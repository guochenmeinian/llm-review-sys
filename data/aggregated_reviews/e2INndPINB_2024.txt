Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the reconstruction flip phenomena in graph autoencoders, which may enhance graph-level anomaly detection. The authors propose a novel graph autoencoder model, MUSE (Multifaceted Summarization of Reconstruction Errors), which represents a graph through multifaceted summaries of its reconstruction errors, achieving notable improvements over existing methods. The paper also provides a theoretical analysis of the reconstruction flip phenomenon and its implications for anomaly detection.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper offers an in-depth examination of reconstruction loss in graph autoencoders, supported by rigorous theoretical analysis.
- The identification of the reconstruction flip phenomenon is novel, providing valuable insights into existing GLAD methods.
- Extensive experiments demonstrate MUSE's effectiveness against several state-of-the-art baselines, and the code is made available for reproducibility.

Weaknesses:  
- The title is considered long and redundant; a revision is recommended.
- The methods for error representation and summarization lack significant innovation, relying on conventional techniques.
- The theoretical analysis does not convincingly link to practical improvements in anomaly detection capabilities.
- Evaluation metrics are limited to AUROC, which may be biased due to the nature of anomaly detection tasks; additional metrics should be included.
- There is a disconnect between the analysis and methodology, and a detailed exploration of primary patterns in datasets is lacking.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the title for conciseness and clarity. Additionally, consider providing a more systematic definition or categorization of primary patterns based on graph theory. It would be beneficial to include a broader range of evaluation metrics beyond AUROC to better assess anomaly detection performance. Furthermore, we suggest integrating the analytical insights from Section 3 more coherently into the methodology in Section 5. Lastly, an analysis of the computational complexity of MUSE compared to other methods would help establish its practical advantages.
