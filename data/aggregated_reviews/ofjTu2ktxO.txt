Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on eliciting comparison data with truthfulness guarantees, focusing on strict Bayesian Nash equilibrium. The authors propose a peer prediction mechanism based on a bonus-penalty framework, demonstrating that it achieves symmetrically strong truthfulness for both comparison and networked data. The mechanism is grounded in a Bayesian strong stochastic transitivity model, which generalizes existing models. Empirical results indicate that truthful reporting yields higher payments compared to random reporting.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem addressed is significant and relevant.
- The theoretical rigor of the study is commendable.
- The proposed approach is sound, and the generalization of Bayesian SST is noteworthy.

Weaknesses:
- The requirement for an admissible condition may necessitate agents to observe and report additional item pairs, which could be impractical.
- The empirical results do not comprehensively cover the applications cited in the abstract and introduction.
- The empirical evaluation lacks clarity, particularly in the construction of graphs and the sophistication of benchmarks used for comparison.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the empirical evaluation procedure, particularly regarding the construction of graphs and the benchmarks used. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion on the limitations of the mechanism and peer prediction in general. It would also be beneficial to explore the implications of assumptions made in the model, such as symmetric deviation and the ability to penalize users. Finally, addressing the potential for more sophisticated forms of strategic behavior in empirical evaluations would enhance the robustness of the findings.
