### Key Points
This paper presents "TensorJSFuzz," a novel method for testing web-based deep learning frameworks, specifically TensorFlow.js. The authors propose leveraging large language models (LLMs) to extract input constraints from source code, facilitating the generation of high-quality test inputs through type-aware and dependency-aware techniques. The experimental results indicate that TensorJSFuzz outperforms existing methods in generating valid inputs and identifying bugs, demonstrating its potential to enhance the robustness of web-based deep learning systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a timely and relevant approach to testing web-based deep learning frameworks, addressing a critical gap in existing methodologies.
2. The integration of LLMs for input constraint extraction is innovative and shows promise in improving test input quality.
3. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of TensorJSFuzz, with a significant number of detected errors, enhancing the understanding of bug detection capabilities.

Weaknesses:
1. The technical details regarding the input-constraint extraction process are insufficiently explained, raising concerns about implementation clarity and potential limitations.
2. The paper does not convincingly argue the importance of its research, lacking compelling evidence or case studies to illustrate the consequences of inadequate testing.
3. The experimental validation lacks rigor, with insufficient ablation studies and a high proportion of duplicate bugs detected, questioning the tool's ability to identify new issues.
4. The paper does not adequately discuss the integration of the proposed framework into existing development processes, limiting its practical applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the input-constraint extraction process by providing more detailed explanations and addressing potential limitations. Additionally, the authors should include concrete examples or case studies that illustrate the risks associated with inadequate testing of web-based deep learning frameworks. To enhance the rigor of the experimental validation, we suggest conducting more ablation studies to quantitatively evaluate the contributions of different methods. Furthermore, the authors should explore testing with other LLM models and consider fine-tuning a model specifically for this fuzzing framework. Lastly, a discussion on how TensorJSFuzz could be integrated into current development workflows would significantly enhance its practical relevance.
