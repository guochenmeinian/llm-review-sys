Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
The authors introduce the HT-step dataset, comprising 116K segment-instruction pairs for video-instruction alignment, specifically in cooking. This dataset is notable for its scale, surpassing existing datasets in the number of videos, segments, and activities. It aims to facilitate research in procedure activity understanding and temporal article grounding by providing detailed temporal annotations aligned with instructional videos.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
1. The dataset's large scale and richness in natural language descriptions provide a valuable resource for the video and language research community.
2. The introduction of a benchmark for temporal article grounding encourages the development of models that can effectively align instructional articles with video segments.
3. The authors leverage wikiHow articles to create a structured taxonomy for step annotations, enhancing the dataset's utility.

**Weaknesses:**
1. The clarity of the annotation process could be improved, with a need for more examples and visual representations.
2. A significant number of partial matches in annotations raises concerns about the accuracy of the alignment between video content and textual descriptions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. The authors are encouraged to enhance the clarity of the annotation process by providing pipeline figures and additional examples.
2. The authors should consider revising the annotations to better match the video content, particularly addressing the high occurrence of partial matches.
3. The authors are recommended to explicitly discuss the differences between their work and prior contributions to contextualize the significance of HT-step within the existing literature.
