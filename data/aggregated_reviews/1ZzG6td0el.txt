### Key Points
This paper presents a study on parametric estimation under communication constraints, focusing on the setup $\theta \to X^n \to Y^n$, where the goal is to estimate $\theta$ from $Y^n$. The main result is Theorem 1, which establishes an information contraction bound. Theorem 2, under additional assumptions of orthogonality and subgaussianity, provides two corollary bounds related to variance, mean, and mutual information. The authors illustrate the tightness of these bounds through examples involving product Bernoulli, sparse Gaussian, and discrete distributions. The work also investigates distributed parameter estimation under local information constraints, deriving lower bounds on sample complexity and presenting matching upper bounds for various estimation problems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- **Originality**: The paper builds on classic parametric estimation frameworks, contributing new findings to minimax theory under communication and privacy constraints.  
- **Quality**: The writing is clear, and the technical aspects are well-explained without glaring issues.  
- **Clarity**: Overall, the paper is well-structured, though some comments below indicate areas for improvement.  
- **Significance**: The interactive parametric estimation problem is relevant and interesting to the community.  
- **Unified Framework**: The work provides a comprehensive framework for deriving minimax lower bounds under local information constraints, complemented by matching upper bounds.

Weaknesses:  
- The structure occasionally references equations that appear later, potentially confusing readers.  
- The distinction in technical contributions between this work and previous references [4] and [16] could be better highlighted, particularly regarding proof techniques and scenarios where the results significantly improve upon [16].  
- The focus on product distributions may limit applicability to more complex structured correlations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper's structure to ensure that references to equations are made in a more logical order to enhance clarity. Additionally, it would be beneficial to explicitly highlight the differences in technical contributions between this work and references [4] and [16], particularly in terms of proof techniques and scenarios where the minimax results can significantly improve upon those in [16]. Furthermore, consider adding a table displaying the lower and upper bounds for the various cases discussed. Addressing the unclear definition of the term $S$ in Equation (2) and correcting the formatting issues noted in line 193 would also enhance the paper's presentation. Lastly, providing examples of non-local/global constraints and clarifying the notation used throughout the paper would aid in accessibility for a broader audience.
