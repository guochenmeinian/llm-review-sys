Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents PUG, a 3D graphics environment utilizing Unreal Engine for rendering synthetic datasets aimed at evaluating computer vision models. The authors propose three datasets: PUG:Animals, PUG:ImageNet, and PUG:Attributes&Relations, which facilitate benchmarking model robustness and generalization. The controllability of rendered images allows for systematic variation of factors such as camera pose and lighting, which is beneficial for model evaluation. The authors argue for the superiority of their dataset in terms of quality and diversity, while also acknowledging that similar results could potentially be demonstrated using other datasets. The paper includes comparisons with Syn-CLIP and discusses the importance of evaluating robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) factors. Significant updates have been made to the paper, including discussions on generative models, clearer explanations of metrics, and improved visual representations of data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a semantically controllable framework for rendering 2D images, enhancing the evaluation of computer vision models in controlled scenarios.
- Synthetic data mitigates privacy, bias, and copyright issues associated with real images.
- The proposed benchmarks effectively illustrate the potential of rendered images for assessing model robustness and fine-tuning.
- The paper effectively highlights the limitations of existing synthetic datasets and proposes a larger, higher-quality alternative.
- The inclusion of Table 5 provides valuable comparisons with other datasets, enhancing the paper's contribution.
- The authors have made significant revisions based on reviewer feedback, improving clarity and detail throughout the manuscript.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a clear characterization of photorealism and does not substantiate claims of superior photorealism compared to existing datasets.
- The rendering parameters appear arbitrary, lacking motivation for the number of images per dataset and variations in scene parameters.
- There is insufficient discussion on object positioning and affordance, which could impact results.
- The paper does not sufficiently address the positioning of objects in images and its potential influence on results.
- Details regarding the computational requirements for rendering images are missing, and the rendering process details are somewhat vague.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the characterization of photorealism by providing comparative assessments with existing datasets. Additionally, the authors should clarify the rationale behind the chosen rendering parameters and ensure consistency across datasets. A discussion on object positioning and affordance is essential to understand their influence on results. Furthermore, we recommend including more direct comparisons that demonstrate PUG's effectiveness in evaluating OOD performance compared to existing datasets. Lastly, clarifying the computational details of the rendering process, including specific resource requirements, would enhance the paper's completeness.
