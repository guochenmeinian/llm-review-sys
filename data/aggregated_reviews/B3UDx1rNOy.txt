Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework called Recurrent Temporal Revision (RTR) to address neighbor subsampling in temporal graphs, which is crucial for applications like social networking and recommender systems. The authors propose a recurrent neural network that integrates all neighbor information through a hidden state, capturing complete neighbor information. They introduce the concept of "temporal revision" to update this hidden state and enhance expressiveness by incorporating heterogeneity. The framework claims superior expressiveness in temporal link prediction and graph isomorphism tests, supported by theoretical proofs and experimental results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors introduce innovative metrics for evaluating expressiveness, establishing connections between their framework and existing models.
- The proposed model effectively retains aggregated information through hidden states and incorporates heterogeneity in the revision process.
- Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in temporal link prediction tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The rationale behind the new definition of expressiveness is not clearly conveyed, leaving gaps in understanding its superiority.
- The introduction lacks an explanation of heterogeneity in temporal revision.
- Some figures and tables, including Figure 1 and Table 1, lack specific descriptions, making them hard to interpret.
- The paper does not analyze time complexity or compare parameter counts, and the motivation for complete neighbor information is questioned.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the rationale behind their definition of expressiveness and its advantages over existing metrics. Additionally, please provide a detailed explanation of heterogeneity in temporal revision in the introduction. Clarifying the descriptions for Figure 1 and Table 1 will enhance understanding. We also suggest including an analysis of time complexity and a comparison of the model's parameter count. Finally, addressing the motivation for complete neighbor information in real-world scenarios would strengthen the paper's argument.
