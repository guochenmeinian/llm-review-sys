### Key Points
This paper presents VQ-Prompt, a prompt-based continual learning method utilizing Vector Quantization (VQ) to enhance task knowledge representation and mitigate catastrophic forgetting. VQ-Prompt integrates VQ into the end-to-end training of discrete prompts, optimizing prompt selection with task loss and achieving effective task knowledge abstraction. The authors demonstrate that VQ-Prompt outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks, particularly in class-incremental settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to understand.
- The introduction of VQ to prompt-based continual learning is intuitive and allows for end-to-end training of prompts.
- Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- The lack of constraints when calculating the similarity score \(\alpha\) and prompt key \(K\) may lead to ineffective prompt learning, resulting in similar prompts for different tasks and rendering many prompts useless.
- There is an absence of an ablation study on the fine-tuned classifier, which is a common technique to enhance classifier performance and should be considered for fair comparisons with other methods.
- The contribution of discrete prompts remains unclear, and the implementation details regarding their usage need clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the constraints on the similarity score \(\alpha\) and prompt key \(K\) to enhance prompt learning effectiveness. Additionally, we suggest conducting an ablation study on the fine-tuned classifier to provide a fair comparison with other methods. Clarifying the implementation of discrete prompts and their distribution would also strengthen the paper, as well as addressing the questions regarding the differences between traditional and proposed prompt-based approaches.
