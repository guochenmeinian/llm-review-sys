Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Vista, a driving world model that predicts future driving videos using a video diffusion model. The authors propose conditioning on prior frames and employing two domain-specific losses to enhance dynamics and structure preservation in driving scenarios. Vista supports controllable generation in a zero-shot manner through LoRA and demonstrates high-resolution video outputs, low FID on nuScenes, and favorable human evaluation scores. Extensive experiments indicate that Vista outperforms state-of-the-art models in prediction fidelity and action evaluation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Vista achieves high fidelity predictions and versatile action controllability, adapting seamlessly to diverse scenarios.
- The methodology systematically addresses limitations in existing driving world models, integrating dynamic prior injection and control mechanisms effectively.
- The paper is well-structured, with clear sections and effective use of figures and tables.

Weaknesses:
- Improvements over existing models like GenAD appear incremental, with GenAD also supporting text commands and achieving comparable qualitative results.
- The proposed conditioning and losses, while helpful, lack novelty.
- Human evaluation was not conducted against driving-specific generation models, raising questions about comparative performance.
- Limitations include the inability to generate surround-view video and insufficient evaluation of the closed-loop process and computational resource demands.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty discussion by providing more insights into how their methods differ from existing work like GenAD. Additionally, conducting human evaluations comparing Vista with GenAD and other driving models would strengthen the findings. Clarifying the implementation details and theoretical basis of the dynamic prior injection mechanism would enhance understanding. Expanding the evaluation to include a broader range of scenarios and performance metrics, as well as supporting surround-view video generation, would significantly improve the model's applicability and robustness in real-world scenarios.
