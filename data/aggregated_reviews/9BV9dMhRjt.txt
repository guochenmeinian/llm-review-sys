### Key Points
This paper presents a study on estimating persistence intensity and density functions derived from persistence diagrams, which are counting measures on an open-half-plane. The authors build on the work of Chazal and Divol (2019), demonstrating that the expected persistence diagram converges under certain conditions and can be estimated using kernel-based methods. They provide theoretical bounds for the bias and variance of these estimators, specifically in the sup-norm, and introduce a persistence density function that normalizes the persistence measure, leading to stronger results without ignoring points near the diagonal.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written, with precise definitions and detailed mathematical proofs, contributing new quantitative results for kernel-based density estimators in the context of persistence diagrams.  
- The introduction of the persistence density function is a novel aspect that could be of interest if adequately motivated.

Weaknesses:  
- The use of the sup-norm is questioned, as it does not account for the diagonal's role in persistence diagrams, making the estimation task harder and resulting in slower convergence rates compared to the optimal transport metric.  
- The motivations for the persistence density function are not fully convincing, particularly regarding its implications for topological information.  
- The paper lacks numerical illustrations in the main body, which could enhance understanding and practical relevance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for using the sup-norm over the optimal transport metric, perhaps by providing practical examples where the sup-norm is more informative. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the motivations for the persistence density function, ensuring that its topological significance is well-articulated. Including numerical illustrations in the main text would help make the paper more accessible and demonstrate the practical applications of the proposed methods. Lastly, addressing the minor comments regarding typos and additional references would strengthen the overall presentation.
