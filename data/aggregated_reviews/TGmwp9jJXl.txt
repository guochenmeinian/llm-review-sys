Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to enhance molecular dynamics simulations by obtaining collective variables (CVs) through biased simulations. The authors propose a method to learn the system's generator, which provides insights into transition timescales and enables the derivation of CVs. The approach leverages biased enhanced sampling simulations to achieve faster convergence and more frequent observation of transitions compared to traditional methods. The authors evaluate their method on toy systems, demonstrating its effectiveness in recovering eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of evolution operators for Langevin dynamics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a novel method for accelerating the identification of scientifically significant collective variables from biased simulations, requiring the development of new theoretical frameworks.
2. It addresses a significant problem in scientific applications, potentially leading to substantial downstream impacts.
3. The introduction and overview of the transfer operator and generator formalism are well articulated.

Weaknesses:
1. The experiments are limited to three toy systems, raising questions about the applicability of the method to more complex systems, such as proteins.
2. The paper lacks comparisons with non-deep learning approaches, which would help contextualize the method's usefulness.
3. The mathematical presentation, particularly in sections 4 and 5, could be clearer, as many notations are introduced without sufficient explanation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental evaluation by applying their method to larger and more complex systems, such as proteins, to better demonstrate its capabilities. Additionally, providing comparisons with classical methods for determining CVs would enhance the understanding of the method's general applicability. Clarifying the mathematical exposition in sections 4 and 5, including an overarching description of the key ideas, would improve readability. Finally, addressing the trade-offs between speed and accuracy in the context of runtime for data collection and training would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the method's performance.
