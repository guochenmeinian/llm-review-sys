Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a systematic empirical evaluation of Predict-and-Optimize (PnO) and Predict-then-Optimize (PtO) methods, introducing a modular framework to benchmark 11 different methods across 8 combinatorial optimization problems, including a new industrial dataset for combinatorial advertising. The results indicate that PnO methods generally outperform PtO methods, although no single method consistently excels across all scenarios. The authors provide a categorization of existing methods and conduct extensive experiments to analyze their performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a broad empirical evaluation of 11 PtO/PnO methods, providing a valuable benchmark for researchers and practitioners.
- The inclusion of a new industrial dataset for combinatorial advertising enhances the practical relevance of the study.
- The categorization of methods into discrete, continuous, statistical, and surrogate categories aids in understanding the landscape of PnO/PtO approaches.

Weaknesses:
- The assumption that constraint coefficients are known limits the applicability of findings to real-world problems with uncertain parameters.
- The paper lacks detailed empirical evaluations of surrogate methods on non-linear and non-convex problems, limiting the analysis of their effectiveness.
- The reliance on synthetic datasets restricts the generalizability of findings, as real-world data often contains complexities not captured in synthetic datasets.
- Scalability to high-dimensional datasets is not thoroughly tested or discussed, which is critical for applications in fields like finance and healthcare.
- Insufficient analysis of failure cases for PnO methods hinders understanding of their limitations and potential improvements.
- The paper acknowledges challenges in deploying PnO methods in industrial settings but does not propose concrete solutions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the applicability of their findings by addressing the assumption of known constraint coefficients, potentially incorporating uncertainty into their models. Additionally, we suggest providing detailed empirical evaluations of surrogate methods on non-linear and non-convex problems to better analyze their effectiveness. Expanding the variety of datasets to include more real-world scenarios would enhance the generalizability of the results. Furthermore, we advise testing the scalability of the methods on high-dimensional datasets and providing benchmarks to demonstrate their efficiency. A more thorough analysis of failure cases for PnO methods would also be beneficial. Lastly, we encourage the authors to delve deeper into the practical challenges of deploying PnO methods in industry and propose concrete solutions to facilitate their adoption.
