### Key Points
This paper presents T-Projection, a method for annotation projection aimed at enhancing sequence labeling tasks in low-resource languages by leveraging labeled data from high-resource languages. The authors propose a two-step approach: candidate generation via beam search using a fine-tuned mT5 model, followed by candidate selection based on translation probability. The method demonstrates superior performance over traditional word alignment-based techniques in both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations across multiple languages.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is intuitive, with a well-designed symmetrized translation probability.
- The experimental setup is robust, featuring strong baselines and standard models.
- The results convincingly support the authors' claims, showcasing significant performance improvements in various tasks.
- The paper is well-structured, clearly articulating the limitations of prior methods and how T-Projection addresses them.

Weaknesses:
- The core idea may lack novelty, as it relies on established machine translation techniques.
- Limited ablation studies fail to provide deeper insights into the method's effectiveness.
- The reliance on large pretrained models raises questions about the necessity of the proposed techniques in light of simpler alternatives.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the originality of their approach by focusing specifically on Named Entity recognition, given the complexities involved in name translations. Additionally, conducting more extensive ablation studies could elucidate the underlying reasons for the method's success. To address concerns about the method's reliance on the mT5 model, we suggest exploring the use of other models, such as GPT-3.5 or GPT-4, under few/zero-shot settings to validate the necessity of T-Projection. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of name translation processes would enhance the understanding of the method's performance across different languages.
