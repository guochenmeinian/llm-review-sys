Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents "BACKTIME," a novel method for conducting backdoor attacks on multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting models. BACKTIME allows attackers to subtly manipulate predictions by injecting stealthy triggers into MTS data through a bi-level optimization process utilizing a graph neural network (GNN)-based trigger generator. The method identifies vulnerable timestamps and crafts effective triggers. Comprehensive experiments across various datasets and state-of-the-art forecasting models demonstrate the efficacy, flexibility, and stealth of BACKTIME attacks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- BACKTIME offers a fresh perspective on backdoor attacks in MTS forecasting, showcasing the feasibility and impact of such attacks.
- The experimental setup is comprehensive, involving multiple datasets and state-of-the-art forecasting models, highlighting the method's versatility.
- Clear explanations of the bi-level optimization process and the GNN-based trigger generator facilitate understanding of the attack mechanism.
- The research underscores the need for robustness in MTS forecasting models, especially in high-stakes scenarios.

Weaknesses:
- The paper inadequately addresses potential limitations and the robustness of BACKTIME against countermeasures, necessitating a more detailed analysis of these aspects.
- The societal impacts of such attacks are not sufficiently explored, particularly given the sensitive nature of MTS forecasting in critical areas like climate and finance.
- The Trigger Generation and Bi-level Optimization processes are not clearly presented, requiring an extended description for better understanding.
- The experiments need expansion, and the advantages of the proposed method are not well validated against more baselines.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the potential limitations of BACKTIME, particularly regarding its generalizability to other types of time series data or forecasting models. Additionally, a deeper exploration of the societal impacts of backdoor attacks is necessary. We suggest extending the descriptions of the Trigger Generation and Bi-level Optimization processes for clarity. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to expand the experimental validation and compare their method against more baseline studies on backdoor attacks for forecasting models. Lastly, consider discussing potential defenses against the proposed attack to enhance the paper's contributions.
