Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel offline reinforcement learning (RL) method called MISA, which optimizes the lower bound of mutual information between states and actions to guide policy improvement. The authors unify existing methods like TD3+BC and CQL under the MISA framework, employing MCMC techniques for unbiased gradient estimation. Empirical results demonstrate MISA's superior performance across various datasets from the D4RL benchmark.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The derivation of the MISA lower bounds is clear and well-structured.
- Practical implementation details and hyperparameter choices are thoroughly discussed.
- The connection to prior methods in offline RL is informative and well-articulated.

Weaknesses:
- The rationale for why MISA is superior to previous methods is vague and lacks clarity. Some statements, such as "directly fitting the policy on the dataset is short-sighted," are subjective and poorly defined.
- Experimental results lack error bars in Tables 1 and 2, making it difficult to assess the significance of improvements.
- The novelty of MISA is diminished by its close relation to established methods in mutual information estimation, such as $f$-divergence and the DV representation of KL.
- The organization of the paper could be improved to ensure that the algorithm box for the main algorithm (Algo. 1) is included in the main text.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the discussion surrounding the advantages of MISA over prior approaches, particularly in the section titled "Intuitive Explanation on the Mutual Information Regularizer." Specific examples should be provided to clarify vague statements. Additionally, including error bars in the experimental results would enhance the assessment of significance. We suggest reorganizing the paper to ensure that the algorithm box for MISA appears prominently in the main text. Lastly, a clearer definition of "data manifold" should be provided, as it is crucial to the paper's contributions.
