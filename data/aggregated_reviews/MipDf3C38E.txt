### Key Points
This paper presents ITMPRec, an intention-based targeted multi-round proactive recommendation method designed to enhance user engagement by guiding preferences towards specific target items. The approach integrates pre-matching, intention-induced scoring, and targeted individual arousal coefficients (TIAC) while utilizing an LLM-based click simulation agent. Experimental results demonstrate ITMPRec's effectiveness in improving user preferences under simulated conditions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. ITMPRec shows significant improvements in IoI and IoR metrics.
2. The methodology is innovative, incorporating user intentions and LLM-driven simulations for capturing user feedback.
3. The paper is well-structured, with comprehensive experimental validation and clear descriptions of the framework.

Weaknesses:
1. The practical significance of the simulation-based evaluation is questionable, particularly regarding the LLM-based click agent's effectiveness.
2. Evaluation is conducted on relatively small datasets, lacking larger datasets like ML-1M or Amazon subsets for stronger validation.
3. The backend model, GraphAU, is not compared as a baseline, and there are several unclear expressions and typos throughout the paper.
4. The methodology relies on basic techniques that may limit the modeling of nuanced user interactions, and the model underperforms on HR@5 and HR@10 metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by addressing vague expressions and providing clearer explanations for key concepts, such as the selection of $L_{N_{can}}$ and the constraint conditions in formulas. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with existing LLM-driven recommendation models to contextualize ITMPRec's performance. Expanding the evaluation to include larger datasets would enhance the credibility of the findings. Finally, addressing the computational complexity and ensuring user experience in real-time applications should be prioritized.
