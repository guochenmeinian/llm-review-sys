Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to jailbreak large language models (LLMs) using an enhanced few-shot jailbreaking technique. The authors propose a method that employs a random search to select the most effective examples from a pre-defined pool generated with Mistral-7B, incorporating special tokens to optimize the interaction between user messages and model responses. The authors demonstrate that their method outperforms previous jailbreaking techniques across five different models and can adapt to evade various defenses.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is simple, effective, and easy to implement, showing superior performance compared to many baselines.
- Insightful ablation studies reveal the significance of various components, such as the number of shots and the role of special tokens.
- The method effectively evades a wide range of defenses, suggesting potential robustness against keyword-based defenses.

Weaknesses:
- The authors do not compare their method to key few/many-shot baselines, particularly the works of Wei et al. and Anil et al., which limits the evaluation's comprehensiveness.
- The paper lacks reporting on the total number of queries required for the random search, hindering comparisons with other methods.
- Some ablations are missing, particularly regarding the quality and length of examples and the impact of using incorrect special tokens.
- The evaluation relies on a limited dataset, which may introduce bias and overfitting concerns.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison by including results against the methods of Wei et al. and Anil et al. to substantiate their claims. Additionally, it would be beneficial to report the total number of queries needed for the random search to facilitate better comparisons. We suggest conducting further ablation studies to assess the impact of example quality and the effects of using incorrect special tokens. Lastly, consider using a more diverse dataset for evaluation to mitigate potential biases in the results.
