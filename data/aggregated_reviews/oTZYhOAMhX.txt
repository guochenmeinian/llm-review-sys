Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an unsupervised approach to the group recommendation task, proposing a model named ITR (Identify Then Recommend) that automatically infers user-group distributions. The authors develop a heuristic-based merge-and-split method for group identification and introduce two self-supervised pre-training objectives: group-level pseudo group recommendation and user-group alignment via pull-and-repulsion mechanisms. Additionally, the paper introduces a group identification module (GIM) that operates in a pure unsupervised setting to discover user groups based on embeddings, achieving an average Silhouette Coefficient (SC) of 0.879 across four datasets. The authors conduct complexity analyses of their proposed ITR method, demonstrating that its time and space complexities are linear with respect to the number of users, ensuring efficiency. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across various benchmarks and industrial applications, although concerns remain regarding the robustness of results due to limited experimental datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a novel task setting, effectively addressing the dynamic nature of user groups without requiring pre-defined group numbers.
2. The GIM effectively identifies user groups, as evidenced by high SC values and case studies on industrial data.
3. Technical details are well-founded, and the writing is clear and accessible.
4. Complexity analyses indicate that the proposed ITR method is efficient, with manageable time and space complexities.
5. The extensive experimental validation demonstrates significant improvements in both user and group recommendation tasks.

Weaknesses:
1. There is a presentation error in Line 147 regarding matrix dimensions.
2. The methodology lacks clarity, particularly concerning the complexity and convergence of the proposed algorithm, and how the ITR model makes inferences during testing.
3. The experiments section requires further elaboration, especially regarding the ablation study, the effectiveness of GIM, and the details of A/B testing metrics.
4. The authors' claims about unsupervised learning contributions do not align closely with experimental results, and comparisons with existing methods that handle ad-hoc groups are missing.
5. The reliance on limited datasets like Mafengwo and CAMRa2011 raises concerns about the generalizability and robustness of the results.
6. There is a lack of detailed information regarding the industrial datasets, including setup and deployment specifics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology section by providing detailed explanations of the complexity and convergence of the proposed algorithm. Additionally, the authors should clarify how the ITR model generates embeddings during testing and the strategy for recommendations based on these embeddings. We suggest including more details in the experiments section, particularly regarding the "base" variant in the ablation study and the effectiveness of GIM through qualitative or quantitative evaluations. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to conduct supplementary experiments on larger datasets such as Yelp and Weeplaces to strengthen the findings and address concerns regarding the limited datasets used for validation. Lastly, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the correspondence between detected and ground-truth groups, particularly in terms of evaluation metrics, and provide more comprehensive details on the industrial datasets, including setup and deployment processes, to allow for better assessment of the internal components of their framework.
