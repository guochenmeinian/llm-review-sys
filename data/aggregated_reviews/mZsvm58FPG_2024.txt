Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ECMamba, a novel framework that integrates Retinex theory with the Mamba architecture to tackle exposure correction. The authors develop a dual-branch framework to restore reflectance and illumination maps, employing a Retinex estimator and a core operator called Retinex-SS2D, which utilizes a two-dimensional scanning strategy and deformable feature aggregation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ECMamba outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is the first to apply Retinex theory to exposure correction, expanding its application beyond low-light enhancement.
2. The organization and clarity of the paper are commendable, effectively communicating complex concepts.

Weaknesses:
1. The rationale for using Retinex theory and the Mamba framework in multi-exposure correction is insufficiently justified.
2. The initial images in Figure 4 do not accurately represent over-exposed scenarios, lacking saturation and clear details.
3. The inference speed of the proposed method is not addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for employing Retinex theory and the Mamba framework in this context, providing a more robust rationale for their relevance. Additionally, we suggest replacing the initial images in Figure 4 with more representative examples of over-exposure. Lastly, the authors should address the inference speed of the proposed method to provide a complete evaluation of its performance.
