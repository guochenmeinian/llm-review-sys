Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for verifying neural control barrier functions (NCBFs) with ReLU activations, addressing the challenge posed by their non-differentiability. The authors derive necessary and sufficient conditions for a ReLU NCBF to ensure positive invariance, extending Nagumoâ€™s theorem. The proposed verification algorithm combines linear relaxation for coarse analysis and interval bound propagation for fine-tuning, ultimately utilizing nonlinear programs for condition checks. Experimental results demonstrate that the method outperforms existing SMT-based approaches across various benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces novel theoretical conditions and a verification algorithm that effectively addresses the non-differentiability of NCBFs, which is a significant contribution to the field.
- The proposed method shows improved runtime efficiency compared to SMT methods, as evidenced by experimental results.

Weaknesses:
- The scalability of the verification method is a concern, particularly as the complexity of the neural network increases, leading to potential combinatorial explosion in runtime.
- The presentation of the paper requires improvement, with several minor errors and unclear definitions that hinder reader comprehension.
- The experimental evaluation is limited, lacking comparisons with classical NCBFs using differentiable activations, which would provide a more comprehensive analysis of the proposed method's advantages.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of mathematical descriptions by clearly defining the dimensionality of all vector and matrix variables introduced in the paper. Additionally, the authors should provide definitions of non-trivial variables in the main statements of mathematical results rather than relegating them to the appendix. To enhance the contribution, we suggest including experiments that compare the performance of ReLU NCBFs against standard approaches, such as those parameterized as SoS polynomials. Furthermore, a thorough analysis of the time complexity of the proposed verification strategy should be included, particularly regarding its scalability in high-dimensional problems.
