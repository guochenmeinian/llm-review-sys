### Key Points
This paper presents a framework, RAST, aimed at enhancing the diversity of question generation by utilizing retrieved templates to guide the syntactic structure of generated questions. The authors propose an end-to-end training approach using reinforcement learning (RL), where the reward function balances consistency and diversity. Experimental results indicate that RAST outperforms previous models in terms of diversity while maintaining comparable consistency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel framework that effectively improves question diversity through carefully designed RL rewards.
- It reports state-of-the-art results and is generally well-written, providing sufficient detail for understanding the framework.

Weaknesses:
- The method primarily increases syntactical diversity without ensuring that questions are grounded in multiple aspects of the context, a limitation not addressed in the paper.
- Human evaluation is limited, comparing the proposed method to only one baseline on a single dataset, which does not provide comprehensive insights into its performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of how their method enhances content/type diversity beyond syntactic variability. Additionally, it would be beneficial to provide more details about the human evaluation process, including the number of annotators per sample and the inter-annotator agreement. The authors should also engage more thoroughly with existing paraphrasing approaches and prior work on template retrieval and editing. Furthermore, clarifying the reference-based evaluation metrics and including standard metrics such as BLEU, Self-BLEU, and iBLEU would strengthen the evaluation. Lastly, addressing minor typos and unclear sections in the writing would enhance clarity and precision.
