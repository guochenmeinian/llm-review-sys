**Key Points:**

The paper explores the optimization of Visual Question Answering (VQA) models for autonomous driving by examining the differences in attention patterns between humans and VQA models. It introduces a filter that enhances the model's focus on relevant objects, thereby improving response accuracy. The study utilizes the LXMERT model and the NuImages dataset to compare attention patterns and demonstrates that the feature encoder filter refines attention mechanisms, leading to better performance.

**Strengths and Weaknesses:**

We recognize that the investigation into the differing attention mechanisms of VQA models and humans is crucial for improving alignment in various downstream tasks, particularly in autonomous driving. The methodology of the proposed LXMERT approach is clearly articulated, facilitating reproducibility. However, we note that the sample size of ten surveyed individuals with a minimum of five years of driving experience is insufficient and may introduce bias. Additionally, the proposed filter in Algorithm 1 appears non-generalizable to long-tail cases, as it functions merely as a hard filter for specific classes. Table 1 indicates multiple failure cases even after the filter's implementation, and the framework depicted in Figure 3 seems incompatible with more recent VLMs like GPT-4V or Gemini.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

We suggest increasing the sample size of surveyed individuals to mitigate bias. Additionally, we recommend enhancing the generalizability of the proposed filter to accommodate long-tail cases. Addressing the failure cases highlighted in Table 1 and ensuring compatibility with contemporary VLMs would also strengthen the framework presented in the paper.
