Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents MEDSAT, a comprehensive dataset that integrates medical prescriptions, environmental indicators, and sociodemographic factors for studying public health in England. Covering all Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) for 2019 and 2020, it includes data on prescriptions for seven medical conditions, various environmental features, and extensive sociodemographic attributes. The authors demonstrate potential applications such as predicting prescriptions and revealing health disparities using machine learning models. Additionally, the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between environmental factors and population health using satellite imagery from Sentinel-2. The authors propose a methodology that integrates sociodemographic and environmental data, employing machine learning models such as LightGBM and spatial econometrics models like the Spatial Lag Model (SLM) to account for spatial autocorrelation. The revised manuscript includes enhanced documentation for data access, improved clarity in the presentation of results, and a detailed exploration of the associations between air quality and health outcomes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel dataset that is a significant contribution to public health research, with implications for machine learning applications.
- It effectively demonstrates potential applications of the dataset, including health disparity analysis and prescription prediction.
- The integration of satellite imagery with health data demonstrates innovative use of technology to explore environmental impacts on health.
- The implementation of spatial econometric models and spatial cross-validation enhances the robustness of the analysis.
- The authors have improved data accessibility and reproducibility by providing clear instructions and making datasets available on TUMMedia.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset description lacks detailed processing information and does not address gender, age, or ethnicity distributions.
- Baseline models are underdeveloped, and the importance of social features requires further experimentation.
- The analysis does not adequately justify the integration of imagery data with health variables, and the statistical methods used may not be appropriate for spatial data.
- The manuscript has grown in length, exceeding the 9-page limit, which may hinder readability.
- Some figures, such as Figure 5, lack clarity and would benefit from additional legends or annotations.
- The classification of opioids and the linkage of drugs to conditions require further clarification to avoid misinterpretation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset description by providing more details on data processing and including distributions of gender, age, and ethnicity. Additionally, the authors should enhance the baseline models by incorporating recent methodologies and conducting more experiments to assess the role of social features. We suggest implementing block-buffered cross-validation to address spatial autocorrelation issues and providing partial dependence plots to illustrate feature relationships. Furthermore, clarity in the documentation regarding data accessibility and the nature of the satellite imagery should be improved, ensuring that users can easily access and utilize the dataset. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Figure 5 by including a legend that defines the bands and color meanings directly within the figure. Additionally, we suggest that the authors work on shortening the manuscript to meet the 9-page limit by moving detailed discussions to the appendix. Finally, we encourage the authors to refine the descriptions of drug classifications and their associations with medical conditions to enhance understanding and avoid potential confusion.
