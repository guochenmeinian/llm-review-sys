Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a balanced multimodal learning method, Classifier-Guided Gradient Modulation (CGGM), which addresses the modality imbalance problem by considering both the magnitude and direction of gradients. The authors propose that their method can be applied across various tasks and optimizers without limitations on the number of modalities. Experiments demonstrate the method's efficiency on multiple datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The exploration of the modality imbalance problem is interesting, and the method is well-written and easy to follow.  
- The experiments include multiple datasets and tasks, showcasing the proposed method's effectiveness in balancing contributions from all modalities.

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty of considering gradient direction is questioned, as prior work has addressed modality dominance due to gradient conflicts. A detailed comparison with existing methods is necessary.  
- The motivation for the method is not clearly articulated, particularly regarding how gradient direction influences modality updates.  
- The experiments lack comparisons with recent state-of-the-art methods, and the authors should visualize gradient direction and accuracy curves to substantiate their claims.  
- Some notations are confusing, and there are concerns regarding the computational complexity of the proposed classifier and its applicability across different tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind their method, particularly in explaining the influence of gradient direction on modality updates. Additionally, it is crucial to include comparisons with recent state-of-the-art methods such as UMT, QMF, and ReconBoost to validate the proposed approach. We suggest visualizing changes in indicators before and after modulation, including the performance change process for each modality, to enhance the experimental analysis. Furthermore, clarifying the computational complexity of the additional classifier and its structure across different tasks would strengthen the paper. Lastly, addressing the concerns regarding notation and the accuracy of modality-specific improvement measurements is essential for clarity.
