### Key Points
This paper presents a survey of transferability estimation methods to determine the optimal pre-trained language model for specific downstream tasks. It compares 14 methods and evaluates them using six pre-trained language models, contributing a model selection approach that could guide future research. The authors conduct both qualitative and quantitative analyses, providing insights into the relative advantages and disadvantages of various methods, particularly through tables and graphs that summarize experimental results on the GLUE benchmark.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper fills a gap in the research area by providing an extensive evaluation of transferability estimation methods.
- It is well-researched and organized into digestible sections, following a clear methodology.
- The ablation study and feature dimension reduction are particularly noteworthy.
- Tables 1 and 3 offer compact comparisons and highlight the performance of different methods.

Weaknesses:
- The writing lacks clarity and fluency, making it difficult for readers to follow.
- The selection of models is limited, primarily focusing on BERT and RoBERTa, which may not generalize to other architectures like auto-regressive or encoder-decoder models.
- The novelty of the paper is questioned, as it primarily compares existing methods without proposing new ones.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and fluency of the writing by seeking assistance from a fluent English speaker experienced in academic writing. Additionally, including examples in the problem formalization would enhance reader engagement. The authors should consider expanding the model selection to include a more diverse range of pre-trained language models, such as T5 or LLMs, to better assess generalizability. Finally, the conclusion should be revised to clearly summarize how to efficiently select a valid PLM for a target task based on the analysis presented.
