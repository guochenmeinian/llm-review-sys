Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive approach to solving Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) and Marginal MAP (MMAP) queries in Logical Credal Networks (LCNs) and introduces a novel approach to incorporating these tasks within Labeled Causal Networks (LCNs). The authors define maximin/maximax MAP and MMAP tasks and propose several search algorithms, including ALDS and ASA, that integrate depth-first search, limited-discrepancy search, and simulated annealing with exact evaluations of MAP assignments. They also introduce an approximate message-passing scheme to enhance efficiency. The experimental results indicate that their approximation methods can scale to larger problems compared to traditional search methods. The paper includes Python implementations and discusses the time and space complexity of the algorithms, although further elaboration on these complexities is recommended for clarity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research provides a detailed formalization of abductive reasoning in LCNs, addressing a significant gap in prior work.
- The introduction of MAP and MMAP to LCNs is a valuable contribution, with solid improvements in the scalability of MAP/MMAP queries.
- The proposed approximate algorithms significantly improve solving time and scalability compared to previous methods.
- The authors provide practical implementations and complexity analyses in the supplementary material.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental setup is simplistic, relying on basic toy examples rather than practical industrial applications.
- Limited comparison with existing algorithms makes it difficult to assess the superiority of the proposed methods.
- There is a lack of comparison with existing methods, such as ProbLog and MLN, making it challenging to evaluate the proposed algorithms' relative performance.
- The theoretical guarantees on the approximation quality of the algorithms are unclear, which weakens the paper's significance.
- The exposition and motivation could be improved, particularly regarding the significance of LCNs and the NP-Hardness of MAP/MMAP problems.
- The manuscript may be challenging for audiences unfamiliar with LCN and MMAP concepts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental setup by including more practical industrial examples and comparisons with existing methods, such as ProbLog and MLN. Additionally, it would be beneficial to clarify the differences in solving time among the various approximate algorithms and to provide more detailed explanations and examples in Section 2.1. We suggest emphasizing the NP-Hardness of MAP/MMAP to better motivate the need for their proposed techniques. Furthermore, including a clear analysis of the time and space complexity of the algorithms would enhance the paper's rigor. We also recommend improving the accessibility of the manuscript for readers not well-versed in LCN and MMAP by including toy examples of MAP and MMAP in contexts like medical diagnosis or fault detection. It would be beneficial to include baselines comparing the performance of the proposed algorithms with existing studies to substantiate their effectiveness. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the specific advantages of ALDS and ASA over AMAP and to elaborate on the conditions under which these algorithms outperform each other.
