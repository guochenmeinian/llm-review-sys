Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel online training framework for multi-view dynamic scenes, introducing the Hierarchical Coherent Motion (HiCoM) framework for effective online learning. The authors propose adding noise to initialize a better 3D Gaussian, addressing potential overfitting in forward-facing multiview setups. The method effectively models motion through a sparse structure, demonstrating improved results over previous methods like 3DGStream. The authors have conducted additional experiments that validate their method's performance, particularly showing superior results over the state-of-the-art Dynamic3DGS on the PanopticSports dataset. They emphasize their commitment to releasing clean, maintainable, and extensible code upon acceptance, aiming to facilitate fair comparisons across different methods. The framework's simplicity and the perturbation smoothing strategy contribute to its effectiveness in dynamic scene reconstruction, and the authors plan to include all results and discussions in the paper or appendix to benefit the research community.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The addition of noise to 3D Gaussians enhances performance in forward-facing multiview setups.
2. The hierarchical motion framework effectively models motion in multiview setups.
3. The global data structure for managing deformation proves to save memory.
4. The authors have conducted additional experiments that validate their method's performance.
5. The commitment to open-sourcing the code enhances the potential for community engagement and comparison.
6. Acknowledgment of the importance of comprehensive results and discussions.

Weaknesses:
1. The potential of hierarchical coherent motion to model large motions necessitates experiments on the PanopticSports dataset.
2. Clarification and comparison with Particle-NeRF are needed.
3. More ablation study figures and visualizations are recommended to support the findings, including a video for better 3D vision representation.
4. The introduction is overly lengthy; a more concise presentation is advised.
5. There is a need for consistent scoring across different scenes, as highlighted by the request for average scores.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction by condensing it to 3-4 paragraphs (approximately 70 lines). Additionally, including experiments on the PanopticSports dataset would strengthen the paper. The authors should clarify the differences between their method and Particle-NeRF and provide more comparative figures from ablation studies. We also suggest submitting a video to enhance visualization, which is crucial in 3D vision. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to ensure consistent comparisons by providing an average score across all three scenes or by having the HiCoM authors report a comparison for the "discussion" scene only. Lastly, we recommend incorporating all results and discussions into the paper or appendix as promised.
