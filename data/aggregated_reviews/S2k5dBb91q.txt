Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for bandits to leverage data from various environments by exploiting causal relationships among them. It defines a probability distribution over unknown quantities in a target structural causal model (SCM) and uses this distribution to warm-start a Thompson sampling algorithm, demonstrating sub-linear regret bounds that depend on the relevance of related environments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The use of domain discrepancy and selection diagrams to formally address different environments.
2. The proposed tTS effectively utilizes priors and recently tried arms to inform posteriors.
3. The paper offers interesting theoretical contributions, proving a sub-linear regret bound that reflects the informativeness of related environments.
4. Compelling experimental results and clear presentation.

Weaknesses:
1. The reliance on detailed information from related environments, such as SCMs and selection diagrams, may be unrealistic.
2. The notation-heavy presentation could be challenging for readers unfamiliar with the terminology.
3. Experiments are conducted on toy data, raising questions about practical applicability on real data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their notation to accommodate readers less familiar with the terminology. Additionally, consider addressing the realism of requiring detailed information from related environments by exploring looser restrictions on prior data than the equality constraints in Eq 2. It would also be beneficial to include comments on the practical applicability of the method using real data, as well as contextualizing their work within the broader literature on generalizability and transportability.
