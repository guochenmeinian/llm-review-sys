Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies the impact of feature heterophily on link prediction tasks using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). It introduces the concept of non-homophilic link prediction based on pairwise feature similarity of connected and non-connected node pairs. The authors demonstrate that the choice of encoders (GCN vs SAGE) and decoders (linear vs MLP) affects link prediction performance on non-homophilic graphs. Various experiments on synthetic and real graph benchmarks reveal that feature heterophily significantly influences GNN performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The writing is clear and accessible.
2. The research problem of feature heterophily is novel and valuable.
3. The theoretical analysis is comprehensive and intuitive.
4. The experiments, particularly the comparisons of encoders and decoders, effectively support the claims made.

Weaknesses:
1. The significance of the study is limited due to the scarcity of real-world graphs exhibiting strong heterophilic properties, making the problem appear artificial.
2. There is insufficient discussion on the relationship between synthetic graph generation and other random graph generation methods.
3. Sections 3 and 4.1 lack clear connections to GNNs, and Theorems 1 and 2 do not extend beyond classical machine learning concepts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the practical significance of their study by including more real-world graphs with strong heterophilic properties. Additionally, discussions on how synthetic graph generation relates to other methods would strengthen the research's validity. The authors should also clarify the connections between their theoretical results and GNNs, ensuring that all sections align with the core focus of the paper. Finally, exploring the implications of feature heterophily in k-hop neighbors and expanding the study's scope beyond GNNs could enhance its impact.
