Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to non-stationary time series forecasting using the Koopman operator, introducing Koopa Blocks that utilize Fourier transforms to separate time-variant and time-invariant components. The method is evaluated across six real-world benchmark datasets, demonstrating competitive performance against existing models. The authors propose a hierarchical structure that learns dynamics through stackable Koopa Blocks, enhancing the model's ability to forecast in long-term scenarios. Additionally, the authors clarify how their proposed architecture reduces the approximation error of non-linear dynamics and analyze the hyperparameter sensitivity of \(D\), while also adding comparisons with deep architecture designs to highlight performance gains from better approximated non-linear dynamics using Koopman theory.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a clear structure and effective visual representations.
2. It innovatively integrates Fourier transforms with Koopman theory, setting a precedent for future research in deep Koopman methods.
3. The model exhibits memory and time efficiency, achieving accurate long-term forecasts.
4. The experiments are comprehensive, showing competitive performance against recent baselines.
5. The authors effectively addressed reviewer concerns, clarified connections to Koopman theory, and demonstrated performance improvements from their architecture.

Weaknesses:
1. The performance improvement in univariate and multivariate forecasting is incremental and not significant in many cases.
2. The paper lacks a thorough analysis of the eigenvalues of the Koopman operator, raising questions about the model's stability and behavior during long-term predictions.
3. The technical novelty is limited, as the method builds on existing techniques for local and global representation extraction without substantial innovation.
4. Some aspects of the weaknesses mentioned by reviewers still require further elaboration.
5. The experiments could benefit from a more focused design, including ablation studies and analysis of time and memory costs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the eigenvalues of the Koopman operator to clarify the model's stability during long-term predictions. Additionally, we suggest elaborating on the novelty of the proposed method, particularly how it differentiates from existing techniques in the literature. The authors should also consider refining Section 1 to better articulate how Koopman theory addresses non-stationary problems and include a discussion on related work in non-stationary time series forecasting. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the local and global model design and to explore the impact of the number of Koopa Blocks on performance. Finally, we recommend that the authors provide a more thorough elaboration on the weaknesses discussed, ensuring that all concerns are thoroughly addressed.
