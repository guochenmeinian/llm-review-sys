### Key Points
This paper presents a method to enhance the performance of modern Hopfield networks (MHN) by employing variational autoencoders (VAE) to improve the separability of memories. The authors demonstrate that memory recall is enhanced when images are encoded by the VAE and explore the use of different VAEs for processing various data modalities. The framework is tested for cross-stimuli query retrieval, successfully retrieving associated images and text queries. Additionally, the study introduces "encoded neural representations" inspired by pre-memory encoding in the dentate gyrus, which further improves input pattern separability before training on MHN.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The integration of encoded neural representations into MHNs is a novel and significant contribution that addresses critical challenges like meta-stable states and pattern separability.  
- The experiments are well-structured, utilizing realistic datasets (MS-COCO) and demonstrating enhanced recall and storage capacity.  
- The framework's hetero-associative capabilities allow for effective cross-modal retrieval, broadening its practical applications.  

Weaknesses:  
- Some mathematical formulations may be challenging for readers lacking a strong mathematical background, potentially hindering comprehension.  
- The paper lacks a detailed scalability analysis regarding computational complexity and real-time applicability.  
- Limited ablation studies do not fully elucidate the impact of various components of the Hopfield Encoding Networks (HEN) on performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of mathematical formulations to enhance accessibility for a broader audience. Additionally, a more in-depth discussion on scalability concerning computational complexity and real-time applicability would be beneficial. We suggest conducting a more detailed ablation study to illustrate the specific impacts of different encoder-decoder pairs on retrieval performance. Finally, while the current focus is on cross-modal associations, we encourage the authors to explore the potential for HEN to learn other types of associations, such as temporal or dynamic memory tasks.
