### Key Points
This paper presents a CLIP-based model for paired multi-omics data integration. The authors demonstrate the superiority of their method through comparisons of batch-related metrics and biological conservation metrics. However, there are concerns regarding dataset selection, the novelty of the approach, and the clarity of certain methodologies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The results are promising and indicate potential for the proposed method in multi-omics data integration.  
- The methodology is innovative, leveraging a CLIP-based approach.

Weaknesses:  
- The dataset selection lacks clarity, particularly regarding the availability of atlas-level multi-omics data.  
- The novelty of the approach is questioned due to similarities with prior work.  
- Several technical aspects, such as data patching and the classification token, are insufficiently explained.  
- The justification for specific methodological choices, such as the selection of cells and data splitting, is unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on dataset selection by referencing the HUBMAP project and considering a data ablation process. Additionally, the authors should provide a detailed comparison of their method with CVQVAE and scMoGNN to clarify performance differences. It is essential to highlight the unique contributions of the current approach compared to similar methods used in prior competitions. We suggest clarifying the scalability claims made in the paper, particularly regarding deep learning techniques. The methodology for data patching should be elaborated to address the arbitrary nature of gene order. A clearer explanation of the role of the "extra classification token" and the motivation behind the translation matching linear mapping is necessary. Justifying the selection of only 30 cells and the random data splitting method would enhance the robustness of the evaluation. Finally, providing additional evidence to support the applicability of the method to real-world data is crucial.
