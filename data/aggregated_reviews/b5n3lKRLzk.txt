Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a large-scale dataset for hand pose estimation using surface electromyography (sEMG), collected from 193 users over 370 hours with 29 diverse gestures. The authors propose two benchmark tasks—pose regression and pose tracking—evaluating generalization capabilities across various scenarios. The dataset, emg2pose, is noted for its potential to enhance sEMG-based human-computer interactions and spur innovation in the field.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is extensive, thoughtfully gathered, and publicly available, addressing a critical need in sEMG research.
- The paper provides competitive baselines and detailed analyses of model performance across different fingers, joints, and stages.
- The introduction of rigorous evaluation metrics reflects good design decisions, enhancing the dataset's value for future research.

Weaknesses:
- Some writing, particularly in the experimental sections, lacks clarity and coherence, making it difficult to follow.
- The paper does not sufficiently compare its methods with existing sEMG-based systems or explore advanced architectures like transformers.
- The joint angle and variance exhibit large errors, indicating room for improvement in accuracy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental writeup, particularly in sections 270-292, and integrate figure references more smoothly into the text. Additionally, we suggest providing a broader comparison with existing sEMG datasets and exploring more advanced architectures. Addressing the large errors in joint angle and variance should be prioritized, and further discussions on the data processing methods, including pre/post-processing techniques, would enhance understanding. Finally, consider including more challenging scenarios involving hand-hand and hand-object interactions to validate the dataset's applicability in real-world contexts.
