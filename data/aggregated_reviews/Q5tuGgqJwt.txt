Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel metric called “restoration gap” to evaluate the reliability of plans generated by diffusion-based planners. The authors propose using this metric along with “restoration guidance” to enhance the generation of more reliable plans. They also introduce an attribution map regularizer to improve the performance of restoration guidance. Additionally, the paper addresses the identification of infeasible plans related to out-of-distribution (OOD) plans, asserting that while existing techniques are applied to a new domain, the proposed metric is theoretically justified. The method is evaluated across three offline control benchmarks, demonstrating its potential in refining unreliable plans and providing significant experimental results with added context.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The problem of improving unreliable plans generated by diffusion-based planners is both interesting and significant.
2. The paper is well-written, with clear visualizations and a structured presentation.
3. The authors effectively addressed reviewer concerns during the rebuttal process, leading to a more positive evaluation of the work.
4. The proposed solution and theoretical analysis are recognized as effective and correct.
5. The experiments cover a diverse range of tasks and compare against numerous benchmarks, supporting the findings.

Weaknesses:
1. The proposed solution shows only marginal improvements over the Diffuser benchmark, raising concerns about its overall impact and the adequacy of the experimental setup.
2. The work lacks comparisons with rejection-based methods, particularly in fixed problem contexts, which could strengthen the significance of the approach.
3. There is confusion regarding the distinction between infeasible plans and OOD plans, which needs clarification.
4. Claims of novelty may be overstated, as the work does not introduce entirely new concepts but applies existing techniques in a novel context.
5. The significance of the restoration gap metric is not adequately demonstrated against other metrics like realism score and rarity score.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of equation 4 by referencing section 3.2 of Janner et al. 2022 regarding trajectory optimality. In equation 5, the definition of g should be elaborated for clarity. The explanation of realism gap and rarity score in figure 2 should be moved to the caption or section 3 for better accessibility. Additionally, a clearer definition of reliability in the context of restoration gap is necessary, along with a discussion on the acceptable noise levels. We suggest removing section 4.2 if the attribution map regularizer's significance is not supported by experimental results. It would also be beneficial to compare guidance with restoration gap against other metrics post-section 5.1. Lastly, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the distinction between infeasible plans and OOD plans, explicitly discussing how the restoration gap identifies these plans, and toning down claims of novelty to accurately reflect the contributions of the work. It would also be beneficial to elaborate on the relationship between the restoration gap and OOD-ness, as well as provide insights into the accuracy of the restoration gap through theoretical analysis and the sensitivity of planning performance in relation to the choice of scaling coefficients.
