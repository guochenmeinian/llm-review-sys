Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to human-centric text-to-image generation by constructing a large-scale dataset of over one million images, including close-up subsets of faces and hands. The authors propose the Mixture of Low-rank Experts (MoLE) framework, which utilizes specialized low-rank modules to enhance the quality of facial and hand details in diffusion models. Extensive visualizations and analyses support the effectiveness of this approach, contributing significantly to the field.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written, clearly articulating its motivation and contributions.
2. The proposed MoLE framework is innovative, being the first to apply a Mixture of Experts strategy to improve human generation quality in diffusion models.
3. The availability of a high-quality, publicly accessible dataset will facilitate further research in human image generation.
4. Comprehensive visual comparisons demonstrate the advantages of the MoLE architecture.

Weaknesses:
1. The text description process is inadequate, particularly regarding the manual filtering of data generated by the LLaVA model, which may include hallucinated descriptions. The authors should clarify how they addressed this issue and consider using human/clothing attribute prediction methods for more reliable prompts.
2. The visualized comparisons primarily feature half-body portraits; the authors should include full-body comparisons to assess quality in smaller facial and hand areas.
3. There is a lack of comparison with existing datasets and state-of-the-art methods, which is essential for contextualizing the proposed dataset's value.
4. The generation of two global scalars lacks sufficient evidence regarding their effects, and the authors should provide a clearer rationale for their selection.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the text description process by addressing the potential hallucinations in the LLaVA-generated descriptions and consider incorporating human/clothing attribute prediction methods. Additionally, we suggest including full-body comparison results to better evaluate the model's performance on smaller features. A thorough comparison with established datasets and state-of-the-art methods should be conducted to contextualize the contributions of the proposed dataset. Finally, the authors should provide a detailed analysis of the distribution of weights sent to each expert by the sigmoid function and clarify the rationale behind the selection of global scalar values in MoLE.
