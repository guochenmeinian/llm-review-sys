### Key Points
This paper presents a factuality-oriented abstractive summarization model, DASum, based on a factual relation discrimination task to identify the root causes of factual errors. The authors construct a new factual summarization dataset using data augmentation techniques and demonstrate the effectiveness of their method through comprehensive experiments, showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is novel and clearly explained, making it easy to follow.
- Comprehensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements compared to other counterparts.
- The evaluation is thorough, incorporating both automatic and human assessments.
- The contribution to data resources for factual summarization is noteworthy.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the constructed factual summarization dataset appears limited, as similar methods have been proposed in existing works.
- The factual relation discrimination task alone may not sufficiently address the factual inconsistency problem, suggesting a need for additional discrimination tasks.
- The improvements in factuality are slightly lower than those of LASum.
- The method for obtaining feature representations of relations is overly complex, and no ablation studies are reported.
- There is a lack of diverse automated evaluation metrics and a more thorough limitations section.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the results to provide intuition on why their method performs better. Additionally, please include more diverse automated evaluation metrics such as SummAC or FactEval. We suggest simplifying the method for obtaining feature representations and conducting ablation studies to clarify its effectiveness. Furthermore, consider introducing more discrimination tasks to enhance the handling of factual inconsistencies. Lastly, we advise restructuring the section on error types for clarity and ensuring thorough grammar and spell checking throughout the paper.
