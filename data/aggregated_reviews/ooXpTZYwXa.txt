Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an in-text learning method for multi-task 3D shape analysis, addressing tasks such as denoising, part segmentation, reconstruction, and registration using a single pretrained masked point model (MPM). The authors propose a joint sampling (JS) module to mitigate information leakage during pretraining, facilitating the model's learning of inherent associations between inputs and targets. The framework, named Point-In-Context, is validated through extensive experiments, demonstrating its versatility and adaptability across various tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The exploration of in-context learning for point clouds is novel and engaging.
2. The unified approach to different 3D shape analysis tasks is logical and effective.
3. The performance of the proposed method is satisfactory, supported by extensive experiments.

Weaknesses:
1. The writing lacks clarity, particularly regarding task definitions and the explanation of information leakage. The JS module's functionality is not sufficiently demonstrated, leading to confusion.
2. The JS module appears straightforward, requiring more in-depth insight into its implementation.
3. Concerns exist regarding the framework's generalizability and the potential instability of performance based on prompt selection.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing, particularly by providing more detailed descriptions of task definitions and the pretraining process. The explanation of information leakage should be made clearer, possibly through enhanced visual aids like Figure 2. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on the JS module to clarify its significance and functionality. To strengthen the paper, consider including comparisons with more recent state-of-the-art methods and addressing the limitations of the current approach, particularly in real-world applications.
