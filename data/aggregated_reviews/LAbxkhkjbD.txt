Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for fitting high-fidelity recurrent spiking neural networks (RSNNs) to multi-session neural recordings, incorporating LIF neurons and a soft-thresholding mechanism for spiking. The authors propose an optimal-transport based loss function to match trial-to-trial variability, validated through simulations and applied to a large dataset from the sensory-motor pathway. The model captures trends across trial types and reveals unexpected modes of variability related to movements during the delay period.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation and methods are clear and novel, with significant implications for neuroscience modeling tasks.
- The model effectively captures trial variability beyond trial-averaged firing rates and demonstrates the potential for unsupervised discovery of new modes of variability.
- The thorough discussion section and comparisons with existing methods, particularly LFADS, provide valuable insights.

Weaknesses:
- Fitting the model to neurons not recorded simultaneously raises conceptual concerns regarding trial-to-trial variability, suggesting a need for clearer terminology.
- The analysis relies on population averages rather than individual trial averages, limiting the depth of insights.
- The model's contribution is seen as incremental, lacking a quantitative comparison to other methods, and it requires careful hyperparameter selection, particularly regarding the number of neurons modeled.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity around the term "trial-to-trial variability," possibly using "condition-to-condition variability" to better reflect the model's capabilities. Additionally, we suggest conducting simulations to test session stitching, which would help validate the model's effectiveness in combining non-simultaneously recorded neurons. It would also be beneficial for the authors to provide a quantitative comparison with other methods to strengthen the contribution of their work. Finally, addressing the scalability of the model for larger and more heterogeneous datasets would enhance its applicability in diverse experimental contexts.
