Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a diffusion-based image denoising method that utilizes the MAP framework along with an adaptive likelihood estimation method and a pre-trained diffusion prior. The authors propose a technique to dynamically infer the precision posterior using variational Bayes, addressing complex noise statistics in real-world images. Experiments conducted on four datasets demonstrate the method's superior performance compared to existing single-image denoising techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and easy to understand.
2. The integration of a reverse diffusion process with adaptive likelihood estimation is novel.
3. The proposed method shows improved quantitative and qualitative performance against various baselines, including self-supervised and diffusion-based methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The title does not accurately reflect the paper's contributions, as it is too generic and does not highlight the significant alternative updating scheme for estimating the likelihood term.
2. The computational cost of denoising is high, with lengthy running times for the reverse diffusion process.
3. The method relies on numerous hyperparameters, which may require careful tuning for optimal performance across different datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the title to better capture the core contributions of the paper. Additionally, addressing the high computational cost and lengthy running times would enhance the method's practicality. We suggest providing a clearer explanation of the hyperparameter selection process and ensuring the algorithm's robustness to variations in these settings. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to justify their choice of the gamma hyperprior and to explore the applicability of their method to other linear inverse problems beyond denoising.
