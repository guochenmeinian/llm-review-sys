### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) prediction by incorporating the Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD) framework to estimate uncertainty in neural network models. Traditional models typically provide point estimates, lacking the ability to capture uncertainty, which is essential for informed business decisions. The authors validate their method using data from PUBG Mobile, showing improvements in predictive accuracy and introducing confidence metrics for performance evaluation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The innovation of integrating MCD into LTV prediction models is commendable, addressing a gap in traditional approaches by providing uncertainty estimates alongside predictions.  
- The validation on PUBG Mobile data demonstrates substantial improvements in predictive accuracy.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper has a loose structure with weak transitions, making it difficult to follow the research flow.  
- There are insufficient experimental details regarding model training settings and data preprocessing, hindering replicability.  
- The methodology lacks a thorough explanation of MCD and its advantages in LTV prediction.  
- The absence of comparative experiments with other mainstream methods, particularly complex neural networks or ensemble learning, limits the validation of the approach.  
- The reliance on a single dataset restricts the demonstration of the method's generalizability.  
- The selection of evaluation metrics is narrow, with inadequate discussion on their appropriateness for assessing business impact.  
- The analysis of experimental results is superficial, lacking depth in discussing the implications of uncertainty on business decision-making.  
- Language clarity suffers due to verbosity and repetition, obscuring the research contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the overall structure of the paper to enhance readability and flow. It is essential to provide more detailed experimental settings and data preprocessing information to facilitate replication. We suggest a more comprehensive explanation of the Monte Carlo Dropout methodology and its specific advantages in LTV prediction. Additionally, including comparative studies with other uncertainty estimation techniques would strengthen the validation of the approach. The authors should consider using multiple datasets to demonstrate the generalizability of their method. Expanding the discussion on evaluation metrics to include their relevance to actual business impacts is crucial. Finally, we encourage the authors to deepen the analysis of experimental results, particularly regarding the implications of uncertainty in model predictions on business decisions, and to refine the language for clarity and conciseness.
