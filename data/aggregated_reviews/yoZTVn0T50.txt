### Key Points
This paper presents a novel hierarchical policy framework, CaMP, for the interactive navigation task in the AI2THOR environment, which incorporates counterfactual reasoning to enhance decision-making in the presence of obstacles. The framework consists of a master policy, an intent policy, and three sub-control policies (navigate, push, and pick). The intent policy is designed to embed intuitive intents from the sub-control policies into the master policy, enabling it to make counterfactual decisions. The authors evaluate CaMP on a newly collected dataset in ProcTHOR multi-room scenes, demonstrating its superior performance compared to various baselines. Additionally, the paper introduces a dataset based on the PROC-THOR simulation environment for evaluation purposes, focusing on the agent's ability to manipulate its environment to enhance navigation performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The interactive navigation task is relevant and challenging within the field of embodied AI, and the paper contributes significantly by introducing a causally-inspired hierarchical reinforcement learning policy.
- The proposed method is sound and well-defined, with a clear problem formulation and method description, addressing a relevant challenge in robotics and embodied AI.
- The use of a larger dataset with complex scene layouts enhances the realism of the task, and the results provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of CaMP.
- The paper provides sufficient implementation details for replication of the model architecture and state-action-reward structures.
- The decomposition of the policy into a master and sub-control policies is a reasonable approach for addressing interactive navigation challenges.

Weaknesses:
- The connection between confounding bias from unmeasurable obstacles and the counterfactual policy design is inadequately explained, leaving the rationale for the intent policy unclear.
- The evaluation metrics and experimental design are a major concern, as traditional metrics like SPL do not adequately reflect the complexities of interactive navigation, potentially obscuring the disadvantages of the interactive approach.
- The model design lacks intuitive clarity, and the introduction of an Intent Policy may not be necessary; a recursive feedback mechanism could be more effective.
- There is a lack of granularity in the quantitative results, particularly in distinguishing episodes that require interaction from those that do not.
- Several implementation details are missing, including how to determine which object to interact with and the force applied during push actions.
- The discussion of causal inference lacks technical rigor, with unclear definitions of "causalities" and "confounding bias."

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper, particularly regarding causal inference concepts, as many readers may be unfamiliar with terms like "counterfactual reasoning" and "confounding factors." Providing more examples of counterfactual situations would enhance understanding. Additionally, the authors should clarify whether the entire model is differentiable and how gradients are propagated through intent predictions.

In the experiments, we suggest explicitly connecting the proposed model's use of counterfactual reasoning to its handling of confounding factors. We also recommend improving the evaluation metrics by incorporating time lost due to interactions into the SPL metric, as this would provide a more accurate representation of performance in interactive navigation scenarios. Furthermore, consider evaluating on data subsets that clearly differentiate between episodes requiring interaction and those solvable by non-interactive agents.

Including error bars in Tables 3 and 4 would strengthen the statistical rigor of the results. The authors should analyze how well each model interacts with relevant obstacles, using precision and recall metrics. Lastly, we recommend addressing the ambiguities regarding object dynamics in ProcTHOR and the specifics of invoking and terminating interaction subtasks to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the proposed approach.
