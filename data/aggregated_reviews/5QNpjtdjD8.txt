### Key Points
This paper presents an extensive evaluation of GPT-4's capabilities in understanding radiology reports, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art (SOTA) radiology-specific models. The authors propose various prompting strategies and categorize errors made by GPT-4, providing a framework for error analysis. The results indicate that GPT-4 either outperforms or is on par with current SOTA models, suggesting its potential as a versatile foundation model across diverse domains, including radiology.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with clear language and structured results.
- Comprehensive evaluation of GPT-4 across various radiology tasks, demonstrating its language understanding and generation capabilities.
- The proposed evaluation framework will be publicly available, benefiting the community.

Weaknesses:
- The findings may lack novelty, as some results are already documented in the GPT-4 technical report.
- The high cost of GPT-4 limits its accessibility and potential impact compared to open-source models.
- The experiments primarily focus on remote LLMs, necessitating an ethics statement to address potential concerns regarding data handling.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their work by including comparisons with other open-source LLMs like Vicuna and LLaMA. Additionally, the authors should explore prompt tuning to enhance performance across different strategies. Including qualitative evaluations by human experts for open-ended tasks would also strengthen the analysis. Finally, we suggest adding an ethics statement section to clarify any ethical concerns related to data usage and storage.
