Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on correlation clustering with an unknown similarity function, utilizing a noisy oracle for feedback. The authors propose two novel problem formulations within the pure exploration combinatorial multi-armed bandits (PE-CMAB) framework: fixed confidence and fixed budget settings. They introduce two algorithms, KC-FC and KC-FB, and provide theoretical guarantees for both. Empirical results on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that these algorithms outperform a baseline method in terms of sample complexity and clustering cost. Additionally, the authors respond to reviewer feedback, indicating an understanding of the challenges in comparing with other baseline methods, and adjustments made have positively influenced one reviewer's score.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper exhibits good originality by exploring two novel problem formulations for correlation clustering with an oracle providing noisy feedback.  
- The settings are well-motivated in the Introduction.  
- The writing is clear and well-contextualized with over 80 references to prior work.  
- The proposed algorithms are theoretically analyzed.  
- The authors demonstrate responsiveness to reviewer feedback, and the inclusion of additional remarks is seen as beneficial.

Weaknesses:  
- The authors focus on a basic formulation for correlation clustering without justifying their choice or discussing general cases where costs may differ.  
- The experimental evaluation is limited by the small number of baselines, primarily comparing against KwikCluster and self-defined methods, missing opportunities to demonstrate the necessity of their algorithms.  
- Comparisons with baseline methods remain challenging, and one reviewer has chosen to maintain their score, indicating some reservations.  
- The lack of reproducibility due to the absence of source code.  
- Missing proof sketch for Theorem 2, which should be included for clarity.  
- Several aspects of the paper lack clarity, including the rationale for different similarity generation methods for the FC and FB settings, the nature of noisy feedback, and the justification for certain parameter values.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the choice of the basic formulation for correlation clustering, including potential extensions to more general cases. Additionally, we suggest incorporating comparisons with existing general-purpose PE-CMAB algorithms to strengthen the argument for their proposed methods. Improving the comparative analysis with baseline methods would enhance clarity and strengthen the paper's contributions. Providing the source code would enhance reproducibility. The authors should include a proof sketch for Theorem 2 and clarify the rationale behind the different methods for generating similarity values, the nature of the noisy feedback, and the justification for parameter choices such as epsilon and T. Lastly, addressing the clarity issues regarding the experimental setup and results would significantly enhance the paper's comprehensibility.
