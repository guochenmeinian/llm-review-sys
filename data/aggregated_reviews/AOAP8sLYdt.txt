### Key Points
This paper presents an empirically-based contribution to understanding how CNNs subitize using two different loss functions: a classical Cross Entropy (CE) and a neuro-symbolic Holographic Reduced Representation (HRR). The authors explore an interesting application of neuro-symbolic methods from cognitive science to enhance the subitizing capability of CNNs and Vision Transformers (ViTs). The proposed HRR loss function shows improvements in generalization for subitizing tasks, although it does not completely resolve the issue of subitizing generalization. The extensive experiments and saliency map analyses provide empirical support for the effectiveness of the approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The integration of HRRs into deep learning loss functions is novel, bridging cognitive science and neural network research.  
- The paper demonstrates improvements in subitizing capabilities, particularly for CNNs, and includes a comprehensive comparison between CNNs and ViTs.  
- The extensive experimental section and saliency map analyses support the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Weaknesses:  
- The results are somewhat weak, with only minor improvements over cross entropy loss in limited cases.  
- The paper lacks an analysis quantifying the computational efficiency benefits of subitization compared to traditional object detection and counting, leaving the practical speedup for real-time applications unclear.  
- The use of a specialized dataset (Numerosity database) may limit the generalizability of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of table captions by explicitly stating that accuracy is the main metric used. Additionally, the authors should clarify how saliency maps demonstrate the symbolic aspects of the inference process in CNNs. To enhance the practical implications of their work, we suggest that the authors include an analysis of inference speed, latency, or computational cost to demonstrate the advantages of the HRR approach over traditional counting methods. Finally, we encourage the authors to incorporate more benchmarks and datasets to improve the generalization of their approach beyond the specialized dataset used.
