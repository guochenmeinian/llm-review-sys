### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the enhanced robustness in diffusion-based classifiers and introduces the Exact Posterior Noised Diffusion Classifier (EPNDC) and Approximated Posterior Noised Diffusion Classifier (APNDC). The authors derive upper bounds on the Lipschitz constant and utilize the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) for likelihood approximation, demonstrating that APNDC achieves state-of-the-art certified robustness. The empirical evaluation shows significant improvements in certified accuracy on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The theoretical framework is intriguing, leveraging the shared Gaussian structure in diffusion models and randomized smoothing.  
- The paper is logically structured, facilitating reader comprehension, and the empirical results, particularly in Figure 2a, are impressive.  
- The work addresses a gap in existing literature by providing certified guarantees for diffusion classifiers.

Weaknesses:  
- Some content lacks clarity, particularly in explaining causal relationships and certain technical terms.  
- The experimental evaluation is limited to smaller datasets, which may not fully represent the method's capabilities.  
- The computational overhead of diffusion classifiers remains significant, and the paper does not convincingly demonstrate the practicality of proposed methods in terms of inference time.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of explanations regarding causal relationships and technical terms, particularly in Lines 156 and 161-164. Additionally, we suggest including a comparison of computational costs between different methods to provide a clearer understanding of efficiency. Expanding the experimental evaluation to larger datasets, such as ImageNet-1K, would enhance the robustness of the findings. Finally, we encourage the authors to incorporate Appendix D into the main text for better accessibility.
