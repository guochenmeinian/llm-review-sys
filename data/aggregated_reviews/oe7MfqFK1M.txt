Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative recover-and-resample augmentation framework aimed at addressing the domain generalization challenge in skeleton-based action recognition. The authors utilize a complete action prior to reconstruct entire action sequences from partial observations, employing boundary pose-conditioned extrapolation and smooth linear transforms. The effectiveness of this approach is validated through extensive experiments on various skeleton action datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over existing domain generalization methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The exploration of domain generalization in skeleton-based human action recognition is a novel and underexplored area.
2. The proposed augmentation method has been shown to be effective across different domain generalization settings.
3. Comprehensive ablation studies are provided, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed framework.

Weaknesses:
1. The introduction lacks a detailed justification for the necessity of domain generalization in skeleton-based action recognition, particularly given the reduced domain gap in 3D coordinate data.
2. Section 4.3 requires more detail on the implementation of the proposed methods for skeleton-based action recognition.
3. The authors should clarify the number of parameters in the proposed approach and compare it with baseline methods.
4. Justification for the selection of GCN backbones, such as HCN and CTRGCN, is insufficient and should be elaborated in a dedicated subsection.
5. The t-SNE visualization of learned embeddings from different approaches is not provided, which could enhance understanding of the method's effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by providing a clearer rationale for the importance of domain generalization in skeleton-based action recognition. Additionally, please elaborate on the implementation details in Section 4.3, including specific techniques used. Clarifying the total number of parameters in the proposed approach and comparing it with baseline methods would also be beneficial. We suggest adding a subsection in Section 4 to justify the choice of GCN backbones. Finally, including t-SNE visualizations of learned embeddings from different approaches on the test domain would illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to others.
