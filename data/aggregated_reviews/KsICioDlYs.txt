Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to circuit design by treating circuit components as point clouds and employing point cloud perception methods for feature extraction. The authors propose a method that allows for direct feature extraction from raw data, facilitating end-to-end training without the preprocessing required by traditional CNN and GNN methods. Experimental results on the CircuitNet dataset indicate that the proposed method excels in congestion prediction and design rule check (DRC) violation prediction tasks, outperforming existing techniques. The integration of a genetic algorithm (GA) module further enhances the optimization process, showcasing the potential for innovative applications in electronic design automation (EDA). Additionally, the authors provide a comparative evaluation of their model against CircuitGNN, reporting that their model, trained for 100 epochs, outperformed CircuitGNN trained for 500 epochs by 28.2% on the ISPD2015 dataset. They also address concerns regarding the model's capability to handle larger designs, providing runtime memory data for the RISCY-FPU-a design, which consists of 77,707 nodes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a groundbreaking method that significantly improves congestion prediction and DRC violation prediction in EDA.
- The use of point cloud perception methods provides a fresh perspective on circuit design analysis, leading to more accurate predictions.
- The multi-scale grid-based attention architecture reduces computational complexity and enhances information compression.
- The authors provide clear experimental results demonstrating superior performance of their model compared to CircuitGNN.
- The runtime memory analysis shows that their model uses less memory than the SOTA GNN-based model, which is a significant advantage.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation lacks comprehensiveness; expanding it to include other EDA applications, such as circuit placement, would provide a more holistic understanding of the method's capabilities.
- There is insufficient analysis of the decoder section, particularly regarding the choice of network architectures like ResNet18 and UNet++, which raises questions about their suitability for different downstream tasks.
- The experimental results do not adequately compare the proposed method against other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on various datasets, limiting the claims of superiority.
- The authors acknowledge that the designs used for testing are relatively small, which may not fully demonstrate the model's scalability.
- The inability to present results from the 500-epoch training due to time constraints may limit the completeness of their evaluation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including additional applications within EDA, such as circuit placement, to demonstrate the versatility of the proposed method. Conducting further ablation studies focused on runtime and scaling trade-offs would provide deeper insights into the performance and efficiency of the method. Additionally, we suggest a more detailed analysis of the decoder section, exploring alternative output formats and optimizing the decoder component to enhance integration into EDA workflows. To strengthen the claims of superiority, we encourage the authors to include comparisons with SOTA methods on other datasets, such as ISPD2015 and DAC 2012, and to clarify the performance metrics in relation to the datasets used. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors include results from the 500-epoch training of their model in the final version of the paper and test their model on larger designs to better validate its scalability and performance in real-world applications.
