### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative end-to-end framework named BOND for the From-Scratch Name Disambiguation (SND) task, addressing the limitations of traditional pipeline-based approaches. The authors propose a model that synergistically integrates local and global informative signals, utilizing local pairwise similarities to enhance global clustering, which in turn refines local characteristics. The efficacy of BOND is demonstrated through extensive experiments, including its success in the WhoIsWho Challenge.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The experimental design is comprehensive, effectively addressing potential reader concerns and covering various aspects of interest.
2. The integration of local and global signals within an end-to-end framework provides a novel perspective on the SND problem.

Weaknesses:
1. The clustering algorithm may face challenges with large datasets, and the paper lacks an illustration of the method's efficiency.
2. Some technical details, such as the rationale behind the decoder's definition in equation (4), require further explanation.
3. There are minor typographical errors, such as "SND-all-" in Table 1, which should be corrected.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the edge construction explanation, particularly regarding the metrics of word overlap and the Jaccard Index, and validate their effectiveness through ablation studies. Additionally, we suggest discussing the implications of potentially incorrect clustering assignments on node similarity. It would also be beneficial to clarify the discrepancies between the reported experimental results and the online leaderboard. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore the performance of various clustering algorithms in their ablation studies to assess the generalizability of the BOND framework.
