Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Direction-Disentangled Gaussian Splatting (DDGS) method, which decomposes radiosity contributions into isotropic and direction-dependent components to approximate complex anisotropic interactions without complex runtime simulations. The authors propose a combination of realistic physics-inspired X-ray simulation with efficient, differentiable digitally reconstructed radiograph (DRR) generation using 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS). The method demonstrates significant improvements in PSNR and SSIM on DRR renderings across multiple datasets, showcasing its potential for intraoperative applications and inverse problems like pose registration.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper clearly defines the problem and presents a well-structured methodological framework, introducing the disentanglement of isotropic and direction-dependent components.
2. The proposed DDGS model effectively integrates complex X-ray physical interactions, achieving real-time, high-quality X-ray image rendering.
3. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant empirical improvements over existing methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The mathematical description of the "migrated version" of Gaussian Splatting lacks detail, particularly regarding its application in CT imaging, making it difficult to understand the algorithm's motivation.
2. The comparison methods used in experiments are limited and do not reflect the current state of the field, reducing the persuasiveness of the results.
3. The paper's organization is unclear, particularly in the related work section, and the effectiveness of the Radiodensity-Aware Dual Sampling method appears marginal.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the mathematical description of the "migrated version" of Gaussian Splatting to clarify its application in CT imaging. Additionally, the authors should include a more comprehensive comparison with Physics-based Monte-Carlo simulations to highlight differences in image quality. It would be beneficial to reorganize the paper for clarity, particularly by integrating the 'Application' section into the related work. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors provide a detailed explanation of how to split the points set P^dw into disentangled isotropic and anisotropic point sets, and clarify the necessity of rendering these sets separately. Lastly, including an overview diagram in the methods section could enhance understanding.
