Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a unified framework for inverse folding (IF) applicable to small molecules, proteins, and RNA, referred to as UniIF. The authors propose a unified frame representation for amino acids, atoms, and nucleotides, alongside a GNN-based model to learn structural information. The results indicate that their model outperforms other baselines in protein design, RNA design, and material design tasks. The authors assert that while training on mixed datasets yields slightly lower performance compared to single datasets, the unified approach offers significant advantages. Extensive experiments support the effectiveness of the method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on individual tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and clearly articulated.
- The unification of inverse folding for various molecule types is an innovative and reasonable approach.
- The unified framework is considered interesting and novel.
- Extensive experiments provide justification for the method's effectiveness.
- UniIF achieves state-of-the-art performance on single tasks.

Weaknesses:
- Important experimental details are lacking, particularly regarding whether the model is trained on a combined dataset from different molecule types.
- Uncertainty exists regarding whether individual tasks benefit from cross-task training.
- The decoder component of the inverse folding model is not explained.
- The ablation studies do not convincingly demonstrate the impact of the proposed techniques on model performance, particularly in the context of previously explored block-based representations.
- The materials-related task lacks clarity, with insufficient detail on what is being predicted and how it relates to inverse folding.
- The comparison baselines for materials are not state-of-the-art, raising questions about the significance of the results.
- Some reviewers express reservations, leading to weak accept scores.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the materials task by providing detailed explanations of the predictions and their relevance to inverse folding. Additionally, the authors should include experiments where the model is trained on various data modalities to assess performance improvements across individual tasks. It would be beneficial to clarify the decoder model used in the inverse folding framework and to include a comparison of perplexity metrics, as seen in related works. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors explore incorporating more specific domain knowledge, such as secondary structure information for RNA design, to enhance the model's performance further. Lastly, addressing the limitations of the proposed method and providing insights into how unification contributes to performance improvements would strengthen the paper's claims.
