Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies weak-to-strong generalization (WTSG) from a theoretical perspective, aiming to elucidate its occurrence. The authors demonstrate that in a regression context with a convex function class, the decrease in mean squared error (MSE) from the weak to strong model is bounded below by the misfit of the weak-to-strong model on weak labels. The proof employs the Pythagorean theorem for projections onto convex sets. The authors validate their theoretical predictions through synthetic and realistic experiments, showing a linear relationship between MSE decrease and misfit. They also highlight that in low-sample regimes, larger models may overfit, leading to unexpected performance outcomes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The theoretical explanation of WTSG is clear, original, and provides novel insights.
- Empirical validation across synthetic and realistic settings enhances the significance of the findings.
- The paper is well-written and accessible.

Weaknesses:
- The choice of a regression setting over a classification context, which is more relevant to the original work, is not adequately justified.
- Empirical validation is limited to one unfamiliar dataset, suggesting a need for broader testing across standard settings.
- The paper lacks intuitive explanations for the theoretical results, particularly regarding the implications of the distance measure used.
- The practical suggestion of selecting the weak model with the highest misfit requires further assumptions to be valid.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the rationale for choosing a regression setting over classification, as this distinction is crucial for contextualizing their work. Additionally, expanding empirical validation to include more familiar datasets would strengthen the findings. Providing intuitive insights into the theoretical results, especially regarding the implications of the distance measure, would enhance reader comprehension. Finally, we suggest discussing the conditions under which the practical proposition of using the weak model with the highest misfit holds true, to ensure its applicability in broader contexts.
