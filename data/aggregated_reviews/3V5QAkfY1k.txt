### Key Points
This paper presents the Spherical Embeddings (SpherE) method, which employs a symbolic approach to address the non-closure problem associated with spherical shapes while effectively learning hierarchy-aware vector representations. The authors demonstrate that SpherE achieves strong performance in complex logical query answering (CLQA) tasks by utilizing polar coordinates to represent hierarchical relations and incorporating fuzzy logic to handle logical operators.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The experiments are comprehensive, effectively evaluating the model across multiple datasets.
2. The motivation for the paper is reasonable, addressing significant limitations in existing geometric embedding approaches for CLQA.
3. The combination of geometric embeddings with fuzzy logic is novel and well-motivated, successfully mitigating the shape-closure requirement.
4. The paper is well-presented, featuring clear illustrative figures.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a formal justification for why spherical embeddings in polar coordinates are particularly suited for hierarchical relations.
2. There is insufficient discussion of recent advancements in probabilistic embeddings and hybrid approaches that combine geometric and probabilistic methods.
3. The baseline models referenced are relatively outdated, and comparisons with more recent models, including hyperbolic embeddings, would strengthen the evaluation.
4. There is limited insight into scalability, computational complexity, and memory requirements when dealing with large knowledge graphs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the suitability of spherical embeddings in polar coordinates for hierarchical relations by providing a formal justification. Additionally, the authors should include a more thorough review of recent advancements in probabilistic embeddings and hybrid approaches. We suggest updating the baseline models to include more recent alternatives and conducting comparisons with hyperbolic embeddings. Lastly, addressing scalability, computational complexity, and memory requirements in the context of large knowledge graphs would enhance the paper's contributions.
