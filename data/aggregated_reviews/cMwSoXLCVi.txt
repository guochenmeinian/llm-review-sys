Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the One-to-Multiple Progressive Style Transfer Unsupervised Domain-Adaptive (PSTUDA) framework for kidney and tumor segmentation in multi-sequence MRI. PSTUDA introduces a multi-level style dictionary and multiple cascading style fusion modules utilizing point-wise instance normalization to progressively recombine content and style features. The framework demonstrates improvements of 1.8% and 3.9% in Dice Similarity Coefficient for kidney and tumor segmentation, respectively, while significantly reducing model parameters and computational costs. PSTUDA outperforms existing state-of-the-art UDA methods, enhancing segmentation performance and training efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The introduction of a multi-level style dictionary effectively decouples content and style, reducing the burden on a single generator in multi-target transfer tasks.  
- The use of multiple cascaded style fusion modules enhances cross-modal alignment and structural consistency.  
- The paper is well-organized, clearly written, and provides detailed explanations of the architecture and methodologies, contributing to reproducibility.  
- Robust experimental design, including comparative and ablation studies, with appropriate metrics and analysis.  

Weaknesses:  
- The reported improvements in Dice Similarity Coefficient and 95% Hausdorff Distance are relatively modest.  
- The scalability of the framework to handle a larger number of target domains in real-world scenarios remains untested.  
- Generalizability beyond kidney and tumor segmentation to multi-class intra-organ or multi-organ segmentation is uncertain.  
- The open-source code is not explicitly provided, and the explanation of the One-to-Multiple Framework lacks detail.  
- The effectiveness of point-wise instance normalization compared to other normalization techniques is not thoroughly evaluated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the One-to-Multiple Framework to provide more clarity. Additionally, we suggest validating PSTUDA bidirectionally on cross-modal data, such as MRI and CT, to assess its effectiveness across different modalities. To enhance the evaluation of point-wise instance normalization, we encourage the authors to compare its performance with alternative normalization methods like Adaptive Instance Normalization or Batch-Instance Normalization. Finally, we urge the authors to consider releasing the code, pre-trained models, and detailed implementation guides to facilitate community engagement with PSTUDA.
