Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of transfer learning through the lens of task-relatedness, introducing a model that transforms a reference task into a target task. The authors propose a metric for task-relatedness based on the differences in class priors, label sets, and features, which serves as an upper bound on transferability. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed task-relatedness effectively predicts model performance across various architectures and datasets. Additionally, the authors present a method for estimating transferability without target labels, suggesting that practitioners can estimate task relatedness by selecting a reference task that minimizes an upper bound, although this introduces a new challenge in reference task selection.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The work provides a novel theoretical framework for analyzing transferability in classification tasks, establishing an upper bound based on task-relatedness.  
2. The authors propose an optimization problem to compute task-relatedness using minimal target labels, showing its applicability even without them.  
3. Multiple experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.  
4. The method shows practical value in scenarios without target labels.  
5. The authors are responsive to reviewer feedback, indicating a willingness to improve the work.

Weaknesses:  
1. The novelty is limited, as the use of distribution distances for measuring transferability has been explored in prior works, and the method lacks theoretical justification for its pseudo-labeling scheme.  
2. The evaluation is not comprehensive; key baselines are missing, and there is no ablation study to assess the contribution of the proposed terms for computing task-relatedness.  
3. The datasets used for empirical studies are relatively small, which may affect the generalizability of the results.  
4. The fixed permutation matrix B limits variability in results.  
5. The approach to reference task selection may require practitioner intuition, complicating implementation.  
6. There is potential computational overhead when running the algorithm on multiple tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their contribution by providing a more rigorous theoretical justification for the pseudo-labeling scheme. Additionally, the authors should expand their evaluation to include a broader range of baselines and conduct an ablation study to clarify the impact of each term in the task-relatedness computation. Furthermore, we suggest using larger and more diverse datasets for empirical validation to enhance the robustness of their findings. We also recommend that the authors improve the evaluation of sensitivity to the initial (random) value of B and address the computational overhead associated with the reference task selection process to enhance the practicality of their method. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the assumptions made regarding the class-prior transformation and explore the applicability of their method to non-classification tasks.
