Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a unified perspective on data augmentation strategies for cross-spectral re-identification, identifying that cross-spectral modality discrepancies arise from various local linear transformations due to material diversity. The authors propose a Random Linear Enhancement (RLE) method, which is further extended to Moderate Random Linear Enhancement (MRLE) and Radical Random Linear Enhancement (RRLE). Experimental results indicate that the proposed methods improve performance in visible-infrared re-identification tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation for the study is valid, and the unified perspective on data augmentation is compelling.
2. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
3. The proposed RLE method demonstrates superior performance on benchmark datasets like RegDB and SYSU-MM01.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks visualization examples of the RLE method and detailed augmentation strategies in Table 4.
2. Innovation is limited, with insufficient comparison to state-of-the-art methods, and the experimental results do not achieve SOTA.
3. The ablation studies are not comprehensive, lacking tests on smaller $t_{min}$ values and single terms in mixed transformations.
4. The reliance on the Lambertian model may restrict the generalizability of the proposed methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by providing several visualization examples of the RLE method to enhance understanding. Additionally, please clarify the detailed augmentation strategies in Table 4 and consider including a comparative analysis with state-of-the-art methods. We also suggest conducting more comprehensive ablation studies, including tests on smaller $t_{min}$ values and exploring the sensitivity of the RLE strategy to various parameter settings. Finally, consider discussing the real-world applicability of the RLE strategies and addressing potential limitations of the Lambertian model in different scenarios.
