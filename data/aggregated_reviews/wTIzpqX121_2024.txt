Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Graph-EFM, a novel method for probabilistic weather forecasting that combines a hierarchical multi-scale graph neural network with a variational objective. The authors adapt GraphCast to enhance accuracy and uncertainty estimation, demonstrating competitive performance against existing deterministic models. The approach is evaluated using a 1.5-degree version of ERA5 data, with results indicating improved reliability for real-world applications. Additionally, the authors construct a specific graph for the MEPS area, claiming it is distinct from a standard U-net, despite potential similarities. They emphasize that their framework allows for various graph constructions, including triangular and irregular graphs, and discuss their modeling assumption that the effective dimension of dynamics is lower than the grid dimension, which they believe does not significantly limit the model's performance, as supported by experiments with Graph-EFM.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The innovative use of Graph-EFM significantly enhances uncertainty estimation and forecast reliability.  
- The paper is well-written, with detailed experiments on large datasets and clear presentation of methods.  
- The hierarchical mesh graph effectively addresses challenges in capturing processes across different spatial scales.  
- The paper provides a clear framework for constructing graphs tailored to specific applications, demonstrating flexibility in model design.  
- Experimental results indicate that the authors' modeling choices yield realistic forecasts, particularly with the Graph-EFM model.

Weaknesses:  
- The choice of baselines is questionable, as comparisons with conventional weather models and other probabilistic models are lacking.  
- The connection to UNets is overlooked, as the Graph-FM appears equivalent to a UNet, which could be more computationally advantageous.  
- The implementation of the VAE may not be physically meaningful, as it captures uncertainty at the coarsest level rather than the finer scales where most model uncertainty arises.  
- The limitations section is brief, failing to adequately address the robustness of the models over longer rollouts or further from training time.  
- The introduction of noise through Initial Condition Perturbations (ICPs) did not improve RMSE values and may have led to less physically plausible diversity in forecasts.  
- The authors acknowledge limitations in their current modeling assumptions regarding randomness and uncertainty.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the baseline comparisons by including conventional weather models and recent probabilistic models like GenCast. Additionally, consider explicitly addressing the connection to UNets, potentially reimplementing the model as a UNet to explore computational advantages. We suggest investigating the physical basis of the VAE implementation, particularly the implications of capturing uncertainty at the coarsest level, and conducting a thorough evaluation of the model's performance during extreme weather events. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors explore alternative graph constructions beyond the current framework, particularly focusing on triangular and irregular graphs. Lastly, we suggest conducting more comprehensive experiments to evaluate the impact of ICPs on model performance, potentially employing more sophisticated methods for perturbing initial conditions to enhance forecast diversity.
