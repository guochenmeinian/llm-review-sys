### Key Points
This paper presents a study on predicting global minimum adsorption energy (GMAE) to aid catalyst discovery. The authors construct three new benchmarking datasets for GMAE predictions and propose AdsGT, a graph transformer model for this task. The evaluation of AdsGT on these datasets yields promising results, highlighting its potential in the field.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an important application in catalysis screening.
- Three well-prepared benchmarking datasets facilitate further research.
- AdsGT demonstrates promising results and serves as a benchmark for future studies.
- The exploration of a pre-training strategy shows potential for enhancing performance, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data.

Weaknesses:
- The absence of baseline comparisons when benchmarking results limits contextual understanding.
- The pre-training strategy utilized is not adequately described.
- Geometric equivariance is insufficiently explored in AdsGT, and the ablation study may lack convincingness due to the effective nature of GDL models in capturing geometric equivariance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including baseline comparisons to provide context for their results. Additionally, a detailed description of the pre-training strategy should be included. Finally, we suggest a more thorough exploration of geometric equivariance in AdsGT to enhance the validity of the ablation study.
