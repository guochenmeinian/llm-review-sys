Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of graphon analysis to graphon-signal analysis, aiming to measure the generalization bounds and stability of message passing neural networks (MPNNs). The authors propose a variant of cut distance as a new graph-signal similarity measure, transforming the space of graph-signals into a dense subset of a compact metric space. They demonstrate Lipschitz continuity of MPNNs, which leads to results on their generalization and stability properties. However, the authors do not provide empirical results connecting graphon-signal analysis with MPNNs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The methodology of analyzing MPNNs through the extension of graphon theory is interesting and fairly novel.
2. The proposed approach can derive generalization and stability arguments for MPNNs.
3. The authors provide a rigorous analysis justified for modeling the graph space, even when Lipschitz continuity of graphons is required.

Weaknesses:
1. There is no empirical evidence highlighting the connection between graphon-signal analysis and MPNNs.
2. The paper lacks discussion of related work that also connects stability arguments of MPNNs with graphon analysis.
3. The practical implications of the theoretical results are unclear, and the exponential dependence in covering number renders some theorems impractical.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by providing empirical results that demonstrate the stability or generalization capabilities of MPNNs concerning graph-signals. Additionally, a further comparison of their analysis with the analysis in the related work should be included. To enhance clarity, we suggest summarizing all notations in a table and addressing the complexities in notation usage. Finally, including figures to illustrate the motivation behind the distance metric would be beneficial.
