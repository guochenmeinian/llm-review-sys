### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative iterative framework that integrates semi-supervised Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a perception model, specifically targeting the acquisition of high-quality micrographs in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) through navigation at different magnification levels. The authors propose a method that alternates perception modeling and RL policy learning, allowing for simultaneous improvement. Their approach demonstrates superior performance compared to various baseline methods in terms of both RL rewards and perception model accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The integration of the perception model and RL is reasonable, and the iterative framework effectively enhances both components gradually.
2. The research addresses a significant challenge in the RL domain, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data, making the proposed framework timely and relevant.
3. The practical application to cryo-EM data collection is compelling, grounding the theoretical work in a real-world context.
4. The paper provides theoretical insights, particularly regarding the bias of RL-generated pseudo labels towards localization, which strengthens the credibility of the approach.

Weaknesses:
1. The improvement of the proposed method over the baseline is not significant, as indicated in Table 1.
2. There appears to be a mismatch in the reward function, as $SSL2-RL 480$ shows better accuracy with 10% compared to 20%, despite having a higher reward with 20%.
3. The paper lacks exploration of the convergence of the learning process and the difficulty of the problem.
4. The entries for 100% in Table 1 are not filled, leaving uncertainty about the proposed method's performance compared to the baseline.
5. The assumptions underlying the iterative framework, particularly regarding the decision model's ability to correct perception model errors, need further clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the assumptions made in the iterative framework, particularly the belief that the decision model can correct the perception model's errors. Additionally, we suggest providing a complexity analysis to understand the computational cost associated with the iterative framework compared to the baselines. It would also be beneficial to explore the framework's applicability in other domains and to fill in the entries for 100% in Table 1 to assess the proposed method's performance more comprehensively. Lastly, addressing the potential convergence issues in the learning process would enhance the robustness of the findings.
