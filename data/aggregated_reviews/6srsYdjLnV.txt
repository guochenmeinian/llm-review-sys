### Key Points
This paper presents GeNTE, a natural bilingual test set for gender-neutral translation from English to Italian, informed by a survey on neutral language perception. The authors propose (1) a study on the feasibility of neutral translation, (2) the creation of GeNTE, the first parallel corpus designed to evaluate machine translation (MT) systems' ability to generate neutral translations, and (3) a comprehensive analysis of existing automatic metrics' suitability for evaluating neutral translation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a valuable resource for addressing gender bias in MT.
- It includes a well-structured introduction and motivation for gender-neutral translation.
- The background and survey on translator preferences for neutral translations are effectively presented.
- The study demonstrates that existing metrics are inadequate for evaluating gender-neutral translations and proposes a new reference-free evaluation method.

Weaknesses:
- The focus on English to Italian limits the applicability of the findings to other languages.
- There is insufficient discussion on the quality of the dataset, particularly regarding inter-annotator agreement and the frequency of neutralization failures.
- The methodology for data collection, including the use of regex, raises concerns about the assumptions made regarding gender neutrality in context.
- The new evaluation metric's effectiveness in gauging overall translation quality remains unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the dataset's quality, particularly regarding inter-annotator agreement and the frequency of neutralization failures. Additionally, consider revisiting the survey in Section 3 to ask respondents to evaluate the created data itself. Clarifying how context was considered in filtering gender-neutral English sources would strengthen the methodology. We also suggest validating the new evaluation metric with human assessments to ensure it accurately measures translation quality beyond gender classification. Finally, addressing the minor grammatical inconsistencies, such as the spelling of "ambiguous," would enhance the paper's clarity.
