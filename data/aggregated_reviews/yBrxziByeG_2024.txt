Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel paradigm for multi-modal image fusion called Text-DiFuse, which integrates information fusion into the diffusion process to address the challenges of mixed degradation and insufficient salience of target objects. The authors propose a zero-shot model that modulates the fusion strategy based on user-input target text, enhancing the visibility of the target of interest. Experimental results indicate significant improvements in human visual perception and performance in advanced computer vision tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The integration of feature-level information aggregation into the diffusion process is innovative, likely yielding better fidelity in fused images compared to likelihood-constrained diffusion models.  
2. The coupled approach effectively addresses compound degradation in multi-modal fusion, as demonstrated by experimental results showing advantages over sequential methods.  
3. The focus on enhancing target saliency through zero-shot assisted re-modulation diverges from traditional uniform fusion rules, proving effective in various tasks.  
4. The method shows strong applicability across multiple domains, including infrared and visible image fusion, medical image fusion, and polarization image fusion.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The paper does not specify the sampling interval used for results after training the diffusion model, nor does it discuss its impact on fusion performance.  
2. The presentation lacks clarity, particularly regarding the transition from Equations 2 to 6, where the degradation condition N is omitted in Equation 7 without explanation.  
3. The rationale behind the order of existing image restoration methods in Table 2 and Figure 4 is unclear and requires justification.  
4. While the novelty of language modulation in enhancing target salience is acknowledged, its effectiveness should be evaluated in object detection scenarios beyond semantic segmentation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation, particularly by addressing the transition between equations and specifying the sampling intervals used in the diffusion process. Additionally, please provide a justification for the order of image restoration methods in the comparative analysis. We suggest expanding the evaluation of the language modulation strategy to include object detection scenarios to further validate its effectiveness. Lastly, ensure that all typos and minor errors are corrected for a polished final submission.
