Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new framework for masked diffusion models aimed at generative modeling of discrete data. It simplifies complex formulations and clarifies relationships between various approaches. Key contributions include the simplification of model formulation, re-derivation of training objectives, performance improvements demonstrated through state-of-the-art results on text and image tasks, and the introduction of a generalized masked diffusion model with state-dependent masking schedules.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper significantly contributes to generative modeling for discrete data by introducing a simplified and generalized framework.
2. It demonstrates thorough methodology and robust experimental validation.
3. The writing is clear and well-structured, making it accessible to a broad audience.
4. The potential impact on various applications in generative modeling is substantial.

Weaknesses:
1. While the theoretical foundation is robust, practical applicability could be emphasized more, particularly through detailed pseudocode and implementation challenges.
2. The range of tasks and datasets in the experimental results could be expanded, including comparisons with models like VQ-Diffusion for token-based text-to-image tasks.
3. The paper lacks some common metrics in image generation likelihood results, such as FID and IS, which could provide a more comprehensive evaluation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the practical applicability of the framework by providing additional practical guidelines, including detailed pseudocode and addressing specific implementation challenges. Expanding the experimental evaluation to include a wider variety of tasks and datasets, such as VQ-Diffusion, would strengthen the results. Additionally, we suggest incorporating common metrics like FID and IS in the evaluation of image generation to enhance the comprehensiveness of the findings.
