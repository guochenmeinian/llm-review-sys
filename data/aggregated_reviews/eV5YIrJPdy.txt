Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the expressive capacity of state-space models (SSMs) within formal language theory, establishing significant theoretical results. It demonstrates that SSMs can effectively model star-free languages and various counter languages, while also identifying limitations, such as the inability of non-negative SSMs to recognize the PARITY language. The authors propose that SSMs, particularly with finite precision, can predictively model certain language classes, and they provide empirical support for their theoretical claims.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel theoretical framework connecting formal language theory with the expressive capabilities of SSMs, an area that has not been extensively explored in machine learning.
- The use of the Krohn-Rhodes theorem and algebraic theory to provide rigorous proofs enhances the validity of the claims regarding the capabilities of SSMs.
- The integration of theoretical computer science concepts with modern SSM architectures is significant for understanding computational limits.

Weaknesses:
- The clarity and organization of the paper could be improved, particularly in distinguishing the main results and providing a clearer structure for the theoretical results.
- Some statements, particularly in theorems and lemmas, are presented informally, making them difficult to interpret.
- The paper contains typographical errors and unclear notation that detract from its overall quality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by clearly delineating the main results and providing a structured overview of the theoretical contributions. Additionally, we suggest that the authors state lemmas and theorems more formally to enhance comprehension. It would also be beneficial to include more detailed proofs and clarify any ambiguous notation. Lastly, we encourage the authors to conduct additional experiments on diverse real-world tasks to strengthen empirical validation and to expand the related work section to include more relevant studies.
