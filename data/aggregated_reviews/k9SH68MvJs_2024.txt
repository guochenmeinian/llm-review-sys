Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Diffusion-Reward Adversarial Imitation Learning (DRAIL), an innovative method that integrates a conditional diffusion model to parameterize the discriminator in Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL). The authors benchmark DRAIL across six environments, demonstrating superior performance in four, comparable results in one, and a lesser result in another. DRAIL shows increased robustness to noise, improved data efficiency, and enhanced generalizability of rewards compared to existing methods, including Behavior Cloning and GAIL.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Clarity: The paper is well-written, with a clear explanation of the proposed method.
- Extensive comparison with DiffAIL, providing a solid foundation for the contributions.
- Methodological novelty: The use of a conditional diffusion model for the discriminator addresses limitations of previous works.
- Significant experimental results: DRAIL's performance improvements in robustness and data efficiency mark a notable advancement in AIL.
- Strong referencing of related prior work, enhancing the context of the research.

Weaknesses:
- The contributions of DRAIL could be better delineated from those of DiffAIL and Diffusion Classifier, as some insights appear to overlap.
- The paper lacks a comprehensive comparison with diffusion-based planning methods, which could provide a more holistic evaluation.
- The advantages of the diffusion discriminative classifier over existing methods are insufficiently explained.
- Missing important AIL baselines, such as DAC and IQLearn, limits the comparative analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the delineation of their contributions by adding a section on DiffAIL and Diffusion Classifier in Section 3 and discussing their limitations in Section 4. This could clarify how DRAIL combines insights from these works. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with diffusion-based planning methods like Diffuser to enhance the evaluation. The authors should also provide a more detailed explanation of the computational requirements and the advantages of their approach over existing methods, as well as conduct ablation studies on hyperparameter sensitivity to strengthen their claims.
