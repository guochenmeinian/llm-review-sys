Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Cross-video Identity-cOrrelating pre-traiNing (CION) framework for person re-identification (ReID), addressing limitations of existing pre-training methods by leveraging identity-invariance across different videos. The authors propose a progressive multi-level denoising strategy and an identity-guided self-distillation loss to enhance representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CION achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer training samples compared to previous methods. The authors also introduce the ReIDZoo model zoo, which includes various pre-trained models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The framework introduces a novel approach to pre-training by explicitly modeling identity invariance across videos, a significant advancement over existing methods.
2. The paper is clearly written, with detailed explanations and effective visual aids.
3. The proposed method shows impressive performance improvements with fewer training samples, demonstrating model-agnostic capabilities.

Weaknesses:
1. The technical contribution is limited, primarily focusing on associating images based on feature similarity, a technique that is not novel and has been widely applied in previous works. The paper lacks an ablation study on hyperparameters, which could affect the method's sensitivity.
2. The reliance on the quality of initial tracking and identity correlation may undermine the method's effectiveness, as inaccuracies in tracking algorithms can impact results.
3. The experiments are primarily conducted on two datasets, Market-1501 and MSMT17, which may not sufficiently demonstrate the model's generalizability across varied conditions. Comparisons with additional methods, such as HAP with ViT-Base, are also lacking.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their technical contributions by exploring more innovative approaches beyond feature similarity for identity association. Additionally, we suggest including an ablation study to analyze the impact of hyperparameters on model performance. To enhance generalizability, the authors should expand their experiments to include datasets that present challenges such as occlusion and clothing changes. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide comparisons with a broader range of existing methods to substantiate their claims of superiority.
