Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Low-Rank Graph Neural Network (LRGNN) designed to model both homophilous and heterophilous graphs through signed propagation. The authors predict the label relationship matrix by solving a robust low-rank matrix approximation problem, resulting in a block diagonal structure with varying distributions of within-class and between-class entries. The approach leverages weak balance theory to support the existence of a global low-rank structure in signed graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LRGNN outperforms baseline methods on both synthetic and real-world graphs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Clarity: The paper is well-structured, easy to follow, and includes visual analyses that enhance understanding.
- Novelty: The low-rank matrix approximation technique for predicting the label relationship matrix is innovative and enhances node representation.
- Quality: The claims are well-supported by theoretical and empirical analyses, including comprehensive experiments.

Weaknesses:
- Assumption of Uniform Distribution: The theoretical foundation assumes uniform node degree distributions, which may not hold in practice, raising questions about the implications for real-world graphs.
- Dependence on Pseudo Labels: The performance of LRGNN is sensitive to the accuracy of generated pseudo labels, necessitating further exploration of its theoretical implications.
- Limited Originality: The paper does not sufficiently differentiate its contributions from existing works like FAGCN and GloGNN, particularly regarding its handling of heterophily.
- Experimental Limitations: Some datasets used for experiments are small or have issues like train-test data leakage, which may affect the significance of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical discussion regarding the implications of the uniform distribution assumption and its relevance to real-world graphs. Additionally, further exploration of the impact of pseudo label accuracy on LRGNN's performance is necessary. To enhance originality, we suggest that the authors provide a more detailed comparison with existing works, particularly FAGCN and GloGNN, to clarify their contributions. Finally, we encourage the authors to address the limitations of the datasets used in experiments and consider incorporating larger, high-quality heterophily datasets for more robust evaluations.
