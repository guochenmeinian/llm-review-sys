### Key Points
This paper presents a new approximation scheme for computing posterior marginals in graphical models, specifically Bayesian networks and Markov networks, utilizing the IBIA (Incremental Build Infer Approximate) framework. The authors propose constructing a sequence of bounded size clique trees, termed a clique tree forest, to compute posterior marginals by selecting appropriate cliques. The experimental evaluation compares the proposed scheme against several state-of-the-art approximation methods based on message passing, demonstrating competitive performance, with some instances showing superior results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well-written and organized, providing sufficient detail on concepts. The empirical evaluation is sound, with clear presentation of results. The proposed method shows promising performance across various benchmarks.

Weaknesses:  
The contribution appears incremental, primarily extending the IBIA framework with a message passing scheme over additional links between adjacent clique trees. The heuristic for choosing links seems arbitrary. The method's sensitivity to the order of factor addition and the initial factor selection is not adequately discussed. Additionally, the paper lacks information on the convergence of the scheme and its time/space complexity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the sensitivity of the proposed method to the order of factor addition and the initial collection of factors. It is crucial to address the convergence properties and time/space complexity of the scheme. Furthermore, we suggest including a deeper discussion on the relationship between the proposed IBIA-based scheme and existing methods, such as the mini-bucket scheme and iterative join-graph propagation. To enhance the empirical evaluation, we recommend comparing the proposed method with more recent variational inference techniques, such as those developed in Alex Ihler's group. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the rationale behind defining clique size in terms of log and to streamline the presentation for better clarity, possibly by including pseudo-code.
