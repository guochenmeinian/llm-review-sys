### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to viral marketing through the formulation of the Dynamic Viral Marketing (DVM) problem, which seeks to achieve a specified adoption goal with minimal budget and dynamic perturbations using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The authors propose the Dynamic Gradient Influencing (DGI) framework, targeting low-budget, high-influence non-adopters and employing gradient ranking to identify optimal perturbations. The evaluation demonstrates DGI's effectiveness on real-world datasets, achieving significant performance improvements.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of the DVM problem and the DGI framework represents a significant contribution to the field of viral marketing.
2. The DGI framework effectively identifies and influences key non-adopters, addressing issues of data scarcity.
3. Comprehensive evaluations show promising performance gains over baseline methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The computational complexity of DGI with respect to network size is unclear, raising concerns about scalability.
2. The evaluation is primarily based on small-scale datasets, which may limit the generalizability of the findings.
3. The selection of hyperparameters lacks clarity, with no guidelines provided for determining optimal values across different datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction and related work sections to make the paper more accessible to a broader audience, including marketing professionals. It would be beneficial to provide high-level explanations of key concepts earlier in the paper. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the role of attributes and the concept of "dynamic" in the context of DVM. More detailed explanations of Figures 1 and 2 are warranted, as well as a visual comparison of the proposed method against baseline methods in Figure 5. Finally, we encourage the authors to address the concerns regarding the generalizability of the model and the sufficiency of the datasets used for evaluation.
