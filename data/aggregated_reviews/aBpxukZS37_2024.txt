Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach called DiffusionPID to analyze uniqueness, redundancy, and synergy in text-to-image diffusion models using partial information decomposition (PID). The authors demonstrate how this method can uncover gender and ethnicity biases in image generation. Extensive experiments validate the technique's utility for identifying biases, understanding model errors, and enhancing model interpretability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a clear motivation and extensive visualizations.
- The adaptation of PID to a tractable diffusion model measure is elegant, incorporating nontrivial twists.
- The approach provides a valuable direction for analyzing semantic bias in image generation and offers interpretability for complex linguistic features.

Weaknesses:
- There are potential issues with Equation 2, as the left parts are identical while the right parts differ.
- The analysis lacks exploration of more complex text prompt scenarios, particularly interactions between objects and their attributes.
- The uniqueness figures in section 6.5.1 are not convincing and do not clearly convey information.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Equation 2 to resolve any discrepancies. Additionally, please provide a more detailed analysis of the efficiency of the proposed approach. To enhance the impact of the work, consider exploring more complex text conditions that reflect the training data distribution. Finally, we suggest including a demo for readers to test the approach themselves, which would strengthen the evaluation of its effectiveness.
