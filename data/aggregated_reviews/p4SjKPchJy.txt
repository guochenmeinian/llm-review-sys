Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical study on saddle point avoidance in stochastic gradient algorithms on Riemannian manifolds, specifically through the introduction of Riemannian Robbins-Monro (RRM) schemes. The authors prove that these schemes can avoid strict saddle points, paralleling results known in Euclidean optimization under certain conditions. The analysis employs the Nash embedding theorem to model RRM within a Euclidean stochastic approximation framework, demonstrating that RRM schemes can escape saddle points with a probability of 1.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and structured, making it accessible to readers with theoretical training.
- It addresses a timely and significant topic in Riemannian optimization, contributing valuable insights into saddle point avoidance.
- The originality of the analysis, particularly the application of the Nash embedding theorem, is commendable and may inform future developments in Riemannian optimization methods.

Weaknesses:
- The lack of empirical validation weakens the paper; minimal experiments would enhance understanding of RSGD behavior on common manifolds.
- Certain assumptions regarding optimization theory need clearer articulation in one location to gauge their limitations effectively.
- The paper's introduction and early sections could be more concise, as they take too long to reach the main results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including a minimal empirical study to illustrate RSGD behavior on common manifolds, particularly cases that confirm or challenge the theoretical findings. Additionally, consider consolidating the optimization-theoretic assumptions into a single section for clarity, possibly under a new paragraph titled "Key Assumptions." The authors should also simplify the introduction by reducing the number of examples and moving results earlier in the paper. Furthermore, we suggest reframing statements about the intricacy of the analysis to focus on specific elements that contribute to its complexity. Lastly, addressing the questions raised regarding the assumptions and the implications of the RRM scheme would enhance the paper's depth.
