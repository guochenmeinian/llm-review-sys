Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Hierarchical Integration Diffusion Model (HI-Diff) for realistic image deblurring, utilizing diffusion models to generate multiscale priors in a compact latent space. The proposed method integrates these priors hierarchically into the deblurring process, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The authors conduct comprehensive experiments and ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance and effectively integrates diffusion models into the deblurring process.
- The ablation study is thorough, and the paper is well-organized and easy to understand.
- The authors provide extensive quantitative and qualitative comparisons, revealing the promising performance of HI-Diff.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a detailed discussion on the differences between HI-Diff and DiffIR, with concerns that the novelty may be limited to the use of multi-scale latent priors.
- There is insufficient comparison with other diffusion models, and the rationale for using diffusion models instead of deterministic priors is unclear.
- The analysis of the latent compression and its hyperparameters is inadequate, and the paper does not provide latency comparisons, which are important for low-level tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion regarding the differences between HI-Diff and DiffIR, clarifying the novelty of their approach. Additionally, the authors should include comparisons with re-trained DiffIR and other diffusion models to strengthen their experimental results. It would be beneficial to analyze the effectiveness of the latent compression and provide latency comparisons to further demonstrate the method's efficiency. Lastly, expanding qualitative experiments to include more real blurry datasets would enhance the robustness of their findings.
