### Key Points
This paper presents a graph-based learning approach to jointly learn socio-semantic representations of the opposing "Black Lives Matter" and "Blue Lives Matter" movements through tweets. The authors define perspectives using Morality Frames theory, capturing dichotomies of actor/target and sentiment. A multi-relational graph is constructed, incorporating various relationships, and a self-learning loop is employed to augment the training set with consistent tweets. The authors propose a "weakly supervised" method using GPT-3 to generate synthetic training data, which is evaluated against human-labeled data. The framework demonstrates superior F1 scores compared to multitask RoBERTa, with ablation tests confirming the contributions of the graph representation, author network, and self-learning loop.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work addresses a significant contemporary issue of understanding polarized political movements in social media.
- The methodology is innovative, effectively combining multiple prediction tasks within a unified graph-based framework.
- The model shows strong performance, outperforming baselines and demonstrating improvements from various methodological aspects.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on a proprietary black-box LLM for generating synthetic training data raises ethical concerns and questions about reproducibility.
- The assumptions of the self-learning loop may limit insights, as they do not account for ambiguous or neutral stances.
- The dataset is heavily skewed, which may compromise the validity of the conclusions drawn.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation of weak supervision by providing more realistic prompts for tweet generation. Additionally, clarifying how the synthetic data is categorized into pro-Black Lives Matter and pro-Blue Lives Matter would enhance transparency. The authors should consider addressing the limitations of their binary stance classification by incorporating mechanisms to handle neutral or ambiguous tweets. Finally, we suggest that the authors provide clearer explanations of the self-learning process, particularly regarding the relationship between the number of steps and epochs.
