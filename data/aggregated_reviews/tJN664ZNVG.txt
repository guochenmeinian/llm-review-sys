Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ORDER, an offline reinforcement learning (RL) solution designed for partially observable environments where agents have access to full states during training but only masked observations during deployment. The authors propose a three-step approach: training a state encoder for discrete representations, training an RL agent with IQL on the offline dataset with blocked state dimensions, and developing a proxy state encoder for estimating current discrete representations during deployment. The authors also explore the impact of discrete code dimensionality on model performance, demonstrating through ablation studies that increasing the number of discrete codes generally enhances performance, with diminishing returns beyond 40 codes. Experimental results across various MuJoCo testbeds and datasets confirm that ORDER outperforms baseline methods and aligns better with ground truth representations, showcasing the versatility of their framework in accommodating a range of masked observation functions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is clearly written, with effective figures summarizing the algorithm's main ideas and well-organized mathematical symbols.
2. The proposed solution is sound and novel, particularly the use of discrete representations, which enhances robustness and performance in the RL agent.
3. The ablation studies provide robust evidence of the model's performance under varying conditions, showcasing its adaptability.
4. The extension of experiments to multiple datasets strengthens the generalizability of the findings.
5. The authors effectively clarify the applicability of their framework to diverse scenarios of partial observability.
6. The methodology for ensuring discrete states are sufficient for control through reconstruction and hyperparameter flexibility is well-articulated.

Weaknesses:
1. The related work section lacks depth and organization, failing to summarize prior works effectively and provide necessary references.
2. The argument regarding the discrete state representation as a sufficient statistic lacks clarity and may not convincingly demonstrate its effectiveness across different environments.
3. The experimental section could benefit from additional clarity regarding the performance improvements attributed to discrete representations versus IQL's effectiveness in discrete state spaces.
4. The assumption of access to full states during training remains a significant concern, as it may not reflect all practical scenarios.
5. The design approach for heterogeneous state factors lacks specificity, which may limit its effectiveness.
6. There is insufficient discussion on computational resource consumption, potential negative societal impacts, and licensing.
7. Minor issues include typographical errors and the need for clearer explanations regarding the choice of discrete representations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors improve the related work section by summarizing prior works with a taxonomy and ensuring appropriate references are included.
2. We suggest presenting more ablation results to clarify the impact of different configurations, such as the effects of grouping dimensions and varying the number of discrete codes in the VQ-VAE.
3. We advise the authors to append details on computational resource consumption, potential negative societal impacts, and licensing information.
4. We encourage the authors to address minor typographical errors and provide clearer explanations about the rationale for using discrete representations earlier in the paper.
5. We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the argument regarding the discrete state representation as a sufficient statistic or information state, ensuring that its advantages are convincingly articulated across various environments.
6. We suggest that the authors explicitly acknowledge and discuss the limitations of their approach concerning other forms of partial observability, enhancing the manuscript's depth and rigor.
7. We recommend that the authors refine their design approach to address heterogeneous state factors more specifically, potentially by employing tailored state encoders for different data modalities, such as CNNs for image data, MLPs for vector-based data, and transformers for text-based data. This could enhance the model's adaptability and effectiveness across diverse scenarios.
8. We strongly advise the authors to consider open-sourcing their code upon acceptance or next submission of the paper.
