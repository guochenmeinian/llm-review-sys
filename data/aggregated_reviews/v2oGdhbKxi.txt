Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a unified framework for monocular 3D object detection applicable to both vehicle and infrastructure scenarios. The authors propose a novel optimization target called normalized depth, which accounts for variations in camera pitch angles and focal lengths, and develop a 3D normalized cube depth of obstacles to enhance depth learning. Extensive experiments on datasets such as Rope3D, DAIR-V2X-I, and KITTI demonstrate promising results, particularly on the infrastructure side.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The main idea is clear and the paper is well-written.
2. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on infrastructure datasets, specifically Rope3D and DAIR-V2X-I, and competitive results on the vehicle side with the KITTI dataset.
3. Code will be open-sourced, promoting further research and development.

Weaknesses:
1. The method does not generalize well to the vehicle side, achieving only about 16 AP on KITTI compared to existing models that exceed 17 AP.
2. Evaluation is limited to KITTI, which contains only 7K images; testing on larger datasets like nuScenes and Waymo is necessary to validate effectiveness for vehicle detection.
3. The pitch-based depth normalization appears detrimental to vehicle-centric detection, and the effectiveness of the cube design remains uncertain with larger datasets.
4. Key details regarding the assumptions of known pitch angles and focal lengths during inference are unclear, potentially undermining the claim of a unified detection pipeline.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalization of their model to the vehicle side by conducting additional experiments on larger datasets such as nuScenes and Waymo. It is crucial to clarify the assumptions regarding pitch angles and focal lengths in the model's inference process. Furthermore, we suggest providing a more detailed explanation of the rationale behind the design of the normalized depth and cube depth, as well as addressing the implications of approximating v_p with v_c. Lastly, including comparisons with stronger existing methods in the related works section would enhance the paper's completeness.
