Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an auditing tool for two LAION datasets, focusing on the correlation between dataset size, data quality, and the prevalence of hateful content. The authors argue that as datasets scale, the incidence of hate speech increases, potentially impacting model performance. They propose to examine the impact of annotation on scaling versus model performance, although they acknowledge this is outside the current paper's scope. The authors discuss the use of the pysentimiento model for detecting three measures of hate speech: hateful, targeted, and aggressive, and plan to include a description of these measures in the final version. They emphasize the need for auditing tools in the context of generative AI and highlight the importance of open-source code for transparency and reproducibility.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a timely and significant issue regarding the impact of data scaling on model performance and societal implications.
2. It provides a unique analysis of hateful content in multimodal datasets, connecting image content with accompanying captions.
3. The use of pysentimiento allows for multiple scoring metrics, enhancing the analysis of hate speech.
4. The paper is well-structured, demonstrating clear results.

Weaknesses:
1. The authors do not adequately demonstrate how the presence of hate speech affects model performance, lacking a direct analysis of data quality versus size.
2. The reliance on tools like pysentimiento raises concerns about the accuracy of hate speech detection, as they may mislabel content.
3. The justification for selecting pysentimiento is insufficient, and there are concerns regarding the validity of dataset comparisons due to size differences.
4. The paper primarily focuses on linguistic components, neglecting the visual aspects of multimodal datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the demonstration of how the presence of hate speech in datasets impacts model performance by analyzing whether removing problematic data leads to performance improvements. Additionally, the authors should clarify the effects of annotation on scaling versus model performance, even if briefly, to enrich the paper's scope. It would be beneficial to reference the work of Dr. Emily Bender and Dr. Timnit Gebru regarding data collection issues, as it supports their claims. Furthermore, the authors should explicitly define what constitutes hateful, targeted, and aggressive content in their measures. Lastly, we suggest addressing the limitations of the tools used for hate speech detection, providing a clearer justification for the selection of pysentimiento, and ensuring proper citations for all utilized packages, including proba.
