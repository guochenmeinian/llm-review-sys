Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel part-based algorithm for 3D novel class discovery (NCD) called Decompose Novel Into Known parts (DNIK). The authors identify that existing methods are biased towards known classes, which hinders generalization to novel classes. DNIK constructs a part concept bank from known objects to facilitate the composition of both known and novel objects, employing three regularizations to prevent part bank collapse. The authors clarify their experimental setup, which involves a labeled dataset of known classes and an unlabeled dataset containing shapes from novel classes during training. They acknowledge that their current setting is less generalized than the full generalized category discovery (GCD) formulation but assert that it remains valid for novel class discovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate DNIK's effectiveness compared to existing 2D NCD literature, and the authors emphasize the importance of developing flexible visual intelligence capable of recognizing novel classes in real-world applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper builds on established part-based models in visual recognition, showing significant improvements over holistic representations in 2D category discovery methods, which aids in identifying and grouping new classes.
- The writing is clear and accessible, allowing for reproducibility by experienced engineers.
- Claims are well-supported by experiments on real-world datasets, with particularly interesting insights in Sec 3.1 and Fig. 4.a.
- The paper addresses a significant problem in 3D recognition by focusing on part-based representations and feature bias, providing a clear rationale for the relevance of GCD in practical scenarios.
- Experimental results demonstrate superior performance of their method under the GCD setting, indicating its effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The setup is considered outdated, lacking a discussion on why it is not suited for generalized category discovery, as seen in relevant literature.
- The toy example in Sec. 3.1 is criticized for not fairly representing the problem, as some unknown objects lack commonalities with known classes, raising questions about the severity of the "overfitting to known classes" issue.
- The authors' initial misunderstanding of the GCD training process may lead to confusion regarding their experimental setup.
- The rationale for using supervised contrastive loss to learn part features is unclear, particularly regarding its application to "shape" features rather than "part" features.
- The reliance on stronger 3D features may overshadow the contributions of their method, raising questions about the extent of improvement due to novel information discovery versus feature extraction.
- Missing experiments to quantify the impact of regularizations on part features, particularly regarding the diversity loss and its potential to cause feature collapse.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the relevance of their setup in relation to generalized category discovery and provide a comparison with existing work to justify their approach. Additionally, we suggest revising the toy example in Sec. 3.1 to ensure it accurately reflects the problem's complexity. Improving the clarity of the experimental setup by explicitly detailing how they handle the unlabeled dataset containing both known and unknown classes would also be beneficial. Clarifying the motivation behind using supervised contrastive loss and providing experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of regularizations on part features would strengthen the paper. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide more qualitative results to illustrate the discussed terms and visualize how learned parts change over time. Finally, addressing the limitations of the current dataset size and exploring potential applications beyond recognition would enhance the manuscript's impact.
