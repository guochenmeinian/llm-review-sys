Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical exploration of the expressive power of Probabilistic Circuits (PCs), specifically comparing tree-structured PCs and those with directed acyclic graph (DAG) structures. The authors demonstrate that DAGs are strictly more powerful, as they can express certain polynomials with polynomial-sized PCs, while tree PCs require super-polynomial size under a depth constraint of \(o(\log n)\). Additionally, the paper shows that DAG-structured PCs can be transformed into tree PCs of sub-exponential size. The work contributes novel theoretical insights into the bounds of these structures.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-motivated, organized, and logically coherent.
- It provides novel theoretical contributions regarding lower and upper bounds for PCs.
- The results are significant for the study of PCs, particularly in demonstrating the depth-reduction algorithm's preservation of decomposability.

Weaknesses:
- The lower bound's depth constraint \(o(\log n)\) limits practical implications, as shallow tree PCs are rarely needed.
- Some presentation aspects could be improved, such as inconsistent notation for nodes and unclear definitions, particularly in Algorithm 1 regarding \(m_2\).
- The applicability of the findings to structure learning in PCs is questionable, as practical challenges remain unaddressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their notation to ensure consistency, particularly regarding the symbols used for nodes. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the relationship between the decomposability of PCs and the depth constraint discussed. It would also be beneficial to provide insights on how this work can advance research in PC structure learning, addressing practical challenges such as learning objectives and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the implications of their findings for managing trade-offs between computational costs, expressiveness, and circuit size.
