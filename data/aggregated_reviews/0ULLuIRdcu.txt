### Key Points
This paper presents a classification model named ClimateBERT-NetZero, which is designed to detect and assess net zero and reduction targets in text. The authors introduce a dataset comprising 3.5k text samples labeled as Net-Zero, Reduction, or No Target. Empirical results indicate that ClimateBERT outperforms baseline models. The research also outlines two use cases for extracting and analyzing climate commitments, emphasizing the rising trend in net-zero discussions since 2019.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper proposes a novel task and valuable dataset in a nascent field, addressing the detection of net-zero claims, which is timely and significant.  
- Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the ClimateBERT model, and the authors plan to release the dataset and models for broader research use.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks detailed discussions on the data creation process, including quality control measures and the nature of expert annotators.  
- There is insufficient exploration of the motivations behind the task design and the implications of greenwashing, which detracts from the overall depth of the analysis.  
- The contributions feel somewhat incremental, with a heavy focus on dataset introduction rather than novel methodological advancements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and detail of the data creation process, including the inter-annotator agreement and the nature of the expert annotators. Additionally, we suggest providing a more comprehensive discussion on the motivations behind the task design and the implications of greenwashing typologies. Including sample texts from the dataset and enhancing the framing of the work in relation to prior climate NLP studies would also strengthen the manuscript. Finally, addressing the questions raised regarding data distribution, preprocessing effects, and model performance metrics will enhance the paper's rigor and transparency.
