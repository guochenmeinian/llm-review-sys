### Key Points
This paper presents strategies to challenge the stereotypical implications of hateful language, proposing six specific strategies to counteract hate speech. The authors conducted a user study to evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies and compared their usage in human-generated versus machine-generated counter-speech datasets. The findings indicate that human-written counterarguments are more specific and convincing than those generated by machines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.  
- The proposed strategies are sound and well-grounded, providing a valuable foundation for future studies.  
- The extensive analysis of counterarguments and the comparison between human and machine-generated responses contribute significantly to the field of NLP-enabled counterspeech.  

Weaknesses:  
- The small size of the human-annotated dataset (only 200 samples) limits the potential for future model development and undermines the robustness of the classification results, which show f1-scores between 0.55-0.70.  
- The rationale for assuming annotators as content moderators is not adequately justified, and the variability in moderation rules across different communities is not considered.  
- The operationalization of "convincingness" lacks clarity and may not align with the context of counter-speech moderation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for assuming annotators as content moderators by providing clear standards or guidelines that moderators follow. Additionally, the authors should clarify how they define "convincingness" and ensure that this definition is consistent throughout the paper. To enhance the robustness of their findings, we suggest increasing the dataset size to improve classifier performance and critically discussing the implications of low classification accuracy on their analyses. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide more details on the selection process for the groups analyzed and the number of samples used in their experiments.
