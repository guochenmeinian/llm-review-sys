Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the "Multimodal Universe," a large-scale multimodal dataset derived from various astronomical datasets, which includes 70TB of multi-channel hyperspectral images, spectra, and multivariate time series. The authors provide a preview of the dataset on HuggingFace and make the code for dataset construction available on GitHub, including utilities for generating custom multimodal datasets. The paper discusses the dataset's characteristics, potential applications in machine learning tasks, and includes experimental results demonstrating its utility.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is extensive and encompasses multiple modalities, potentially accelerating scientific discovery in astronomy.
- The authors propose a self-supervised method, Contrastive Image-Spectrum Pretraining, which has shown effectiveness.
- The paper is well-written, with detailed supplementary materials and a clear outline of the data creation process.

Weaknesses:
- The data curation strategy lacks clarity on how standardized formats are enforced and maintained.
- The description of multimodal cross-matching utilities is insufficient, leaving questions about their usability and extensibility.
- The role of the proposed dataset in enabling or improving machine learning tasks requires further clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the description of how they impose and ensure standardized data formats in their curation strategy. Additionally, the authors should provide a detailed explanation of the cross-matching utilities and their usability for end-users. It is also essential to clarify whether the example machine learning tasks were previously impossible or if the "Multimodal Universe" enhances model performance, including comparisons with models that do not utilize this dataset. Furthermore, addressing the writing quality and organizational structure of the paper would enhance clarity and presentation. Lastly, incorporating modern computer vision architectures and evaluating cross-source transfer for tasks would strengthen the submission.
