### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of overfitting behaviors in two-hidden-layer ReLU networks, specifically examining benign and tempered overfitting in relation to input dimension and training sample size. The authors propose that benign overfitting occurs when the input dimension grows faster than the number of training samples, while tempered overfitting is characterized by non-optimal performance that degrades with increased noise levels. Theoretical results are provided for the excess risk of interpolating networks, and empirical validation is included to support the findings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a novel theoretical analysis of tempered overfitting in two-layer ReLU networks, which has not been previously explored in standard finite-width neural networks.
- The authors effectively connect theoretical results to empirical observations, providing clear proof outlines and accessible explanations.
- The study includes a comprehensive examination of the relationship between input dimension, sample size, and overfitting types, with intriguing results regarding the role of bias in networks.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical results rely on assumptions that may not reflect common deep learning practices, particularly regarding the input dimension relative to the number of training samples.
- There is a lack of discussion on the implications of the assumptions made in the theoretical setup, particularly concerning the generalizability of results to more complex architectures or data distributions.
- The paper could benefit from a concluding section to summarize findings and suggest future research directions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the assumptions underlying their theoretical results, particularly in relation to their realism in practical deep learning scenarios. Additionally, we suggest including a dedicated conclusion section to tie the results to real-world applications and outline potential next steps for research. Clarifying the necessity of the simplifying assumptions regarding label noise and exploring the implications of network width in more realistic settings would also enhance the paper's impact.
