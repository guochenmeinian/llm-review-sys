### Key Points
This paper presents the task of Entity-Centric Question Generation (ECQG), proposing a framework called GenCONE that utilizes focus locating and question verification modules to generate entity-centric questions. The authors reconstruct the SQuAD 2.0 dataset to create a task-specific dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of GenCONE through experiments, showing notable performance improvements over existing question generation baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an interesting problem and presents a clear structure.
- It proposes a novel task and reconstructs an existing dataset, which may be beneficial for future research.
- The empirical evaluation shows that GenCONE outperforms both question-agnostic QG baselines and pretrained seq2seq models.

Weaknesses:
- The claim that ECQG is a new task is inaccurate, as prior studies have explored similar concepts.
- The proposed approach lacks novelty, relying on established methods in the QG field.
- Experimental results are insufficient, with only intrinsic evaluation conducted on one dataset; coherence evaluation and human evaluation are necessary.
- The constructed dataset lacks analysis, particularly regarding the strict constraints imposed on question generation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by expanding the human evaluation study to provide a more extensive analysis of the entity-centric nature of GenCONE and its improvements over baselines. Additionally, we suggest adding quantitative results for benchmarking the ECQG dataset against large language models like ChatGPT and GPT-4 to enhance the evaluation of the proposed approach.
