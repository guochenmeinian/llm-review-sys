### Key Points
This paper presents a study on summarizing scientific abstracts into journalistic-style news articles for a public audience. The authors propose a new dataset, SciTechNews, which encompasses a broader range of domains than existing datasets. They also introduce a methodology that utilizes discourse structure and metadata, generating a plan before creating the summary, which shows improvements in quality. Comprehensive analyses highlight stylistic differences between scientific abstracts and press summaries, providing insights for future research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The construction of a new dataset beneficial for the research community.
- Meticulous analysis in Section 3.2, illuminating the differences in style between genres.
- Promising results from the proposed method, evaluated against various baselines and LLMs.
- The paper is well-written and structured, enhancing readability.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution of using meta information is weak, primarily relying on author names and affiliations.
- The motivation behind the two-step framework lacks clarity, particularly regarding the utility of generating a plan prior to the summary.
- Concerns about factuality, as the proposed system scores lower than GPT-3.5, warrant further discussion and error analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for the two-step framework, providing more analysis on the benefits of generating a plan first. Additionally, addressing the weak contribution of meta information by expanding its role in the summarization process could enhance the paper. Finally, we suggest including a discussion on the tradeoff between quality and factuality, along with an error analysis of factuality shortcomings, to strengthen the paper's contributions.
