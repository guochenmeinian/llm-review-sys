Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a lightweight approach for generating neural architectures that are robust to diverse perturbations through Neural Architecture Search (NAS). The authors propose a "zero-cost proxy" called CRoZe, which evaluates consistency across features, parameters, and gradients of clean and perturbed images. The method is empirically validated on small-scale datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet16-120, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing robust architectures. The authors assert that their proxy can learn invariant features from both clean and perturbed images, supported by experimental results showing high correlation with robust accuracies across multiple adversarial training methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The focus on developing architectures robust to a diverse range of perturbations is novel and relevant to the ML community.
- The proposed method is simple yet effective, as evidenced by extensive experimental results demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying robust architectures with significantly lower search costs.
- The paper is well-structured, with clear figures that effectively convey the intended message.
- The method shows high average robust accuracy against multiple adversarial attacks, indicating its potential for practical applications.

Weaknesses:
- The clarity of several paragraphs and legends is lacking, leading to confusion about terms like CC Accuracy and HRS accuracy.
- The theoretical insights behind the proposed consistency score and the claims of generalization to diverse perturbations are unclear and require further clarification.
- The experimental validation is limited, primarily relying on FGSM, which is considered a less effective adversarial attack, and lacks comparisons with well-known architectures like ResNet and human-made architectures.
- More comprehensive experiments on contemporary adversarial attacks are needed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by defining all terms and metrics, particularly CC Accuracy and HRS accuracy, in the introduction. Additionally, we urge the authors to clarify the theoretical insights, particularly the rationale behind the proxy's ability to generalize across various perturbations. Expanding the experimental validation to include comparisons with established architectures and a broader range of adversarial attacks, such as AutoAttack, would strengthen the paper's contributions. Conducting ablation studies on different weight initialization and adversarial training methods is also suggested to bolster the claims made. Lastly, we recommend proofreading the manuscript to correct unclear phrases and grammatical errors.
