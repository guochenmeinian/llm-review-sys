Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel backdoor attack paradigm, termed IPR Backdoor, for Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents, addressing the security risks posed by these agents in sensitive environments. The authors propose an object-aware backdoor attack that embeds triggers during training, enabling the agent to execute abnormal behaviors upon encountering specific objects during navigation while maintaining normal operation otherwise. Key contributions include the IPR Backdoor's development, extensive experimental validation, and demonstration of robustness against various visual and textual variations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors propose a new backdoor attack method on VLN tasks, which performs well.
2. The paper is well-written, clearly presenting the motivation and method design.
3. Extensive information is provided in the appendix, supporting the findings.

Weaknesses:
1. The definition of "physical" in experiments is limited to "pasting a physical object into an image," rather than sampling in the physical world.
2. There is a lack of horizontal comparison with other backdoor attack methods.
3. The action space is based on the current state, which is atypical in reinforcement learning; clarification on this aspect is needed.
4. The impact of poison ratios on training data is not adequately addressed, particularly the high 20% ratio.
5. The related work section lacks discussion on backdoor defense techniques for multi-modal models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the definition of "physical" to encompass real-world sampling rather than just image manipulation. Additionally, we suggest including a horizontal comparison with other backdoor attack methods to strengthen the paper's contributions. Clarifying the rationale behind the variable action space and providing insights on the impact of different poison ratios would enhance the paper's rigor. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to expand the related work section to include backdoor defense techniques relevant to multi-modal models. Lastly, a broader discussion on the societal impacts and ethical considerations of the proposed method should be included.
