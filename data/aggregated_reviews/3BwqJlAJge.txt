### Key Points
This paper presents the Information Guided Preference Chain (IMPEC) to address the issue of reward confusion in reinforcement learning. The authors propose a novel technique for enforcing transitivity of preferences during reward learning, utilizing a Bayesian neural network to rank agent trajectories by information gain for constructing an efficient set of trajectories. The concept of reward confusion is introduced, highlighting the challenges in learning causal relationships in preference learning, with the hypothesis that a full ordered chain of preferences may alleviate this issue.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The approach to enforcing transitivity of preferences is novel and of significant interest to the research community. The comprehensive analysis, including ablation studies and a graph-theoretical evaluation of the preference dataset, is commendable. 

Weaknesses:  
The paper lacks precise details on the IMPEC algorithm, particularly regarding the pseudocode that references subroutines like “SupervisedTrain” and “DerivePreferences,” which are not adequately described. The variable names in the pseudocode do not align with those in the text, complicating implementation. Additionally, the results in Table 1 do not clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of IMPEC in addressing reward confusion, and the introduction of spurious behavior in the Confusing Minigrid scenarios raises concerns about robustness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the IMPEC algorithm by providing detailed descriptions of the subroutines mentioned in the pseudocode. Aligning variable names in the pseudocode with those in the text will enhance comprehension. To strengthen the evaluation of IMPEC, we suggest conducting a more targeted analysis by increasing the amount of spurious information in the CMG environment. Additionally, addressing the minor issues, such as the typos and notation inaccuracies, will improve the overall quality of the paper.
