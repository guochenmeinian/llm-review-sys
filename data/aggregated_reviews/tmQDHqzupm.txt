### Key Points
This paper presents a hypergraph-based zero-shot multi-modal model for extracting product attribute-value pairs, addressing the challenge of identifying attributes for new products without historical data. The authors utilize CLIP encoders to integrate multi-modal information, enabling effective hyperlink prediction between unseen product nodes and attribute-value nodes. Experimental results on the MAVE dataset indicate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art generative multi-modal language models in zero-shot learning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles a significant real-world challenge in e-commerce, enhancing product search and recommendation systems.
- The proposed method shows strong zero-shot learning capabilities and computational efficiency, with promising results across multiple product categories.
- The motivation for the study is clear, and the novelty of the approach is commendable.

Weaknesses:
- Some tables lack a bottom line, and variance data is missing in Table 2.
- The evaluation does not adequately address seen attribute values, and important related works on knowledge graph-based zero-shot learning are overlooked.
- The details regarding hypergraph construction and the proposed model's mechanics require further elaboration.
- Scalability concerns regarding hypergraph construction and message-passing mechanisms for large datasets are not sufficiently discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the problem formulation in Section 3.1, particularly regarding the input and output of the task. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the motivations by incorporating comparisons with related works, such as [TCSS24] and [MM24]. The authors should elaborate on the hypergraph construction details, especially the types of hyperlinks, and consider advanced objectives like hyperlink prediction. To enrich the experimental results, we encourage the inclusion of comparisons with HyperPAVE, an ablation study on the effectiveness of text data, and case studies demonstrating hyperlink prediction accuracy. Finally, addressing scalability concerns in the context of large datasets and providing code and data availability would strengthen the paper's contribution.
