### Key Points
This paper presents the concept of "perennial" Data Terms of Use (DToU) to enhance user control over data in a decentralized web environment. The authors propose a formal policy language that allows users and applications to specify DToU policies, covering permissions and obligations, with automated reasoning for compliance verification. The solution leverages semantic web technology and integrates with the Solid framework, aiming to facilitate data usage negotiation with minimal user effort.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposal addresses a significant challenge in decentralized web applications.
- The integration of the DToU policy language into the Community Solid Server is a notable contribution.
- The paper includes a comparative analysis of related policy languages and provides experimental evaluations.

Weaknesses:
- The scientific problem addressed is unclear, with the proposal appearing project-specific rather than broadly applicable.
- The evaluation lacks assessments of the language's expressiveness and privacy/security guarantees.
- Figures, particularly Figure 3, are difficult to read, and the language design lacks formal definitions.
- Usability studies and real-world use cases are not adequately addressed, raising questions about the practical applicability of the DToU.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by providing formal definitions of the DToU policy language and reasoning tasks within the paper. Additionally, the authors should enhance the usability of the proposed concept by conducting user studies to demonstrate its practical application for data and application providers. We suggest clarifying the relationship between Table 1 and the state-of-the-art description, as well as addressing the limitations of using RDF surfaces for the DToU. Lastly, we encourage the authors to consider integrating or extending existing languages like ODRL to avoid redundancy and improve expressiveness.
