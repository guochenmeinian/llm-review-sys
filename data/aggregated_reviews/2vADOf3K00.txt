Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for adapting pre-trained raw video models to compressed videos through a prompt-tuning approach named Compressed Video Prompt Tuning (CVPT). The authors propose using motion vectors and residuals as prompts to enhance cross-modal interactions, achieving promising results with a minimal number of trainable parameters. The study demonstrates that fine-tuning only 0.1 percent of parameters can effectively modify the model for video classification tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written, clearly demonstrating its motivation and methodology.  
- The innovative use of motion vectors and residuals as prompts is computationally advantageous.  
- Experimental results indicate that CVPT outperforms full fine-tuning and other prompt-tuning methods on several datasets.  

Weaknesses:  
- The evaluation benchmarks used are small-scale, raising concerns about the scalability of the proposed method.  
- Some key component designs lack justification, and certain figures are confusing.  
- The paper does not provide sufficient comparisons with state-of-the-art methods or detail the computational costs and efficiency metrics.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the design and justification for key components, particularly regarding the integration of motion vectors and residuals. Additionally, the experimental setup in the ablation study should be made clearer, and the authors should provide detailed comparisons of computational costs (GFLOPs) and inference times against previous works. It would also be beneficial to include results from larger datasets to strengthen the claims of scalability and effectiveness.
