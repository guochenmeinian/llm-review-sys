Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SelectAL, an algorithm that addresses the selection of active learning methods under varying labeling budgets. It is the first work to automatically determine selection strategies based on budget regimes in active learning. The authors provide both theoretical and empirical support for their derivative-based test method, demonstrating its effectiveness across different datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-50.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper tackles an important issue in active learning by determining selection strategies based on budget.
2. The experimental results consistently show performance improvements, supporting the claims made.

Weaknesses:
1. Several assumptions in the theoretical framework may not be realistic, particularly regarding universality and the uniqueness of $B_{eq}$.
2. The connection between theoretical results and practical methods is weak, leading to difficulties in following the paper's flow.
3. The writing and structure require improvement for clarity, especially regarding the data removal process and the algorithm's motivation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the theoretical analysis and its connection to the practical implementation of SelectAL. Specifically, provide more intuitive explanations for the assumptions, such as the physical meaning of $E_{low}(x)=E_{high}(\alpha x)$. Additionally, clarify the data removal process and discuss why TypiClust and inverse-TypiClust are effective in predicting budget scenarios. We also suggest including more budget settings in experiments and addressing the scalability of the method for real-world applications. Lastly, consider providing a clearer pseudocode for the second part of the algorithm to enhance understanding.
