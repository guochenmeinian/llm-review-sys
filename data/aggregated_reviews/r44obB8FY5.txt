Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for applying strided and transposed convolutions to point cloud data, enabling deterministic operations directly on points. The authors propose a strided convolutional layer with an auxiliary loss to ensure consistent point selection throughout the learning process and develop a lightweight autoencoder network based on this convolutional operator. Experiments are conducted on KIMO3-6 for point cloud reconstruction and ModelNet40 for shape classification, showing some promise in reconstruction tasks but underwhelming results in classification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method for performing strided and transposed convolutions on point clouds is interesting.
2. The related work section provides a comprehensive discussion of existing point cloud CNNs.
3. Figure 3 effectively illustrates point selection during the learning process.
4. Code implementations are included in the supplementary material.

Weaknesses:
1. The writing quality is poor, with long text lacking clear organization, making it difficult to read.
2. Key related work, such as SparseConvNet, is not discussed or compared, which is crucial for evaluating the novelty of the proposed method.
3. The application of the proposed method on Point-M2AE is unclear, and additional experiments across various benchmark settings are necessary to validate its effectiveness.
4. Reported results do not demonstrate a clear advantage over state-of-the-art point CNNs, raising questions about the proposed method's potential.
5. The paper lacks comparisons of FLOPs and latency, which are important for assessing efficiency.
6. The robustness of the model to various transformations and noise is not experimentally tested, which is vital for real-world applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the writing quality by organizing the paper into clearer sections and including illustrative figures for network designs. It is essential to discuss and compare the proposed method with SparseConvNet and SampleNet to evaluate its novelty and effectiveness thoroughly. We suggest conducting additional experiments on various benchmark settings to demonstrate the method's robustness and performance. Furthermore, we recommend including comparisons of FLOPs and latency to provide a comprehensive evaluation of efficiency. Lastly, testing the model's robustness to transformations and noise would enhance its applicability in real-world scenarios.
