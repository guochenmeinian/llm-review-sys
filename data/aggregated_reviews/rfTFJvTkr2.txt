Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Parallel Spiking Neuron (PSN) and its variants, which reformulate neuronal dynamics by removing the reset mechanism and utilizing matrix multiplication for parallel processing. The PSN achieves significant acceleration on digital hardware, particularly GPUs, while maintaining accuracy in various data classification tasks. The authors demonstrate that the PSN can effectively utilize temporal information through fully connected weights, leading to high simulation speeds.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The concept of parallelized neuron implementation is innovative and can be efficiently processed on GPUs.
2. The experiments show strong performance across different datasets, enhancing the technical soundness of spiking neural networks.

Weaknesses:
1. The optimization for GPU may not provide a clear advantage over traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), as GPUs are not ideal for spiking neural networks (SNNs) due to energy inefficiencies.
2. The removal of the reset mechanism may limit the PSN's ability to handle certain dynamics, and the rationale for this removal is not adequately justified.
3. The network architecture presented in Table 2 lacks clarity, and the experiments do not sufficiently reflect the claimed advantages in simulation speed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the network architecture in Table 2 and provide a detailed explanation of the advantages of the PSN regarding simulation speed. Additionally, we suggest including an ablation study comparing PSN and vanilla SNNs on static image datasets to better illustrate performance differences. It would also be beneficial to report the results of the VGG model with parallel neurons for the ImageNet dataset and to clarify how the PSN handles input/weight noise stability. Lastly, we encourage the authors to discuss the limitations of their work and the trade-offs involved with the current vanilla spiking neurons.
