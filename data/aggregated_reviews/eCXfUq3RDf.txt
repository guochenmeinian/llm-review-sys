Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new method for personalized dialogue generation called MIRACLE, which disentangles complex personalities into three attributes (language style, attitude, and mental characteristic) and utilizes an energy-based model (EBM) for generation. The authors propose two new loss terms—aspect classification loss and attribute distance loss—to enhance personalized text generation. Experimental results demonstrate that MIRACLE outperforms several baselines in personality controllability and response generation quality, supported by both automatic and human evaluations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-motivated, addressing the limitations of conventional methods in personalized dialogue generation.
- The proposed approach effectively tackles the issue of sparse persona descriptions, allowing for better control over multiple persona attributes.
- The authors provide a new dialogue corpus and detailed data pipeline, enhancing the study's contributions.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on ChatGPT-generated data raises questions about the necessity of MIRACLE, as it may only be applicable to this specific dataset.
- The performance metrics used for evaluation, particularly the comparison with ChatGPT, lack clarity regarding the training and testing conditions.
- The paper exhibits limited reproducibility due to the absence of shared training data and model checkpoints, making it challenging to verify claims.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their evaluation metrics and provide a detailed analysis of the training and testing conditions for baseline models. Additionally, we suggest releasing the training code, dialogue dataset, and model checkpoints to facilitate reproducibility. An in-depth analysis of the synthetic data's diversity and its ability to capture human dialogue characteristics is also necessary. Finally, simplifying the mathematical complexity and enhancing the paper's readability would benefit the audience's understanding of the core ideas.
