Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to uncertainty estimation for multi-modal data by extending Neural Processes (NPs). The authors propose three key innovations: dynamic context update, multi-modal Bayesian aggregation, and an adaptive radial basis function (RBF) attention mechanism. The method demonstrates superior test accuracy, uncertainty calibration, out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, and robustness across multiple benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses the underexplored area of uncertainty estimation for multi-modal data, which has significant practical implications.
- A comprehensive evaluation is provided through multiple metrics, including accuracy, calibration, OOD detection, and robustness.
- The dynamic context update mechanism is particularly noteworthy, as it replaces uninformative context samples with informative ones based on attention weights and classification difficulty.

Weaknesses:
- While three innovations are presented, only the Bayesian aggregation is inherently linked to multi-modal inputs; the other two components do not leverage multi-modal characteristics, leading to a lack of coherence in contributions.
- The Bayesian aggregation mechanism is not ablated, leaving unclear how much it contributes to overall performance and whether improvements stem from it or the other components.
- Some notation definitions are confusing, making sections difficult to follow, particularly in the context of the proposed algorithm's components.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the technical introduction and the experimental setup to enhance reader comprehension. Specifically, it would be beneficial to provide a more comprehensive explanation of the context memory's necessity and its role in storing training samples. Additionally, we suggest conducting further ablation studies to clarify the contributions of each component to end-to-end performance. It would also be helpful to consolidate a single table for one dataset to directly illustrate the effectiveness of each component in terms of accuracy, uncertainty, and robustness. Finally, addressing the notation issues and enhancing the clarity of sections 3.2 and 4 would significantly improve the paper's presentation.
