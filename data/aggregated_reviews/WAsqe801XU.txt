### Key Points
This paper presents a reinforcement learning (RL) approach for auto-bidding in advertising, focusing on the challenges posed by conservative offline training methods. The authors propose Trajectory-wise Exploration and Exploitation (TEE) to enhance exploration during offline training and Safe Exploration by Adaptive Action Selection (SEAS) to ensure safety during online exploration. The experimental results, including synthetic and real-world evaluations, support the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a significant real-world problem and is well-written, making it easy to follow.  
- The proposed methods, TEE and SEAS, are novel and provide valuable insights into exploration and safety in RL.  
- Comprehensive evaluations, including an ablation study, validate the proposed approach on a real-world platform.  

Weaknesses:  
- Section 6 lacks clarity regarding the reasoning behind solutions to issues raised in Section 5.2, which should be better integrated into the main text.  
- The evaluation relies on a non-standard simulation environment, limiting comparisons with existing approaches.  
- The complexity of the proposed methods may pose challenges for real-world implementation, and the computational overhead and scalability remain unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 6 by integrating the reasoning from the appendix into the main text and providing theoretical justification for their choices. Additionally, consider evaluating the proposed approach against standard benchmarks to enhance comparability. A latency analysis and discussion of the computational overhead associated with the proposed methods would also be beneficial. Finally, we suggest exploring robust alternatives to least squares for trajectory exploitation to better handle outliers in the data.
