### Key Points
This paper presents a study of stochastic optimization with oblivious noise, which may be biased and have unbounded variance, generalizing the heavy-tailed noise setup. The authors assume that the oblivious noise takes the value of $0$ with a probability $\alpha$, interpreted as the fraction of inliers. They prove that when $\alpha \leq 1/2$, finding an approximate stationary point is information-theoretically impossible. To tackle this, the authors introduce list-decoding into stochastic optimization, focusing on identifying a list of points where at least one is an approximate stationary point. The paper establishes an equivalence between list-decodable stochastic optimization with oblivious noise and the list-decodable mean estimation problem, utilizing a technique called noisy location estimation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper investigates an important aspect of stochastic optimization and introduces the concept of list-decodable stochastic optimization, which is both intuitive and theoretically elegant.
- The algorithms and proofs are intricate yet well-organized, making them generally accessible.

Weaknesses:
- The exponential dependence on $1/\eta$ in the list size may affect the scalability and practicality of the results.
- The abstract nature of the framework leads to a lack of clarity regarding the algorithm's performance in specific examples and practical problem domains.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the problem statement and assumptions, particularly regarding the properties of the function $f(\gamma,x)$. Additionally, addressing the exponential dependence on $\eta$ by exploring adjustments to the definition of list-decodable stochastic optimization could enhance the results. Providing more concrete applications of the proposed methods would also strengthen the paper. Lastly, we suggest refining the definitions and methodology in the technical sections for better precision and self-containment.
