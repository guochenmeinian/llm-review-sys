### Key Points
This paper presents a novel strategy to mitigate gender bias in multilingual machine translation (MT) models by employing a "gender-aware contrastive loss" alongside traditional loss functions. The authors propose a straightforward modeling technique that influences the encoder to enhance gender translation accuracy across various target languages, even those not seen during training. The evaluation includes a comprehensive range of language pairs and architectures, demonstrating significant improvements in gender accuracy and translation quality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach effectively reduces gender bias while maintaining translation quality, as evidenced by detailed evaluations and analyses.
- The methodology is clearly explained and includes a robust set of experiments across multiple languages and models.
- The paper provides interesting observations, such as the reliance of certain models on gender stereotypes.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation is limited to English as the source language, which is a significant constraint.
- The focus on encoder-decoder architectures may exclude applicability to recent large language models (LLMs).
- The data selection process lacks clarity, particularly regarding balanced sampling and handling of gendered terms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how gender is represented at the sentence level, particularly in relation to the encoder embeddings. Additionally, the authors should consider discussing the applicability of their technique to decoder architectures. It would be beneficial to include an impact statement addressing the effects of the technique on marginalized groups, such as non-binary individuals. Furthermore, the authors should provide statistical significance testing for their results and clarify the data selection process, including how balanced sampling is achieved. Lastly, addressing the limitations of focusing solely on binary gender would strengthen the paper's contributions.
