Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of linear transformers, demonstrating that each layer maintains a weight vector for implicit linear regression problems, including scenarios with varying noise levels. The authors provide theoretical insights into the gradient behavior in linear attention and validate their findings through experiments, showing that simplified linear attention retains effective gradient descent behavior. The research enhances the understanding of transformer weights and the implicit learning capabilities of attention-based models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The theoretical analysis is sound and provides valuable insights into linear attention behavior.
2. The paper expands the analysis framework from fixed noise linear regression to flexible noise scenarios, addressing more complex problems.
3. Experimental settings effectively validate the mathematical formulations presented.

Weaknesses:
1. The analysis remains confined to linear regression and linear attention with simplified modifications, limiting generalizability to other architectures and contexts.
2. The empirical validation in Section 5.3 is limited, particularly regarding the two-step update pattern, which lacks concrete experiments and visualizations.
3. The incremental nature of the work raises questions about its novelty compared to existing literature.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical validation in Section 5.3 by providing concrete experiments and visualizations to illustrate the two-step update pattern. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explore the implications of full versus diagonal parameterizations more thoroughly, particularly regarding their convergence behavior during training. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the significance of their baselines and address potential practical applications of their findings.
