Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Depth-Wise Graph Neural Network (DepWiGNN) aimed at enhancing multi-hop spatial reasoning in text. The authors address the over-smoothing issue prevalent in classical GNNs by introducing a unique node memory scheme and a Transformed Product Rule (TPR) mechanism, which facilitates memory updating and retrieval through simple arithmetic operations. Experimental results indicate that DepWiGNN outperforms existing spatial reasoning methods across multiple challenging datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a novel GNN modeling approach that effectively incorporates a node memory scheme and TPR mechanism.
- Comprehensive experiments benchmarked against popular LLMs and GNNs, demonstrating strong performance.
- Clear writing and organization, particularly in the methodology section, with detailed explanations of design choices.

Weaknesses:
- Some experiments lack comprehensiveness, such as the absence of breadth-based GNNs in the StepGame experiment.
- Insufficient empirical evidence supporting the claim that DepWiGNN mitigates the over-smoothing issue.
- The methodology can be confusing, with a need for better motivation and organization of the framework's design choices.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology by reorganizing Section 3 to emphasize the challenges of designing a GNN that addresses their motivation, outline the necessary components, and explain how each component addresses these challenges. Additionally, we suggest including a complexity analysis of the BFS search and long dependency collection to address concerns about time and space overhead. Finally, we recommend adding experiments that demonstrate how baseline methods struggle with longer path aggregation and how DepWiGNN effectively circumvents this issue.
