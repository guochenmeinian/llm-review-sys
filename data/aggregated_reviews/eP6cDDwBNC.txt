Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents TRIAGE, a novel data characterization framework specifically designed for regression tasks, addressing a gap in existing methodologies that primarily focus on classification. The authors leverage conformal predictive distributions to compute training example scores, enabling analysis of training dynamics and identification of under/over/well-estimated samples. Extensive empirical studies validate TRIAGE's effectiveness across various datasets, demonstrating improvements in model performance through data selection and feature acquisition.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is innovative and addresses a significant gap in regression data characterization.
- The framework is well-motivated, clearly written, and supported by extensive empirical results.
- The analysis of training dynamics provides valuable insights into model performance.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation lacks clarity in several areas, with some sections being overly verbose and confusing.
- The novelty of TRIAGE is questioned due to similarities with existing methods, particularly those referenced in [23].
- There is insufficient discussion on the implications of removing under/over-predicted data and the computational overhead of the framework.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation, particularly in Section 5, to enhance reader understanding. Additionally, the authors should provide a thorough comparison with existing data valuation methods, such as Shapley-based approaches, to contextualize TRIAGE's contributions. It would be beneficial to include empirical studies on the impact of discarding data on model generalizability and robustness. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the computational overhead and scalability of TRIAGE, and ensure that all technical terms and methodologies are explicitly defined and justified throughout the paper.
