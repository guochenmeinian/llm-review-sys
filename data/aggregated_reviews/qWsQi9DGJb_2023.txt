Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the StressID dataset, a multimodal resource for stress identification that incorporates video, audio, and physiological data (ECG, EDA, respiration). The dataset comprises recordings from 65 subjects undergoing 11 tasks designed to induce stress, with self-assessments yielding labels for model training. StressID is approximately twice the size of existing multimodal datasets and offers a diverse range of stimuli, contributing significantly to the field of stress recognition. The authors emphasize that while the novelty may not be groundbreaking, the dataset's size and variety will benefit future research. Baseline models for stress classification are provided, alongside a comprehensive cleaning and feature extraction pipeline. The manuscript has been revised to include a more comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art datasets, additional classification models, and clearer documentation of the experimental protocol.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
1. The dataset captures diverse modalities, offering complementary information for stress analysis and enhancing the robustness of stress recognition frameworks.
2. The data collection process is well-structured, ensuring high quality and synchronization across modalities.
3. The inclusion of both stimulus labels and self-reported feelings is well-validated, and the experimental protocol is easy to reproduce, allowing for future data augmentation.
4. The authors have improved the comparison with state-of-the-art datasets, highlighting the advantages of StressID, and additional multimodal baselines and experiments have been included.

**Weaknesses:**
1. The multimodal fusion baseline model does not demonstrate the dataset's advantages, with classification accuracy lower than single modalities, and the underperformance of the multimodal baseline model compared to unimodal models requires further explanation.
2. The dataset suffers from a significant gender imbalance (18 women and 47 men), raising concerns about potential bias in algorithm development.
3. Clarity issues exist in the writing, with grammatical errors and vague definitions of classification tasks, despite revisions made for clarity.
4. The frame rate of the dataset is limited to 5 fps, despite the recording equipment supporting higher rates, which could affect data quality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the multimodal fusion baseline model to better reflect the dataset's capabilities, ensuring that classification accuracy surpasses that of single modalities. Additionally, we suggest providing more detailed comparisons with existing datasets to highlight the unique contributions of StressID. The authors should clarify the classification task definitions and consider employing more advanced models tailored for stress identification to enhance the dataset's applicability. We also recommend improving the reporting of usable data demographics post-cleaning, particularly concerning gender, and investigating any potential recency bias in stress ratings related to task order. Clarifying participant compensation details and considering the implications of time of day on stress responses would also be beneficial. Furthermore, we suggest exploring the removal of middle-range ratings in binary labeling to enhance the stress detection algorithm, while discussing the pros and cons of this approach. Lastly, we advise providing a high frame rate version of the dataset to enhance the quality of the recordings and the overall utility of StressID.
