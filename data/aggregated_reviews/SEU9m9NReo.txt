Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the SARAMIS dataset, a large-scale collection of rendering assets of over 100 anatomical structures of the human abdomen, derived from three existing computed tomography datasets. The authors propose an automated method for navigating within the colon using this dataset, emphasizing a comprehensive pipeline for generating 3D assets, including texture generation and navigation path evaluation. Key contributions include the careful curation of segmentations, the introduction of a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm tailored for colonoscopy navigation, and the public availability of processing methods, enabling reproducibility and extension of the work. The dataset aims to enhance simulation-based experimentation in minimally invasive surgery, with applications in deformation simulation, generative 3D models, and navigation training.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Uniqueness: The dataset is the first openly accessible resource for rendering assets of abdominal organs, facilitating in-silico validation of algorithms in robot-assisted and minimally invasive surgery.
- Curation: The dataset is meticulously curated from three existing CT datasets, with expert evaluations of the labeling process.
- Open science: The dataset and processing methods are publicly available, promoting straightforward reproduction and extension.
- Expanded evaluation: The authors have increased the evaluation of generated navigation paths from 4 to 24 cases, providing a more robust comparison between human and RL performance.
- Well-documented: The paper includes detailed supplementary materials that enhance understanding of the texture generation process and the dataset's creation.

Weaknesses:
- Dataset access: The full dataset was not available at submission, limiting the ability to fully assess the paper.
- Focus: The paper emphasizes the reinforcement learning method over the dataset's quality and applications.
- Label quality: The manual labeling process for anatomical landmarks appears rough, lacking accuracy metrics and qualitative evaluation.
- Texture realism: Insufficient detail on how texture realism is assured, raising concerns about the dataset's applicability and the realism of textures is limited.
- Experimental design: The limited number of test cases and lack of uncertainty analyses weaken the experimental conclusions, and the evaluation of navigation paths is criticized for being weak and cherry-picked.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve public access to the dataset without barriers, such as logins. Additionally, the authors should focus more on the dataset's quality and applications, providing detailed descriptions of label accuracy and annotation protocols. Clarifying the texture generation process and its impact on realism is essential, and we suggest mentioning this process earlier in the paper. The authors should enhance the experimental design by increasing the number of test cases and performing uncertainty analyses. Furthermore, we advise including a statement or evaluation regarding the number of generated wall intersubsections to strengthen the evaluation of navigation paths. Lastly, addressing the limitations of the navigation paths, discussing the physical properties of anatomical structures, and ensuring comprehensive documentation for the code and dataset access would significantly enhance the paper's clarity and usability.
