Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents AdaNovo, a novel framework designed to enhance de novo peptide sequencing by addressing biases in training data, particularly focusing on post-translational modifications (PTMs). The authors argue that all PTM types significantly influence overall performance, despite some PTMs being less frequent than canonical amino acids. They compute Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) between mass spectra and amino acids to improve robustness against noise and enhance PTM identification. Statistical evidence in Tables Re1 and Re5 demonstrates that while the frequency of specific PTMs is low (0.051% - 0.914%), the overall presence of peptides with PTMs is relatively high, affecting peptide-level precision in sequencing. Extensive evaluations show that AdaNovo outperforms existing methods on a widely-used benchmark dataset, particularly in accurately identifying biologically meaningful PTMs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors tackle a highly relevant biological issue regarding the identification of PTMs, which are often overlooked in de novo sequencing.
- The proposed CMI weighting framework is innovative and aligns well with the challenges presented.
- The rationale for including multiple PTM types is clear, emphasizing their collective impact on sequencing performance.
- Statistical data effectively supports claims regarding PTM frequency and its implications for de novo sequencing.
- The experimental results provide strong empirical evidence of the model's effectiveness, showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art tools.

Weaknesses:
- The initial hypothesis regarding the impact of PTMs on peptide sequencing is flawed, as PTMs are rare at the peptide level, making their overall effect negligible.
- The benchmark dataset may not be suitable for learning tasks due to potential data leakage, as many peptides are shared between closely related organisms.
- The absence of error bars complicates the assessment of the claimed performance improvements, and the standard deviations suggest that the advancements may not be statistically significant.
- There is a perceived conflation between natural PTMs and accidental modifications, which may mislead readers regarding the significance of the contribution.
- Some reviewers express concerns about the narrative suggesting that the work addresses a major challenge in mass spectrometry proteomics, while it may primarily focus on technical artifact removal.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their initial hypothesis regarding PTMs and their impact on peptide sequencing. Additionally, it would be beneficial to acknowledge existing methodologies that identify PTMs separately and consider benchmarking against them. To address concerns about data leakage, please quantify the overlap of peptides between species in the dataset and detail how this is mitigated. We also suggest providing standard deviations for key results, particularly for Mouse and Human datasets, to substantiate claims of performance superiority. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the distinction between natural and accidental PTMs in their narrative to avoid potential misunderstandings. It would also be beneficial to emphasize the biological significance of the PTMs identified by AdaNovo more explicitly. Lastly, consider including a plot that progressively removes 5-10% of peptides with PTMs to illustrate the impact on model performance more effectively, and consider employing a beam search decoding strategy, as it may enhance the model's performance.
