### Key Points
This paper presents a method called latest weight averaging (LAWA) for checkpoint averaging during the pre-training of large language models (LLMs). The authors demonstrate that LAWA accelerates convergence and enhances test and zero-shot generalization across various model sizes, including nanoGPT-2 and Pythia models. The approach is well-supported by theoretical explanations, comprehensive ablation studies, and comparisons with existing methods like Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA). The results indicate that LAWA is particularly effective under strict compute budgets, although its benefits may diminish with larger model sizes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The theoretical foundations of LAWA are clearly articulated through a toy example.
- Comprehensive evaluations across a range of model sizes validate the method's effectiveness.
- The paper includes meaningful baselines and ablation studies that enhance the robustness of the findings.
- The experimental design is straightforward and well-explained, making the results accessible.

Weaknesses:
- The method adapts existing techniques rather than introducing a novel approach, which may limit its perceived originality.
- The evaluation against other averaging baselines is insufficient, particularly regarding metrics beyond loss.
- The presentation of figures and tables could be improved for better clarity and flow.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the figures and their placement within the text to enhance the reading experience. Specifically, consider consolidating redundant figures, such as those in Figure 2, to avoid confusion. Additionally, we suggest conducting further evaluations against other averaging methods beyond loss metrics to strengthen the paper's contributions. To enhance reproducibility, please make the code and checkpoints publicly available. Finally, a more detailed related work section is needed to contextualize the novelty of the proposed method.
