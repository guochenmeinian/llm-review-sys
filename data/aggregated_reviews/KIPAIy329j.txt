### Key Points
This paper presents Semantic Guidance (SEGA), a method that enables user control and interaction with text-to-image diffusion models to generate images that align with intended semantics. The authors address the challenge of small changes in input prompts leading to vastly different images by leveraging a composable diffusion approach for fine-grained control. The experiments primarily demonstrate SEGA's effectiveness on human faces, showcasing its ability to enable subtle edits while disentangling intended modifications from other factors.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The study addresses an important problem of fine-grained control in diffusion models.  
2. Extensive experiments on human faces include both automatic and human evaluations.  
3. Results indicate that SEGA allows for subtle edits on human faces, effectively managing intended changes.

Weaknesses:  
1. The method closely resembles Composable Diffusion, raising concerns about originality.  
2. Evaluation is limited to human faces, leaving its applicability to other object categories unclear.  
3. Potential biases arise from semantic edits targeting controversial concepts, necessitating a clearer discussion of the evaluation scope.  
4. The human study primarily assesses label presence/absence without evaluating image quality, which is crucial for practical applications.  
5. Quantitative evaluation on larger datasets and comparisons with competitive methods are lacking.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the limitations of the method and evaluation settings, particularly regarding the generalizability of SEGA beyond human faces. Additionally, a user preference study against competitive methods such as Wu et al. should be included. It would also be beneficial to provide insights about hyperparameter choices and their impact on image quality and details. Finally, we suggest conducting a more comprehensive evaluation of image quality, possibly through user studies or metrics like inception scores or FID, to better assess the effectiveness of the proposed method.
