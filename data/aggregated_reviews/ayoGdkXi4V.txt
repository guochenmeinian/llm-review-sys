### Key Points
This paper presents a technique, Lazy-k decoding, which employs best-first search with global, non-decomposable constraints for structured prediction tasks in information extraction. The Lazy-k decoding method maintains a separate list of child states for each examined state, adding them to the heap lazily, thus ensuring a manageable heap size and reduced computational overhead. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms vanilla best-first search without sacrificing accuracy. The authors propose that this method is a simple plug-and-play algorithm applicable beyond structured prediction tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed method simplifies the application of NLP techniques with global decoding and offers a unified modeling of hard constraints, enhancing practical applications.  
- The paper is well-organized, easy to follow, and the motivation is supported by experiments.  
- The inclusion of a proof enhances the soundness of the work.

Weaknesses:  
- The method may be seen as an incremental improvement, as the concept of partial/lazy expansion has been explored in existing literature.  
- Some details, such as the computation of the `NextBest` function, are not clearly explained.  
- The experimental section lacks depth, with insufficient analysis and a limited range of tasks, raising questions about the method's applicability to state-of-the-art models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing a simple mathematical explanation for the observation mentioned in line 214. Additionally, we suggest expanding the experimental section to include more diverse tasks and deeper analyses to elucidate the workings of the proposed method. Furthermore, discussions on search algorithms for traditional probabilistic models and the tradeoff between decoding effectiveness and model size should be included to enhance the paper's depth.
