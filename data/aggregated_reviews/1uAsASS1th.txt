Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the MM-Fi dataset, a novel multi-modal non-intrusive 4D human dataset designed to advance wireless human sensing algorithm development. It integrates four sensing modalities: RGB-D, LiDAR, mmWave radar, and WiFi, comprising 320.76k synchronized frames across 27 pose categories performed by 40 subjects. The authors detail the data collection process and conduct experiments to establish single-modal and multi-modal benchmarks. The dataset aims to facilitate advanced multimodal fusion methods, allowing for comprehensive insights into human behavior while addressing privacy concerns in non-intrusive sensing applications. The authors acknowledge limitations in the dataset, including manual annotation quality, restricted sensing tasks, and controlled collection conditions, and they plan to enhance the dataset in future versions by incorporating a motion capture system for dense pose annotations and expanding scenarios to include multi-user and multi-location settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is the first to combine RGB-D, LiDAR, mmWave radar, and WiFi modalities, enhancing privacy-preserving human sensing applications.
- The data collection process, including synchronization and annotation, is well-articulated, and the authors have validated the annotation quality, achieving a reprojection error PCKh@0.5 of 95.66%.
- The dataset offers a unique opportunity for research in domain adaptation and generalization for Human Pose Estimation (HPE) using emerging modalities, enabling cross-modal learning and enhancing the performance of sparse data modalities in fine-grained recognition tasks.
- The authors provide a comprehensive comparison of MM-Fi with existing datasets, highlighting its unique features and advantages.

Weaknesses:
- The quality of the dataset remains ambiguous, particularly regarding the annotation process and the use of 2D positions estimated by HRNet to generate 3D positions.
- The motivation for including WiFi alongside other modalities is unclear, especially given the observed performance drop in human pose estimation (HPE).
- The dataset is currently limited by movement diversity, as subjects are fixed in specific locations and orientations, and it lacks certain daily actions, which may limit the generalization of the proposed models.
- The reliance on processed point clouds instead of raw data may hinder the dataset's effectiveness for certain applications, and the dataset was collected under controlled conditions, limiting its applicability to real-world scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the annotations of the dataset by qualitatively and quantitatively evaluating the annotation process. Additionally, the design and results of experiments should consistently reflect the strengths of the modalities used, particularly clarifying the role of WiFi in conjunction with LiDAR and mmWave. The visualization of WiFi and mmWave contributions to the HPE task should be enhanced for clarity. Furthermore, providing a detailed discussion on the limitations of the dataset, including movement diversity and environmental factors, would strengthen the paper. We suggest expanding the dataset to include more diverse movements and orientations to enhance its applicability and incorporating a wider variety of downstream tasks and more advanced multimodal fusion methods. It would also be beneficial to explore privacy-preserving techniques in future work, ensuring user privacy while completing downstream tasks. Lastly, we encourage the authors to include comparisons with additional state-of-the-art models, such as MotionBERT and PointGPT, in their future work to strengthen their findings.
