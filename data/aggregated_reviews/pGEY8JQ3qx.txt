### Key Points
This paper presents a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm for tabular MDPs focusing on average reward criteria. The authors assume a generative model and study a learning algorithm that samples each state-action pair \( n \) times. In the weakly communicating setting, the authors provide the first algorithm achieving the minimax lower bound for finding an \(\varepsilon\)-policy. They also explore multi-chain MDPs, introducing a transient time parameter \( B \) and proposing an analysis of the minimax lower bound alongside an algorithm that achieves this bound. The work establishes the first minimax optimal sample complexity bound for weakly communicating and general average reward MDPs without uniform mixing assumptions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and demonstrates comprehensive documentation of related work, effectively utilizing references throughout.  
- The definitions are precise, and the study of learning algorithms for multi-chain MDPs is notably rare.  
- The theoretical results appear reasonable and strong, with clear presentation.  
- The paper resolves a significant open problem and introduces a breakthrough insight regarding sample complexity bounds.

Weaknesses:  
- The algorithmic novelty seems limited, with the analysis being the primary contribution.  
- The discussion on the lower bound is incomplete, and the implications of the generative model on the analysis are not fully explored.  
- There are questions regarding the clarity of certain definitions and the necessity of prior knowledge of parameters like \( H \) and \( B \).  
- The lack of numerical experiments limits the practical applicability of the proposed algorithms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the lower bound to provide a more comprehensive understanding. Clarifying the definitions of transient time \( B \) and addressing the implications of the generative model on the analysis would enhance the paper's clarity. Additionally, we suggest including recent relevant works in the literature review to address questions raised in the paper. Finally, incorporating numerical experiments could strengthen the practical relevance of the proposed algorithms.
