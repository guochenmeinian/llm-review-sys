Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an improved approach to multi-label learning through the introduction of the multi-label logistic loss, which effectively addresses label correlations often overlooked by traditional binary relevance surrogates under Hamming loss. The authors extend their analysis to various multi-label losses, ensuring Bayes-consistency across diverse settings, and provide efficient gradient computation algorithms for minimizing the proposed loss function. The work offers a unified framework with robust consistency guarantees, advancing beyond traditional methods in multi-label learning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of the multi-label logistic loss effectively accounts for label correlations and establishes $\mathcal{H}$-consistency bounds for a wide range of multi-label losses.
- The paper provides a comprehensive review of related works, detailing the limitations of existing binary relevance loss and the theoretical contributions of the proposed loss.
- The authors demonstrate efficient gradient computation for the multi-label logistic loss and conduct time complexity analyses, showcasing the applicability of their approach.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation and background lack clear logic and hierarchy; outlining the shortcomings of existing methods before presenting the research questions would enhance clarity.
- The paper does not include experimental validation, leaving the practical effectiveness of the proposed loss unverified. This absence should be acknowledged in the conclusion.
- Several equations are unnumbered, which may hinder reference for readers and reviewers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the logical structure of the motivation and background by clearly outlining existing method shortcomings before presenting their research questions. Additionally, including experiments to compare the proposed multi-label logistic loss with commonly used multi-label losses on standard datasets would enhance the paper's comprehensiveness and validate its practical effectiveness. Furthermore, addressing the computational complexity associated with implementing the multi-label logistic loss compared to traditional loss functions would provide valuable insights. Lastly, we suggest numbering all equations for easier reference and clarifying the specific nature of label correlations mentioned in the paper.
