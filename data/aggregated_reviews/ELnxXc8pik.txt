### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to unsupervised semantic image segmentation, utilizing a recursive spectral clustering method to construct a hierarchy-agnostic semantic region tree. The authors propose a deep recursive spectral clustering method that maximizes an unbiased measure of total semantic similarity across various levels of granularity. They integrate this method with self-supervised learning models and introduce new metrics, Normalized Multigranular Covering (NMCovering) and Normalized Hierarchical Covering (NHCovering), to evaluate segmentation quality at different hierarchy levels. The method is framed as a graph partitioning problem, where nodes represent parts and edges reflect similarity scores, with experiments demonstrating strong performance on popular benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with clear motivation and a novel recursive spectral clustering idea.
- The experimental results show significant improvements over prior methods.
- The introduction of innovative metrics for evaluating segmentation quality is practical.
- Code is provided for reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- The approach relies on critical hyperparameters (e.g., $k_{min}$, $p_{max}$, $\lambda_{max}$) that, if improperly set, can degrade performance.
- The pre-trained DINOv2-ViT-B14-REG backbone is a strong requirement, complicating fair comparisons with other unsupervised segmentation models.
- The writing could be clearer; convoluted sentences hinder understanding of the method.
- The hierarchy discovered does not influence the training of the feature extractor, potentially limiting its impact.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing to enhance reader comprehension, particularly in method descriptions. Providing examples to illustrate the computation of the newly introduced metrics would clarify their application. Additionally, we suggest conducting ablation studies with alternative spectral methods to assess the importance of the smooth function-labelling minimization. Lastly, addressing the limitations related to the reliance on superpixel pre-processing and frozen features could strengthen the paper's contributions.
