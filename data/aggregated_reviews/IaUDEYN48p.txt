### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of the Koopman operator as a data-driven tool that connects with the Bellman equation and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation in reinforcement learning and control theory. The authors propose that the Koopman operator can transform nonlinear systems into a linear dynamics framework, facilitating the application of HJB-based methods. This transformation aids in estimating and controlling highly nonlinear dynamics. The introduction of a "Koopman tensor" allows for the estimation of the optimal value function. By leveraging the Koopman operator for the value function's time evolution and incorporating control actions, the authors develop two new reinforcement learning algorithms: soft-value iteration and soft actor-critic (SAC), which demonstrate superior performance compared to traditional methods across various systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper presents a novel integration between model-free reinforcement learning and Koopman theory.
2. It increases interpretability while maintaining similar performance in empirical results.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper would benefit from more visualization analysis to enhance the explainability of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including additional visualization analysis to investigate the explainability of the results.
