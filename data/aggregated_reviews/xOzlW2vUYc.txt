Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CrossGNN, a GNN-based model for multivariate time series forecasting that addresses two key challenges: unexpected noise and variable heterogeneity. CrossGNN comprises three components: the Adaptive Multi-Scale Identifier (AMSI) for identifying potential periods using FFT, Cross-Scale GNN for capturing cross-scale dependencies, and Cross-Variable GNN for modeling dependencies among variables. The model's linear complexity is a notable advantage. The authors provide a comprehensive evaluation of CrossGNN against PatchTST across eight datasets, demonstrating that CrossGNN outperforms PatchTST in both predictive performance and computational efficiency, achieving an average performance gain of 8.36% in MSE and 5.8% in MAE without RevIN, while maintaining superior performance even when PatchTST employs RevIN. Additionally, CrossGNN exhibits a runtime that is ten times faster and memory consumption that is eight times lower than PatchTST.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work is well-structured and easy to follow.
- It addresses significant issues in multivariate time series forecasting, particularly noise.
- CrossGNN shows significant improvements in predictive performance over PatchTST across multiple datasets.
- The computational efficiency of CrossGNN is markedly superior, with reduced runtime and memory usage.
- The three components of CrossGNN are well-motivated, and the linear complexity is beneficial.
- Robustness analysis of noise is interesting and adds value.

Weaknesses:
- The static nature of the graphs used in Cross-Scale and Cross-Variable GNNs limits adaptability, as they do not account for varying dependencies across different inputs.
- The paper lacks comparisons with recent works like PatchTST and Crossformer that explicitly model cross-variable dependencies.
- Initial results were limited to only four datasets, which may not fully represent the model's capabilities.
- The technical novelty is questioned, as concepts of cross-scale and cross-variable interactions have been previously introduced in other models.
- The analysis could benefit from further clarification on the implications of using RevIN in the context of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the adaptability of the graph structures in Cross-Scale and Cross-Variable GNNs to better reflect the dynamic nature of time series data. Additionally, it is essential to include comparisons with recent state-of-the-art methods such as PatchTST and Crossformer in the main experiments. We suggest that the authors broaden the range of datasets in the initial results to enhance the generalizability of their findings. Clarifying the novelty of the AMSI component and providing justifications for the selection of top-k frequencies would enhance the paper's contribution. Furthermore, a more detailed discussion on the role of RevIN in the performance of both models would clarify its impact and relevance. Finally, a more detailed analysis of the ablation study is necessary to determine the relative importance of the Cross-Scale and Cross-Variable GNN components.
