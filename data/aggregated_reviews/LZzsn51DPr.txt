Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for fusing raw radar data with images for object detection from a mobile platform. The authors propose a Polar-Aligned Attention module that projects features onto a polar coordinate system, enhancing the fusion process. They utilize the RADIal dataset, providing improved annotations to evaluate their method's precision. The approach is validated against existing methods, demonstrating competitive performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for using raw radar data is compelling, and the results are convincing.
- The model effectively leverages the unique properties of radar data and includes a thorough ablation study.
- The reannotation of the RADIal dataset is a significant contribution to the field.

Weaknesses:
- The method section lacks precision and detail, particularly regarding the CrossAttn operator and polar queries, making it difficult to replicate.
- The paper relies heavily on jargon, which may alienate readers unfamiliar with radar data, and the figures could be clearer.
- The writing quality is inconsistent, containing imprecise formulations that hinder readability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method section by providing detailed definitions for the CrossAttn operator and polar queries. Additionally, we suggest simplifying the language and reducing jargon to make the paper more accessible to a broader audience. Enhancing the figures and their captions for better comprehension is also advised. Finally, we encourage the authors to focus on refining the overall writing quality to enhance readability and pedagogical value.
