Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical analysis of posterior contraction rates for the variational posterior in linear inverse problems, specifically using inducing-point variational Bayes approximations for Gaussian processes. The authors investigate the performance of these approximations under mildly and severely ill-posed conditions, deriving contraction rates for specific operators, including the Volterra operator, heat equation, and Radon transform. The results are illustrated through synthetic data experiments, demonstrating that a small number of inducing points can yield accurate results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a clear and structured analysis of posterior contraction rates, enhancing the theoretical understanding of variational Gaussian processes for linear inverse problems.
- The theoretical results are sound, and the paper is well-written, making it accessible to a specialized audience.
- The contribution is significant, as it addresses the frequentist properties of variational posteriors, which have not been explicitly studied in this context before.

Weaknesses:
- The analysis relies on the assumption that the functional space of the target function is known, limiting its applicability in practical scenarios where this assumption may not hold.
- The experimental evaluation is confined to synthetic toy examples, lacking real-world applications that could enhance the paper's relevance.
- The comparison to existing literature is insufficient, and the literature review does not adequately cover significant related works, particularly those addressing non-linear cases and other covariance functions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental evaluation by including real-world applications, such as the use of the Radon transform in computed tomography, to illustrate the practical significance of their results. Additionally, we suggest that the authors address the limitations of their assumptions regarding model specification and discuss potential extensions to model misspecification scenarios. Furthermore, enhancing the literature review to include key papers, such as those by Pinski et al., would provide a more comprehensive context for their work. Lastly, we advise clarifying the definitions and notations used in the paper, particularly in relation to contraction rates and the specific terms introduced.
