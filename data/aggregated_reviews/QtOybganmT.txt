### Key Points
This paper presents ITER-RETGEN, an iterative retrieval-generation synergy framework aimed at enhancing large language models (LLMs). The authors demonstrate improved performance in question answering, fact verification, and commonsense reasoning tasks. The method involves concatenating generated outputs with retrieval results iteratively until a maximum number of iterations is reached. The authors also introduce a new evaluation metric based on LLMs, which is deemed more reliable than exact match metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and effectively conveys its message through descriptive figures.
- It demonstrates strong motivation and addresses a crucial question in LLM research.
- The experimental design is comprehensive, showcasing the method's effectiveness across various tasks and datasets.
- The proposed evaluation metric is robust and enhances the reliability of results.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the iterative retrieval approach is limited, as it does not present unique aspects related to LLMs and resembles existing methods.
- The paper lacks a comparison with the DSP framework, which would serve as an appropriate baseline.
- The experiments are conducted solely with the text-davinci-003 model, omitting open-sourced models and failing to address potential data leakage in benchmarks.
- The clarity regarding how the method resolves issues with previous approaches is insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty aspect by highlighting unique contributions of ITER-RETGEN in the context of LLMs. Additionally, the authors should include a comparison with the DSP framework to strengthen their claims. It would be beneficial to incorporate open-sourced models in the experiments and discuss potential data leakage concerns. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify how ITER-RETGEN addresses the limitations of previous methods, particularly regarding the processing of retrieved knowledge and the necessity of multiple retrievals.
