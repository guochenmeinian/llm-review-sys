Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new approach for Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) called Regressor-Guided MIL (RGMIL), which introduces a novel aggregation method known as Regressor-Guided Pooling (RGP). The authors argue that RGP enhances instance-level representation by mimicking human inference processes. The model is evaluated across various binary and multi-class MIL problems, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods. Additionally, the paper provides a detailed analysis of the SIVAL dataset, arguing that it is not suitable for instance-level evaluation due to the presence of "fake" critical instances and the dependency relationships among image segments. The authors offer performance comparisons across different pooling methods for both 11-class and 25-class scenarios, highlighting the limitations of RGP and ABP methods in handling dependencies. They clarify the metrics used for evaluation, including MAE, MSE, PCC, and ICC, emphasizing their relevance in assessing model performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The RGP approach is original, particularly with its double pass through the regressor.
2. The evaluation covers multiple datasets, showing strong results and outperforming most existing methods.
3. The motivation for RGMIL is intuitive, addressing key limitations in current MIL techniques.
4. The authors provide a thorough explanation of the SIVAL dataset's characteristics and the rationale for not performing instance-level evaluations.
5. The performance comparisons across various pooling methods are well-documented, showcasing the effectiveness of RGMIL in specific scenarios.
6. The clarification of evaluation metrics enhances the understanding of model performance.

Weaknesses:
1. Some elements of the proposed method, such as equation 4 and equation 8, are based on well-known concepts, which could detract from the perceived originality.
2. The clarity of the paper is compromised; it is difficult to follow the proposed method and understand its workings, particularly regarding training and the aggregator's role.
3. The evaluation lacks a comprehensive analysis of performance across different configurations, particularly in multi-class scenarios without max-based assumptions.
4. The justification for not providing instance-level results is seen as insufficient by some reviewers, who argue that all models face similar challenges.
5. Concerns about the general applicability of RGP and its performance relative to other methods remain unaddressed.
6. The bag-level performance of RGP is noted to be less impressive, raising questions about its overall effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by restructuring and condensing verbose sections, particularly in the assumptions and results discussions. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide clearer definitions and purposes for the metrics used, especially in Table 4. It would be beneficial to include more dataset details for reproducibility and to clarify the construction of the UNBC dataset for the MIL setting. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the justification for not including instance-level results by discussing potential issues with the SIVAL dataset in greater detail. Providing a comparative analysis of RGP's performance against other methods, along with a discussion of its merits, would strengthen the paper. We also suggest that the authors conduct further experiments to validate the instance-level performance of RGP, as this could enhance the credibility of their claims. Lastly, incorporating a more detailed analysis of how each metric evaluates specific aspects of the model would provide valuable insights into the experimental results, and revising figure and table captions for better standalone clarity would be beneficial.
