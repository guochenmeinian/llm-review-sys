Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of the LMAC method for explaining decisions made by audio classifiers, specifically transitioning from fixed-vocabulary to zero-shot/open text description settings. The authors propose a training objective that preserves the proximity of masked audio embeddings to corresponding text embeddings. Evaluated on the CLAP model across standard sound event detection datasets, the method shows favorable comparisons to prior work. Additionally, the paper introduces LMAC-ZS, a post-hoc interpretation method for zero-shot audio classifiers, which outputs saliency maps correlating audio regions with text prompts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and timely, addressing the growing trend towards open vocabulary settings in audio analysis.
- The motivation for interpretability in AI, particularly for zero-shot audio classifiers, is clearly articulated.
- Empirical evaluations are appropriate and generally convincing, with qualitative and quantitative results supporting the method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The investigation of the proposed method is somewhat shallow, focusing more on high-level comparisons rather than detailed analysis of the training objective components.
- There is limited technical novelty, primarily revolving around the loss function in Equation 6, which closely follows the framework of the original L-MAC paper.
- Some experimental results are counterintuitive, such as LMAC-ZS (CT) outperforming LMAC-ZS (FULL) in certain metrics, requiring further explanation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the depth of their investigation into the proposed method by conducting an ablation study to measure the importance of the various terms in the training objective. Additionally, we suggest restructuring Sections 2.1 and 2.2 as a "Background" or "Preliminaries" section to clarify the contributions distinct from L-MAC. To enhance clarity, we advise against omitting parts of Equation (4) and recommend defining abbreviations like L-MAC earlier in the text. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore the rationale behind using the same dataset for contamination in their experiments and consider alternative baselines that are more suited for zero-shot settings, such as those from the gScoreCAM paper.
