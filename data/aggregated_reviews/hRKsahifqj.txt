### Key Points
This paper studies task allocation under resource constraints and proposes a new constrained RL algorithm, Polytope Action Space Policy Optimization (PASPO), based on autoregressive policy optimization with a novel de-biasing mechanism. The authors demonstrate improved performance through extensive simulations, showing better reward without constraint violations compared to benchmark algorithms that allow such violations. The approach focuses on sampling points that satisfy constraints, enhancing compliance and efficiency in constrained allocation tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and presents a novel algorithm design.  
- The motivation for the problem is clear, with practical significance.  
- The proposed algorithm shows significant improvements in constraint adherence and task performance compared to existing methods.  
- The core sampling approach is logical and effectively addresses the challenges of sampling over the polytope.

Weaknesses:  
- There is no theoretical guarantee provided for the observed constraint satisfaction, raising questions about the algorithm's performance under the problem formulation.  
- The algorithm requires substantial computing resources, demanding high-performance computational capabilities.  
- The paper lacks a comprehensive explanation of the algorithm's operational principles, optimization techniques, and adaptive features.  
- The overall algorithm or flow of the framework is not clearly presented, and the novelty of the sampling approach is questioned.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical foundation of their work by providing guarantees for constraint satisfaction and clarifying the operational principles of the algorithm. Additionally, addressing the computational resource requirements in the context of other RL approaches would enhance the discussion. We suggest including a clear overall algorithm or flow of the framework to aid understanding. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to elaborate on the differences between PASPO and other methods, such as rejection sampling from the constrained simplex, to clarify the advantages of the proposed approach. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide more details on the environments used for empirical studies and the impact of the de-biasing mechanism.
