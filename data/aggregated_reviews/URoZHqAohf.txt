Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark, ProteinGym, for predicting the effects and fitness of protein mutations, utilizing a large dataset curated from Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) assays and clinical data. The authors implemented over 40 models across zero-shot and supervised settings, providing various evaluation metrics such as Spearmanâ€™s correlation, Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). Additionally, the authors introduce significant contributions such as 157 new assays, effectively doubling the number of proteins and mutants compared to previous work. They clarify misunderstandings regarding the novelty of their work and assert that their contributions extend beyond mere incremental improvements. The paper emphasizes the establishment of a critical connection between fitness prediction and protein design, bridging two often-separate subdomains of computational biology. The inclusion of inverse folding baselines further connects structure-based methods with sequence-based models, enhancing the evaluation of inverse folding models. The methods are available as open-source programs, enhancing accessibility for the research community.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- ProteinGym encompasses a broad collection of standardized DMS assays and clinical datasets, covering millions of mutated sequences across diverse protein families.
- It includes proteins with multiple mutations and indels, which are often absent in other datasets.
- The implementation of over 40 high-performing models in a common open-source codebase facilitates ease of use and future method additions.
- A dedicated website provides access to benchmarks and analysis results.
- The integration of clinical benchmarks with DMS assays offers a novel perspective on protein fitness prediction.
- The paper includes a detailed discussion of the relationship between their work and prior literature, addressing previous concerns about clarity.
- The extensive scale of the benchmarks and the inclusion of diverse baselines provide robust assessment capabilities.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks specific statistics about the datasets, such as the number of proteins, families, labels, mutations, and species.
- There is a need for test datasets with low sequence similarity to the training datasets.
- The relationship between the datasets and typical protein design tasks is unclear, necessitating adjustments in the title and text for clarity.
- Redundancy control between training and test datasets is not adequately addressed.
- Some reviewers express skepticism regarding the originality of the contributions, viewing them as incremental rather than groundbreaking.
- The performance of inverse folding baselines on the DMS benchmark raises questions about their utility in practical applications, as many generated sequences may not be functional.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the dataset descriptions by including statistics such as the number of proteins, families, labels, mutations, and species. Additionally, incorporating test datasets with low sequence similarity (e.g., <30% sequence identity) would enhance the benchmark's robustness. To clarify the connection to protein design tasks, we suggest revising the title and relevant sections of the text. Furthermore, we advise implementing redundancy control between training and test datasets to ensure more reliable evaluations. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their manuscript by explicitly stating how their work extends ProteinGym rather than merely introducing it. Consider revising the abstract to reflect this perspective. It may also be beneficial to clarify the relationship of their work to protein design tasks in the title and throughout the text. Lastly, ensure that all claims made in the manuscript align with the clarified contributions discussed in the rebuttal, and provide a more detailed discussion of the insights gained from their results, particularly regarding future research directions. A concise summary of the paper's contributions, novelty, and impact in bullet points could enhance the accessibility of their findings for the audience.
