### Key Points
This paper presents KGQUIZ, a benchmark designed to evaluate the knowledge generalization abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) across five knowledge-intensive tasks and three knowledge domains. The methodology is robust, categorizing tasks by complexity and providing a comparative analysis of 10 different LLMs. The results reveal performance variability across tasks, highlighting the challenges LLMs face with complex reasoning and domain-specific knowledge.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses the critical need for improved evaluation mechanisms for LLMs, contributing valuable insights to the field.
- It systematically categorizes tasks based on complexity, enhancing the understanding of model performance.
- The extensive experiments conducted provide a broad perspective on LLM capabilities.

Weaknesses:
- The focus on biomedical knowledge as the sole representative of domain-specific knowledge limits broader applicability.
- The proposed tasks are rigid and lack multi-step reasoning, potentially underrepresenting LLM capabilities.
- The absence of detailed model descriptions for the evaluated LLMs hinders understanding of experimental methods.
- The analysis does not deeply explore why certain models excel in specific tasks or domains, leaving ambiguous conclusions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the diversity of knowledge domains included in the study, considering additional fields like mathematics and coding to enhance applicability. We suggest providing detailed descriptions of the LLMs used, including differences between models like ADA, BABBAGE, CURIE, and DAVINCI. We encourage the authors to explore varying task weightings to reflect real-world applicability and to conduct a deeper analysis of performance variability across models and tasks. Additionally, we advise clarifying the novelty of KGQUIZ in relation to existing benchmarks like KILT and addressing the potential issues with random entity sampling in dataset construction. Finally, we recommend releasing the prompts used in the experiments and making the benchmark open to facilitate further research.
