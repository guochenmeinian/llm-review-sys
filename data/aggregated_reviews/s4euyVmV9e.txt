### Key Points
This paper presents a surrogate model based on STNP for the Global Epidemic and Mobility model (GLEAM), named GLEAM-AI. The authors claim that GLEAM-AI is 200 times faster than the mechanistic model while maintaining similar performance. The paper applies STNP to epidemiology, redesigning parts of the encoders and decoders. However, it lacks a direct comparison with the original STNP model to substantiate claims of improved performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- GLEAM-AI demonstrates a substantial speed increase compared to the non-AI version while generating similar results.  
- The results are scientifically interesting and present a compelling combination of AI and Bayesian statistics.  
- The paper is mostly well written.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper does not compare GLEAM-AI with the original STNP, limiting its novelty.  
- The writing and notation are confusing, particularly in the Bayesian active learning section and Algorithm 1.  
- Key aspects of the model's structure and focus on latent prevalence and incidence are not clearly articulated early in the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison between GLEAM-AI and the original STNP to justify performance claims. A fair comparison should utilize mean STD as the acquisition function for both models while fixing all other parameters. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the clarity of the writing, particularly in the Bayesian active learning section, by defining variables such as "d" and "r" in Algorithm 1. It would also be beneficial to clarify the contributions of the AI component versus the Bayesian active learning component to the observed improvements. Lastly, consider adding an appendix to explain the architecture of GLEAM-AI more thoroughly.
