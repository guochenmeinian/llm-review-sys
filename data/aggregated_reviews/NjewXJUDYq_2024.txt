### Key Points
This paper presents the Unified Spoken Dialog Model (USDM), a large language model (LLM) framework that directly understands and generates spoken dialog responses with natural prosody. The authors propose a method that incorporates prosodic information into speech tokens and employs a multi-step spoken dialog template for fine-tuning. Evaluations on the DailyTalk dataset demonstrate that USDM outperforms previous models, including a cascaded approach relying on ASR and TTS, in generating natural-sounding spoken responses. Key contributions include a unified pretraining strategy for modeling speech-text relationships, a comprehensive spoken dialog framework utilizing prosody-infusing encoders and decoders, and a foundation for speech-enabled chat-based LLMs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors demonstrate superior performance of USDM on the DailyTalk dataset and validate their training methods through thorough analysis.
- The pretraining approach effectively models the relationship between speech and text, and the integration of paralinguistic content is significant for multimodal and speech communities.
- The interleaved pre-training schedule mitigates the modality gap between speech and text.

Weaknesses:
- The comparative analysis should include a wider range of previous methods beyond SpeechGPT to clarify USDM's relative strengths and weaknesses.
- The evaluation relies solely on the DailyTalk dataset, limiting the assessment of generalization capabilities.
- The reliance on a massive amount of transcribed English speech restricts applicability to resource-rich languages, and the emotional control aspect of the generated responses requires further exploration.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparative analysis by including a broader range of previous methods to provide a clearer understanding of USDM's performance. Additionally, we suggest expanding the evaluation to multiple datasets beyond DailyTalk to assess generalization capabilities. It would also be beneficial for the authors to explore and discuss the potential for controlling emotional expression in the generated responses, as this could enhance the model's adaptability to different emotional contexts.
