Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the partial identification of counterfactual probabilities from observational data, specifically within a standard bandit model involving a binary treatment A and a continuous reward Y. The authors demonstrate that without additional assumptions, the learning setting yields non-informative bounds. They introduce a sensitivity model, the Curvature Sensitivity Model (CSM), and propose a novel deep generative model, the Augmented Pseudo-Invertible Decoder, to obtain informative bounds. Theoretical results, particularly Theorem 1, reveal the limitations of smoothness constraints on identifiability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and organized, with extensive examples and graphical illustrations that enhance understanding.
- It addresses a significant challenge in causal inference, particularly in multi-armed bandit models, and has potential implications for fairness analysis in machine learning.
- The introduction of the CSM is novel and theoretically sound, providing a pathway to informative bounds.

Weaknesses:
- Some statements in the abstract may overstate the generality of the findings, as the non-informative bounds specifically apply to ECOU in bandit models.
- The simulation plots, particularly Figure 7, lack clarity regarding the ground truth ECOUs, complicating the evaluation of the proposed bounding strategy.
- The generalizability of the method to more complex causal graphs remains uncertain, and the relationship between CSM parameters and their implications is not fully elucidated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the abstract to accurately reflect the specific context of their findings. Additionally, enhancing the simulation plots to clearly indicate the ground truth ECOUs would facilitate better evaluation of the bounding strategy. We suggest providing more insight into the practical applicability of the CSM and conducting further experiments with varied response surfaces and noise levels to strengthen the empirical evaluation of the proposed method. Lastly, addressing the challenges related to the selection of the parameter $\kappa$ and the correspondence between theoretical and computational bounds in more detail would benefit the paper's overall rigor.
