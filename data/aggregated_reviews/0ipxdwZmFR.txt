### Key Points
This paper presents the application and optimization of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving complex differential equations with known governing equations and limited data. The authors propose a novel, comprehensive open-source module that facilitates detailed comparative analysis between various neural network architectures and loss formulations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
**(a)** The introduction of an open-source module for comparing PINN performances is a notable contribution.  
**(b)** The exploration of both custom and classical architectures provides a comprehensive view.  
**(c)** The incorporation of user-defined modules and the option to choose between autograd and numerical differentiation algorithms is a valuable feature.  

Weaknesses:  
Clarity in the experimental section could be improved with a more detailed presentation of the setup, datasets, and specific results to enhance readers' understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
**(a)** We recommend that the authors enhance the experimental section with visual representations to convey results more effectively, such as adding visualizations that help explain the differential equations.  
**(b)** The authors should add additional comments interpreting the physical results, as the norms used as metrics may lack some physical observables for better interpretation of the results.  
**(c)** In section 3.4, we suggest that the authors clarify their focus on the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation instead of the standard linear version, and consider changing the title of the section if they do not intend to solve the linear version.  
**(d)** We recommend that the authors add more references to existing works for each differential equation to strengthen the paper.  
**(e)** While the mention of an open-source module is a positive step towards reproducibility, we suggest that the authors clarify the availability of datasets and specific implementation details to further improve reproducibility.
