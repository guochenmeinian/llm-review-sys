Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a dual-branch weakly supervised point cloud semantic segmentation network, DGNet, which utilizes a mixture of von Mises-Fisher (moVMF) distributions for feature space regulation and cosine similarity as the distance metric. The authors claim that their approach enhances the performance of existing segmentation networks by providing supplementary supervision signals derived from the feature space distribution. Additionally, the authors compare the category prototype model with cosine similarity and the adopted moVMF under a proposed distributional alignment framework, arguing against claims of a lack of theoretical proof for their method. They assert that their experiments have resolved previous issues raised by reviewers and clarify that identified typos are transcription errors that do not impact the method's correctness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The use of moVMF distribution to regulate the feature space is a novel contribution that addresses a core issue in weakly supervised point cloud semantic segmentation.
2. The methodology is well-presented, and the experimental results demonstrate impressive performance across various architectures and benchmarks.
3. The dual-branch design of DGNet effectively integrates weakly supervised learning with distribution alignment.
4. The authors provide a robust theoretical framework supporting the superiority of moVMF.
5. They effectively address and clarify concerns raised by reviewers, demonstrating engagement with feedback.

Weaknesses:
1. The selection of feature space distribution in a fully supervised manner raises concerns about its applicability in weakly supervised scenarios with sparse labeled samples.
2. The paper lacks a detailed discussion on the computational complexity of the distribution alignment branch, particularly regarding the EM-like algorithm.
3. There is insufficient exploration of the balance of weights for loss terms in Equation (9), and the ablation study does not cover a broader range of loss term combinations.
4. The writing contains minor flaws, such as unreferenced tables and figures, and some figures are not numbered in the order referenced.
5. There is a perceived logical inconsistency in comparing different distributional choices within the same framework.
6. The authors do not provide additional qualitative results beyond representative samples, which may limit the demonstration of their methodology's validity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the choice of moVMF distribution over other distributions, particularly in terms of its theoretical underpinnings and practical advantages. Additionally, the authors should address the computational complexity of the distribution alignment branch and provide a more comprehensive ablation study that examines various combinations of loss terms. Clarifying the balance of weights in Equation (9) and ensuring all tables and figures are properly referenced and numbered will enhance the overall presentation of the paper. We also suggest that the authors improve the clarity of their theoretical proof to address the logical concerns regarding distributional choices and consider including more qualitative results to strengthen their claims about the methodology's validity. Lastly, we encourage the authors to ensure that all transcription errors are corrected to avoid any potential misinterpretations of their work.
