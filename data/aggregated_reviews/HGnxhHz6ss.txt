Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a patch-based diffusion modeling approach aimed at efficiently learning image priors for solving inverse problems, such as CT reconstruction and natural image deblurring. The authors propose a patch-based position-aware diffusion inverse solver that computes the score function for entire images from individual patches and their positional encoding. The method is empirically validated through experiments on both CT and CELEBA datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel approach to learning image priors using patch-based diffusion models, demonstrating rigorous empirical results.
- The inclusion of positional information in the reconstruction process is a promising innovation, allowing the computation of score functions for entire images without needing to process them as wholes.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental evaluation is insufficient, lacking comparisons with a broader range of models and methods, particularly in the context of CT reconstructions, which exhibit significant hallucinations and artifacts.
- The clarity of certain methodological justifications, such as the use of non-overlapping patches, is lacking, and the quality of visual results is compromised by poor figure resolution and presentation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their justification for using non-overlapping patches during training and address the negative impacts of overlapping patches. Additionally, we suggest conducting a more extensive evaluation against various state-of-the-art methods and including a sensitivity analysis to assess performance across different forward operators. The authors should also enhance the quality of visual results by using high-resolution images in the compiled PDF and ensure that the CT images are presented with appropriate window levels and widths to enhance clinical significance. Finally, addressing the issue of hallucinations in the reconstructed CT images is crucial for the paper's acceptance.
