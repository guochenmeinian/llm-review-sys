### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for simulating specific individuals using large language models (LLMs) through experience reconstruction and protective experiences. The authors construct detailed character profiles and fine-tune an LLM based on generated experiences, demonstrating that their model outperforms baselines like Alpaca and Vicuna, and is comparable to ChatGPT in terms of memorization and reducing hallucination. The evaluation process includes interviews and comparisons with baseline models, providing insights into the performance of the trained agents.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces an innovative framework for training agents to simulate specific individuals, which could advance character simulation research.
- The thorough methodology from profile gathering to LLM refinement is well-structured and practical.
- The evaluation process offers comprehensive insights into agent performance.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks critical implementation details, such as the specific architecture and training settings for the agents.
- There is insufficient comparison with additional baselines and a limited number of interview questions.
- The potential ethical concerns and limitations of using trainable agents are not adequately discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the implementation details by providing specific architecture and training settings used for the trainable agents. Additionally, we suggest expanding the evaluation to include comparisons with more baselines and a larger number of interview questions. It would also be beneficial for the authors to discuss the potential ethical concerns associated with using trainable agents and outline how they plan to address these issues.
