Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents sVORF, a method for unsupervised object-centric 3D representation learning that decomposes a single image into individual 3D objects and backgrounds. The authors propose three key techniques: a global pooling and slot-based scene decomposition, a hyper-network for generating per-object radiance fields, and a scene composition module. The method demonstrates superior performance on synthetic datasets like CLEVR and Room, and provides initial results on real images, indicating broader applicability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method significantly improves upon prior methods, particularly on the Room-Chair and Room-Diverse datasets.
2. The efficiency of the new modules, especially the combination of global pooling features with the slot-guided method, is commendable.
3. The overall performance is strong, with thorough experiments validating the method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks clarity on the effectiveness of individual components, as it does not compare the proposed hyper-network with alternatives like uORF or slot-attention.
2. The importance of connectivity regularization (CR) is not adequately explored, leaving its impact on performance unclear.
3. The simplicity of the datasets used for validation raises concerns about the model's generalization to more complex scenes.
4. The technical novelty is questioned, as the approach appears similar to previous works, particularly in its reliance on a hyper-network.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the contributions by providing a detailed ablation study that isolates the effects of the hyper-network and other components. Additionally, exploring the impact of connectivity regularization on previous methods would strengthen the findings. We suggest incorporating more complex datasets to demonstrate the model's effectiveness in challenging scenarios. Clarifying the training strategies and implementation details, such as the settings for K, would enhance the paper's comprehensibility. Finally, including qualitative comparisons and visualizations of learned object-level radiance fields would provide valuable insights into the method's performance.
