Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to interpretable models for tabular data, introducing Interpretable Mesomorphic Networks (IMN) that leverage deep hypernetworks to generate instance-specific linear models. The authors achieve a balance between high accuracy and interpretability by maintaining a non-linear global decision boundary while producing locally linear decision surfaces. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that IMN outperforms traditional white-box models and competes with state-of-the-art classifiers, providing both local and global interpretability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The method is intuitive and theoretically sound, effectively combining deep learning and linear model advantages.
2. Extensive experimental evidence supports IMN's effectiveness across various datasets, showcasing its applicability.
3. The approach allows for instance-level explanations and global feature importance analysis, enhancing interpretability.

Weaknesses:
1. The complexity of IMN's implementation and training may hinder practical deployment and maintenance.
2. The authors limit their baseline comparisons to interpretable classifiers, neglecting recent advancements in tabular data methodologies.
3. The interpretability study relies on well-studied datasets, which may limit the generalizability of the claims.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve their baseline comparisons by including a wider range of recent studies on tabular data. Additionally, it would be beneficial to discuss the similarities between their method and single-layer Transformers, particularly regarding interpretability. The authors should also clarify how the decision surface's rapid changes affect interpretability and explore the implications of regularizer strength on results. Finally, including detailed case studies from real-world applications and expanding the dataset selection to include more complex scenarios would strengthen the paper's claims.
