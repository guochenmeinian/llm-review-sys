Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a spike-based Bayesian inference framework for motion segmentation using event cameras. The authors design neurons that utilize STDP for online learning of motion patterns, enabling the framework to perform the M-step of the EM algorithm in motion segmentation of event streams. The WTA circuit implements the E-step, facilitating the online partitioning of event streams into distinct motion patterns. The authors provide theoretical proof and experimental results demonstrating the network's spatiotemporal decoupling capabilities for mixed motion patterns.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The authors demonstrate that the SNN framework based on WTA is equivalent to the EM algorithm for motion segmentation of event streams. This online learning approach is compatible with neuromorphic data and advantageous for deployment on low-power, low-latency neuromorphic computing platforms. The proposed framework is interpretable and applicable to various neuromorphic vision chips, representing a promising research direction.

Weaknesses:  
The experimental results lack quantitative evaluations, and the authors should perform object detection and tracking based on motion segmentation, providing metrics such as object detection success rates and comparisons with other methods. The proposed algorithm lacks an analysis of time complexity or processing speed, raising questions about its ability to leverage the low-latency advantage of event cameras. Additionally, the method's reliance on SVD for motion pattern initialization requires further justification, and ablation experiments are recommended to explore alternative methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their methodology by providing a more detailed description of the underlying model and optimization framework. Specifically, the authors should clarify the choice of $N_{\ell}$ (number of motion models) and the forms of the warping functions $W_j$. The authors should also address the relationship between their method and the EM algorithm, explicitly writing the conditional likelihood to describe the Expectation step. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to include quantitative evaluations and assess the dependency on parameter initialization, as well as explore the robustness of the method against noise in complex motion patterns.
