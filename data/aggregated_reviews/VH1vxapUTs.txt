Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a large-scale spatio-temporal Mesogeos Datacube with a resolution of 1km x 1km x 1day, encompassing weather measurements, vegetation, and human activity data from 2006-2022 in the Mediterranean region. The authors propose two wildfire modeling tasks: "wildfire danger forecasting" and "final burned area prediction," utilizing the datacube. The contributions include a standardized dataset that facilitates wildfire prediction research, a comprehensive comparison of the Mesogeos dataset with existing datasets, and a well-structured introduction to wildfire modeling for the ML community. The authors emphasize the importance of discussing the limitations of VIIRS and MODIS products, which are foundational to many wildfire datasets, and address challenges in modeling fire spread and integrating firefighting intervention data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and provides a comprehensive overview of the application domain.
- It introduces two standard yet challenging tasks to the ML community, enhancing wildfire modeling efforts.
- The creation of the Mesogeos dataset and accompanying ML models are significant contributions to wildfire prediction.
- The authors present a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset's advantages and limitations in relation to existing literature.
- The datacube serves as a valuable resource for researchers, streamlining access to relevant data.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset's large memory footprint may limit accessibility for some researchers.
- The training process for the predictor in Task 1 is somewhat confusing and lacks clarity.
- The reliance on MODIS active fire product, despite its noted inaccuracies, raises questions about the choice of ignition date determination.
- The dataset currently relies heavily on ERA5 and MODIS, suggesting a need for broader data incorporation.
- Some reviewers expressed concerns regarding the clarity of data distribution and balance in comparison to standard wildfire datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the training process for Task 1, particularly regarding the weighting scheme used for the loss function. It would be beneficial to explicitly model the level of risk as a multi-label classification problem rather than a binary one. Additionally, consider using the VIIRS active fire product for ignition date determination to enhance accuracy. To address the dataset's size, we suggest providing a smaller, manageable version for local use. We also recommend improving the clarity around the data distribution and explaining why the Mesogeos dataset is more balanced than standard wildfire datasets. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to incorporate a wider range of datasets beyond ERA5 and MODIS to enhance the robustness of the Mesogeos dataset and to expand the discussion on the challenges of modeling fire spread and the integration of firefighting intervention data, as this remains a critical aspect of wildfire management. Lastly, ensure that colorbars in Figures 2 and 3 are clearly labeled to enhance scientific rigor.
