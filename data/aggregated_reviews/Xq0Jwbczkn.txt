### Key Points
This paper presents a primal-dual algorithm for approximately solving the semi-discrete optimal transport problem, achieving a running time of $\log \Delta/\epsilon$ with improved graph size from $n^5$ to $n^3$. The algorithm constructs a residual graph using a $\delta$-expanded Voronoi diagram and augments the transport plan along admissible paths. It extends to any dimension $d > 2$ and any $p \ge 1$-Wasserstein distance. Additionally, it adapts existing solutions to provide a sub-linear time online algorithm for discrete optimal transport with fixed large sides.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper presents strong results that significantly enhance known methods for the semi-discrete optimal transport problem.
- The algorithm's theoretical complexity is greatly reduced compared to existing methods, and it is well-written, making complex ideas accessible.

Weaknesses:
- The work largely reworks recent results, particularly those of Agarwal et al., raising questions about the relevance of improving polynomial dependence.
- The lack of numerical experiments limits the assessment of practical applicability, and the validity of proofs cannot be fully verified.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors provide more background on the construction of the Voronoi diagram, specifically regarding the complexity involved. Additionally, it would be beneficial to discuss any lower bounds on the runtime of algorithms for the semi-discrete optimal transport problem and to compare Theorem 1.2 with other algorithms for the discrete optimal transport problem. Finally, we suggest including numerical experiments to demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed method.
