### Key Points
This paper presents a novel latent prompt Transformer model for molecule design, comprising three components: a latent vector generated by a Unet transformation of a Gaussian white noise vector, a molecule generation model utilizing a causal Transformer with the latent vector as a prompt, and a property prediction model employing non-linear regression on the latent vector. The model is trained using an approximate maximum likelihood learning algorithm and a gradual distribution shifting algorithm. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on molecule design tasks. Additionally, the paper introduces a new library, SYNTHESEUS, for evaluating retrosynthesis algorithms, discussing pitfalls and best practices, and offering a comprehensive collection of methods for both single-step and multi-step retrosynthesis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in molecule design tasks.  
- The figures and tables are clear and well-labeled.  
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.  
- The library SYNTHESEUS is comprehensive and includes various methods for retrosynthesis evaluation.  

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty of the research question is not sufficiently emphasized in the context of existing literature.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the emphasis on the novelty of the research question within the existing literature to better contextualize their contributions.
