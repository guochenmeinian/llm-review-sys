### Key Points
This paper presents a post-training confidence calibration framework, RECAL, that utilizes graph neural networks to model implicit sample relations in tabular data. The authors propose that this approach improves calibration quality compared to traditional methods, such as temperature scaling. Extensive experiments demonstrate the method's superiority across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The central idea of leveraging graph neural networks for understanding data relationships is compelling.
- The paper is well-written, particularly in the introduction and related work sections, making it accessible.
- The proposed method shows improved results over conventional calibration techniques.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental comparisons are limited to only two methods, lacking engagement with more recent calibration approaches, which may overstate the method's promise.
- The absence of source code raises concerns about reproducibility.
- The paper does not sufficiently contextualize its contributions against existing techniques.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including comparisons with additional calibration methods, such as isotonic regression, histogram binning, and Platt scaling, to better contextualize their contributions. Additionally, providing source code would enhance reproducibility and allow for a more thorough evaluation of the proposed method.
