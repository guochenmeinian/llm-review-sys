### Key Points
This paper presents a multi-level contrastive learning framework aimed at enhancing character understanding in scripts. It introduces two contrastive losses: summary-conversation loss for in-sample character information and cross-sample contrastive loss for capturing global features. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through extensive experiments across three tasks—coreference resolution, character linking, and character guessing—showing significant improvements over baseline models, including ChatGPT 3.5.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for the research is clear, emphasizing the importance of different text types and long-context descriptions in character understanding.
- Extensive empirical evaluation supports the effectiveness of the proposed method.
- The paper is well-structured and coherent, facilitating comprehension.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the contrastive loss approach is limited, as it follows conventional methods without significant advancements.
- The connection between text type, longer context, and contrastive learning lacks clarity, particularly regarding the choice of summaries and conversations as sources.
- The implementation details of the proposed methods, such as the extraction of character representations and the determination of training stage completion, are vague and insufficiently explained.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the character understanding task definition in Sections 3 and 4 by providing concrete examples at the beginning. Additionally, the authors should offer more intuition behind the necessity of their proposed methods and clarify the extraction process of character representations. It would also be beneficial to specify how the completion of the first training stage is determined. Finally, the authors should address the statistical significance of the reported improvements over baselines to strengthen their claims.
