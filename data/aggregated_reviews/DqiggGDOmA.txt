Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Evolutionary Adversarial Simulator Identification (EASI), a novel approach to sim-to-real transfer that utilizes a combination of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Evolutionary Strategies (ES) to optimize simulator parameters. EASI aims to align state transitions between simulation and reality, thereby enhancing policy transferability. The authors demonstrate that EASI outperforms traditional methods like Uniform Domain Randomization (UDR) across various tasks, indicating its potential for broader applications in robotics and reinforcement learning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- **Originality**: The integration of GANs with ES to tackle sim-to-real transfer is innovative.
- **Low Data Requirement**: EASI's effectiveness with minimal real-world data is a significant advancement.
- **Clear Exposition**: The paper is well-written, making complex concepts accessible.
- **Practical Impact**: EASI addresses the reality gap in robotics, offering a cost-effective solution with significant implications for real-world applications.

Weaknesses:
- **Methodological Concerns**: The use of Wasserstein GAN loss with clipped weights lacks novelty.
- **Experimental Limitations**: The experiments primarily focus on simpler tasks, with limited real-world applications, such as only using Cartpole for Sim to Real experiments.
- **Computational Resources**: The computational cost and scalability of EASI, particularly regarding high-dimensional state and action spaces, are not thoroughly discussed.
- **Lack of Technical Detail**: The GAN architecture and the processing of state transitions require further elaboration.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the GAN architecture and provide a detailed sensitivity analysis for hyperparameters used in both the GAN and ES components. Expanding the experimental validation to include more complex real-world scenarios, such as navigation tasks, would strengthen claims about EASI's applicability. Additionally, discussing the computational requirements and potential optimizations for training GANs and performing evolutionary searches would enhance practical deployment insights. Finally, addressing the scalability of EASI to high-dimensional state and action spaces, along with preliminary results, would be beneficial.
