Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for generating realistic strand hair geometry through a frequency-decomposed representation. The authors propose a hierarchical generative model that utilizes discrete cosine transform (DCT) and k-medoids clustering to create guide curves, effectively distinguishing fundamental hair shapes from complex details. The approach employs a permutation-equivariant architecture (PVCNN) to facilitate flexible modeling and hierarchical generation of hair strands across varying frequencies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The hierarchical approach ensures detailed and realistic hair geometry by transitioning from coarse to densely populated strands.
2. The innovative use of DCT for frequency decomposition avoids Gibbs' oscillation issues, enhancing the representation of hair curves.
3. K-medoids clustering effectively retains hairstyle characteristics, outperforming traditional UV grid sampling methods.
4. The permutation-equivariant architecture allows for flexible guide strand modeling, enabling the generation of strands with varying density.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of using DCT for hair curves is not sufficiently emphasized, as it is commonly used in other domains.
2. The performance of k-medoids clustering lacks clear demonstration and should be compared with other clustering techniques, such as k-means.
3. Insufficient comparisons with existing strand-based hair modeling methods, particularly with works like Wang et al. (2009), limit the paper's context.
4. The presentation quality is poor, making it difficult to follow, particularly in distinguishing implementation details from method details.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by enhancing the presentation quality, particularly in Section 3 and Figure 4. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with other state-of-the-art clustering techniques and hair modeling methods to validate the proposed approach. Further highlighting the novelty and advantages of using DCT specifically for hair curves could strengthen the paper's contributions. Lastly, ensuring fair and transparent comparisons with detailed explanations of all methods used in evaluations would enhance the credibility of the results presented.
