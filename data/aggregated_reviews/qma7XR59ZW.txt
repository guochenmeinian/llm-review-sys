### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for processing online trajectory similarity joins, addressing the challenge of identifying dissimilar trajectories that have not been recently updated. The authors propose a time-decaying similarity function and a multi-threaded framework to parallelize the similarity join across multiple partitions, incorporating load balancing and incremental updates. The evaluation is conducted using two real-world datasets, demonstrating that the proposed approach outperforms its variants and one existing method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for the research is practical and relevant.
- The introduction is well-written, featuring a vivid example that clarifies the research background.
- The use of real-world datasets for evaluation enhances the credibility of the findings.
- The paper is logically structured and easy to understand.

Weaknesses:
- The innovativeness of the proposed approach is somewhat limited compared to existing methods.
- The writing in the technical sections requires improvement for clarity.
- The experimental results are not convincing and lack comparisons with a broader range of existing methods.
- The motivation for the time-decaying similarity function is not fully justified, and its implications are not adequately explored.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the technical writing to enhance reader comprehension. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more thorough discussion on the rationale behind the exponential-decaying setting and explore whether alternative settings could achieve similar effects. It is crucial to clarify the differences between their approach and existing methods that utilize time windows. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include comparisons with a wider array of contemporary frameworks beyond the GHOST framework to strengthen the validation of their results. Lastly, addressing the parameter settings in Table 1 and ensuring consistency in reported values would enhance the paper's rigor.
