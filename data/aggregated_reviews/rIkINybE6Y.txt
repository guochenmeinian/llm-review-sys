### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of an information disclosure problem that adheres to inferential privacy constraints, extending previous work by relaxing perfect privacy to $\epsilon$-inferentially privacy. The authors focus on a binary-state setup, providing a geometric characterization of Blackwell-optimal solutions and deriving a closed-form solution for mechanism design with binary secrets and convex utility functions. However, the paper lacks sufficient examples and intuitions, particularly regarding the intractability of general cases and the dependency on the cardinality of the secret space.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The relaxation of perfect privacy to $\epsilon$-inferentially privacy is a significant extension of prior work.
- The results, particularly in the binary-state setup, are interesting and contribute to the literature on privacy in information design.
- The paper is well-written and includes helpful figures that enhance understanding.

Weaknesses:
- The paper is difficult to read due to a lack of examples and intuitions, especially regarding the challenges in finding sufficient conditions.
- Most results rely on binary secrets, and the applicability of techniques to broader problems is unclear.
- There is a lack of proofs for results in sections 2 and 3, and the novelty of the techniques is questionable, as they appear to be variants of existing arguments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by including more examples and intuitions, particularly explaining why general cases are intractable and the implications of the cardinality of the secret space. Additionally, we suggest providing proofs for results in sections 2 and 3 to substantiate the applicability of existing results to the current setup. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the key technical innovations in their work compared to [He et al. 2022] and to elaborate on the intuitions behind the definition of "H-L crossing blocks" in the proof for Lemma 4.3.
