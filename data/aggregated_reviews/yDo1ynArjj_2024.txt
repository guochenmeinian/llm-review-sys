Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Diffusion Forcing, a novel framework for probabilistic sequence modeling that integrates diffusion models with Bayesian filtering. The authors propose a method that allows for *independent* noise levels per sequence element, enhancing stability in autoregressive and guided generation. They introduce a new guidance technique for sequential decision-making, enabling the generation of the next token based on the full distribution of future tokens. The empirical results demonstrate the framework's general applicability beyond text generation, showcasing its effectiveness in various domains such as video prediction and planning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work significantly advances the integration of diffusion models with autoregressive models, demonstrating substantial improvements in performance.
- The methodology is technically sound, supported by formal proofs and extensive experiments across diverse applications.
- The experimental section is comprehensive, addressing long-range video generation, planning, compositional generation, and multivariate time series forecasting.

Weaknesses:
- The intuition regarding the effects of noising on long-horizon generation is closely aligned with concepts from related work, AR-Diffusion, which may obscure the unique contribution of *independent* noise levels.
- The experiments do not directly compare Causal Diffusion Forcing with AR-Diffusion, which would be a relevant benchmark, although this may require significant adaptation.
- Certain appendices, such as B.6, lack references in the main text, which could enhance clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the distinction between *independent* noise levels and the related work AR-Diffusion, particularly in terms of stability and conditioning on corrupted observations. Additionally, consider providing a comparison with AR-Diffusion that does not necessitate extensive code refactoring, perhaps by modifying the CDF method to use linearly dependent noise levels. 

We also suggest enhancing the organization of the paper to improve readability, particularly by clearly delineating the proposed Diffusion Forcing method, its theoretical analysis, and its capabilities. Furthermore, clarify the figures to ensure they effectively communicate the sampling process. 

Lastly, addressing minor typographical and formatting issues will improve the overall presentation of the paper.
