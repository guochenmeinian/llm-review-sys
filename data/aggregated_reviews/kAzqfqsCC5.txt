### Key Points
This paper presents a significant advancement in personalized web agents, introducing the PUMA (Personalized User Memory-enhanced Alignment) framework and the PersonalWAB (Personalized Web Agent Benchmark). The authors argue that traditional web agents lack the necessary personalization to enhance user experience and propose solutions to address this gap. The paper details the construction of PersonalWAB using real-world Amazon review data, focusing on personalized search, recommendation, and review tasks. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PUMA, demonstrating improvements in accuracy and operational efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a critical gap in web automation by emphasizing personalization, which has been overlooked by previous LLM-based web agents.
2. The introduction of PersonalWAB provides a much-needed benchmark for evaluating personalized web agents.
3. The PUMA framework innovatively integrates personalized user data with task-specific retrieval strategies, enhancing the alignment of LLMs with user actions.

Weaknesses:
1. The benchmark does not effectively simulate user queries that encompass multiple demands, limiting its applicability.
2. The distinction between recommendation and search functions is not meaningful for real users, as the simulated ground truth reflects only GPT's understanding.
3. There is insufficient detail regarding the proposed agent's prompts, hindering comprehension of the information available to the agent.
4. The paper does not address potential ethical concerns or privacy issues related to the use of personalized user data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the sampling process and explicitly state how user data quantity is ensured for PUMA's effectiveness. Additionally, the authors should clarify the potential interference from GPT's memory of user data when generating and validating user profiles. It is essential to address the benchmark's limitations in simulating complex user queries and to provide a more meaningful distinction between recommendation and search functions. Finally, we suggest that the authors discuss ethical considerations regarding the use of personalized data in web automation.
