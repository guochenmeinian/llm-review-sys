### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework, NetCB, that integrates heterogeneous spillover effects into contextual multi-armed bandits (CMAB) for recommendation systems within social networks. The authors propose a method that fuses dynamic neighborhood features with user context attributes to maximize bandit rewards by considering network spillover. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's efficacy across various real-world and semi-synthetic datasets, highlighting its potential to enhance recommender systems by providing personalized recommendations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The framework is innovative, addressing the impact of heterogeneous spillover in networks, which is a significant contribution to CMAB models.
- The methodology is well-structured, supported by rigorous experiments, and demonstrates clear improvements over traditional methods.
- The writing is generally clear, effectively explaining complex concepts through formulas and examples.

Weaknesses:
- The model assumes uniform activation probabilities for users, failing to account for variations in influence susceptibility, which limits its ability to address heterogeneity in spillover.
- The datasets primarily focus on network classification, suggesting a need for broader dataset inclusion, particularly those relevant to recommendation systems and influence maximization.
- Some mathematical descriptions are overly dense, which may hinder accessibility for a wider audience.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the dynamic feature set and how spillover effects are quantified. Additionally, addressing the uniformity of activation probabilities by allowing for user-specific variations could enhance the model's applicability. We suggest comparing the proposed framework against state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods to strengthen the results. Furthermore, providing a hyperparameter sensitivity analysis and clarifying the basis for parameter settings would improve the manuscript's rigor. Lastly, exploring the framework's adaptability to low-homophily networks and its handling of cold-start problems would be beneficial.
