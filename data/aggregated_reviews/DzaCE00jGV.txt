Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Sparse Additive Mechanism Shift Variational Autoencoder (SAMS-VAE), an extension of the VAE model designed for single-cell RNA sequencing data. The authors propose a generative model that incorporates sparse perturbations in latent variables, aiming to recover latent variations and improve out-of-distribution predictions. The model is evaluated on CRISPR perturb-seq datasets, demonstrating some improvements in predicting biological pathways and interpretability of the latent space.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper articulates appropriate assumptions for expression data and presents a clear methodology.
- Empirical results show that the model outperforms baselines like SVAE+ and maintains or improves likelihood while enforcing sparsity.
- The manuscript is generally well-written and reproducible, making it accessible to the research community.

Weaknesses:
- The connection between sparsity and causality is tenuous; making a model sparse does not inherently imply it captures causal relationships.
- The benefits of SAMS-VAE over the CPA-VAE baseline are not clearly articulated, and performance differences appear insignificant.
- The paper lacks a self-contained discussion on disentanglement concepts and the rationale behind certain design choices, such as the additive structure of perturbations.
- Figures 2 and 3 are not adequately discussed, leading to ambiguity in interpreting results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the benefits of SAMS-VAE compared to CPA-VAE, possibly through additional experiments. It would be beneficial to include a more comprehensive discussion on the biological interpretation of clusters and the implications of the latent variables. We suggest that the authors provide more background on disentanglement concepts and clarify their design choices, particularly regarding the additive structure of perturbations. Additionally, addressing the limitations of the model in a dedicated section would enhance the paper's rigor. Finally, including UMAP visualizations for baseline models and refining the title to reflect the specific application focus would improve the manuscript's clarity and relevance.
