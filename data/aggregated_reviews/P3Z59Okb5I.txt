Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents EvoFed, a novel method that integrates Evolutionary Strategies (ES) with Federated Learning (FL) to mitigate the high communication costs associated with traditional FL. Instead of transmitting model parameters, EvoFed communicates fitness values derived from a population of perturbed models, which reflect the similarity to locally updated models. The authors demonstrate that EvoFed can compress model communication by over 98% on datasets like FMNIST and CIFAR-10 while maintaining performance comparable to FedAvg.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed EvoFed is a novel and compelling application of evolutionary strategies in FL, effectively reducing communication costs.
2. The theoretical foundation is sound, with convergence analysis and motivation from population-based gradient estimation.
3. The integration of privacy enhancements through Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) is a significant advantage.
4. The supplementary material includes extensive experimental studies, covering various population sizes and partitioning methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The empirical evaluation is limited to small datasets (FMNIST and CIFAR-10), which may not reflect performance on more complex datasets like CIFAR-100.
2. The local update epoch is set to one; further investigation into multiple local epochs and their impact on accuracy is necessary.
3. Some theoretical aspects, such as the clarity of Theorem 1 and the definitions of certain parameters, require further elaboration.
4. The paper's presentation is at times unclear, with some sentences difficult to follow and abbreviations not defined.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical evaluation by including more complex datasets to validate the performance of EvoFed. Additionally, the authors should explore the effects of increasing the local update epochs and report the findings. Clarifying the theoretical aspects, particularly regarding Theorem 1 and the definitions of parameters like eta and b_j, will enhance the paper's rigor. Finally, we suggest a thorough proofreading to improve clarity and readability, particularly in sections where model partitioning and abbreviations are discussed.
