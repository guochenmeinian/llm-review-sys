Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a diffusion-based generative approach for daily articulated objects, introducing a novel graph representation that outputs part shapes and joint configurations. The authors propose a transformer network to accommodate this graph structure in the generative process. Evaluated on the Part-Mobility dataset, the method shows superior performance over both non-diffusion and diffusion-based baselines, with applications in conditional generation on synthetic datasets. The paper also introduces a new distance metric for evaluating generated articulated objects. Additionally, the authors integrate Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) and provide detailed explanations of their methodology, including the parameterization of nodes and edges in the object graph, and propose a structured representation of rigid parts and articulation constraints.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses the novel task of generating daily articulated objects, which is previously unexplored.
- The proposed approach exhibits superior generative performance both qualitatively and quantitatively compared to baselines.
- The method demonstrates generalizability to unseen datasets and introduces interesting conditional generative applications.
- The authors effectively respond to reviewer feedback, demonstrating a commitment to refining their work.
- The visualization of failure cases and schematic representations enhances comprehension of the proposed methods.
- The technical merits of the paper are significant, particularly in the context of articulated object generation.

Weaknesses:
- The writing quality is insufficient for a conference paper, with inconsistent notations and unclear explanations.
- Concerns regarding the clarity of writing and claims persist, necessitating further refinement.
- The evaluation metrics may not adequately assess the novelty of generated objects, particularly given the small dataset size.
- The limited size of the dataset remains a point of contention, potentially impacting the generalizability of the findings.
- The task simplifies articulated object generation by focusing only on objects in a rest state, which may not represent all models in the dataset.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the writing quality by addressing inconsistent notations and providing clearer explanations of the methodology. Specifically, clarify the transformation from local to global coordinates and ensure consistent font usage throughout. Additionally, we suggest adding visualizations for qualitative ablation studies, failure cases, and a schematic of variables described in Section 3.1. To enhance evaluation, consider methods to assess the novelty of generated objects more effectively, such as comparing generated models to the nearest training samples. Finally, address the limitations of the dataset and the assumptions made in the model more explicitly in the final version, and ensure that all identified writing errors and questions are adequately resolved before submitting the camera-ready version.
