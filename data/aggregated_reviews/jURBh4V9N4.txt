Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new method for training diffusion models from corrupted data using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The method involves sampling clean images from noisy inputs and utilizing these samples to train the diffusion model. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on data corrupted by noise, blurring, and missing pixels, claiming convergence to the true data distribution.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a simple and elegant idea that is conceptually strong and applicable to various fields, such as scientific imaging.
- The structure is well-organized, clearly presenting the components of score-based diffusion models, posterior sampling, and the EM algorithm.
- Extensive experiments validate the proposed method, addressing a significant challenge in scenarios with limited clean datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation lacks convincing qualitative results, with visible artifacts in the outputs, raising concerns about the training process.
- The requirement for a limited amount of clean data for initialization is a notable limitation.
- The assumption of Gaussian noise in the forward model may restrict the method's applicability.
- The paper does not adequately address the conditions under which convergence to the true data distribution is claimed, nor does it quantify the minimal clean data required.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by providing more comprehensive comparisons with baselines across various corruption levels and datasets. Specifically, they should remove results related to tasks beyond inpainting unless the methodology satisfies the necessary theoretical conditions. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the claims regarding convergence to the true data distribution and discussing the implications of different forward operators on this convergence. Finally, addressing the potential for including other degradation models, such as a combination of Gaussian and Poisson noise, would enhance the method's applicability in real-world scenarios.
