Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents LE-SINR, a novel approach for estimating species range maps (SRMs) by integrating citizen science observations with textual descriptions from Wikipedia. The framework extends the previous SINR model, utilizing two branches—one for location and one for text—to predict species presence based on location and textual descriptions. LE-SINR demonstrates superior performance in zero-shot and few-shot range estimation, showcasing its potential for enhancing species range estimation accuracy through textual data integration.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The framework is among the first to incorporate textual descriptions for species distribution modeling, enabling zero-shot species mapping.
- A novel dataset of 37,889 species articles from Wikipedia is compiled, which can serve as a training/benchmarking resource for ecological tasks and large language models.
- LE-SINR exhibits strong few-shot and zero-shot performance compared to the baseline SINR.
- The paper is well-structured and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The authors present zero-results of LE-SINR using range-text or habitat-text as input, which may lead to model "cheating" since such text may not be available to end users.
- Key results are missing, such as the significance of improved zero-shot performance when training species representations jointly and fully-supervised/oracle results for LE-SINR.
- The technical novelty is limited as the framework builds on SINR, which lacks high-frequency spatial information capture. Comparisons with recent location encoding frameworks are absent.
- There is insufficient discussion on the learning outcomes of the text encoder branch, including its ability to capture species taxonomy hierarchy and spatial correlations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the zero-results presented, ensuring that the input text aligns with realistic user scenarios. Additionally, please provide significant metrics for the joint training of species representations and include fully-supervised results for a clearer comparison with SINR. It would be beneficial to compare LE-SINR with other recent location encoding frameworks to highlight its novelty. We also suggest including a discussion on the text encoder's learning outcomes, particularly regarding taxonomy and spatial correlations. Lastly, we advise revising the presentation of loss functions for better understandability and clarity.
