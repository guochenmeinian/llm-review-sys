### Key Points
This paper presents TFGNN, a novel approach to polynomial selection in spectral graph neural networks (GNNs) by connecting polynomial approximation errors to network performance. The authors establish a theoretical foundation linking polynomial capabilities to spectral GNN efficacy through an error-sum of function slices framework. They introduce a parameter-efficient trigonometric polynomial-based graph filter, validated on benchmark node classification tasks and graph anomaly detection applications, demonstrating its scalability and performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper establishes a clear theoretical connection between polynomial approximation capabilities and spectral GNN performance.
2. The authors provide solid theoretical analysis and comprehensive experimental validation across multiple datasets.
3. The proposed trigonometric polynomial-based graph filter is parameter-efficient, addressing computational efficiency concerns in spectral GNNs.
4. The writing is clear and accessible, with code availability enhancing reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
1. The description of the first contribution regarding the connection between polynomial approximation error and construction error is inaccurate, as it does not require function slices for clarification.
2. The numerical experiments lack polynomial fitting curves, hindering visual observation of polynomial approximations.
3. The effectiveness of the trigonometric filter for complex graph tasks remains untested.
4. Some sections are overly verbose, complicating the paper's clarity, and the related works section is relegated to the appendix.
5. The Taylor-based parameter decomposition may introduce additional approximation errors and increase implementation complexity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the accuracy of the description of their first contribution by clarifying that the polynomial approximation error and construction error are inherently connected without needing function slices. Additionally, we suggest including polynomial fitting curves in the numerical experiments to facilitate visual comparisons of approximations. It would be beneficial to conduct experiments evaluating the trigonometric filter's effectiveness on more complex graph tasks. We also advise revising verbose sections to enhance clarity and relocating the related works section to the main body of the paper. Finally, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the derivation of parameters in their equations to clarify their significance and obtain a deeper understanding of the saturation effect observed with varying polynomial degrees.
