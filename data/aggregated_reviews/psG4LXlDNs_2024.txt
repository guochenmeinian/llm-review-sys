Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the linear program formulation of constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs), proposing an algorithm that operates in the primal space and achieves a sample complexity of \(O(1/\epsilon)\), improving upon the previous \(O(1/\epsilon^2)\) bound. The authors characterize the instance hardness of CMDPs and derive a problem-dependent sample complexity bound of \(\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon)\). The algorithm utilizes an elimination procedure to identify an optimal basis and adapts to remaining resources, ensuring near-optimal policy performance with fewer samples.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a strong sample complexity result for CMDPs, breaking the \(O(1/\epsilon^2)\) barrier.
- The theoretical results are clearly presented, and the proposed framework has potential applications in broader online LP problems.

Weaknesses:
- The introduction and related work sections lack comprehensiveness, particularly in comparing the proposed method with existing policy-based approaches.
- The paper does not include numerical simulations, which would help illustrate the algorithm's convergence rate and efficiency.
- The presentation of contributions is unclear, particularly regarding the motivation and implications of the new characterizations of problem instance hardness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction and related work sections to provide a more comprehensive literature review, particularly addressing the dependency of sample complexity on problem-related parameters. Additionally, it would be beneficial to clarify the contributions of the paper, especially the motivation behind the new characterizations of problem instance hardness and their relevance to the algorithm's development. We also suggest including preliminary numerical experiments to demonstrate the algorithm's efficiency compared to existing methods. Lastly, addressing the notation and definitions used in the paper, such as "problem instance hardness," would enhance clarity for readers unfamiliar with the terminology.
