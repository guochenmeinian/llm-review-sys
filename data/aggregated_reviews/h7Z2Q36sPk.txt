Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SynRS3D, a novel synthetic dataset aimed at enhancing global 3D semantic understanding from monocular remote sensing (RS) imagery. SynRS3D includes 69,667 high-resolution optical images with diverse city styles and land cover types, providing valuable annotations for land cover mapping and height estimation. Additionally, the authors propose RS3DAda, a multi-task unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method designed to bridge the gap between synthetic and real-world RS data. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and adaptability of SynRS3D and RS3DAda in real-world scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- SynRS3D is the largest synthetic RS dataset, with extensive geographic and semantic coverage.
- RS3DAda provides a novel approach to domain adaptation, improving performance on real-world RS tasks.
- The dataset and method are well-documented, enhancing reproducibility.
- Comprehensive benchmarking experiments validate the contributions.

Weaknesses:
- Despite RS3DAda, there remains a noticeable performance gap between synthetic and real-world data.
- The UDA method's specificity to RS may limit its applicability to other fields.
- Initial overfitting during training indicates a need for further refinement of the UDA method.
- The generated images lack realism and may not fully capture real-world complexities.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the realism of the generated images by applying unsupervised style transfer or unpaired image-to-image translation methods. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the clarity of the related work section by providing more comparisons with existing non-synthetic datasets. The authors should also consider reducing the number of figures and tables to improve readability and ensure that all captions are sufficiently detailed for standalone understanding. Finally, we advise documenting the random seed used for data splits to enhance reproducibility.
