Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel curriculum learning method for graph neural networks (GNNs) focused on node classification, termed Relational Curriculum Learning (RCL). The method progressively incorporates edges based on their difficulty, determined by the model's performance in predicting them. The authors argue that traditional curriculum learning (CL) methods are not designed to manage the dependencies between nodes in graph data, which is critical for effective learning. They propose that their method, which adapts pacing functions for edge selection, outperforms existing methods, as evidenced by experimental results showing significant accuracy improvements, including an average performance increase of 3.3% across seven datasets. The study includes extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating substantial accuracy improvements and robustness against noisy edges.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research addresses a critical problem in graph learning by focusing on the varying difficulties of edges.
- The self-supervised approach to measure edge difficulties is innovative and well-motivated.
- The proposed method demonstrates consistent performance improvements over the CLNode method across various datasets and GNN backbone models, achieving statistically significant results.
- The authors provide a clear rationale for the importance of edge curriculum learning and its distinction from traditional node-focused CL methods.

Weaknesses:
- Improvements on real-world datasets are marginal, raising questions about the method's effectiveness in practical applications.
- Some reviewers express skepticism regarding the validity of the challenges presented, suggesting that they may not be universally applicable to CL methods on graphs.
- The paper lacks clarity in its writing, with several grammatical mistakes and obscured presentation of key concepts, particularly regarding the use of Lagrange multipliers and the description of the optimization process.
- The choice of baseline methods for experiments is limited, primarily using basic GNNs, which may not adequately represent the state-of-the-art performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing, particularly in the introduction and the explanation of the proposed model's challenges. Addressing grammatical issues and ensuring that key concepts, such as the function \( g(S;\lambda) \), are more prominently defined would enhance readability. It would be beneficial to revise the title to "Edge Curriculum Learning for Node Classification with Graph Neural Networks" to better reflect the model's focus. Additionally, we suggest including a comparison with modern GNNs, such as PNA, to validate the method's performance across a broader range of architectures. The authors should also address the limitations of the proposed approach more thoroughly, particularly regarding its reliance on pre-trained models and the marginal improvements observed in real-world datasets. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the edge selection process and the implications of the optimization model used in the curriculum learning framework. Presenting different pacing functions as a central experiment rather than relegating them to the appendix would also be beneficial. Finally, considering incorporating skip-connections in their experiments to align with state-of-the-art practices would strengthen the study.
