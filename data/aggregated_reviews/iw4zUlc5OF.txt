### Key Points
This paper presents a study on distinguishing between text generated by language models and human-written text. It investigates the effectiveness of a detector trained on outputs from different decoder-based language models, revealing that a medium-sized model can effectively detect text produced by a large model. The authors propose a pruning method that excludes large model-generated text, which outperforms baseline ensemble techniques. However, the experimental setup lacks concrete and practical elements, raising concerns about the validity of the conclusions drawn.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study conducts diverse and rigorous experiments with various language models.
- It challenges the intuitive belief that larger models produce text that is harder to discriminate.
- The findings suggest that excluding large model-generated text can enhance detection of AI-generated text.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental setup is insufficiently concrete, particularly regarding the diversity of human writing data and its distribution.
- The method of generating text from language models is overly simplistic, potentially misleading conclusions about detection capabilities.
- The binary classifier used may not reliably distinguish between human and machine-generated text due to biases in the datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental setup by incorporating a more diverse and representative dataset of human writing to avoid bias. Additionally, consider employing a more sophisticated method for generating text from language models, rather than relying on the initial 20 truncated tokens. It would also be beneficial to explore different classifiers and provide a comparison with other detector models beyond ELECTRA-large. Finally, enhancing the clarity of the Datasets section and the results presentation would significantly improve the paper's comprehensibility.
