Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel concept called *parameter markets*, serving as a platform for exchanging parameters learned by machine learning models. The authors propose a framework where agents can trade parameters for mutual benefits or monetary gains. Key contributions include defining parameter value, establishing pricing mechanisms, and outlining transaction processes. The authors explore competitive and collaborative scenarios, demonstrating the advantages of trading through empirical experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The idea of trading parameters is innovative and distinct from data markets, addressing a relevant problem.
2. The formulation is comprehensive, and empirical experiments adequately support the claims.
3. The paper is well-written and accessible.

Weaknesses:
1. The framework's viability hinges on ensuring model privacy and alignment.
2. Theorem 4.1's reliance on the broker having access to $\theta^*$ is a strong assumption.
3. There is a lack of discussion on incentives, particularly regarding agent misreporting their valuations. The use of the Cobb-Douglas utility function is also unclear.
4. The analysis is limited to a two-agent setting, raising questions about scalability and practical implementation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the limitations of their framework, particularly regarding the assumptions made about the broker's knowledge and the valuation functions. Additionally, we suggest incorporating a mechanism design perspective to address potential incentive misalignments. The authors should clarify the rationale behind the Cobb-Douglas utility function and explore how the model could extend to more than two agents. A more extensive evaluation of the proposed framework's performance against additional baselines would also enhance the paper's contributions.
