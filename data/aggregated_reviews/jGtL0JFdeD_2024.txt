### Key Points
This paper investigates inconsistencies in findings regarding uncertainty quantifications in LLMs, utilizing various methods such as entropy-based techniques and sequence probabilities across seven models of differing sizes. The authors propose that the performance of sequence probabilities may be influenced by confounding factors. The critique of the ROUGE-L metric is particularly notable, highlighting its tendency to favor higher scores and suggesting the need for similar evaluations of other metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The selection of LLMs and datasets is well-justified.
- The critique is thorough and well-targeted, with clear comparisons between ROUGE-L and LLM-graders.
- The introduction is engaging and the paper's layout is clear and well-structured.
- The exploration of the ROUGE-L metric contributes valuable insights to the community, particularly regarding metric choices and their impact on LLM performance.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a list of actionable recommendations following the critique, which diminishes its practical utility.
- The lengthy introduction to formalism may be more suited for a thesis than a conference paper, and the relevance of the sampling methods could be better signposted.
- There is no summary detail provided for ROUGE-L, which could enhance understanding.
- The conclusions drawn from the comparison of studies [10] and [11] may not be as contradictory as suggested, and the findings could benefit from additional exploration of benchmark variations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including a list of actionable recommendations at the conclusion of their critique. Additionally, we suggest condensing the introduction to formalism and enhancing the signposting of relevant sections. Providing a summary detail for ROUGE-L would also be beneficial. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore variations across benchmarks in the appendix and to better support claims regarding temperature variations and budget considerations for evaluation sets.
