Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new kernel, KMERF, for independence testing, utilizing random forests for kernel construction. The authors demonstrate that KMERF is asymptotically characteristic and exhibits better statistical power than existing methods. The method combines random forest proximity with distance correlation and a chi-square test for hypothesis testing, proving its validity for large sample sizes. The experimental results indicate that KMERF outperforms other tests in various simulation settings and successfully identifies significant biomarkers in real data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is impressive, well-organized, and easy to implement, inheriting the advantages of random forests.
- The paper is well-written, with a solid theoretical analysis and convincing experimental results.
- KMERF's ability to estimate feature importance is a notable advantage.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation is poor, particularly in explaining the connection between random forests and kernel methods, leaving the novelty unclear.
- The related work on random forests for hypothesis testing is not adequately surveyed, limiting the evaluation of KMERF's novelty.
- Concerns about potential inflation from post-selection inference due to the learned kernel remain unaddressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation by providing detailed explanations of random forests and their relationship to kernel methods, as this is crucial for understanding the paper's contributions. Additionally, conducting calibration tests for KMERF to address concerns about post-selection inference would strengthen the validity of the results. It would also be beneficial to include more comprehensive details in the figures, such as parameter values and exact equations, and to conduct a thorough review of existing random forest-based kernels to clarify KMERF's novelty.
