Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the intersection of differential privacy (DP) and selective classification (SC). The authors analyze various SC methods under the DP-SGD framework, revealing that stronger privacy constraints can lead to overconfidence in incorrect predictions. A new metric is introduced to evaluate SC performance under DP, which accounts for baseline accuracy. The findings indicate that the SCTD approach, which utilizes intermediate model checkpoints, performs best in this context.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is the first to empirically explore the degradation of selective classification performance under differential privacy, addressing significant questions in the field.
- The experimental evaluation is extensive, covering various SC techniques and providing valuable insights into their performance under DP.
- The proposed metric effectively evaluates SC performance across different levels of coverage, contributing to the community's understanding of the interplay between SC and DP.

Weaknesses:
- The exclusive reliance on DP-SGD for differential privacy implementation raises questions, as other methods exist that could be explored.
- The grouping of SC techniques lacks sufficient justification, particularly regarding why certain techniques are categorized as "free" or affect utility.
- The necessity and clarity of the new evaluation metric remain unclear, with concerns about its interpretation and the implications of its formulation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the proposed metrics, particularly Definition 3.1, to enhance clarity and understanding. Additionally, we suggest providing more justification for the grouping of SC techniques, especially regarding their impact on privacy and utility. It would also be beneficial to clarify the significance of the new evaluation metric and its advantages over existing metrics, particularly in the context of private selective classification.
