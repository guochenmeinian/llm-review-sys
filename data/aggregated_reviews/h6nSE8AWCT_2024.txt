Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Test-time Procrustes Calibration (TPC), an alignment algorithm aimed at enhancing human image animation systems by addressing misalignment between reference images and target poses. TPC provides a calibrated reference image latent, improving fidelity and consistency in animation. The authors propose that TPC can be applied model-agnostically to any diffusion-based animation system, enhancing performance without additional training.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper tackles a significant problem in human image animation, particularly regarding shape differences between reference and target images.
2. The structure is well-organized, making it easy to follow.
3. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TPC, with improvements in robustness and temporal consistency.

Weaknesses:
1. The necessity of TPC is questioned, as aligning images directly may be a simpler solution.
2. The method of injecting guided images into the model requires more than just cross-attention; its effectiveness in non-cross-attention contexts is unclear.
3. The introduction lacks clarity regarding the gains from TPC, which may be better suited for the methods or experiments section.
4. Some demo results exhibit artifacts, and the background details do not consistently align with the reference images.
5. The implementation details of Iterative Propagation are insufficiently comprehensive.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction by reorganizing it to better highlight the contributions of TPC. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed description of the training process and consider including an algorithm table for Iterative Propagation. We suggest conducting quantitative and qualitative comparisons between TPC and existing skeleton alignment algorithms to substantiate its effectiveness. Furthermore, addressing the background alignment issues in the demos and exploring the handling of partial body visibility in reference images would strengthen the paper.
