Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents AVATAR, a novel framework designed to optimize large language model (LLM) agents for knowledge retrieval tasks. The framework incorporates a Comparator agent that generates holistic instructions through contrastive reasoning on batches of positive and negative queries. Experimental results demonstrate AVATAR's effectiveness across four retrieval datasets, showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines like ReAct and Reflexion.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The comparator module's use of contrastive reasoning to generate holistic instructions is an innovative approach that enhances agent performance.
2. The paper provides clear motivation and insightful analogies, making the core concepts accessible.
3. Strong empirical results indicate that AVATAR consistently outperforms established baselines across multiple datasets.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks innovation compared to existing works like ExpeL and Autoguide, as it does not sufficiently differentiate its contributions.
2. The evaluation scope is limited, with comparisons primarily against outdated methods rather than more recent, cutting-edge approaches.
3. The clarity of the presentation is compromised by obscure language and insufficient explanations of key concepts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their work by conducting more comprehensive comparisons with recent methods such as ExpeL and Retroformer, rather than relying on basic baselines. Additionally, the authors should clarify the optimization process, particularly regarding the sampling of positive and negative queries and the criteria for stopping iterations. To enhance clarity, we suggest revising obscure sentences and providing concrete examples to illustrate complex concepts. Finally, including a dedicated limitations and broader impacts section would strengthen the paper by addressing computational requirements and potential failure modes.
