Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Environmental-context Validated lAtent Program Synthesis framework (EVAPS), which enhances program synthesis for robotic applications by utilizing a trail-eval-repair loop to improve generalization and rectify erroneous program segments. EVAPS operates in partially observed environments, leveraging candidate programs from existing synthesizers and capturing environmental context through execution traces. Evaluated in the Vizdoom domain, the results indicate that EVAPS outperforms baseline methods in modeling program semantics and resolving errors.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- EVAPS effectively synthesizes robot programs in partially observed environments, addressing a significant challenge in real-world robotic tasks.
- The iterative trail-eval-repair loop enhances program generalizability by correcting potentially erroneous code segments.
- The framework demonstrates robustness against noisy observations and is supported by comprehensive experimental evaluations.

Weaknesses:
- The title may overstate the contribution of the research, and the choice of the Vizdoom environment raises concerns about its representativeness for diverse robotic tasks, particularly those involving object manipulation.
- The evaluation lacks a convincing argument for the applicability of EVAPS in more complex, realistic environments like Miniworld and AI2-Thor.
- The paper does not sufficiently clarify the distinction between global and partial observations, nor does it provide insightful evaluations linking the motivation for partial observability to the proposed architecture.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the title to better reflect the contributions of the research. Additionally, we suggest conducting evaluations of EVAPS in more realistic environments, such as Miniworld and AI2-Thor, to assess its applicability across a broader range of robotic tasks. It would also be beneficial to provide a more detailed explanation of the differences between global and partial observations and to include insightful evaluations that connect the motivation for partial observability with the proposed architecture. Finally, addressing the writing quality by reducing repetitive language and clarifying the assumptions regarding the execution of candidate programs in real-time control scenarios would enhance the overall presentation.
