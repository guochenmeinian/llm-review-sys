Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel offline reinforcement learning approach called Diffusion-DICE, which integrates diffusion models with DICE-based methods. The authors propose a guide-then-select paradigm to minimize error exploitation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on D4RL benchmark tasks. The paper introduces a new representation of the optimal policy model and its training method, termed In-sample Guidance Learning (IGL), which circumvents the limitations of previous methods that require multiple samples from the behavior policy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of diffusion models with DICE-based methods is well-motivated and novel.
- The theoretical justification for the approach is well-written.
- Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements over prior diffusion-policy baselines.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation is challenging, with several equations lacking definitions for variables, leading to potential confusion.
- The selection of D4RL datasets is limited, missing expert/random datasets and other environments like Adroit.
- There is a lack of comparison with more optimal Gaussian policy methods in Table 1, and the discussion of hyperparameter choices is insufficiently detailed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by defining all variables in equations and ensuring that overlapping variables are clearly distinguished. Additionally, we suggest expanding the dataset selection to include expert/random datasets and other relevant environments. A comparison of the inference speed of Diffusion-DICE with prior baselines would also enhance the paper's contribution. Finally, including a discussion of hyperparameter choices in the experimental section would provide valuable context for readers.
