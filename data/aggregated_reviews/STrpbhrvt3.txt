Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Knowledge-enhanced Bottlenecks (KnoBo), a concept bottleneck model designed to address the sensitivity of deep networks to domain shifts in medical image analysis, specifically for chest X-rays and skin lesion images. The authors propose incorporating explicit medical knowledge from resources like textbooks and PubMed to enhance generalization. KnoBo utilizes retrieval-augmented language models to establish a clinically relevant concept space, achieving an average performance improvement of 32.4% over fine-tuned models across 20 datasets. The evaluation demonstrates KnoBo's effectiveness in mitigating domain shifts, particularly highlighting PubMed as a valuable knowledge resource.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Innovative Integration of Medical Knowledge: The introduction of KnoBo effectively incorporates explicit medical knowledge into deep networks, enhancing generalization capabilities.
- Comprehensive Evaluation Across Diverse Domain Shifts: The extensive testing across 20 datasets and two imaging modalities showcases KnoBo's robustness in handling various domain shifts.
- Significant Performance Improvement: The model's substantial performance gains underscore the effectiveness of integrating medical knowledge to reduce sensitivity to domain shifts.

Weaknesses:
- Lack of Application to 3D Medical Imaging: The focus on 2D modalities raises concerns about the generalizability of KnoBo to critical 3D imaging scenarios, such as CT scans or MRIs.
- Insufficient Comparative Analysis with 3D Domain Adaptation Methods: The absence of comparisons with existing 3D domain adaptation techniques limits the evaluation of KnoBo's effectiveness relative to state-of-the-art methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the applicability of KnoBo by expanding the research to include 3D medical imaging modalities, such as CT scans or MRIs. Discussing potential adaptations and preliminary results for 3D imaging could provide valuable insights. Additionally, including a detailed comparative analysis with advanced domain adaptation techniques tailored for 3D medical imaging would strengthen the paper, offering clearer benchmarks and highlighting KnoBo's unique advantages and limitations. Furthermore, enhancing the clarity of the presentation by providing examples and addressing confusing results would improve the overall readability and understanding of the methodology.
