Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents **dattri**, an open-source library aimed at enhancing the development, benchmarking, and deployment of data attribution methods in machine learning. It features a unified API for PyTorch users, modularized utility functions, and a comprehensive benchmark suite that includes pre-trained models and various performance metrics such as LOO, AUC, and LDS. The library primarily focuses on gradient-based data attribution methods, while the absence of game-theoretic approaches like Data Shapley and Data Banzhaf is noted as a limitation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- **Unified API and Ease of Use**: dattri simplifies the integration of various data attribution methods into existing PyTorch workflows, enhancing user experience for developers and researchers.
- **Comprehensive Benchmarking**: The library supports a wide range of machine learning tasks and robust evaluation metrics, facilitating thorough assessments of attribution methods across diverse contexts.

Weaknesses:  
- The exclusion of game-theoretic methods limits the library's capabilities.
- The paper lacks detailed validation through extended error analysis, which is essential for establishing the reliability and stability of the methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the library by including game-theoretic, retraining-based methods such as Data Shapley and Data Banzhaf to enrich its capabilities. Additionally, incorporating counterfactual analysis could enhance evaluation capabilities, such as removing data points based on attribution scores and retraining the model for deeper insights. We also suggest extending validation and error analysis by including error bars and variance to better assess the stability of the attribution methods under varying conditions. Furthermore, addressing the overlap with the influenciae library by highlighting major differences in methods implemented would clarify the unique contributions of dattri.
