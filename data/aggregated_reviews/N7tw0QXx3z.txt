Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SLaM, a method for knowledge distillation that effectively utilizes both labeled and unlabeled samples by incorporating teacher prediction noise into student learning. The authors propose a linear mixing of student predictions with teacher noise to help students learn the true underlying labels. The method is supported by theoretical results and empirical experiments across various datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing student model performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, structured, and easy to follow.
- SLaM is a simple and general method, making it broadly applicable.
- The approach is backed by both theoretical and empirical results, showcasing its effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The empirical evaluation raises concerns, as results are based on the best test accuracy over all epochs, potentially leading to overfitting. There is a lack of independent test set evaluations.
- Claims regarding SLaM's performance are overly bold, with only a subset of experiments showing significant improvements over baselines.
- The paper does not adequately clarify why SLaM should not be classified as a semi-supervised learning method, given its reliance on labeled validation data.
- Key results and details are relegated to the appendix, limiting the main paper's clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical evaluation by reporting test performance at the last epoch and including evaluations on completely independent test sets to ensure reliability. Additionally, we suggest moderating claims about SLaM's performance to reflect the actual experimental results more accurately. The authors should clarify the semi-supervised nature of the method and consider presenting key results from the appendix in the main text for better accessibility. Lastly, an ablation study on the influence of uncertainty quantification and a more thorough explanation of the choice of isotonic regression would enhance the paper's rigor.
