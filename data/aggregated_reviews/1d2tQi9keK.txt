### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to active learning by utilizing Rashomon sets to address predictive multiplicity and model ambiguity. The authors propose selecting observations to label based on the uncertainty of predictions from multiple near-optimal models, drawing from concepts in Economics literature. The methodology emphasizes robust decision-making by considering the worst-case scenario within the Rashomon set, aiming to improve the effectiveness of active learning strategies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach is innovative and theoretically sound, addressing a significant gap in active learning literature by focusing on model ambiguity.
- The problem statement is well-defined, effectively articulating the challenges posed by predictive multiplicity.
- Empirical validation shows that the proposed method, RRAA-AL, achieves lower training errors compared to traditional active learning methods.
- The detailed theoretical background on Rashomon Theory enhances understanding of model ambiguity and its implications for data labeling.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments are basic and lack depth, failing to convincingly demonstrate the method's performance in real-world scenarios.
- Scalability concerns are raised, particularly regarding the computational complexity of enumerating the Rashomon set for large datasets.
- The paper does not adequately compare its results with traditional active learning methods or provide comprehensive experimentation across diverse datasets.
- Some algorithmic details are dense and could benefit from clearer explanations for broader accessibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical validation by conducting more comprehensive experiments on diverse datasets to showcase the robustness of the method. Additionally, addressing scalability concerns through potential optimizations or approximations would enhance the practical applicability of the approach. We also suggest providing a more thorough comparative analysis with traditional active learning methods to strengthen the contribution. Lastly, simplifying the presentation of algorithmic details would improve clarity and accessibility for a wider audience.
