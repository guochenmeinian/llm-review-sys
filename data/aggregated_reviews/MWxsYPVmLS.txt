Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of two families of "explainable" randomized voting rules—randomized positional scoring rules and random committee member rules—focusing on their efficiency as measured by distortion. The authors aim to enhance the efficiency of deterministic voting rules while maintaining their explainability. The paper provides tight bounds on distortion for these voting rules and includes computational experiments demonstrating their performance compared to deterministic benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear insights into the developed techniques.
- It makes a significant technical contribution by deriving distortion bounds through a global lower bound on social welfare, which could benefit future research.
- The breadth of results is commendable, as many findings apply to entire classes of voting rules.

Weaknesses:
- The connection between the paper's contributions and the concept of explainability is weak, with insufficient elaboration on how randomization affects explainability.
- The experimental results are limited, focusing solely on the Mallows Model, which may not represent the full spectrum of election types.
- The introduction could better align with the paper's content, and the limitations of the experiments should be addressed more transparently.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by focusing more on the content of the paper, specifically addressing how to measure explainability in randomized rules and the current status of utilitarian distortion among various voting rules. Additionally, we suggest extending the experimental evaluation to include more models beyond the Mallows Model to enhance the relevance of the findings. Clarifying the relationship between explainability and randomization in the context of voting rules would strengthen the paper's argument. Finally, providing a more intuitive explanation of the main technical lemma in the body of the paper would benefit readers.
