Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative approach using De Bruijn Graph Neural Networks (DBGNN) to predict temporal centralities, specifically temporal betweenness and closeness, in dynamic graphs. The authors demonstrate that their method outperforms static Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and other state-of-the-art time-aware graph learning techniques across 13 real-world temporal networks. However, the network sizes are relatively small, which raises questions about the generalizability of the results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The task of predicting temporal centralities is novel and has the potential to open new research directions.
2. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a comprehensive evaluation ensuring reproducibility.
3. The proposed DBGNN architecture achieves significant speedup in computation compared to exact methods and shows substantial performance improvements over existing models.

Weaknesses:
1. The contribution of the paper is unclear as it primarily applies an existing DBGNN model without sufficient theoretical analysis to justify its effectiveness in this context.
2. The evaluation is limited to a small number of baselines, and additional models should be tested to provide a clearer understanding of the method's performance.
3. Clarity issues arise from the reliance on external references for mathematical formulas, which may hinder reader comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis to clarify why DBGNN is effective for this task. Additionally, the authors should include a broader range of baseline models, such as NAT and DyGformer, to strengthen their comparisons. A more detailed analysis of the model's performance, including ablation studies and parameter sensitivity, should be conducted. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors justify the choice of relatively small temporal networks and explore the impact of input features on performance. Lastly, enhancing the clarity of mathematical formulations within the manuscript would benefit reader understanding.
