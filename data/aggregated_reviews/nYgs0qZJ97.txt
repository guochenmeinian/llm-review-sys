Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive study of the RM+ algorithm and its variants in the context of learning in games. The authors demonstrate that RM+ and predictive RM+ can exhibit instability, which negatively impacts the regret of other players. To address this, they propose several stabilization methods, including stable predictive RM+, smooth predictive RM+, conceptual RM+, and extragradient RM+, each with theoretical regret guarantees. The authors also conduct experiments on matrix and extensive-form games, showcasing the effectiveness of their proposed algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and clearly articulates the theoretical advancements in RM+ algorithms, establishing the first instance of improved regret bounds beyond $O(\sqrt T)$.
- The proposed variants not only provide appealing theoretical guarantees but also demonstrate strong empirical performance, enhancing the practical utility of the algorithms.
- The authors effectively discuss the importance of stability in achieving sub-sqrt regret bounds, contributing valuable insights to the field.

Weaknesses:
- The main text lacks sufficient exposition on proof intuitions, which could enhance reader understanding.
- Section 5 is overly dense, making it difficult to follow; a more streamlined presentation of technical results is recommended.
- The empirical convergence rates presented in Figure 1 show large residue errors, and a theoretical proof of the $T^{-0.5}$ convergence rate would strengthen the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the proof intuitions in the main text to aid comprehension. Additionally, consider revising Section 5 to present only the main technical results or deferring more complex discussions to the appendix. It would also be beneficial to provide a theoretical proof for the asymptotic convergence rate to bolster the results. Furthermore, organizing the algorithms into a comparative table could enhance the presentation. Lastly, we suggest addressing the potential impact of varying the threshold in the smooth predictive RM+ method on theoretical guarantees.
