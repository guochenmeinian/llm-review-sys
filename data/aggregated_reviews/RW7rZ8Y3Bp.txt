Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a secure kernelized factorization method for federated spectral clustering on distributed data, ensuring convergence guarantees for optimization, bounds on reconstruction error of the similarity matrix, and sufficient conditions for correct clustering. The authors also provide differential privacy guarantees. The effectiveness of the proposed method, FedSC, is demonstrated through both synthetic and real datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses the important yet under-explored problem of federated spectral clustering.
2. The authors analyze the convergence of their proposed federated spectral clustering algorithm.
3. They introduce two approaches to enhance privacy: perturbing original data and learned factors.
4. Theoretical guarantees are provided, including reconstruction error bounds and differential privacy analysis.
5. Numerical results indicate that FedSC outperforms baseline methods like DSC.

Weaknesses:
1. The theoretical and experimental results regarding FedSC with perturbed factors are relegated to supplementary material; restructuring the paper to include these in the main text is recommended.
2. Certain points lack sufficient explanation, such as the choice of client participation in equation (11) and the definitions in Theorem 3.1.
3. The privacy guarantees require more robust evidence, particularly regarding potential privacy leakage during the upload phase and the implications of noise addition.
4. The empirical evaluations lack clarity on why vanilla spectral clustering performs worse than FedSC, and further explanation of results in Table 1 is needed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the structure of the paper by incorporating the theoretical and experimental results related to perturbed factors into the main text. Additionally, addressing the questions raised regarding client participation, the definitions in Theorem 3.1, and the implications of privacy leakage during the upload phase would enhance clarity. It would also be beneficial to provide a discussion on the privacy-utility trade-off and to include empirical evidence demonstrating the privacy preservation of FedSC. Finally, further exploration of the performance discrepancies noted in the empirical results, particularly in Table 1, is advised.
