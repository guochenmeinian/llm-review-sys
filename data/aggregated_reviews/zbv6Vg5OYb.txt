Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents LARA, a lightweight anti-overfitting retraining approach based on deep variational auto-encoders (VAEs) aimed at unsupervised anomaly detection in time series data. The authors model the retraining process as a convex problem to prevent overfitting and ensure fast convergence. A novel ruminate block is introduced to leverage historical data with low memory requirements. The paper evaluates LARA on four real-world datasets, demonstrating competitive F1 scores and robustness to various hyperparameters and distribution shifts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The mathematical analysis and empirical evidence support the proposed method, showcasing its effectiveness and efficiency.
- The ruminate block is an innovative feature that enhances the model's adaptability.
- Extensive experiments validate LARA's performance against state-of-the-art baselines.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks code or data for reproducibility.
- The notation is overly complex, making it difficult to understand the content.
- The performance of LARA under significant distribution shifts is not adequately addressed.
- Comparisons with recent baselines and methods directly addressing distribution shifts are insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the notation and provide a more straightforward explanation of the formulas used. Additionally, please include code and data to facilitate reproducibility. It would be beneficial to discuss how LARA's performance changes with multiple retraining iterations and to provide statistics or visualizations of the distribution differences between training and testing datasets. Furthermore, we suggest including comparisons with more recent state-of-the-art methods and addressing the limitations of LARA in scenarios with significant distribution changes.
