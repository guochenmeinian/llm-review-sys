### Key Points
This paper presents "Symbolic Planning and Code-Generation" (SPC), a system that integrates a prompted LLM (GPT-4) as a task-oriented dialogue agent with a symbolic planner for the OneCommon benchmark. The system enables two players to communicate about visible dots and select a common dot. SPC processes partner utterances into a probabilistic symbolic representation, which is then updated by a partner model to inform the agent's actions. The authors report state-of-the-art results on OneCommon, demonstrating the effectiveness of their neuro-symbolic architecture.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- SPC effectively combines neural and symbolic techniques, achieving superior performance in the OneCommon task.
- The method transitions smoothly between language and symbolic spaces, enhancing planning efficiency.
- The paper includes illustrative examples and diagrams that facilitate understanding.
- SPC shows improved performance with more skilled human partners, contrasting with previous methods.

Weaknesses:
- The methodology lacks clarity, particularly in how GPT-4 is prompted to generate symbolic representations and the specifics of the parsing process.
- The contribution over prior work, especially Chiu et al. (2022), is not clearly articulated, raising questions about the novelty of the approach.
- The system's applicability to real-world tasks is limited, as it relies on a hand-engineered library of symbolic checks and requires efficient enumeration of shared state configurations.
- The interaction dynamics with human partners appear unnatural, as evidenced by shorter utterances compared to human-human interactions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of SPC's methodology by providing detailed descriptions of how GPT-4 is prompted, including the nature and number of examples used. Additionally, the authors should explicitly articulate the novel contributions of their work in relation to Chiu et al. (2022) and other relevant literature. To enhance the system's applicability, consider discussing the potential for extending the method to more complex real-world tasks beyond OneCommon. Finally, we suggest addressing the interaction dynamics to encourage more natural dialogue, possibly by refining the response generation mechanism to allow for greater user initiative.
