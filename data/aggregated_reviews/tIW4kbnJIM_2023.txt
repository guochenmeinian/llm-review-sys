Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a large and diverse video dataset for nursing procedure activity understanding, named NurViD, which includes 1,538 samples covering 51 types of nursing procedures and 5,615 sub-procedure step samples. The dataset supports three tasks: procedure recognition, sub-procedure action recognition, and step detection, with benchmark results reported for various methods. The authors aim to enhance the quality and safety of nurse-patient interactions through this dataset, addressing the current lack of high-quality annotated datasets in the field. Additionally, the paper includes original and preprocessed videos, RGB and optical flow features, and detailed documentation for reproducibility. The authors propose two methods for dataset access, ensuring compliance with content creator rights, and acknowledge potential biases in the dataset while expressing willingness to expand it with additional nursing procedures. The incorporation of optical flow features enhances the understanding of temporal action information, and an ablation study demonstrates the impact of varying input frame numbers on classification performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
1. The dataset is the largest and most diverse of its kind, providing significant advantages in scale, diversity, and expert annotations, which are beneficial for nursing procedure activity understanding.
2. Comprehensive experiments are conducted, establishing benchmark results for three tasks, showcasing the dataset's properties effectively.
3. Annotations are provided by nursing professionals, ensuring high-quality data.
4. Thorough documentation is provided for dataset governance and reproducibility, along with thoughtful integration of motion information through optical flow features.
5. The dataset's coverage of nursing procedures is confirmed by experts, and the authors transparently address potential biases.

**Weaknesses:**
1. The dataset has not been released as promised, raising concerns about its accessibility and verification of contributions.
2. Documentation regarding the organization, availability, and maintenance of the dataset is insufficient, making it difficult for reviewers to access the data.
3. The motivation for the dataset's necessity is weakly articulated, particularly in relation to real-time guidance for nursing students.
4. The dataset has inherent biases, and challenges in classification performance arise due to common actions across different procedures, especially in scenarios with limited video data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors improve the dataset's accessibility by ensuring its release by the rebuttal deadline, as this is crucial for validating the paper's contributions.
2. We suggest enhancing the documentation to provide clearer instructions on data organization, availability, and maintenance to facilitate user navigation.
3. We advise the authors to strengthen the motivation section by clearly articulating how the dataset can aid in real-time guidance for nursing students.
4. We recommend including videos with no procedures or actions to ensure that models do not assume every input must contain a nursing procedure, thereby improving dataset realism.
5. We encourage the authors to discuss limitations from a nursing procedure perspective, including any missing procedures or actions, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the dataset's scope.
6. We recommend that the authors actively seek and incorporate additional nursing procedures as they become available to enhance the dataset further.
7. We suggest further exploration of strategies to mitigate the impact of common actions on classification performance, particularly in limited data scenarios.
