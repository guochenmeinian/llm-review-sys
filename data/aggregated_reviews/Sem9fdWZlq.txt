### Key Points
This paper presents a novel multi-criteria (MC) recommendation system, CA-GF, which utilizes criteria-aware graph filtering to deliver efficient and accurate recommendations. The authors propose a training-free and matrix decomposition-free approach, addressing significant computational challenges associated with MC ratings. CA-GF demonstrates impressive computational efficiency and competitive accuracy, outperforming benchmark methods by up to 24% in accuracy while maintaining a runtime of less than 0.2 seconds on large datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The methodology is innovative, eliminating the need for training and matrix decomposition.
- The paper is well-organized, with clear motivation and supporting experimental results.
- CA-GF achieves remarkable computational efficiency and offers interpretability regarding criterion contributions.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a comprehensive comparison with recent state-of-the-art methods, which could better highlight its novelty.
- The Related Work section does not adequately analyze existing methods' differences and relevance.
- Certain design choices, such as the rationale for polynomial low-pass filters and hyperparameter sensitivity, are insufficiently explained.
- The codebase is not available, limiting reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology by providing more insights into the hyperparameter selection process, particularly for polynomial LPFs. A deeper comparative analysis with single-criterion recommendation methods and the variant CA-GF-m would enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest addressing the inconsistencies in Tables 3 and 4 and providing a detailed explanation of Figure 2. The authors should also consider including more recent references and standardizing the citation format. Finally, further theoretical validation of the assumptions in the Criteria Preference-Infused Aggregation section would strengthen the paper's contributions.
