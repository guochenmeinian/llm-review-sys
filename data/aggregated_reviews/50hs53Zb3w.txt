Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an IRLS method for recovering data with multiple, heterogeneous low-dimensional structures from linear observations. It combines non-convex surrogates for row-sparsity and rank to identify row-sparse and low-rank matrices from limited measurements. Theoretical results demonstrate locally quadratic convergence, while experiments show favorable empirical convergence and efficacy in challenging data recovery scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well-written, with clear contributions and a thorough discussion of related work. The challenge of combining structures is effectively highlighted. The IRLS approach is practical for large-scale systems, and experiments indicate robustness to parameter choices.

Weaknesses:  
Local convergence is guaranteed, but practical initialization within the required radius may be challenging. The results would be strengthened by demonstrating that matrices other than Gaussian satisfy the RIP and by including empirical results for these cases. Additionally, the numerical results are limited, lacking discussions on applications and robustness in noisy settings. The title suggests a broader scope than just low-rank and sparse, and extending the method to other structures would be beneficial.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the per-iteration complexity of their method and contrast it with existing methods. It would also be beneficial to include a more thorough examination of the algorithm's performance in the presence of noise and to provide more realistic numerical examples. Furthermore, we suggest extending the method to include other types of structures beyond low-rank and sparse. Lastly, clarifying the definition of \(\mathcal{F}\) functions in (13) would enhance reader understanding.
