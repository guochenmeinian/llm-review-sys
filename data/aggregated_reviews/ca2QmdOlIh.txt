Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a matrix factorization problem where the rank of the factor matrices grows linearly with the ambient dimensions, assuming rotationally invariant priors for the factors and noise. The authors derive a closed-form expression for the oracle estimator, demonstrating its Bayes optimality, and propose an implementable estimator that they conjecture performs similarly to the oracle. The empirical results support this conjecture, indicating the effectiveness of the derived estimators.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a practical method for constructing the Bayes optimal estimator for the O(N) rank matrix factorization problem.
- It provides explicit formulas for the reconstruction of the matrix factors and strong experimental validation of theoretical claims.
- Section 5 offers a clear overview of complex derivations.

Weaknesses:
- The analysis is limited to the rotationally invariant setting, and the assumptions regarding the matrices may seem unnatural.
- The main results rely on non-rigorous methods from statistical physics, necessitating a stronger theoretical foundation.
- The optimality of the proposed estimators is contingent on several assumptions, including knowledge of limiting eigen/singular value distributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical foundation of the estimators to enhance their rigor. Additionally, providing practical examples that justify the chosen prior structure would clarify the relevance of the findings to the NeurIPS community. It would also be beneficial to discuss the implications of prior misspecification and the conditions under which the assumption of known priors is reasonable. Finally, we suggest including relevant literature on information-theoretic limits and approximate message passing algorithms for a more comprehensive context.
