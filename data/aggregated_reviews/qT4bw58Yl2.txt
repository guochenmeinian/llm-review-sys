Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents MProto, a noise-robust prototype network for distantly supervised Named Entity Recognition (DS-NER). The authors propose using multiple prototypes per NER class to account for intra-class variance, with prototype assignment achieved through optimal transport (OT) algorithms. To address label noise from distant supervision, they introduce a novel "denoised optimal transport" (DOT) algorithm. The approach is tested on two datasets, CoNLL03 and BC5CDR, demonstrating competitive performance against other DS-NER models, although weaker than a fully-supervised BERT model. The paper includes ablation studies and highlights the impact of dictionary coverage on performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively addresses the challenges of learning from unlabeled data and mitigating label noise.
- Clear presentation and well-structured experiments support the main claims.
- The introduction of multiple prototypes and the DOT algorithm is innovative and relevant.

Weaknesses:
- The section on the denoised optimal transport algorithm may be complex for readers unfamiliar with the topic; a high-level summary would be beneficial.
- Inconsistencies in data comparisons with previous work raise concerns about the validity of results.
- Limited dataset usage and lack of error analysis weaken the robustness of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the token versus span-based approach early in the paper. Additionally, the source of distant labels should be introduced earlier to avoid confusion. To enhance the robustness of their findings, the authors should conduct error analysis and compare results with more datasets and configurations. Finally, including a high-level summary of the denoised optimal transport algorithm would aid comprehension for readers less familiar with the subject.
