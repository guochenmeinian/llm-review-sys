Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Hydra, a novel method for ab initio heterogeneous cryo-EM reconstruction that models conformational and compositional heterogeneity using K-parameterized neural fields. Hydra employs a hybrid optimization strategy to concurrently optimize particle poses, heterogeneity, and density map representations. The authors assess Hydra's efficacy on three datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms three baseline methods in reconstruction quality, particle classification, and pose estimation accuracy. Additionally, Hydra addresses the challenges of analyzing datasets containing a mixture of distinct, dynamic protein complexes, allowing for joint inference of poses and structures without the need for predefined poses. The authors emphasize Hydra's unique approach of using an ensemble of independent neural representations to model heterogeneity, which is more expressive than traditional 3D classification methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses the challenging problem of ab initio reconstruction, particularly in estimating poses and reconstructing 3D structures from cryo-EM data.
- Hydra is the first method to utilize a mixture of neural networks for simultaneous estimation of conformational and compositional heterogeneity.
- The method shows significant improvements in both qualitative and quantitative results compared to existing approaches.
- Hydra's ability to handle extreme heterogeneity in cryo-EM datasets is a significant advancement.
- The method's ab initio reconstruction capability allows for more accurate modeling of complex mixtures.
- The authors provide a clear comparison with existing methods like cryoSPARC and DRGN-AI, highlighting Hydra's advantages.

Weaknesses:
- The synthetic dataset used for validation is limited in size (3000 images) and low SNR (0.01), which does not reflect real cryo-EM conditions.
- The evaluation of reconstruction quality lacks comprehensive metrics, such as 3D resolutions and comparisons with other methods like cryoSPARC and cryoDRGN.
- The choice of metrics for pose evaluation is inadequate, as it ignores translation errors.
- The paper lacks a detailed comparison of Hydra's performance, training and inference speed, and expert effort required against competitive baselines.
- The discussion on compositional heterogeneity and the advantages of Hydra over traditional methods could be more robust.
- The paper lacks an ablation study on the number of K, and the chirality of some reconstruction results appears incorrect.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental validation by using larger and more realistic datasets to better assess Hydra's performance. Additionally, please report the 3D resolutions of the reconstruction results to facilitate quantitative evaluation. We suggest including qualitative comparisons with cryoDRGN-AI and cryoDRGN2, as these methods also address conformational heterogeneity. The authors should also consider reporting in-plane and out-of-plane angle errors alongside translation errors for a more comprehensive pose evaluation. An ablation study on the number of K would provide valuable insights into its determination in practical scenarios. We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the results by reversing the order of Sections 4.2 and 4.3. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to emphasize the comparison with cryoSPARC and DRGN-AI more prominently in the main text, including a discussion on the level of expert processing required. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the methodology and improve the accessibility of the paper for a broader audience, while providing insights into the specific advantages of Hydra over traditional methods to better inform structural biologists on its applicability.
