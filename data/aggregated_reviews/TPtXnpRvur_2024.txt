Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel one-step effective diffusion network, termed OSEDiff, for Real-World Image Super-Resolution (Real-ISR). The authors propose to utilize low-quality (LQ) images as inputs without random noise, directly outputting high-quality images through a variational autoencoder (VAE) decoder. This approach eliminates uncertainty from random noise sampling and incorporates variational score distillation (VSD) for KL-divergence regularization, enhancing the quality of the generated images. Experimental results indicate that OSEDiff outperforms existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative assessments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The one-step diffusion model significantly reduces inference time, making it attractive for practical applications.
2. The paper is well-structured and easy to read.
3. The proposed method demonstrates competitive results against state-of-the-art models with fewer parameters.

Weaknesses:
1. The experimental section requires further improvement, particularly in providing comprehensive comparisons and details on the model's efficiency.
2. The motivation and novelty of the approach are insufficiently explained, particularly regarding the elimination of uncertainty and the effectiveness of the VSD loss.
3. The paper lacks detailed network structure illustrations and clarity on how LQ images are utilized in the model.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including comparisons of total parameters and FLOPs, as well as providing visual evidence to support claims regarding the elimination of uncertainty through direct input of LQ images. Additionally, we suggest offering a detailed explanation of the network structure, particularly the VAE encoder and the diffusion network with trainable LoRA layers. Clarifying the role of the text prompt extractor and its impact on performance, along with addressing the degradation in LQ images, would also enhance the paper's clarity and depth.
