Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the security issues of Business Collaboration Platforms (BCPs), specifically Google Workspace, identifying three vulnerabilities due to improper access control design. The authors conducted a large-scale analysis of 4,732 add-ons, revealing that over 70% are vulnerable to various attacks. The paper discusses the implications of these vulnerabilities, including potential exploits that could lead to data leaks and privilege escalation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper identifies three new vulnerabilities in Google Workspace and demonstrates practical attacks exploiting these vulnerabilities.
- It includes a large-scale measurement study that provides insights into the prevalence of security issues in add-ons.
- The writing quality is generally good, with a clear structure and presentation of findings.

Weaknesses:
- The data collection methodology is unclear, lacking details on how the add-ons were selected and analyzed.
- The paper relies heavily on manual analysis, which raises concerns about reproducibility and the potential for errors.
- Generalizations made about BCPs beyond Google Workspace are not sufficiently supported by experimental evidence.
- The threat model is overly strong and lacks clarity regarding the assumptions about attacker capabilities.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the data collection methodology, detailing how the dataset of add-ons was obtained and the criteria for their selection. Additionally, we suggest incorporating some form of automation in the analysis to enhance reproducibility and reduce potential errors. The authors should also consider limiting their claims to Google Workspace or conducting experiments on other platforms to substantiate their generalizations. Furthermore, we advise refining the threat model to better articulate the assumptions regarding attacker capabilities and to ensure they are realistic. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the implications of their findings regarding responsible disclosure, particularly concerning vulnerabilities in benign add-ons.
