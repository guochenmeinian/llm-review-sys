Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ContextSSL, a self-supervised learning framework that enhances joint embedding architecture by integrating task-specific context. The authors propose that ContextSSL dynamically adapts symmetries using context in self-supervised learning (SSL), allowing it to adjust to varying task symmetries without parameter updates. The efficacy of ContextSSL is demonstrated on 3DIEBench and CIFAR10, where it selectively learns invariance or equivariance to transformations while maintaining general representations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper suggests an innovative direction for SSL, emphasizing the role of context in enabling dynamic adaptation to task symmetries.  
- The writing is clear and coherent, making it accessible.  
- The framework is original and significant, potentially shifting real-world applications of SSL.  
- Empirical results indicate substantial improvements in equivariant downstream tasks, supported by extensive ablation and sensitivity analyses.  
- Detailed information is provided for replication.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper overlooks invariant-based approaches that can achieve context lengths of 0 to 126 through linear classifiers, and the potential for more shots to enhance SimCLR and VICReg performance is not addressed.  
- ContextSSL underperforms in linear classification compared to key baselines, which is a common task in SSL.  
- The method's ability to handle complex augmentation strategies is unclear, as the current evaluations are limited to controlled datasets.  
- The reliance on practitioner-selected augmentations raises questions about the claimed lack of hard-coded symmetries.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation setup clarity in the final manuscript, particularly regarding the performance of SimCLR and VICReg. It would be beneficial to explore the impact of few-shot classification on ContextSSL's performance, as this could provide additional context for its adaptability. We suggest including more generalized augmentations in downstream tasks to better support the generalization claims. Additionally, clarifying the role of context length in representation extraction and addressing the concerns about hard-coded symmetries would enhance the manuscript's rigor. Lastly, we encourage the authors to incorporate comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods like EquiMod, E-SSL, and CARE to strengthen their findings.
