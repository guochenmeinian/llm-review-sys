Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a general method for constructing a debiased estimator called the Adaptive Linear Estimating Equations (ALEE) estimator, which achieves asymptotic normality in sequential data collection. The authors utilize an online debiasing procedure that guarantees a reduction of bias to zero, albeit slowly, which the ALEE estimator addresses effectively. The stability of ALEE is demonstrated through equations for multi-arm bandits, autoregressive time series, and contextual bandits, showing improved performance compared to previous methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- ALEE provides point and interval estimation based on the central limit theorem, ensuring stable estimation and efficiency, with theoretical performance guarantees.
- The method is simple, nearly efficient, and well-motivated, making it useful for practitioners.
- The proposed estimator demonstrates desirable properties in numerical experiments across relevant domains.

Weaknesses:
- Numerical experiments are limited to specific parameter values (0.3 and 1), and a broader range would enhance the findings.
- The presentation is sometimes confusing, with unclear connections between sections and insufficient explanation for Table 1.
- The experiments rely solely on synthetic data; validation with real-world datasets would strengthen the study.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation, particularly by ensuring that all components, such as the matrix \( A \) from Section 2, are consistently referenced in subsequent sections. Additionally, we suggest including a wider variety of parameter values in the numerical experiments and validating the framework with real-world datasets to provide practical insights. Lastly, we encourage the authors to address the limitations of their work explicitly and clarify the meanings of terms like "lower tail coverage" and "upper tail coverage" in the figures.
