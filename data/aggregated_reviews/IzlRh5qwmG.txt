Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of swap agnostic learning, a variant of agnostic learning, and establishes its equivalence to swap versions of multicalibration and omniprediction. The authors introduce the concept of Swap Loss Outcome Indistinguishability and demonstrate that existing algorithms, such as MCBoost, can guarantee swap multicalibration. The work aims to deepen the understanding of algorithmic fairness and learning theory by connecting these seemingly distinct notions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with clear definitions and a logical flow of ideas.
- It makes a significant contribution to the literature on multicalibration by establishing equivalences among different learning concepts.
- The technical results are insightful and connect various areas of machine learning.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for studying swap multicalibration and swap omniprediction is unclear, particularly outside their equivalence context.
- The paper lacks sufficient exposition and intuition, making it difficult for readers unfamiliar with the field to follow.
- Some algorithmic details, such as the parameter settings and the relationship to existing algorithms, are inadequately explained.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation behind the swap variants by discussing their practical significance and implications beyond establishing equivalences. Additionally, enhancing the exposition around the definitions of swap omniprediction and swap multicalibration would aid reader comprehension. Clarifying the algorithmic details, particularly regarding the MCBoost algorithm and the termination of iterations in Algorithm 2, would also strengthen the paper. Finally, providing intuition or proof sketches in Section 3.1 could help demystify the technical content for a broader audience.
