Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents G3, a novel framework for worldwide geolocalization that employs a three-step process: Geo-alignment, Geo-diversification, and Geo-verification. The authors address challenges in capturing location-specific visual cues and variations in image data distribution. G3 utilizes the MP16-Pro dataset to enhance location-aware visual representation learning and demonstrates superior performance over existing methods on the IM2GPS3k and YFCC4K datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The G3 framework's modules—Geo Alignment, Geo Diversification, and Geo Verification—are logically structured, utilizing three types of embeddings from the vision encoder for retrieval.
- The method outperforms several baselines at various granularity levels on IM2GPS3k and YFCC4K.
- The writing is clear and the flow of the paper is coherent, making it easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The paper only discusses efficiency limitations without quantifying compute time and memory requirements for geo-localization.
- There are no qualitative examples of failure cases, raising concerns about the system's robustness in ambiguous scenarios.
- The evaluation lacks consideration of recent state-of-the-art works like Pigeon and GeoReasoner.
- The choice of the CLIP vision encoder is not justified, and no ablation study is provided to explore alternatives like DINO-v2.
- The performance sensitivity to the number of references provided to the LLM is not adequately addressed, potentially affecting practical reliability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the efficiency of inference by providing specific compute time and memory requirements for geo-localization. Additionally, including qualitative failure case examples would enhance the understanding of the system's limitations. The authors should also consider evaluating G3 against recent works such as Pigeon and GeoReasoner to contextualize its performance. Justifying the choice of the CLIP vision encoder through an ablation study comparing it with alternatives like DINO-v2 would strengthen the methodology. Lastly, addressing the sensitivity of performance to the number of references provided to the LLM would improve the framework's reliability for practical applications.
