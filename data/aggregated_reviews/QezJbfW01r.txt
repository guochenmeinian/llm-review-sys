Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of ex-post privacy mechanisms, particularly focusing on the Brownian Noise Reduction Mechanism. The authors propose a unified privacy filter that allows for the adaptive composition of differential privacy (DP) and ex-post DP mechanisms, aiming to maximize the number of counting queries answered with low relative error while adhering to a predetermined privacy budget. The framework is instantiated to release private counts under accuracy constraints, demonstrating empirical improvements over existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
* The theoretical framework is robust and general, with potential for significant practical applications.
* The new analysis for the Brownian mechanism enhances its utility.
* The experimental section is well-detailed, showing substantial improvements compared to baseline approaches.

Weaknesses:
* The paper's presentation is dense and lacks clarity, making it difficult for readers to grasp key concepts.
* The composition of ex-post mechanisms is not adequately addressed in the main body, despite being a claimed contribution.
* The analysis is limited to specific mechanisms and privacy measures, which may reduce its generalizability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation, particularly in explaining complex concepts such as the Brownian mechanism and the relationship between ex-post and traditional DP. It would be beneficial to include a stronger early statement regarding the overall privacy guarantees, specifically distinguishing between 'differentially private' and 'ex-post private' terms. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide more intuitive explanations of theorems and definitions, particularly regarding the composition theorem for ex-post privacy, which currently appears only in the appendix. Lastly, addressing the composition of ex-post mechanisms more thoroughly in the main text would strengthen the paper's contributions.
