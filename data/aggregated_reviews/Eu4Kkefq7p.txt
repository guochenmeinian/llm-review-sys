Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new system for learning a joint embedding space for text, images, and 3D shapes (point clouds) by leveraging pre-trained CLIP embeddings and introducing a self-supervised embedding function for 3D shapes using contrastive loss. The authors propose improvements such as dataset combination, automated re-labeling of Objaverse, and optimization of the 3D embedding architecture, resulting in superior performance on tasks like zero-shot classification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper contributes sound incremental work on multi-modal embedding functions, considering various engineering dimensions and providing insights for future research.
- It offers interesting suggestions for improving datasets like Objaverse, particularly the use of GPT-4 for caption assessment and BLIP for replacements.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks deep technical innovations, primarily focusing on engineering aspects, with the main finding being the limited scalability due to insufficient training data.
- Performance drops when applying the model to real data compared to synthetic datasets, with unclear dominance between the proposed backbones, SparseConv and PointBERT, whose performance varies significantly based on testing data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify whether filtering bad positive samples in the contrastive loss is ablated in Table 3. Additionally, they should investigate the reasons behind the performance discrepancies of SparseConv and PointBERT across different test datasets. It would also be beneficial to provide more analyses on the linear probe results to substantiate the claims regarding shape representation learning. Finally, the authors should explicitly discuss the limitations of their model to enhance reader understanding.
