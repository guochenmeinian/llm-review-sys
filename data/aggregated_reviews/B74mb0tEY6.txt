Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents strategies for maximizing cumulative rewards in repeated second-price auctions, modeled as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) scenario. The authors propose two novel algorithms, Local-Greedy (LG) and Greedy-Grid (GG), both achieving constant problem-dependent regret. LG is practical and outperforms GG in experiments, while GG provides problem-independent guarantees. The paper introduces new concentration bounds and theoretical guarantees, marking significant advancements in online auction optimization using structured bandit approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper introduces an original approach to optimizing online auctions through structured bandits, merging auction theory with MAB frameworks. The theoretical contributions are substantial, with rigorous derivation of regret bounds and new concentration bounds that enhance performance guarantees. The clarity of the paper is commendable, with complex concepts explained logically and supported by illustrative examples. The work's significance is highlighted by its application to online display advertising, potentially leading to substantial economic benefits.

Weaknesses:  
A major weakness is the limited experimental validation, relying primarily on synthetic data, which does not fully demonstrate the algorithms' practical applicability. The comparison with existing methods is narrow, lacking a comprehensive benchmarking against relevant algorithms. The theoretical assumptions, particularly the unimodality of the reward function and i.i.d. nature of bidder values, may be overly restrictive. The discussion on practical implementation lacks depth regarding computational complexity and scalability. Additionally, there is insufficient exploration of parameter selection and sensitivity analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental validation by using actual auction data, potentially through collaboration with industry partners. A broader comparison with more sophisticated algorithms, including privacy-preserving bandits, would enhance the evaluation. We suggest relaxing the assumptions of unimodality and i.i.d. values, exploring their impact through theoretical extensions or empirical investigations. A detailed analysis of the computational complexity of LG and GG, including scalability with increasing bidders, is essential. Finally, we encourage a comprehensive parameter study to provide guidelines for selecting appropriate values for parameters like the exploration parameter $\alpha$ and confidence levels $\delta$.
