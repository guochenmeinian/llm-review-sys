Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a functional-group-based diffusion model called D3FG for generating 3D molecules aimed at target protein binding, contributing to structure-based drug design (SBDD). The authors propose two generation schemes: joint and two-stage, decomposing molecules into functional groups and linkers while predicting their types, coordinates, and orientations through a diffusion process. The model achieves competitive performance, particularly in the Gnina Score, although it slightly underperforms compared to existing methods like TargetDiff in the Vina Score. The authors justify their selection of 25 functional groups as sufficient for their repository, noting that it is extendable but requires significant time for expansion. They emphasize the novelty of their methodology and request that reviewers focus on their contributions rather than the novelty debate. The experiments indicate satisfactory generation performance and potential applications in molecule elaboration.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and clear, making it easy to follow.
2. D3FG is the first functional-group-based diffusion model for structure-based drug design.
3. The model addresses important details, including functional group determination and chirality handling.
4. D3FG shows competitive performance across multiple scoring functions, particularly in the Gnina Score.
5. The authors provide a rationale for the selection of functional groups and acknowledge the potential for future expansion.

Weaknesses:
1. The performance improvement over previous methods is limited, as evidenced by the results in Tables 2 and 4, where D3FG does not outperform baselines like TargetDiff.
2. Evaluations lack comprehensiveness; aspects such as bond angles and dihedral angles are not assessed.
3. The technical contribution is limited, with many techniques already present in prior works like TargetDiff and DiffSBDD.
4. Limited comprehensive comparisons with other methods due to the absence of pre-trained models.
5. The literature review is insufficient, neglecting related methods that also utilize functional groups, such as JT-VAE and FLAG.
6. The novelty of the methodology remains a contentious point that could detract from the perceived value of the work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comprehensiveness of their evaluations by including assessments of bond angles and dihedral angles. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed comparison with existing methods to clarify their contributions and highlight differences. It would also be beneficial to discuss the influence of the functional group set size more thoroughly, exploring larger sets beyond the current range. We suggest enhancing the presentation by including an overview of the method before delving into specifics and ensuring consistency in notation throughout the paper. Furthermore, we recommend including the validities of other baseline methods in the Appendix and incorporating more details regarding the settings and specifics of the molecular elaboration task to enhance clarity. Finally, the authors should consider including any effective open-source methods not currently compared to D3FG to strengthen the experimental comparisons.
