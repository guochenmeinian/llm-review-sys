Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical analysis of Threshold-Based Auto-Labeling (TBAL) systems, deriving sample complexity bounds for the amount of human-labeled validation data necessary to ensure the quality of machine-labeled data. The authors propose that even weak models can effectively label large amounts of unlabeled data, but highlight the potential need for substantial validation datasets. The paper provides both theoretical guarantees on auto-labeling error and empirical validation through experiments on synthetic and real data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. This is the first paper to theoretically analyze TBAL, contributing novel insights to the field.
2. The authors provide sound theoretical guarantees using Rademacher Complexity and PAC theory.
3. The writing is clear and accessible, with intuitive figures that aid understanding.
4. The empirical results reveal interesting observations about TBAL systems.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper's goal is somewhat unclear, as it appears to study an existing TBAL system while also proposing a new algorithm.
2. Several questions remain regarding the relationship between the proposed TBAL and existing systems, including its claimed popularity and applicability.
3. The experimental results show discrepancies that require further discussion, particularly regarding the performance of competing methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding the paper's objectives, explicitly distinguishing between the proposed TBAL and existing systems. Additionally, please address the following questions in the related work section: 
1) Clarify whether the proposed TBAL aligns with any existing popular TBAL systems.
2) Discuss the implications of different workflows on the applicability of the theoretical results.
3) Provide evidence for the claimed popularity of TBAL, including use cases and scenarios.

In the experimental section, we suggest adding more discussions to explain the unexpected performance differences among the competing methods, particularly regarding Figures 2 and 3. We also recommend providing a more in-depth comparison between TBAL and AL+SC, focusing on their respective trade-offs. Lastly, please ensure that the empirical validation closely connects with the theoretical bounds presented, and consider using a more expressive feature extractor to enhance the results.
