Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Manifold-valued Spiking Graph Neural Network (MSG) that generalizes spiking GNNs to Riemannian manifolds, introducing a new training algorithm called Differentiation via Manifold (DvM) to mitigate the high training overhead associated with Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT). The authors demonstrate that MSG serves as a neural ODE solver and show through experiments that it outperforms existing spiking GNNs in terms of energy efficiency and performance on various tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The integration of spiking neurons with Riemannian manifolds is a novel and technically solid approach.
2. The theoretical foundation is well-established, proving MSG as a neural ODE solver.
3. Experimental results convincingly demonstrate MSG's superior performance and energy efficiency compared to traditional and spiking GNNs.

Weaknesses:
1. The performance of MSG with different backbones, such as GAT, is not explored.
2. Some experimental details, particularly regarding link prediction settings with SNN baselines, are not specified.
3. The paper lacks a thorough discussion of prior works involving Riemannian manifolds in spiking neural networks.
4. The energy consumption of the proposed method remains unclear due to the complexity of the integration.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Figure 4(a) by providing a complete list of training times and addressing the apparent discrepancy regarding the backward time of DvM. Additionally, please elaborate on the computation of manifold representations during inference, particularly the float-point operations involved. It would also be beneficial to discuss the potential neuromorphic implementations of MSG and specify any real-world applications where MSG could be particularly advantageous. Finally, we encourage the authors to strengthen the argument for the necessity of Riemannian manifolds and consider discussing other types of manifolds.
