Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for estimating individualized treatment rules (ITRs) in precision medicine, addressing limitations of traditional methods that rely on inverse probability weighting (IPW) and L1-penalization. The authors propose using model-free distributional covariate balancing and a hard L1-ball constraint, optimizing the ITR via projected gradient descent (PGD). The paper includes a thorough analysis with convergence and statistical estimation guarantees, supported by simulation studies that show the framework's superiority over existing methods in robustness and effectiveness. Additionally, the proposed method demonstrates superior performance in reducing squared bias and variance compared to existing methods, particularly in estimating treatment decisions. The authors provide detailed tables showing performance metrics across different sample sizes, indicating that their method effectively mitigates bias without overfitting. They also explore the impact of variable screening on a linear baseline model, noting that while it yields minor performance improvements, the proposed method consistently outperforms the baseline, especially in observational studies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The focus on weight optimization enhances the efficiency of ITRs, introducing a novel algorithm using Proximal Gradient Descent (PGD).
2. The proposed method shows the best performance in terms of squared bias and variance across various sample sizes.
3. The combination of theoretical guarantees with empirical analysis effectively demonstrates the method's reliability.
4. The authors effectively address reviewer concerns and provide additional data to support their claims.
5. The explanation of the challenges associated with observational studies is clear and convincing.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper does not sufficiently differentiate its methodology from previous works emphasizing weight adjustments, such as "Balanced policy evaluation and learning" and "More efficient policy learning via optimal retargeting."
2. The authors need to theoretically connect the claimed reduction in finite sample bias from using distributional covariate balancing weights to the findings in Theorem 3.5.
3. A comparison of computation speed between PGD and other methods is lacking.
4. The tuning strategies for the "penalized" and "constrained" versions of the method require clarification, particularly regarding their justification for differing strategies.
5. The linear baseline model, even with variable screening, shows limited performance improvements, highlighting its inherent challenges in observational contexts.
6. The lack of a variable screening step in the initial analysis may raise questions about the robustness of the baseline model's performance.
7. Some typographical errors and unclear terminology, such as the use of "multi-category trts," may confuse readers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the differentiation of their methodology from existing literature on weight adjustments. Additionally, they should provide a theoretical connection between the reduction in finite sample bias and Theorem 3.5. A comparison of computation speed between PGD and other methods should be included to enhance understanding. Clarifying the tuning strategies for the two versions of the proposed method is essential for a fair comparison. Furthermore, addressing typographical errors and refining the terminology used in the title will enhance clarity. We also recommend improving the clarity of the discussion surrounding the limitations of the linear baseline model, particularly in observational studies. Including a revised figure that incorporates the proposed method would enhance the presentation of results. Finally, a more detailed exploration of the implications of variable screening on model performance could provide further insights into the effectiveness of the proposed method.
