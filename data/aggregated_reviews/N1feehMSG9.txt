Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel contextual bandit algorithm that balances cumulative and simple regret guarantees through a surrogate objective and optimal cover. The authors introduce conformal arm sets (CASs) to enhance coverage guarantees for the optimal policy, allowing efficient policy identification that minimizes simple regret while managing cumulative regret. Theoretical upper bounds for both types of regret are established, even under model misspecification, and a hardness result indicates that the trade-off between simple and cumulative regret is unavoidable.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a theoretical analysis of the balance between cumulative and simple regrets, addressing gaps in prior literature.
- The introduction of CASs provides a new framework for characterizing simple regret minimization.
- Generalizing regret bounds to account for model misspecification extends existing research.

Weaknesses:
- More discussions on theoretical results are needed, particularly regarding the action selection kernel in Assumption 2, implications of zero probability in Assumption 2, the bias term's relation to $\sqrt{1/T}$, and examples satisfying Theorem 3's assumptions.
- The experimental section lacks a focus on the balance between cumulative and simple regret, necessitating more diverse settings for algorithm evaluation.
- Clarity issues arise from the paper's presentation, including confusing notation, insufficient definitions, and a lack of comprehensive comparisons in the simulation section.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical discussions by elaborating on the role of the action selection kernel in Assumption 2, clarifying the implications of zero probability, and providing examples that satisfy Theorem 3's assumptions. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the experimental section to include a clear balance of cumulative and simple regret and to incorporate more diverse evaluation settings. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to refine the presentation by clearly defining terms, improving the flow of the preliminaries, and ensuring that the algorithm section is accessible to non-expert readers. Lastly, we recommend including a comprehensive comparison with existing baselines in the simulation results.
