Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a normative model to describe neural computations in the olfactory bulb, emphasizing biological interpretation and realistic predictions that align with experimental observations. The authors validate their model using synthetic data, showcasing various implementations and performance evaluations. The model employs a compressed sensing circuit approach, utilizing Poisson noise to enhance biological plausibility and improve odorant concentration estimation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with clear logic and rigorous mathematical explanations.
- It effectively relates equations to biological principles, particularly in predicting state-dependent inhibition.
- The proposed model demonstrates improved performance in biologically relevant scenarios compared to existing models.

Weaknesses:
- The bibliography is excessively long, complicating the identification of key references.
- It remains unclear whether the new model outperforms existing ones, particularly in terms of human olfactory discrimination performance.
- The model's biological accuracy is questioned, particularly regarding simplifications and the treatment of non-linear components.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the bibliography by distilling it to the most relevant references, possibly marking key ones with asterisks. Additionally, the authors should provide a clearer comparison of their model's performance against existing models, particularly in terms of human olfactory discrimination benchmarks. Clarifying how the model's performance relates to the number of neurons versus coding schemes would also enhance understanding. Finally, we suggest that the authors map the model to the olfactory bulb throughout the paper to improve contextual clarity.
