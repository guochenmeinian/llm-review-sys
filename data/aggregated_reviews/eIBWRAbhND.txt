### Key Points
This paper presents an improvement in the optimization method for Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) that directly targets refusal suppression. The authors propose that suffixes derived from GCG are inherently universal and transferable, hypothesizing that these suffixes deactivate the “safety feature.” A new loss term is introduced in the conventional GCG optimization, achieving a 56% attack success rate (ASR) on Llama-3 and demonstrating high ASR against close-source models and Representation Rerouting defense.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a notable improvement on GCG, enhancing transferability.
- The exploration of neuron-level interpretation in jailbreak attacks is interesting, particularly for open-source models.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty is incremental, as the concept of the “safety feature” has been previously explored, and the additional loss term appears to be a minor enhancement.
- Evaluations lack clarity and robustness; the dataset and experimental settings for Table 1 are unclear, and testing on only 50 random prompts is insufficient to substantiate claims of universal transferability.
- The claim of “surprising generalization achieved from single-behavior optimization” is questionable, as it relies on selecting the best suffix from a limited set of behaviors without adequate validation on a separate held-out set.
- The connection between the refusal vector and observations in Section 3 is not clearly articulated.
- The writing quality needs improvement, particularly in Section 4, where clearer notations are required for better comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their evaluations by specifying the dataset and experimental settings used in Table 1. Conducting evaluations on HarmBench and JailbreakBench would strengthen their claims regarding the universal and transferable nature of the suffixes. Additionally, we encourage the authors to optimize prefixes across multiple models simultaneously to enhance transferability. Lastly, we suggest revising the writing for clarity and coherence, especially in Section 4, to ensure that the methods and contributions are easily understood.
