Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Holistic Evaluation of Multimodal Models (HEMM), a systematic framework for evaluating multimodal foundation models across three dimensions: basic skills, information flow, and real-world use cases. HEMM encompasses 30 tasks and evaluates 11 representative models, providing insights into how various factors such as model size and training decisions impact performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The systematic evaluation of multimodal foundation models is valuable and contributes to measuring progress in the field.
2. The proposed assessment dimensions are logical and relevant.
3. The paper is well-organized and easy to follow, with comprehensive experiments and insightful results.

Weaknesses:
1. The main contribution is limited to reorganizing existing datasets without introducing new ones.
2. The evaluation lacks many representative multimodal models, such as LLaVA and GPT-4.
3. The color scheme in Figure 3 is difficult to interpret, and there is insufficient comparison with related works.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Figure 3 by using distinct colors. Additionally, the leaderboard table should include detailed values instead of relying on Figures 3 and 5 for rough information. It would also be beneficial to present the data in Table 1 in the appendix with legends for better reader understanding. Furthermore, we suggest including more recent models in the evaluation and providing a deeper analysis of model performance across different tasks.
