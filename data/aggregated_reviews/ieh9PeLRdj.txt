### Key Points
This paper presents a Multi Scenario Pricing (MSP) model designed for hotel revenue management, leveraging shared information across multiple scenarios to enhance market demand accuracy and competitiveness. The authors propose a comprehensive pricing metric that adjusts for sample distribution imbalances and provide a novel neural architecture that includes components for demand representation and price competitiveness. Extensive offline and online experiments validate the MSP model's superior performance, supported by a unique industrial dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1) The paper features a well-structured methodology and provides real-industry multi-scenario pricing data, enhancing the study's credibility.
2) The introduction of a comprehensive pricing metric that adapts to sample distribution imbalances is a significant contribution.
3) Extensive experimentation in both offline and online settings demonstrates the effectiveness of the MSP model.

Weaknesses:
1) The MSP method's detailed process lacks clarity; formal summarization in Algorithm form would improve understanding.
2) The selection of baselines for comparison is limited, with only three single-scenario methods used, which weakens the robustness of the results.
3) The paper does not include convergence curve plots for loss during training, nor does it provide a comparison between the model's suggested price and the theoretical optimal price, which would enhance insights.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the MSP method by providing a formal algorithm in section 3.2. Additionally, including convergence curve plots in section 5 would allow for better analysis of the model's convergence speed and stability. To strengthen the experimental validation, we suggest incorporating models for multi-scenario pricing as additional baselines. Furthermore, a more detailed introduction and analysis of the dataset would enhance its presentation. Finally, addressing the statistical significance of the claims and discussing potential fairness and bias implications would broaden the paper's relevance and impact.
