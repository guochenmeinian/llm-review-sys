Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies Contextual Linear Optimization (CLO) with bandit feedback and presents a class of algorithms termed Induced Empirical Risk Minimization (IERM). The authors derive regret upper bounds that account for policy class misspecification and incorporate a margin condition for potentially faster regret rates. The work also addresses the partial bandit feedback setup, proposing an IERM algorithm that utilizes doubly-robust estimation to manage reward model misspecification, providing significant theoretical results and broad applicability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The extension of the CLO problem to bandit feedback is an important and novel research direction.  
2. The mathematical formulations and proofs are rigorous and well-presented.  
3. The analysis accommodates practical concerns such as model misspecification and partial feedback, with solid theoretical results supported by numerical experiments.  

Weaknesses:  
1. Readability could be improved; the presentation of the problem and model may be unclear for readers unfamiliar with CLO.  
2. The complexities of terms are not stated, making interpretation difficult.  
3. The model misspecification is not fully explained in the initial sections, and the paper would benefit from a clearer structure with definitions and algorithms.  
4. Minor errors in presentation need correction, such as in line 108 and the definition of $\chi^2_{n,\delta}$.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the problem setting by providing a more detailed explanation of the interaction protocol between the learner and the environment in the introduction. Additionally, the authors should compare their suggested model with partial monitoring to enhance understanding. It would be beneficial to summarize the order of regret with respect to \( n \) and to explain model misspecification before commencing the theoretical analysis. Lastly, we suggest correcting minor errors in the presentation to enhance readability.
