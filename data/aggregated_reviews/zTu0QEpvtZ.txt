Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the mechanisms of diffusion models, focusing on the denoising process and the role of text conditioning. It finds that shapes in images are constructed early in the denoising process, while textures and details are added later, supported by mathematical frequency analysis. The authors analyze the significance of the [EOS] token, which captures global information from prompts, and demonstrate that it is more heavily relied upon than other prompt tokens. This insight leads to a proposed method that accelerates diffusion sampling by over 25% while maintaining image quality by injecting conditional information only at the beginning of the denoising process.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study provides a principled analysis of shape construction and the reliance on the [EOS] token, contributing valuable insights for future research.
- The empirical findings support practical applications, such as speeding up inference in diffusion models.
- The use of multiple architectures and samplers enhances the generalizability of the results.

Weaknesses:
- Many findings, such as shape reconstruction and early reliance on text, are not entirely novel and have been discussed in prior literature.
- The paper lacks a discussion on broader impacts or limitations, and the Conclusion section merely summarizes findings without addressing implications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the limitations and implications of their findings, particularly regarding the applicability of the proposed sampling strategy in tasks requiring detail preservation, such as human face generation. Additionally, we suggest clarifying how "computational cost" is defined and ensuring that the theoretical aspects of frequency signal analysis are more accessible to readers. Finally, conducting experiments to explore the influence of the SOS token alongside the EOS token would strengthen the study's claims.
