Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel model of human motion perception, utilizing a two-stage architecture that integrates trainable motion energy sensing with a recurrent self-attention network. The authors aim to replicate the computations of the V1-MT pathway, demonstrating that their model's responses align closely with mammalian neural recordings and human perceptual responses to various stimuli. The model shows promise in outperforming existing computer vision models in explaining human motion perception.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a deep exploration of the human visual system, effectively leveraging existing computer vision modules in an insightful two-stage framework.
- The model exhibits direction and speed tuning characteristics similar to those observed in mammalian physiology, generating human-like responses to traditional motion stimuli.
- The writing is clear and the model's performance is compelling, particularly in its ability to account for responses to both low-level and complex stimuli.

Weaknesses:
- The authors do not provide sufficient visual evidence to support their claims about the model's effectiveness.
- There is a notable gap in performance compared to state-of-the-art models in optical flow prediction, which requires further analysis.
- The complexity of the model's dynamic graph construction raises questions about its neural implementation, which remains unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of visual evidence supporting their model's claims and provide a more thorough analysis of its performance compared to state-of-the-art models in optical flow prediction. Additionally, we suggest including a complexity analysis for each component of the model to address concerns about its neural plausibility. To enhance clarity, we advise revising the presentation of figures and ensuring consistent terminology, particularly regarding the use of "two-stage" versus "two stages." Lastly, we encourage the authors to incorporate quantitative comparisons with existing models, such as MotionNet and DorsalNet, to substantiate their contributions more explicitly.
