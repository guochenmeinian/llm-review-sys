Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SceneDiffuser, a diffusion-based method for traffic simulation that unifies scene initialization and closed-loop agent behavior simulation. It introduces an amortized diffusion technique to accelerate the process with 16x fewer inference steps and incorporates large language models (LLMs) for few-shot prompt engineering. SceneDiffuser demonstrates competitive performance in the Waymo Open Sim Agent Challenge, achieving top results in both open-loop and closed-loop settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a diffusion mechanism to traffic simulation is commendable, as previous methods primarily relied on transformer architectures.
- The amortized diffusion technique effectively reduces computational burdens while enhancing trajectory consistency.
- The unification of scene generation and simulation rollout in a single model is innovative and simplifies the simulation process.
- The figures are illustrative and contribute to overall comprehension.

Weaknesses:
- The writing quality requires improvement; algorithms and figures lack sufficient explanation, making them difficult to understand.
- The motivation for the LLM extension is unclear, appearing more as an application rather than an enhancement to SceneDiffuser.
- The paper lacks comparisons with other relevant methods, such as SceneTransformer, and does not adequately address the realism issues inherent in diffusion methods.
- Metrics used in experiments are not well-defined, and the layout of figures and tables could be improved for better readability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing, particularly in explaining Algorithms 1-3 and the role of Figure 4. Additionally, the motivation behind the LLM extension should be elaborated, potentially exploring its implications for autonomous driving. We suggest including comparative experiments with SceneTransformer to provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Furthermore, detailed descriptions of the metrics used in experiments should be added, and the layout of figures and tables should be organized according to their reference order for smoother reading. Lastly, addressing the realism issues associated with diffusion methods and ensuring consistent object size predictions during the rollout phase would enhance the paper's contributions.
