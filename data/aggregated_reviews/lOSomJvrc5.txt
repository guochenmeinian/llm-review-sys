Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Aim, a paradigm for AI model modulation that allows a single neural network to adapt its behavior to meet diverse requirements without retraining. The authors propose a straightforward logits redistribution technique, supported by comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive empirical results across various tasks, including large language models and image segmentation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The algorithm is easy to implement and the theoretical framework is robust.
- The empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique across multiple modalities.
- The approach addresses a significant challenge in optimizing resource usage for large AI models.

Weaknesses:
- The core idea of adding noise to logits lacks novelty and is not sufficiently differentiated from existing methods.
- The connection between the utility and focus modulation techniques is unclear, and their integration appears forced.
- The paper does not adequately evaluate the runtime or computational overhead of the modulated models, nor does it provide guidance on setting parameters like $\sigma$ for specific tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the connection between the utility and focus modulation techniques to enhance coherence. Additionally, a more systematic evaluation of output coherence, including manual assessments and coherence scoring, would strengthen the argument. The authors should also include baseline comparisons for focus modulation to highlight its advantages and provide more detailed explanations of how utility and focus modulation are operationalized. Lastly, addressing the lack of empirical comparisons with distillation-based approaches would be beneficial.
