### Key Points
This paper presents a new math word problem (MWP) dataset, DMath, which is characterized by its diversity in lexicon usage, problem types, and bilingual support (English and Korean). The dataset includes two solution forms: expression trees and Python code, and features 50 operators across five problem types. Experimental results indicate that the GPT-4 LLM achieves 70% accuracy on DMath, highlighting the dataset's complexity compared to existing datasets like SVAMP and ASDiv. The authors argue that this dataset will facilitate future research in MWP solving.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset provides significant diversity in languages, problem types, and solution forms.
- The paper is well-written, with clear argumentation and thorough analysis of current LLMs on the dataset.
- It addresses gaps in previous research and has the potential to enhance future studies in the field.

Weaknesses:
- There is a lack of detailed description regarding the validation procedures for DMath, raising concerns about the correctness of the annotated data.
- Intermediate solutions are annotated in a pre-defined format rather than mathematical language, which may hinder human interpretation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the description of the validation procedures for DMath to mitigate risks regarding the correctness of the annotated data. Additionally, we suggest providing more clarity on how the intermediate solutions can be interpreted by humans. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to explain the rationale behind the comparisons with other datasets more clearly.
