Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an SQ lower bound for distinguishing the standard Gaussian distribution from a distribution with a single non-Gaussian component, removing the bounded $\chi^2$ distance assumption required in prior work. The authors provide additional SQ lower bounds for List-Decodable Mean estimation and anti-concentration detection. The approach utilizes direct probabilistic bounds and Fourier analysis over the Hermite basis to establish the results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The problem is clearly defined and well-motivated, with the claimed result representing a significant improvement over previous work and offering further applications.  
- The paper is generally well-written, with a clear overview of the main results and a natural solution approach.

Weaknesses:  
- The main result appears to contradict prior work, particularly Theorem 1.3 of [DK22], raising concerns about its correctness.  
- There are inaccuracies in the presentation of related work, particularly regarding the implications of the listed papers on NGCA.  
- The introduction is overly casual, and Section 3 is dense and difficult to parse, requiring clearer exposition.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the correctness of their main result in relation to Theorem 1.3 of [DK22], ensuring that this comparison is central to the paper. Additionally, the authors should revise the paragraph in lines 66-74 to clarify the relationship between NGCA and the other listed works, avoiding misleading implications. We suggest polishing the introduction for clarity and revising Section 3 to simplify the technical content, possibly by providing proof sketches instead of full proofs. Lastly, a thorough discussion of the limitations posed by existing LLL-based algorithms should be included.
