Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection by introducing "textual outlier exposure," which utilizes textual equivalents instead of visual outliers. The authors propose various methods for generating textual outliers, validated through extensive experiments on large-scale OOD benchmarks. The findings indicate that generated textual outliers outperform visual counterparts and establish criteria for effective textual outliers, including their proximity to data distribution and descriptiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces an innovative idea that has significant implications for OOD detection and online learning.
- It is well-written, with clear organization and intuitive illustrations that enhance understanding.
- The extensive experimental studies demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method and provide valuable insights into different types of textual outliers.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental focus is primarily on outlier exposure methods, lacking comparisons with other OOD detection techniques, which limits the evaluation's comprehensiveness.
- There is an absence of an ablation study to assess how different network architectures impact the proposed methodology.
- The method's reliance on large models like CLIP may lead to unfair comparisons with previous methods and limit applicability to other fields.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including comparisons with recent state-of-the-art methods such as ASH and GradNorm to provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Additionally, conducting an ablation study to investigate the influence of different network architectures on performance would enhance understanding of the method's strengths and limitations. Furthermore, clarifying the rationale for using images from the validation set for outlier generation and addressing the potential impact of smaller CLIP models on metrics would strengthen the paper. Lastly, discussing the filtering process in more detail and its relationship with data quality would be beneficial.
