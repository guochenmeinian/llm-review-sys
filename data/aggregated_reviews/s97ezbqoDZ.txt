Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach called the Regional Heterogeneous Multimodal Brain Networks Fusion Strategy (RH-BrainFS) to address regional heterogeneity between structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) in brain networks fusion. The proposed method includes a brain subgraph networks module for extracting regional characteristics and a transformer-based fusion bottleneck module to mitigate the heterogeneity issue. The authors claim this is the first solution to the structural-functional modal regional heterogeneity problem and demonstrate through extensive experiments that RH-BrainFS outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in various neuroscience tasks. Additionally, the paper explores the use of AI methods in diagnosing medical conditions, specifically focusing on predicting depression using multimodal brain data. The authors propose a framework that transitions from direct to indirect interactions to address regional heterogeneity in multimodal brain networks and acknowledge potential negative social impacts, such as incorrect diagnoses and privacy issues, with plans to include a discussion on these impacts in a future version of the paper.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written, providing a thorough introduction, related work review, and detailed method description.
- The proposed solution addresses a significant challenge in multimodal brain networks, potentially improving multimodal fusion model performance.
- Detailed preprocessing and implementation parameters are provided, enhancing reproducibility.
- The authors recognize the importance of addressing potential negative social impacts and are committed to including this discussion in their future work.
- The proposed framework aims to improve the classification performance of multimodal brain networks by addressing regional heterogeneity.

Weaknesses:
- The authors do not adequately compare their approach with existing methods, such as the joint embedding of structural and functional brain networks with graph neural networks proposed by Zhu et al.
- The originality of the transformer-based fusion is questioned, and the authors should investigate and clarify the fusion bottlenecks that utilize shared characteristics between modalities.
- There is a lack of exploration of different GNN architectures for brain network modeling, which could enhance the robustness of the proposed approach.
- Interpretation analysis is lacking; identifying relevant brain regions for classification tasks and their connectivity patterns could strengthen the findings.
- The claim of being the first to address structural-functional modal regional heterogeneity is seen as overstated, as previous works have tackled similar issues.
- The authors' assertion that their work guarantees no negative social impact is seen as overly confident, as no research can control how findings are utilized.
- There are concerns regarding the novelty of the proposed framework, with some reviewers suggesting that it merely modifies existing methods without providing significant advancements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve their comparison with existing methods, particularly the joint embedding approach by Zhu et al., to substantiate their claims of superiority. Additionally, we suggest investigating and providing concrete interpretations of the fusion bottlenecks that utilize shared characteristics between modalities. The authors should also consider incorporating a broader range of GNN architectures and conducting ablation studies to demonstrate the robustness of their proposed method. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include interpretation analysis to identify key brain regions relevant to their classification tasks. We also recommend that the authors improve their discussion on potential negative social impacts by explicitly acknowledging the limitations of their claims regarding social consequences. Lastly, we suggest that the authors clarify the novelty of their work by addressing the complexities of existing methods and justifying the significance of their proposed framework.
