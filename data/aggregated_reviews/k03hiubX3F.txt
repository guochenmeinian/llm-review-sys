### Key Points
This paper presents Shaver, a novel embedding pruning method for content-based recommender systems (CRSs) that leverages Shapley values to quantify the contribution of embedding parameters, enabling efficient single-shot pruning. The authors propose an unbiased method for estimating Shapley values and introduce a field-aware codebook to reduce information loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate Shaver's competitiveness against state-of-the-art methods without requiring additional fine-tuning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of Shapley value-based pruning offers a new perspective in the CRS domain.
- The paper is well-written, with thorough experiments effectively demonstrating the proposed method's improvements.

Weaknesses:
- The research motivation is unclear, and the connection between on-device CRSs and the Web is not compelling.
- The novelty of the work is not well-defined, as it builds upon existing methods with minimal innovation.
- Contributions are limited, with no significant performance improvements over existing approaches.
- The experimental section lacks depth, particularly in demonstrating deployment on resource-constrained devices.
- The organization and writing are inadequate, with important information relegated to the appendix and redundancy in figures and tables.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the research motivation and establish a stronger connection between on-device CRSs and the Web. Additionally, the authors should clearly define the novelty of their approach and articulate specific contributions compared to existing methods. We suggest enhancing the experimental section to better demonstrate deployment on resource-constrained devices and provide evidence for claimed performance advantages. Furthermore, we recommend including a discussion on the relationship between the approximate Shapley value and the standard Shapley value, as well as incorporating more related works, such as AdaEmbed and CAFE, into the literature review. Lastly, the authors should address the organization and clarity of the paper, ensuring that essential information is presented in the main text rather than the appendix.
