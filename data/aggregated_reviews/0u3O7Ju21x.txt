### Key Points
This paper presents a new seq2seq model, CASENT, aimed at ultra-fine entity typing, featuring a calibration method that transforms conditional log-probability into calibrated confidence values. The authors demonstrate strong experimental results, indicating that the calibration process effectively enhances performance on out-of-domain datasets. However, the definition of Ultra-Fine Entity Typing diverges from the original definition by Choi et al. (2018), as it imposes restrictions on the types used.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed calibration process shows effective performance improvements, particularly in out-of-domain settings.
- Experimental results indicate that CASENT outperforms state-of-the-art models, including ChatGPT, in ultra-fine entity typing tasks.
- The paper is well-organized and clearly articulated, with well-motivated design choices.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the work is questioned, as the primary contribution appears to be the calibration process, which employs techniques to address label prior biases.
- The experimental setup lacks a baseline seq2seq model (T5), making it difficult to assess the calibration process's effectiveness fully.
- The evaluation is primarily quantitative, lacking qualitative analysis and error analysis on baseline outputs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental setup by including the baseline seq2seq model (T5) in all experiments to provide a clearer understanding of the calibration process's effectiveness. Additionally, we suggest incorporating qualitative analysis and error analysis to elucidate the types of errors addressed by the proposed approach. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the definition of Ultra-Fine Entity Typing to align more closely with the original definition by Choi et al. (2018).
