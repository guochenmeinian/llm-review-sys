### Key Points
This paper presents a new annotated dataset, "TalkUp," focused on empowerment detection in Reddit posts, comprising 2000 samples categorized into 'disempower', 'neutral', and 'empower', along with reasons for empowerment. The authors analyze the characteristics of empowering language and its relationship with gender, and provide two baselines for empowerment detection using a fine-tuned RoBERTa and zero-shot GPT-3. The study aims to enhance understanding of empowering language and its potential applications in education and healthcare.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The introduction of a novel dataset and the exploration of empowering language are significant contributions to the field.  
- The comprehensive analysis of linguistic features and gender-related aspects offers valuable insights for future research.  
- The paper addresses a gap in language resources related to empowerment detection.

Weaknesses:  
- Low inter-annotator agreement is noted, with insufficient justification provided.  
- The claim that zero-shot GPT-3 outperforms few-shot learning is counterintuitive and requires further analysis.  
- The dataset may be too small and skewed towards the 'empower' category, necessitating a larger and more balanced sample.  
- The analysis is limited to gender, neglecting other factors like age and culture, and focuses solely on single-turn posts, overlooking multi-turn dialogue complexities.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for low inter-annotator agreement and provide a clearer rationale for the performance of zero-shot GPT-3 compared to few-shot learning. Increasing the dataset size and including more 'disempowering' posts would enhance balance. Additionally, exploring other attributes affecting empowerment, such as age and culture, and addressing multi-turn dialogue could broaden the study's relevance. We also suggest considering the visualization of RoBERTa weights to strengthen the analysis, and clarifying the label distribution in RoBERTa surfaced posts versus randomly sampled posts. Lastly, we encourage the authors to discuss potential applications of the dataset for generating empowering posts and responses in future research.
