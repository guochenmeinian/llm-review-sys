Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a fully quantum Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework, QVAE-Mole, for 3D molecule generation, utilizing a quantum encoding scheme and a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributed latent space. A conditional version, QCVAE-Mole, is also introduced for property-specified generation. The authors propose that the KL divergence term in the ELBO loss is constant, depending solely on the dimension \(d\) and hyperparameter \(\kappa\). They discuss the limitations of current quantum machine learning (QML) models, particularly in comparison to state-of-the-art classical methods, due to constraints in quantum hardware and algorithmic maturity. Experimental results demonstrate that the model surpasses other quantum or hybrid methods and achieves competitive results with fewer parameters compared to classical approaches, although it does not yet show a definitive quantum advantage.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach is novel, being the first fully quantum VAE for 3D molecule generation, which could leverage quantum advantages in the NISQ era.
- The theoretical framework regarding the vMF distribution and its implications for the KL divergence term is well-articulated, ensuring normalization of samples.
- The paper effectively highlights the differences between QCVAE and existing models, particularly in terms of architecture and generative capabilities, demonstrating reasonable performance on larger datasets.

Weaknesses:
- Some background knowledge is insufficiently detailed and should be included in the appendix for clarity.
- The theoretical contributions lack novelty, closely resembling existing works without sufficient differentiation.
- The performance of the proposed method lags behind classical methods, particularly in the metrics of Unique x Valid and Novel x Valid, raising concerns about practical applicability.
- The paper does not compare the **Atom stability** and **Molecule stability** metrics, which are common in 3D molecular generation literature.
- The definitions and calculations of the metrics Valid, Unique, and Novel are ambiguous, potentially leading to unfair comparisons.
- The experimental results do not yet show a clear quantum advantage over classical methods, which may limit the perceived impact of the work.
- The evaluation metrics and methodologies used to assess model performance require further clarification and justification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the background knowledge section by providing more detailed explanations, possibly in an appendix, to aid understanding for readers less familiar with the topic. Additionally, the authors should include comparisons of **Atom stability** and **Molecule stability** metrics to align with existing literature. To enhance the clarity of their evaluation, the authors should explicitly define how the metrics Valid, Unique, and Novel are calculated. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors conduct extensive ablation studies to explore the effects of various components of their model on performance, providing insights into performance trends based on dataset size, molecule complexity, and qubit count. Clarifying the choice of evaluation metrics and the rationale behind specific thresholds would enhance the credibility of the results. Lastly, we encourage the authors to discuss the potential for quantum advantage in more depth, particularly in relation to future advancements in quantum hardware, and to provide a more thorough discussion on how to improve the performance of their method to match classical approaches.
