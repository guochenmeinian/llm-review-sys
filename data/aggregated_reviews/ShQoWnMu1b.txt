### Key Points
This paper presents a method for predicting task transferability by learning an affinity scoring function based on soft prompts. The authors propose a novel approach that allows for efficient selection of source tasks for transfer learning, demonstrating its effectiveness through extensive experiments against various baseline methods. The contributions include a new affinity scoring function and an ablation study that validates its performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Novelty in method, being the first to utilize an affinity scoring function for task transferability.
- Extensive experiments that validate the proposed method against multiple baselines.
- Clear writing that aids in understanding the paper's contributions.

Weaknesses:
- The method suffers from training complexity and lacks important baselines, such as GPT-3 and ChatGPT.
- Insufficient experimental analysis and comparisons with relevant prior work.
- The set of target tasks is limited and not sufficiently diverse from training tasks, raising concerns about generalization.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the training complexity by providing total training time in their experiments. Additionally, include comparisons with important baselines like GPT-3 and ChatGPT, and discuss the advantages of the proposed method over these models. For Table 1, clarify the performance of the Affinity Scoring Function based on specific source tasks to enhance analysis in Section 4.4. We also suggest addressing the behavior of the affinity scoring function with manually-written prompts and including more out-of-distribution (OOD) experiments to strengthen generalization claims. Lastly, ensure that all references are correctly cited and relevant comparisons with previous work are made explicit.
