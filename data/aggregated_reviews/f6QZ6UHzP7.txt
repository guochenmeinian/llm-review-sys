### Key Points
This paper presents ToTER (Topical Taxonomy Enhanced Retrieval), a framework aimed at enhancing retrieval effectiveness in theme-specific contexts by leveraging a topical taxonomy. The authors propose a two-stage approach: first, constructing a topical taxonomy using a silver labels generation strategy and Contrastive Knowledge Distillation (CKD); second, employing this taxonomy during retrieval through strategies such as Sub-Space Alignment (SSA), Contextual Relevance Matching (CRM), and Query Expansion Processing (QEP). The effectiveness of ToTER is validated through experiments on two real-world datasets, showing improvements over baseline methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The innovative use of Topical Taxonomy significantly enhances PLM-based retrieval capabilities by effectively reducing the retrieval space.
2. The paper is well-written, with precise terminology related to themes, topics, relevance, and similarity.
3. The experiments are thorough and provide convincing evidence of the proposed approach's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. Some tables, such as Table 1, contain ambiguous attribute meanings and relationships without clarification.
2. The work lacks novelty, appearing to be an incremental development based on existing methods, particularly in the construction of the Topical Taxonomy, which utilizes techniques from TaxoCom.
3. The paper does not adequately explain the classification of queries and lacks details on taxonomy generation and completion, which are crucial to the contribution.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by providing explicit definitions for the attributes and relationships in tables, particularly in Table 1. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the novelty of the work by conducting more comprehensive analyses and experiments to substantiate the reported improvements. It would be beneficial to include a detailed explanation of how queries are classified and to clarify the taxonomy generation process, including whether queries were included in the corpus used for taxonomy completion. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to discuss the implications of their chosen evaluation metrics and address the scalability and generalization of ToTER across different theme-specific domains.
