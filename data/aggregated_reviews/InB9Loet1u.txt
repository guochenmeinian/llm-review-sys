Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies the algorithm configuration problem with a monotone (invertible) utility function, focusing on a set of $n$ algorithms and instances drawn from a distribution, $\mathcal{D}$. The authors aim to identify an $\epsilon$-optimal algorithm while considering the costs associated with sample collection and the observation of capped runtimes. They present lower bounds on sample and captime requirements and introduce the Utilitarian Procrastination method (UP), an anytime algorithm that adapts captime as needed. Experimental results demonstrate UP's advantages over a naive configuration method. Additionally, the authors propose that the utility of an algorithm is influenced by both intrinsic utility and deliberation cost, equating the latter to running time. However, there are critical misunderstandings in the application of utility theory, particularly regarding the conflation of intrinsic utility with time cost. The paper also discusses the estimation of means for distributions on infinite domains, incorrectly asserting that such distributions lack means, and addresses the estimation of means from right-censored samples without acknowledging established statistical methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper explores an interesting direction in algorithm configuration through a utility-theoretic approach.
2. The setup and algorithms are well articulated.
3. The technical motivation for UP is clearly presented, with results that are strong relative to the established lower bounds.
4. The paper attempts to integrate utility theory into algorithm configuration, which is a relevant and ambitious goal.
5. The authors reference seminal works in the field, providing a foundation for their approach.

Weaknesses:
1. The technical novelty is marginal, as the concept of procrastination has been previously developed.
2. The utilitarian setting appears somewhat artificial, lacking realistic utility functions commonly encountered in practice.
3. The lower bound analysis in Section 3.2 may rely on overly pessimistic inputs, facilitating nearly tight upper bounds in subsequent sections.
4. The discussion has become unproductive, with reviewers expressing confusion over the authors' arguments and the clarity of the review process.
5. There is a fundamental issue with the authors' treatment of utility functions, particularly the assumption that utility remains bounded at zero for algorithms that exceed time limits, leading to paradoxical outcomes.
6. The assertion that distributions on infinite domains lack means is incorrect, and the treatment of right-censored samples lacks acknowledgment of established statistical methods.
7. The implicit assumption that utility cannot be negative is a significant oversight, contradicting established utility theory.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the technical novelty in the utilitarian setting, particularly in relation to previous work by Kleinberg et al. (2017, 2019). Additionally, we suggest providing natural examples of utility functions that are relevant in practice. The authors should also consider relaxing the assumption of invertibility in Section 2 to accommodate non-invertible functions, as this may enhance the applicability of their results. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve their understanding of probability and statistics, particularly regarding distributions on infinite domains, acknowledging that many such distributions can have means. We also suggest that the authors critically evaluate the methods for estimating means from right-censored samples, incorporating established techniques. It is crucial to address the inherent inconsistencies in their approach, particularly regarding the utility function's behavior at positive time infinity. Lastly, we advise a thorough review of the Graham et al. paper to ensure accurate representation and application of its findings, and to reconsider their stance on utility, recognizing that negative utility is valid and should be integrated into their decision-making framework.
