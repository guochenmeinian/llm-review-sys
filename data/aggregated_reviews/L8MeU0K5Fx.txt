### Key Points
This paper presents Distinguished Quantized Guidance for Diffusion-based Sequence Recommendation (DiQDiff), addressing two primary challenges in sequential recommender systems: the heterogeneity of user behavior and the popularity bias in recommendation models. The authors propose a framework that incorporates Semantic Vector Quantization (SVQ) to enhance guidance signals and Contrastive Discrepancy Maximization (CDM) to mitigate biases in item generation. The method is evaluated on four datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over existing benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel approach by combining diffusion models with quantized guidance, effectively addressing common challenges in sequential recommendations.
- The methodology is technically rigorous, with a well-structured framework and comprehensive experiments validating its effectiveness across multiple datasets.
- The related works are well-explained, and the authors clearly outline the main challenges and contributions.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks experiments demonstrating how DiQDiff handles heterogeneous sequences, which would strengthen its claims.
- Key concepts like vector quantization are insufficiently explained, potentially hindering reader comprehension.
- There is no discussion of the model's limitations or failure cases, nor is there a comparative analysis of computational efficiency against baseline models.
- The motivations for the proposed method are not adequately reflected in the experiments, particularly regarding the handling of noise and sparsity in user interaction sequences.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of vector quantization in the preliminary section to enhance reader understanding. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments that artificially introduce noise and sparsity to evaluate the model's robustness under these conditions. It would also be beneficial to include a discussion of potential limitations and failure cases of the model. Furthermore, providing a comparative analysis of the computational efficiency of DiQDiff relative to other generative methods would enhance the paper's quality. Lastly, we encourage the authors to ensure that the experimental results reflect the motivations outlined in the introduction, particularly concerning the heterogeneity of user interaction sequences.
