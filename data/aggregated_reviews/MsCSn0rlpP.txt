### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive benchmarking tool for dataset creation practices and communication, emphasizing the significance of dataset curation within the D&B track. The authors propose a detailed framework for evaluating datasets, identifying critical areas for improvement such as documentation consistency, environmental impact, and ethical considerations. The framework was applied to assess 60 datasets, revealing substantial gaps in documentation quality and a lack of improvement over time.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The framework developed is well-considered and tested, with a clear iterative methodology.
- The supplementary materials effectively address specific methodological questions.
- The findings highlight significant issues in dataset documentation practices and provide a solid basis for future improvements.

Weaknesses:
- Variability in inter-rater reliability (0.45 to 0.94) suggests subjectivity in the review process, which could be better addressed.
- Some elements of the evaluation framework lack sufficient citation or rationale, and there is uncertainty about omitted elements.
- The focus on documentation may overlook the complexities of dataset creation processes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on inter-rater reliability variability to reflect the subjectivity of the review process and provide insights into factors that led to disagreements among reviewers. Additionally, we suggest including more information on the rationale behind certain guidelines and clarifying any omitted elements from the framework. It would be beneficial to address the limitations of relying solely on documentation for audits and consider the implications of standardizing the framework. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the distinctions between this paper and Ref. 21, ensuring that contributions are clearly articulated and that redundancies are minimized.
