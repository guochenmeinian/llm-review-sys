Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach called "gradient flossing" aimed at addressing the instability of gradients in recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The authors leverage the connection between Lyapunov exponents and the singular values of the model-Jacobian to propose a regularization technique that stabilizes gradient signals during training. They demonstrate improvements in synthetic tasks involving long-range dependencies, showing that gradient flossing can lead to faster convergence and higher success rates.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors effectively address a longstanding issue in training neural networks, particularly for sequence models with long temporal dependencies.
- The use of Lyapunov exponents to mitigate gradient instability is well-justified and shows promising results on toy tasks.
- The paper provides practical insights into the implementation of gradient flossing, including when and how often to apply it during training.

Weaknesses:
- The lack of experiments on real-world data is a significant limitation, as the authors consciously avoid using standard benchmarks like Sequential MNIST, which hinders understanding of the method's potential failure modes.
- Clarity issues persist, particularly regarding the definitions and explanations of key equations, such as the loss function and the long-term Jacobian.
- The empirical evaluations are limited to toy tasks, and comparisons with more competitive methods and architectures are lacking.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the manuscript by defining all key terms and equations more explicitly, particularly $\tau$ in equation 1 and the loss function in equation 4. Additionally, we urge the authors to conduct experiments on standard benchmarks like Sequential MNIST to better understand the proposed method's performance in real-world scenarios. It is also advisable to compare gradient flossing against more recent methods, such as HiPPO Matrices and state space models, to establish its competitiveness. Finally, addressing the potential limitations of pushing Lyapunov exponents to zero in certain contexts would enhance the depth of the discussion.
