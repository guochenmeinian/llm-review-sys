Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel RGB-E tracking framework, CSAM, which utilizes an MOT philosophy to track both targets and distractors effectively. The framework includes a Candidate Encoding Module, a Spatial-Temporal Transformer Encoder, and a Dual-branch Transformer Decoder, leveraging appearance and motion cues for improved candidate matching. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance across three RGB-E tracking benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation is clear, addressing an important problem in RGB-E tracking.
2. This is the first work to apply MOT philosophy to the SOT task using RGB-E data.
3. The proposed framework, CSAM, is novel and well-supported by extensive experimental results.

Weaknesses:
1. More experimental results under varying illumination conditions are needed to emphasize the necessity of DVS.
2. The paper contains excessive abbreviations, particularly in CSAM, complicating comprehension.
3. The ablation study regarding N/M/T is absent, and the selection of hyperparameters (e.g., τth and ζ) lacks discussion.
4. The motivation for the model's complexity and its implications on performance require clearer analysis.
5. The writing quality needs improvement, with several inconsistencies and misrepresentations noted.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by reducing the number of abbreviations and providing a more thorough explanation of the model's complexity and its necessity. Additionally, we suggest including more experimental results under varying illumination conditions to validate the effectiveness of DVS. The authors should also conduct an ablation study on N/M/T and discuss the selection of hyperparameters in detail. Furthermore, enhancing the writing quality and addressing inconsistencies in figures and descriptions will strengthen the paper. Lastly, providing qualitative examples in the main text, rather than solely in supplementary materials, could help readers better understand the method's advantages and disadvantages.
