### Key Points
This paper presents a method to enhance the stability of 3D models generated from text prompts by integrating a differentiable simulation-based loss function with existing diffusion-based text-to-3D frameworks. The authors propose a "standability" loss to maintain the generated mesh's rotation and a "stable" loss to encourage a local minimum of height for the center of mass. The evaluation includes both simulations and real-world 3D-printed models, demonstrating improved stability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses the significant issue of physical stability in 3D generation, introducing effective methods tailored to SDS-based models.
- The writing is clear and accessible, facilitating understanding and implementation.
- The experimental validation is robust, showcasing the method's effectiveness in both simulated and real-world contexts.

Weaknesses:
- The lack of ablation studies raises questions about the necessity and influence of each loss term, particularly the standability and stable losses.
- The paper does not adequately compare its methods with traditional balancing techniques or provide sufficient baselines to demonstrate the non-triviality of the task.
- Important details regarding loss weights and the setting of parameters like \(T\) are not sufficiently addressed, complicating reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including a comprehensive ablation study to clarify the contribution of each loss term. Additionally, a direct comparison with traditional balancing methods would strengthen the argument for the proposed approach. It would also be beneficial to provide clearer definitions of key terms such as "self-supporting" and to specify the loss weights in Eq (10) to enhance reproducibility. Finally, including more details on the failure modes of the proposed method would be valuable for future research.
