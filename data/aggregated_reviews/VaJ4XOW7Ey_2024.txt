Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of the relationship between context length and mixing time in reinforcement learning policies, demonstrating that longer context lengths lead to increased mixing times. The authors establish theoretical bounds linking mixing time to the structure of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) and provide empirical evidence through toy examples and experiments with different architectures, particularly Transformers. Additionally, the paper introduces a novel approach to defining the $\epsilon$-return mixing time through the term $\rho(\pi, s_0, m) := E_\pi[\frac{1}{m} \sum_{t=1}^m r_t | s_0]$. The authors acknowledge potential confusion regarding this definition and plan to clarify it in the final draft. The findings suggest that the complexity of evaluating policies increases with context length, and the authors emphasize the need for a stronger connection between experiments and theory.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant problem in context-based reinforcement learning, providing a novel theoretical connection between context length and mixing time.
- The writing quality is high, with a clear structure that aids understanding.
- The theoretical results, while not groundbreaking, offer a fresh perspective on established concepts.
- Empirical verification through toy examples supports the theoretical claims.
- The authors demonstrate a willingness to engage constructively with reviewers and clarify complex points.

Weaknesses:
- Some figures, particularly in the experimental section, lack clarity, making it difficult to understand correlations, especially in Figures 3 and 4.
- The theoretical bounds are upper bounds, and their applicability to all algorithms is uncertain, as they may not reflect the actual complexity of context length.
- The experimental results are inconclusive, with potential confounding factors not fully explored, raising questions about the correlation between reward rates and mixing times.
- The presentation and experimental results require improvement for better clarity and coherence.
- The relationship between theory and experiments is perceived as weak by some reviewers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the figures and their captions, particularly in Figures 3 and 4, to better illustrate the relationships being discussed. Additionally, we suggest providing proof sketches for the theoretical results to clarify the mechanisms behind the findings, especially regarding the roles of variables like $l$, $k$, $\beta$, and $g$. We encourage the authors to clarify the definition of $\rho(\pi, s_0, m)$ by considering a more formal approach as suggested in the referenced work. Furthermore, we suggest enhancing the connection between the theoretical framework and experimental results to address how reward rates influence mixing times and to strengthen the overall coherence of the paper. Finally, we recommend including empirical evaluations of the bounds to bolster the theoretical insights presented.
