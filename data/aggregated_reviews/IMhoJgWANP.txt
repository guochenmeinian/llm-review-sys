### Key Points
This paper presents a large-scale empirical analysis comparing web development practices between developed and developing countries, focusing on various axes such as webpage size, security, privacy, and optimizations. The authors analyze 200,000 webpages across 20 countries, providing valuable insights into the digital divide from a web development perspective. The study highlights that developing countries adopt newer techniques more rapidly but often lack optimization, suggesting a need for targeted improvements.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper utilizes a large-scale dataset, offering a comprehensive picture by balancing representation from both developed and developing nations.
- A well-motivated methodology combines multiple data sources and measurement tools, enhancing the study's credibility.
- The authors present plausible hypotheses for their findings, making the paper engaging and insightful.

Weaknesses:
- Some technical aspects are unclear, particularly regarding the differences between trackers and cookies.
- The applicability of the study's findings is not well-defined, raising questions about the intended audience and beneficiaries.
- Minor issues include incomplete references, unclear figures, and typographical errors.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity on the intended audience and beneficiaries of the study. Additionally, addressing the differences between trackers and cookies would enhance the technical rigor. The authors should also operationalize accessibility aspects more thoroughly, providing deeper insights into how it varies across the two groups of countries. Furthermore, including more details about the CrUX dataset would aid in understanding its significance. Lastly, correcting typographical errors and enhancing figure clarity, particularly in Figures 11 and 13, would improve the overall presentation.
