Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework called Long-range Meta-path Search through Progressive Sampling (LMSPS), which aims to efficiently utilize long-range dependencies in large-scale heterogeneous graphs. The authors propose a progressive sampling algorithm and a sampling evaluation strategy to reduce computational costs while maximizing information utilization and addressing the over-smoothing problem in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The results indicate that the performance of the proposed LMSPS method improves with longer meta-paths, and comprehensive experiments reveal that a small number of meta-paths significantly influence performance, while others may negatively impact it. The framework demonstrates effectiveness by outperforming state-of-the-art baselines across multiple datasets, including the evaluation of its ability to eliminate negative meta-paths.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written, coherent, and easy to follow.
2. The use of a progressive sampling algorithm to narrow the search space for meta-paths is novel and well-motivated.
3. The methodology effectively addresses the challenges of searching for long-range meta-paths, maintaining stable performance and resource usage.
4. Empirical results demonstrate that LMSPS outperforms existing methods across various datasets, providing a clear rationale for the effectiveness of the discovered meta-paths.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the paper is limited, as the differentiable search method is widely used in automated graph learning tasks, and the proposed sampling strategies lack theoretical analysis.
2. The paper primarily evaluates only one large-scale dataset (OGBN-MAG), raising concerns about the generalizability of the findings.
3. Many searched meta-paths lack interpretability, with some appearing strange or unreasonable, necessitating a deeper analysis of their semantics and characteristics.
4. There is insufficient discussion on the implications of the observed meta-paths for robust generalization and performance improvement, as well as a lack of specific techniques for searching meaningful long-range meta-paths.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis regarding the effectiveness of the progressive sampling method, specifically addressing how it filters promising meta-paths in the early search stages. Additionally, the authors should conduct experiments on a broader range of large-scale heterogeneous datasets beyond OGBN-MAG to validate the proposed method's effectiveness. It is also suggested to provide a detailed interpretability analysis of the searched meta-paths, highlighting common characteristics and their relevance to the target tasks. Furthermore, we recommend enhancing the discussion on the quality of the discovered meta-paths, particularly regarding their effectiveness across various HGNN architectures, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of their contributions. Finally, more detailed ablation studies focusing on individual components of LMSPS would strengthen the validation of its effectiveness.
