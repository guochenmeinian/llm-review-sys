Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on semi-supervised learning (SSL) in a 2-class classification problem, assuming samples from isotropic Gaussian distributions with unknown mean vectors $\mu_1$ and $\mu_{-1}$. The authors propose that the vector $\Delta \mu = \mu_1 - \mu_{-1}$ is sparse, with $k << p$ non-zero elements. The main contributions include deriving information-theoretic lower bounds for exact support recovery in SSL, establishing computational lower bounds as $(k, L, n, p) \to \infty$, and identifying conditions under which SSL is computationally advantageous for classification and feature selection. The authors also propose an SSL algorithm that outperforms traditional supervised or unsupervised methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The theoretical results are interesting, with rigorous proofs.  
- The writing is clear and easy to follow.  
- The paper is well-structured and presents a thorough literature review.  

Weaknesses:  
- The algorithm LSPCA appears to lack practical applicability to real-world data, limiting its value to theoretical contexts.  
- The exposition could be improved, particularly regarding the clarity of Theorem 2.3 and Corollary 2.4, and the connection of Figure 1 to theorems.  
- The computational-statistical gap in SSL remains unclear, particularly regarding the "white hole" in Figure 1.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the practical applicability of the LSPCA algorithm to enhance its relevance for real-world data. Additionally, we suggest providing a clearer exposition of Theorem 2.3 and Corollary 2.4, including explicit connections to Figure 1. It would also be beneficial to rigorously address the computational-statistical gap mentioned in the paper, particularly in relation to the "white hole" region. Lastly, we encourage the authors to include a detailed explanation of the reduction on Eqn (3) in the appendix for clarity.
