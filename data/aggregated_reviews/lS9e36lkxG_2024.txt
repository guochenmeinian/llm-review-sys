Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach named Diffusion-based Representation with Random Distance matching (D2R2) for tabular few-shot learning. It utilizes diffusion models to extract essential semantic knowledge for the denoising process and introduces a random distance matching mechanism to preserve distance information in embeddings, enhancing classification effectiveness. The authors propose an instance-wise iterative prototype scheme during classification to improve performance by accommodating the multimodality of embeddings. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that D2R2 achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem addressed is interesting and valuable, with a well-written and clear presentation.
- The proposed method shows promising experimental results, validating its effectiveness.
- It is the first to apply diffusion models specifically for tabular few-shot learning.

Weaknesses:
- The introduction lacks sufficient emphasis on the shortcomings of existing tabular few-shot learning methods, particularly regarding heterologous feature types.
- There is insufficient motivation for leveraging diffusion models, which should be tied to existing problems.
- The relationship between semi-supervised learning, self-supervised learning, and tabular few-shot learning is not adequately explained.
- The paper does not discuss the scalability of the method to larger datasets or those with high dimensionality.
- The pseudo-label validation scheme for hyperparameter selection may not reliably reflect true labels.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by emphasizing the issues posed by heterologous feature types that current methods overlook. Additionally, the authors should clarify the motivation for using diffusion models based on existing challenges. It would be beneficial to explain the connections between semi-supervised learning, self-supervised learning, and tabular few-shot learning, particularly in relation to D2R2. Furthermore, the authors should provide more empirical evidence regarding the scalability of their method to larger datasets and higher feature dimensions, as well as a detailed analysis of the pseudo-label validation scheme's reliability.
