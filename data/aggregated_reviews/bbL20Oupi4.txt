Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of fractional allocation rules in liquid democracy, focusing on two equivalent delegation rules: Mixed Borda Branching and Random Walk Rule. The authors demonstrate the equivalence of these rules in the context of fractional delegations and provide a polynomial-time algorithm for computing outcomes based on these rules. The paper also conducts an axiomatic analysis concerning anonymity, copy-robustness, confluence, and top-rank priority.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents an interesting model that extends previous work on delegation rules.
- The equivalence between the two delegation rules is a significant and non-obvious contribution, supported by technically involved results.
- The authors effectively leverage known lemmas and introduce techniques from graph theory and combinatorial optimization.

Weaknesses:
- The choice of the top-rank priority axiom appears somewhat arbitrary, and it would be beneficial to explore other axioms leading to similar impossibility results.
- The axiomatic analysis does not seem to resolve key issues discussed in the introduction, instead circumventing them.
- The equivalence of Mixed Borda Branching and Random Walk Rule may not be as surprising given existing knowledge of the Markov chain rule.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction by minimizing assumptions about the reader's prior knowledge of liquid democracy literature. Specifically, terms like "rank function on edges" and "subpath of v1" should be clearly defined. Additionally, we suggest that the authors address the implications of ignoring isolated voters on axioms like copy-robustness and provide a more in-depth discussion of the supervised learning literature to enhance the paper's relevance to broader audiences. Lastly, we advise the authors to clarify the novelty of their Directed Power Watershed algorithm in relation to existing work.
