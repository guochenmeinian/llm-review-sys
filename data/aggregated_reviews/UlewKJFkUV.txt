### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of neural machine translation models by mapping source/target pairs onto a memorization/generalization continuum. The authors train multiple systems on overlapping data subsets and compare the length-normalized probabilities P(Y|X) to derive training memorization (TM), generalization score (GS), and counterfactual memorization (CM). They identify correlations between these scores and input features, and build predictive models for TM, GS, and CM. The findings illustrate that memorization is influenced by data characteristics and can lead to hallucinations, providing insights for improving machine translation quality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and logically structured.
- It presents thorough experimental results that convincingly demonstrate the claims.
- The innovative "Memorisation Cartography" approach offers a new perspective on the memorization-generalization continuum.
- The research addresses significant issues in NLP, such as generalization, memorization, and hallucinations.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the work is somewhat limited, and the motivation could be stronger.
- The applicability of findings to low-resource settings is unclear.
- The experimental setup is constrained, limiting the generality of the results.
- There is a lack of practical implementations or strategies for real-world applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generality of their findings by validating their results on a broader range of datasets, including diverse languages and domains. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide concrete strategies or tools that leverage their insights for practical applications. Finally, we encourage the authors to consider other factors influencing NMT performance to provide a more holistic view of the memorization-generalization dynamics.
