Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an ecosystem-level analysis of machine learning models, investigating how systemic failures occur when an individual is misclassified by all models in a given ecosystem. The authors utilize the HAPI and DDI datasets to demonstrate that model improvements do not significantly reduce systemic failures, often occurring on instances already classified by other systems. Additionally, the paper reveals that human annotators exhibit greater polarization than models, particularly regarding skin tone disparities. This research contributes to the understanding of algorithmic monoculture and outcome homogenization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper offers an original and valuable contribution to the literature on homogeneous outcomes, providing empirical evidence of systemic failures across multiple modalities and datasets.  
- It effectively highlights the implications of repeated failures for individuals, emphasizing the societal impact of machine learning models.  
- The writing is clear, and the technical limitations and strengths are well-defined, particularly in section 6.  

Weaknesses:  
- The model proposed in section 3.2 for computing expected failure rates is questionable, as it assumes independence among models that are tested on the same dataset.  
- The commentary in section 6 lacks depth regarding the factors driving systemic failures, leaving important questions about polarization unanswered.  
- The theoretical framework is underdeveloped, limiting the understanding of the implications of systemic failures and the mechanisms behind them.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical grounding of their claims regarding systemic failures, potentially focusing on a single dataset for deeper analysis. Additionally, consider revising section 3 to either remove the expected failure rates or replace it with a more detailed model from section 6 that captures correlations among models. Clarifying the definition of "negative outcomes" in the introduction would enhance understanding. Including a discussion on successes that turn into failures in section 4 and providing more details or figures related to the correlation between systemic failure rates and annotator disagreement would strengthen the analysis. Finally, we suggest expanding the discussion on the causes of polarization and its implications for different contexts.
