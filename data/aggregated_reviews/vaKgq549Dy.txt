### Key Points
This paper presents a study on evaluating the factual consistency of automatically generated summaries, proposing a novel model, FACTKB, which enhances factual knowledge representation by focusing on entities and relations. The authors introduce three pre-training objectives: Entity Wiki, Evidence Extraction, and KnowledgeWalk, leveraging external knowledge graphs like Wikidata and Yago. The model is evaluated on both in-domain (news summarization) and out-of-domain (scientific literature) datasets, demonstrating improved performance in factual consistency evaluation, particularly in mitigating semantic frame errors.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized and clearly written, providing a comprehensive analysis of limitations.
- It proposes three innovative strategies for factuality pretraining, enhancing model capabilities.
- Robust experimental results show improvements over existing methods in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed method lacks fine-grained factuality assessment and interpretability, making it difficult to identify specific factuality issues.
- The experimental analysis could benefit from more detail, particularly regarding the differences between FACTKB and existing models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the interpretability of the model by providing examples that illustrate which tokens or sentences receive more attention weights for factuality evaluation. Additionally, the authors should include a deeper exploration of the improvements related to semantic frame errors, potentially through qualitative analysis. Clarifying the motivations behind the three pre-training strategies and providing more detailed comparisons with baseline models would strengthen the paper. Finally, addressing the experimental setup and ensuring proper citations for knowledge graphs in the main text would enhance clarity and rigor.
