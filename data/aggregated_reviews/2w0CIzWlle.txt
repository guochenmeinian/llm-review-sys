### Key Points
This paper presents a novel extension to the self-consistency framework aimed at enhancing language model reasoning through two main techniques: Centroid Proximity Weighting (CPW) and Semantic Consensus Weighting (SCW). The authors propose utilizing outlier removal algorithms to improve semantic consistency among responses generated for the same input. The methodology is well-articulated, with thorough experimental evaluations across multiple datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements in reasoning capabilities, particularly on complex tasks like StrategyQA.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of CPW and SCW provides innovative methods for analyzing semantic relationships in reasoning paths.
- Empirical results indicate significant performance improvements across various datasets.
- The methodology is clearly described, facilitating understanding of the experimental setup and evaluation metrics.
- Extensive ablation studies and analyses are included, showcasing rigorous investigation.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks generalizability and could benefit from deeper methodological investigations and a clearer rationale for dataset choices.
- Some results show inconsistent performance, particularly with CPW on certain models, which requires further explanation.
- The trade-off between diversity and coherence in reasoning paths is not adequately explored.
- The conclusion lacks clear recommendations, and the paper exceeds the recommended length.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their methodology by providing more detailed explanations of the dataset choices and the distinctions between CPW and SCW. Additionally, addressing the inconsistent performance of the proposed methods through further ablation studies would strengthen the findings. Exploring the diversity versus coherence trade-off in reasoning paths and including visualizations or case studies of the weighting process would enhance interpretability. Finally, we suggest revising the conclusion to offer clearer recommendations and ensuring the paper adheres to the length guidelines.
