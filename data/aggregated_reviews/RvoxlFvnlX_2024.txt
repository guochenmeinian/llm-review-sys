Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel watermarking technique for diffusion models that is robust against input transformations and imperceptible to the human eye. The authors propose embedding the watermark during the intermediate diffusion process using adversarial optimization to enhance watermark strength while minimizing differences between watermarked and original outputs. The method identifies optimal keypoints for watermark embedding without degrading image quality. Evaluation against six attack types demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms existing baselines in robustness, with numerical and perceptual assessments indicating minimal distortion. Several ablation studies validate the design choices.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The design incorporates an intriguing adversarial optimization and prompt embedding optimization strategy.
2. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
3. Results are promising, validated through thorough testing.

Weaknesses:
1. The evaluation could be enhanced by including more robust attack scenarios.
2. Certain sections of the manuscript would benefit from more detailed explanations.
3. The methodology and empirical results lack clarity, particularly regarding the optimization of guiding prompts and the presentation of figures and tables.
4. The robustness improvement over existing methods is minor, and the rationale for certain design choices is not well-explained.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology by moving critical explanations from Appendix A to the main text. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed discussion on how the watermarking technique resists frequency domain attacks and clarify the distinction between passive and active watermarking methods. It would also be beneficial to address the minor robustness improvements over existing methods and ensure that all figures and tables are clearly presented and explained. Lastly, the authors should explicitly describe the methodology for selecting the L1 distance threshold for watermark verification and consider using FID scores for a more balanced evaluation of their method's effectiveness.
