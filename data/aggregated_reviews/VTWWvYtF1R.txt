### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Reasoning via Planning (RAP) framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by integrating an external world model and principled planning methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). The authors propose a method that builds a tree-structured internal world model, simulating actions and states to improve decision-making. The evaluation across tasks such as Blocksworld, high school math, and logical reasoning demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The RAP framework introduces a promising approach to enhance LLMs by utilizing world models and MCTS for reasoning.
- The paper showcases substantial performance improvements across diverse tasks, indicating the framework's general applicability.
- The experimental design is robust, providing clear evidence of the framework's advantages over contemporary methods.

Weaknesses:
- The method's reliance on LLM outputs raises concerns about the fidelity of action space and state predictions, particularly regarding self-evaluation rewards.
- The effectiveness of reward designs is not thoroughly explored, lacking analysis on their task dependency.
- The Limitations section requires further elaboration to address inherent constraints of using frozen LLMs without fine-tuning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method by including a full sample prompt to assist in the description. It would be beneficial to clarify whether the action space is pre-defined or completely open-ended. Additionally, in Section 3.2, the authors should specify how the likelihood of action is determined. The authors should also explain how "multiple sample answers" are drawn from the world model and define "terminal state" more clearly. For fair comparisons in Table 1, the authors should justify why CoTs are not allowed multiple trials if RAP is. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the meaning of "super large" in line 455, define "alpha" in line 524, and explain "self-consistency" in line 541. Lastly, the authors should investigate whether increasing sample numbers could allow Least-to-Most or CoT to outperform RAP, as suggested by Figure 5.
