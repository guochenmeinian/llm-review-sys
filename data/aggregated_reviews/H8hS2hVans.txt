### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework named FIM (Framework of dIffusion approxiMation) aimed at addressing the computational complexities of large-scale network inference and influence estimation. The authors propose a continuous-time dynamical system approach to the diffusion process, contrasting with traditional discrete models. The framework includes a formalization of the diffusion graph problem, model introduction, and experiments conducted on both real-world and self-generated datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The transformation of the diffusion graph problem into a continuous-time framework is a significant innovation, aligning more closely with real-world scenarios.
2. The proposed model demonstrates the ability to perform large-scale data calculations with minimal computational power, enhancing the applicability of graph diffusion algorithms.

Weaknesses:
1. The baseline comparison is outdated, limiting the demonstration of the proposed model's superiority over contemporary methods.
2. The analysis of approximation errors and the introduction of the shortest diffusion time of set (SDTS) technique lack necessary ablation experiments to validate SDTS's effectiveness.
3. The assumption of a static network architecture restricts the model's applicability to dynamic datasets, such as social networks, which evolve over time.
4. The reliance on social media datasets for experiments raises questions about the model's scalability across diverse fields.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the baseline comparisons by including more recent methods to substantiate the advantages of their approach. Additionally, we suggest conducting ablation experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the SDTS technique. The authors should also consider addressing the limitations posed by static network assumptions and explore the model's scalability using datasets from various domains. Lastly, providing more details on the SDTS method and clarifying the impact of the initial state S on results would enhance the paper's robustness.
