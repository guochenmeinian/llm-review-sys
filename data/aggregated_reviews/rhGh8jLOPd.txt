### Key Points
This paper presents a novel multilingual Visual Question Answering (mVQA) dataset named MAVERICS-XM3600 (MaXM) in seven languages, contributing to the field of mVQA. The authors propose a lightweight mVQA model called MPT, which demonstrates competitive performance against existing benchmarks. The dataset has undergone rigorous human verification and serves as a benchmarking tool for evaluating multilingual comprehension capabilities of VQA models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The MAVERICS-XM3600 dataset is a valuable asset for multilingual VQA research.
- The paper provides a comprehensive comparison of monolingual and multilingual VQA models.
- The authors perform an exhaustive set of experiments and ablations, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The contributions of the multilingual data curation pipeline and the benchmark creation process lack novelty and detail.
- The proposed MPT model shows limited novelty and does not outperform state-of-the-art models.
- Experimental results are somewhat inconclusive, with unclear baseline comparisons and a lack of detailed analysis of the dataset.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of the multilingual data curation pipeline and provide a more detailed description of the benchmark creation process. Additionally, the authors should clarify the advantages of the proposed multilingual dataset over a mixed dataset of single-language VQA data. It would be beneficial to include comparisons of model sizes and compute for the MPT model against state-of-the-art models. Finally, a more in-depth qualitative analysis of the dataset is necessary to enhance the paper's contributions.
