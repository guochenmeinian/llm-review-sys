Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a model of hippocampal neurons that utilizes a similarity-based objective function to generate context-dependent place cell representations. The authors demonstrate that both feedforward and recurrent neural networks can exhibit remapping behaviors akin to biological place cells when exposed to varying contextual cues. The model learns place-like representations, defined by peak activation locations that can decode position from the model's output. Additionally, the proposed model shows invariance to orthogonal transformations across contexts, suggesting a novel approach to understanding hippocampal function.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The objective function is intuitive and effectively maintains similarity between representational and physical spaces, allowing for localized representation and remapping capabilities.
- The authors effectively utilize machine learning techniques to model neural activity, offering an intriguing perspective on remapping representations based on context.
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with comprehensive experiments and analyses that are clearly presented.
- The concept of using orthogonal transformations for remapping could be applicable to other neural networks or brain regions.
- The writing is clear, well-organized, and the figures are well-made and easy to understand.
- The authors acknowledge the model's limitations and discuss them in detail.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on explicit position information in training and inference raises questions about biological plausibility, as existing models can learn hippocampal-like representations without such information.
- A major concern is that the feedforward network receives ground truth location data, which undermines the claim of how place cell responses emerge.
- The recurrent model, which only uses velocity information, is more compelling but is underutilized.
- The title is vague and could better reflect the focus on hippocampal place cells; a mention of "context-specific" spatial maps would enhance clarity.
- The paper lacks a dedicated "related work" section, making it challenging for non-expert readers to contextualize the findings within the broader literature.
- The experimental setup uses fixed environment shapes, limiting the generalizability of findings across differently shaped contexts.
- The authors' objective function, described as "minimal," includes five constraints, which raises questions about its simplicity.
- The decoding approach lacks clarity, and the rationale for using a scalar context signal needs further exploration.
- There are concerns regarding the model's architecture, such as the necessity of multiple layers for encoding only two input dimensions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the title to include "hippocampal place cells" and consider using "context-specific" spatial maps for greater accuracy. Additionally, we suggest adding a "related work" section to provide a clearer roadmap for readers unfamiliar with the literature. The authors should discuss the limitations of their model regarding empirical predictions more explicitly, particularly concerning the gradual transition between contexts and the implications of varying receptive field sizes. 

We also recommend that the authors improve the model by training it without direct position information to better mimic the brain's learning process. Clarifying the rationale for different inputs to the feedforward and recurrent models and whether the objective function is modified for the recurrent model would be beneficial. It would also be helpful to provide a more detailed explanation of the objective function's constraints to emphasize its simplicity. 

Furthermore, we encourage the authors to conduct ablation studies to investigate the role of individual components of the loss function, particularly the Gaussian drop-off and the second-order loss, and to compare these with simpler alternatives. Clarifying the implications of the plots in figures 2f, 4f, and 5b would enhance the interpretability of the results. The authors should explore the impact of different input formats on response profiles and consider including a continual learning experiment to demonstrate the efficiency of learning new contexts. Lastly, validating the model using additional dimensionality reduction methods beyond UMAP would strengthen the findings and explore the use of proxies for distance, such as the number of steps traveled, to address biological plausibility.
