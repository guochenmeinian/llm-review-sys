### Key Points
This paper presents a benchmark, IndoMMLU, for evaluating large language models (LLMs) using K-12 exam questions in Indonesian. It includes 14,906 questions across various subjects and analyzes the performance of 24 multilingual LLMs, revealing significant challenges in understanding local languages and cultures. The study contributes to the field by addressing the performance of LLMs in non-English languages, particularly highlighting their limitations in Indonesian.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The IndoMMLU dataset is a valuable resource for assessing reasoning abilities and real-world knowledge in Indonesian.  
- The comprehensive analysis provides significant insights into the performance of different LLMs.  
- The study promotes AI democratization by highlighting LLM limitations in low-resource languages.  

Weaknesses:  
- The applicability of the benchmark across other languages, such as English, remains unverified.  
- There is no evaluation using GPT-4, which could provide critical insights into performance limitations.  
- The exploration of LLMs' learning curves from grades 1 to 12 is insufficiently addressed.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including a comparison with GPT-4, even if it is a small-scale experiment, to substantiate claims regarding performance limitations. Additionally, the authors should clarify the impact of questions related to Indonesian culture and geography on LLM performance and consider conducting experiments in English to explore this further. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors provide a more robust justification for the importance of evaluating models on a learning curve, particularly in subjects where knowledge progression is not strictly cumulative.
