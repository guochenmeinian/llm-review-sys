### Key Points
This paper presents three new algorithms—SCF, SCFV, and SCFV+—for estimating the diagonal entries of the forest matrix $\Omega = (I + L)^{-1}$ for directed graphs, where $L$ is the graph Laplacian. The authors leverage a probabilistic interpretation of the diagonal entries, asserting that the inverse of the $i$-th diagonal entry corresponds to the average size of the tree containing node $i$ across all converging spanning forests. The estimators are shown to be unbiased, with SCFV+ achieving a bounded relative variance. The paper includes comprehensive experiments comparing these algorithms with existing methods for undirected graphs, demonstrating their effectiveness across various graph sizes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a fundamental problem with significant applications in network science.
- The proposed algorithms provide provable guarantees and demonstrate good empirical performance, particularly SCFV+.

Weaknesses:
- Some claims and notations are unclear or non-standard, potentially hindering understanding.
- The motivation for focusing on directed graphs over undirected ones is not convincingly articulated.
- The paper lacks clarity on the relationship between diagonal entries and applications like forest closeness centrality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their claims and notations to enhance understanding. Specifically, please provide a more detailed discussion on the importance of diagonal entries in applications such as forest closeness centrality. Additionally, clarify the necessity of the proposed methods in the context of existing directed Laplacian solvers and elaborate on why directed graphs present unique challenges. Finally, ensure that the experimental results are connected to the theoretical guarantees discussed, particularly regarding the sampling number $l$.
