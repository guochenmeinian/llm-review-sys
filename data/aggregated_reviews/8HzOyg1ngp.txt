Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents GS2, a novel method for addressing large information states in subgame solving within imperfect-information games. The authors provide theoretical results and experimental evaluations, particularly on the GuanDan game, demonstrating impressive performance. The contributions include a theoretical bound on exploitability increase when refining strategies in subgames and the design of the GS2 algorithm, which utilizes a diversity-based generation function to sample histories effectively.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The theoretical guarantee of the GS2 algorithm is a significant advancement.
- The experimental results, especially in the GuanDan game, showcase strong performance.
- The paper is well-structured, with clear descriptions and a relevant example illustrating the technique.

Weaknesses:
- Some claims are misleading or poorly justified, particularly regarding the exploitability bounds and the relevance of sampled histories.
- The lack of released code hinders reproducibility and community engagement.
- The large-scale experimental setting appears disconnected from the proposed techniques, raising concerns about the safety of the GS2 method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and justification of their claims, particularly regarding the exploitability bounds and the relevance of the diversity-based generation function. Additionally, releasing the code would greatly benefit the community and facilitate reproducibility. We suggest conducting further experiments to explore the impact of varying the parameter \( k \) in GS2-R, particularly with larger values, to better understand the effects of the diversity function. Finally, expanding the discussion to include relevant literature, such as techniques used in Hanabi and Bridge, would enhance the paper's context and depth.
