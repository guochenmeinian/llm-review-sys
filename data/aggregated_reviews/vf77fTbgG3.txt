Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Structured Voronoi Sampling (SVS), a novel gradient-based sampling method for neural autoregressive models. The authors propose constructing a Voronoi-like probability space over output token embeddings to facilitate the sampling process and introduce a new algorithm to address non-continuities at Voronoi borders. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SVS outperforms existing gradient sampling techniques in both toy and controlled text generation tasks, achieving better success rates, perplexity, and diversity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper makes significant contributions to practical gradient-based sampling, particularly through the theoretical construction of Voronoi distributions for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling.
- The theoretical framework is clearly articulated, and the empirical results validate the theoretical claims, showing improvements over popular sampling techniques like FUDGE.
- The method is well-motivated and provides formal guarantees that are lacking in prior heuristic approaches.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation of the paper is a major concern, as key algorithms are relegated to the appendix without clear indication, making the paper less self-contained.
- Empirical results are limited in scope and depth, with insufficient analysis of the generated samples, which diminishes the overall impact of the findings.
- The choice of the GPT-2 model for experiments is criticized as outdated, and the empirical evaluations lack comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods, such as diffusion-LMs and Gibbs with gradient methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation by integrating key algorithms into the main text and clearly indicating their relevance. Additionally, we suggest expanding the empirical analysis to include a broader range of samples and comparisons with more contemporary models and methods. Addressing the efficiency of the proposed approach in the main text, rather than relegating it to the appendix, would also enhance clarity. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore the implications of the equal base measure assumption and provide more detailed analyses of the toy example and controlled generation tasks to strengthen the empirical foundation of their claims.
