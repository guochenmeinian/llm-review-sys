Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for reconstructing garments that are manipulated rather than worn, utilizing a diffusion-based deformation prior alongside the Implicit Sewing Patterns (ISP) model. The authors generate UV mappings from point clouds, producing complete mappings through a reverse diffusion process. The method demonstrates superior accuracy, particularly in handling complex non-rigid deformations, and shows lower reconstruction errors compared to baseline methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
* The method effectively recovers garments in complex poses, addressing a significant gap in existing research.
* The combination of ISP with a diffusion-based deformation prior is a strong methodological contribution, enhancing the modeling of complex deformations.

Weaknesses:
1. The approach appears garment-specific, requiring different models for various garments, which limits generalization.
2. The recovered garments tend to be oversmooth, lacking high-frequency details, and the accuracy is contingent on the quality of input point clouds, which may be incomplete or noisy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comprehensibility of the paper by clearly discussing the pipeline stages and their results. Additionally, providing intermediate results for different scenes could enhance understanding. It would be beneficial to explore the method's ability to generalize across various garment types and materials without retraining. We also suggest including quantitative evaluations on the number of intersections in the reconstructed mesh and testing the robustness of the method with noisy or highly sparse point clouds.
