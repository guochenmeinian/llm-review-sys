### Key Points
This paper presents a reinforcement learning algorithm designed to address action-contingent, noiselessly observable Markov decision processes (AC-NOMDPs). The authors propose the Deep Dynamic Multi-Step Observationless Agent (DMSOA), which allows the agent to decide on an action and the number of steps to apply it before making the next measurement. The problem is well articulated, and the results demonstrate a reduction in decision-making costs, particularly in Section 6.1. However, the experimental section could benefit from additional baselines and more challenging tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The problem is clearly stated, and the algorithm's ability to output a number of steps before the next decision is a valuable feature.  
- The manuscript is well-written and includes useful illustrations.  
- The extensive survey of related works enhances the paper's foundation.  

Weaknesses:  
- The choice of parameter \( K \) is not sufficiently detailed, leading to ambiguity regarding its influence on the agent's decision-making process.  
- The experimental section lacks diversity in use cases, which could limit the demonstration of the algorithm's applicability beyond toy problems.  
- DMSOA, while saving resources during evaluation, requires a heavier model during training, raising concerns about computational efficiency.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the choice of parameter \( K \) and its implications on the agent's behavior. Additionally, we suggest expanding the experimental section to include more baselines and challenging tasks, as well as testing the agent on practical use cases to demonstrate its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Finally, consider presenting the data in Figure 3 in a different format, such as a table, to enhance clarity and accessibility.
