### Key Points
This paper presents a new PyTorch library, Deepspeed4Science, designed for AI applications in biology, claiming technical advantages such as superior memory efficiency. The primary contribution is the introduction of a novel computational ML platform derived from Microsoft's DeepSpeed library, which enhances PyTorch with optimizations like ZeRO and model parallelism tailored for scientific tasks. However, the manuscript lacks clarity in articulating its specific contributions and goals.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The introduction of Deepspeed4Science offers promising technical advancements for AI in scientific applications.  
- The foundation on the established DeepSpeed library provides a solid basis for the proposed enhancements.

Weaknesses:  
- The abstract, introduction, and conclusion are vague, making it difficult to discern the specific contributions and goals.  
- Evidence supporting the applicability of Deepspeed4Science across various scientific domains is limited to two examples from biology, lacking demonstration in other fields.  
- The emphasis on potential scientific discoveries is undermined by examples that appear to be previously addressed by existing methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity in the introduction and goals, providing specific contributions and backing broad claims with evidence. A more measured tone would be beneficial, avoiding promotional language such as "proud to present." If the aim is to highlight potential rather than realized benefits, this distinction should be made clearer. The manuscript should explore what differentiates Deepspeed4Science and its potential advantages in greater depth.
