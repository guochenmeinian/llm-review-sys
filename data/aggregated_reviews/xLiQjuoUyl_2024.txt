### Key Points
This paper presents an extension to the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) by proposing a method to align sparse masks with new random initializations through activation matching. The authors aim to address the limitation of LTH's sensitivity to initialization by permuting winning ticket masks, thereby enhancing generalization performance for sparse training. The experimental results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with ResNet and VGG architectures suggest that this approach improves performance compared to naive methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel solution leveraging weight symmetry and activation matching, enhancing the generalizability of sparse models.
- Extensive experimental validation demonstrates the proposed method's potential to improve generalization performance.
- The theoretical motivation is well-grounded in existing literature, providing a plausible explanation for the challenges faced by LTH masks.

Weaknesses:
- The method requires training two models and performing activation matching, leading to significant computational overhead, raising questions about its practical value.
- There is a lack of comparison with direct pruning approaches on model B, which would clarify the necessity of the added complexity.
- The paper does not adequately discuss the computational costs associated with activation matching and mask permutation, which are critical for understanding overall training time.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their definitions and language regarding "Lottery Tickets" to avoid potential misunderstandings among readers unfamiliar with the LTH. Additionally, the authors should include a direct comparison of their method with straightforward pruning approaches to justify the complexity of mask permutation. A detailed computational cost analysis should also be included to assess the efficiency of the proposed method. Furthermore, enhancing the clarity of Figure 2 and Algorithm 1, as well as addressing the logical issues in the figures, would improve the overall presentation of the work.
