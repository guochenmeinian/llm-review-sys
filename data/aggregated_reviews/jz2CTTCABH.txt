Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the YouTube Driving Light Detection (YDLD) dataset, designed for detecting lights from multiple sources in driving scenarios, particularly during dark hours. The authors propose a new lightness focal loss that penalizes misclassified samples and a lightness spatial attention prior that incorporates global scene context, significantly enhancing light source detection. The dataset is well-constructed, featuring extensive human labeling and a diverse range of light sources, along with rigorous statistical analysis and comparisons with existing detection benchmarks. The authors acknowledge the need for further discussions and details to address reviewers' comments, including insights into limitations, additional experimental results, and fair comparisons in transfer learning evaluations. They also commit to managing the benchmark challenge via GitHub and plan to open their training code and detector weights upon acceptance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is comprehensive and well-annotated, particularly excelling in labeling small light sources that are often overlooked in other datasets.
- The introduction of the lightness focal loss and spatial attention prior adds valuable contributions to the field of light detection.
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written, effectively utilizing figures and tables to convey key points.
- Positive feedback on the YDLD dataset and methodology.
- Commitment to transparency by planning to open code and trained weights.
- Additional experimental results provided in response to reviewer comments.

Weaknesses:
- The introduction lacks a thorough discussion of the background and challenges associated with light detection tasks.
- There is insufficient analysis of the limitations of the dataset, particularly regarding the types of light sources included and the complexity of real-world lighting environments.
- The clarity of certain technical terms and concepts, such as the SS-FL and the roles of Lightness Focal Loss and Lightness Spatial Attention Prior, is inadequate.
- Need for more insights and details regarding the paper's limitations.
- Comparisons in Table 4 are deemed less meaningful due to the absence of a traffic light class in other datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by providing a more detailed background on the challenges of light detection tasks and the relevance of their dataset. Additionally, a comprehensive discussion of the dataset's limitations, including the absence of sunlight as a light source and the need for further research in areas like deblurring and light intensity estimation, should be included. The authors should clarify the definitions and roles of technical terms such as SS-FL and enhance the explanations of the proposed methods to ensure better understanding. Furthermore, we suggest incorporating additional analysis of experimental results, including discussions on failure cases and the confusion between different classes of light detection. Lastly, the authors should provide more detailed discussions on the limitations of their work and ensure fair comparisons in their transfer learning evaluations.
