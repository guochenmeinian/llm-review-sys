Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Mix-of-Show, a framework for decentralized multi-concept customization using diffusion models. The authors propose embedding-decomposed LoRA (ED-LoRA) and gradient fusion to address concept conflict and identity loss, alongside regionally controllable sampling to mitigate attribute binding and missing object issues. A quantitative analysis evaluates the effectiveness of ED-LoRA and gradient fusion in reducing identity loss during multi-concept fusion, demonstrating that Mix-of-Show achieves the lowest identity loss. Experimental results indicate that Mix-of-Show outperforms existing methods, including Custom Diffusion, LoRA, and P+, in generating high-fidelity multi-concept compositions and shows better image alignment with minimal identity loss. Additionally, a human preference study reveals that users favor gradient fusion over weight fusion.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and easy to understand.
2. Each component of the proposed method is reasonable and well-motivated, providing valuable insights into fine-tuning pretrained diffusion models.
3. The framework effectively addresses challenges such as concept conflicts and identity loss, demonstrating promising results in multi-concept customization.
4. The quantitative analysis effectively demonstrates the advantages of ED-LoRA and gradient fusion in reducing identity loss.
5. The human preference study provides valuable insights into user preferences, favoring gradient fusion.
6. The comparison with previous methods highlights significant improvements in image alignment.

Weaknesses:
1. The necessity of the decentralized design is questionable, as current customization scenarios allow for fine-tuning all subjects together, which may lead to better results.
2. The paper lacks extensive discussion on computational complexity and resource requirements.
3. Some figures and equations lack clarity, leading to confusion regarding their content and implications.
4. The improvements over Custom Diffusion and other methods are perceived as not significant, which may limit the impact of the findings.
5. Some reviewers express that while the results are convincing, they do not fully address all concerns.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the decentralized design's necessity, emphasizing its advantages over centralized approaches. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed quantitative analysis, including metrics like CLIP scores, to validate the effectiveness of their methods. We suggest that the authors enhance the significance of their results by providing additional comparative analyses or enhancements that could further differentiate their method from Custom Diffusion and others. Expanding the related work section and including a visual explanation of the overall architecture would enhance reader comprehension. Finally, addressing minor typographical errors and providing more examples of different objects and scenes would strengthen the paper's overall presentation.
