Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to optimizing Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) in object detection through graph theory, introducing two methods: Quicksort Induced NMS (QSI-NMS) and Boxes Outside Excluded NMS (BOE-NMS). These methods enhance computational efficiency while maintaining mean Average Precision (mAP). Additionally, the authors propose NMS-Bench, a benchmarking framework for evaluating various NMS algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The application of graph theory to NMS offers a fresh perspective and significant improvements in computational efficiency, with QSI-NMS achieving up to 10.7× speedup and BOE-NMS achieving 5.1× speedup without sacrificing mAP.
- NMS-Bench provides a standardized evaluation framework that could foster further advancements in NMS methodologies.
- The paper delivers a detailed analysis of NMS's intrinsic structure, revealing computational bottlenecks and optimization strategies.

Weaknesses:
- The performance decrease observed in QSI-NMS is not thoroughly analyzed, leaving questions about the algorithm's limitations.
- The connection between the proposed methods and graph theory is tenuous, as QSI-NMS primarily resembles a quicksort algorithm, and BOE-NMS's heuristic does not strongly align with graph theory principles.
- The clarity of eQSI-NMS's pseudo-code is questionable, particularly regarding the line "for s ∈ S do s ← −s;" which lacks explanation.
- Evaluation is limited to the YOLOv8-N model on the MS COCO 2017 dataset, necessitating broader assessments across various models and datasets for a comprehensive understanding of generalizability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the performance decrease in QSI-NMS by identifying specific algorithmic aspects contributing to this decline. Additionally, we suggest strengthening the theoretical connection between the proposed methods and graph theory principles to enhance clarity. The authors should also clarify the pseudo-code for eQSI-NMS to ensure comprehensibility. Finally, we encourage the authors to conduct evaluations across a wider range of models and datasets to better demonstrate the generalizability of their methods.
