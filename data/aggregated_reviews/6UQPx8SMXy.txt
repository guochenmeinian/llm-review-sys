### Key Points
This paper presents LAVIB, a large-scale video interpolation benchmark comprising 283K clips from 17K ultra-HD videos. It introduces automated video sourcing and metrics for motion, luminance, sharpness, and contrast, along with both in-distribution and out-of-distribution challenge sets for evaluating video interpolation performance. The contributions include a high-quality dataset for video interpolation, an effective data sourcing and filtering pipeline, and new trained video interpolation models that validate the dataset's effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The writing is clear and well-structured.
- The dataset's statistics are comprehensive.
- Metrics are well-designed for comparison with previous datasets.
- The methodology for dataset construction is transparently presented.
- Experiments effectively demonstrate the dataset's utility.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset has a narrow distribution, primarily featuring realistic-style videos, limiting its applicability.
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion on minimizing biases in data collection.
- Important factors affecting video frame interpolation, such as resolution and frame rate, are not addressed.
- There is no supplementary material provided with video results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors enhance the dataset by including a wider distribution of video styles, such as anime or 3D rendering, to increase its usefulness. Additionally, the authors should provide a detailed discussion on how biases in data collection were minimized. It would also be beneficial to explore the impact of resolution and frame rate on video frame interpolation performance. Lastly, we encourage the authors to include supplementary material with video results and to elaborate on the calculation of metrics like motion amplitude, brightness, frame sharpness, and contrast.
