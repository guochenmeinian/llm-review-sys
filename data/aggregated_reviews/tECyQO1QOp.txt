Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the fair $k$-center problem, focusing on the combination of Group Fairness (GF) and Diversity in Center Selection (DS). The authors demonstrate that a constant approximation algorithm for either GF or DS can be extended to both constraints simultaneously. Additionally, they reveal that GF and DS are incompatible with various other distance-based fairness notions. The paper also provides experimental validation of the proposed algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study of the relationship between different fairness notions in clustering is significant due to the importance of fair clustering.
- The theoretical results indicate a separation between DP notions (GF and DS) and distance-based notions, which is conceptually interesting.

Weaknesses:
- The focus on the fair $k$-center problem is less relevant in machine learning; extending the work to fair $k$-median and fair $k$-means would enhance its impact.
- The experimental results are limited, relying on a single dataset in the main text, with additional datasets only in supplementary material.
- The algorithms may violate some group fairness constraints, raising concerns about their practical applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on limitations and societal impact, particularly regarding the potential violation of group fairness constraints. Additionally, we suggest expanding the experimental validation to include multiple datasets to strengthen the findings. Clarifying the running time of the algorithms in Theorem 4.1 and 4.2 in the main text would also be beneficial. Finally, addressing the additive violations of the GF constraints in the pseudocode and throughout the paper would enhance clarity.
