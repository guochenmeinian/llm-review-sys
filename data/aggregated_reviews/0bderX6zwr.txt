### Key Points
This paper presents a novel human evaluation framework, FFAEVAL, aimed at comparing the performance of various open-domain dialogue systems. The authors propose a Free-For-All Ranking method, which enables evaluators to engage in single-blind, multi-turn dialogues with multiple systems concurrently. This approach addresses the limitations of automatic evaluation metrics and the inefficiencies of traditional human evaluations, providing a more reliable and efficient method for assessing dialogue systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed FFAEVAL framework improves evaluation efficiency by allowing simultaneous comparison of multiple dialogue systems.
- The study demonstrates a strong correlation between the new evaluation metric and human assessments, particularly in managing historical context.
- The clarity of the paper and the comprehensive analyses contribute positively to its presentation.

Weaknesses:
- The relevance of the proposed method to the authors' motivations is questionable, as it may not effectively address the issues with current score-based evaluation systems.
- The experiments utilize outdated dialogue models, which may skew results; more contemporary models should be included for a more convincing evaluation.
- The framework lacks detailed annotation guidelines and does not provide insights into specific properties of the dialogue systems, such as coherency or hallucination issues.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the relevance of their method by clearly articulating how FFAEVAL addresses the limitations of existing evaluation systems. Additionally, incorporating current LLM-based chatbots in their experiments would strengthen their claims. The authors should also provide more detailed annotation guidelines and clarify the criteria evaluators should use during the assessment process. Finally, addressing the statistical significance of their findings and ensuring that multiple annotators evaluate the same conversations would enhance the robustness of their results.
