Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents two distinct contributions: the introduction of MomentumSMoE, a novel integration of heavy-ball momentum into Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) aimed at enhancing stability and robustness, and an analysis of eigenvalues across different layers of a neural network, specifically focusing on layers 1, 3, and 6. The authors establish a connection between SMoE and gradient descent in multi-objective optimization problems, demonstrating both theoretical and empirical improvements of MomentumSMoE over standard SMoE across various tasks, including language modeling and object recognition. The method is applicable to multiple SMoE models, such as V-MoE and GLaM, with minimal computational overhead. Additionally, the authors utilize PyTorch to compute and visualize the absolute values and phases of eigenvalues, providing insights into their behavior through scatter plots and histograms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The integration of momentum into SMoE is an original and interesting approach to addressing instability and inefficiency.  
2. The paper provides extensive empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of MomentumSMoE across multiple benchmarks.  
3. The proposed method is compatible with other momentum-based optimizers, suggesting broad applicability.  
4. The use of PyTorch for eigenvalue computation and visualization is well-executed, demonstrating technical proficiency.  
5. The visualizations are clear and informative, aiding in the understanding of eigenvalue distributions across layers.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The connection between SMoE and gradient descent is largely unfounded; a more general connection to accelerating fixed-point iterations would strengthen the paper.  
2. The theoretical results primarily reproduce known outcomes for momentum, lacking significant novelty.  
3. The formulation of SMoE as a multi-objective optimization problem is questionable due to the dynamic nature of expert networks during training.  
4. The absence of pseudocode limits clarity regarding the implementation of the proposal.  
5. The analysis of eigenvalues lacks depth regarding the implications of the eigenvalue distributions on convergence rates and optimization strategies.  
6. There is a missed opportunity to incorporate additional visualization techniques, such as heatmaps, which could enhance the interpretability of the data.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical foundation of MomentumSMoE by exploring the connection between SMoE and general acceleration methods beyond momentum, potentially using tools from Azizian et al. Additionally, we suggest providing empirical investigations into the eigenvalues of $\nabla_x f$ to validate theoretical claims regarding acceleration schemes. A delineated section discussing all limitations would enhance the paper's clarity. Furthermore, including pseudocode would better illustrate the implementation of MomentumSMoE. For the eigenvalue analysis, we recommend that the authors improve the depth of their analysis by discussing how the eigenvalues relate to convergence rates, particularly in the context of the fixed point operator. We also suggest implementing heatmaps in their visualizations to provide a more nuanced view of the eigenvalue distributions. Exploring the eigenvalues of the fixed point operator could yield valuable insights into the optimization process. Lastly, a thorough analysis of computational overhead and its implications on training efficiency should be included, as this is critical for current foundation model training.
