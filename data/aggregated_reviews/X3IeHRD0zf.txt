Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on causal imitation learning, focusing on the incorporation of context-specific independence (CSI) relations. The authors prove that the decision problem for imitation feasibility under CSIs is NP-hard and provide a necessary graphical criterion for imitation learning in this context. They propose algorithms for causal imitation learning that account for both CSI relations and data, while also acknowledging the limitations of their approach, particularly regarding the completeness of their algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The problem is well-motivated, with a clear significance in practical applications.
2. The paper is well-written, self-contained, and covers related literature extensively.
3. The theoretical contributions are solid, with a clear demonstration of how CSIs affect the imitatability of policies.

Weaknesses:
1. The theoretical results heavily rely on existing work, particularly Zhang et al. (2020), which may appear derivative; a clearer distinction of contributions is needed.
2. The experiments are limited to synthetic datasets, lacking real-world applicability and justification for chosen parameters.
3. The assumption in Proposition 3.9 requires further justification to assess its generality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions by explicitly contrasting their work with existing literature, particularly regarding identifiability. Additionally, we suggest incorporating real-world datasets in their experiments to enhance practical relevance. The authors should also provide a more detailed explanation of the assumptions used in Proposition 3.9 and clarify the motivation for their algorithms, especially regarding why Alg. 1 fails in broader contexts. Lastly, addressing the NP-hardness of their algorithms and exploring alternative settings for polynomial time solutions could strengthen the paper's impact.
