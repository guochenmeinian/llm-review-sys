Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the trainability of quantum neural networks (QNNs) by analyzing the locality of quantum gates. The authors demonstrate that the variation range of the cost function decreases exponentially with the number of qubits, thereby unifying the constraints on both gradient-based and gradient-free optimization methods. The work includes numerical simulations across three applications, enhancing the understanding of locality's role in QNNs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper is well-written, providing a rigorous analysis of QNN trainability and scalability from a locality perspective.  
2. The application of the proposed theorem to three representative QNN models, including VQE, quantum autoencoder, and quantum state learning, is supported by numerical simulation results.

Weaknesses:  
1. The paper lacks a clear comparison with previous works, making it difficult to ascertain the novelty of the findings.  
2. The contribution appears limited, as the results can be derived from existing literature on barren plateaus, with only a minor distinction introduced by the parameter related to locality.  
3. The authors do not address strategies to avoid the exponentially vanishing variation range, nor do they clarify the implications of their findings for practical QNN design.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with prior works to clearly delineate the novelty of their contributions. Specifically, they should discuss how their findings relate to existing literature on barren plateaus and the implications for QNN design and training strategies. Additionally, we suggest including strategies to mitigate the exponentially vanishing variation range and providing a more detailed explanation of the necessity of decomposing and preserving local unitaries for subsequent analysis. Lastly, clarifying the choice of VQE ansatz and its implications for practical applications would enhance the paper's impact.
