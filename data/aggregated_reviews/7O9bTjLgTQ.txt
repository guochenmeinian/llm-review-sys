### Key Points
This paper investigates LM attention heads, memory values, and vectors dynamically created by models during input processing. The authors propose a visualization tool that represents the forward pass of GPTs as an interactive flow graph, revealing insights into layer norms as semantic filters and consistently activated neurons acting as regularization vectors. The work aims to enhance explainability in NLP and DL communities and includes a thorough theoretical analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed visualization tool could significantly impact explainability research.
- The theoretical analysis is comprehensive, indicating extensive research on GPT-related works.
- The observation of layer norms acting as semantic filters is a novel and interesting contribution.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental section lacks sufficient comparative experiments to validate the proposed method's superiority.
- The paper's structure resembles a technical report rather than an academic paper, which may hinder clarity.
- The analysis is limited to a single dataset (CounterFact) and a single model (GPT-2), raising questions about generalizability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by devising more persuasive comparative experiments to verify the proposed method's effectiveness. Additionally, the authors should emphasize academic innovation by clearly articulating the principles of their work to inspire further exploration. Redesigning the paper's structure to align more closely with academic standards would enhance its clarity. We also suggest providing more quantitative validation of findings and addressing the limitations of using GPT-2 exclusively by exploring other language models. Finally, the authors should clarify the logit lens methodology and ensure that the visualization tool is accessible and user-friendly, considering colorblindness and contrast levels.
