Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents InversionView, a method for inspecting the information encoded in neural activations by examining inputs that yield similar activations. The authors utilize a conditional decoder trained on these activations to generate inputs, demonstrating the method on three tasks: character counting, indirect object identification, and 3-digit addition. The approach aims to enhance interpretability by producing human-readable examples that correspond to specific activation patterns.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method effectively identifies which parts of a network are responsible for specific tasks, providing insights into neural network operations.
- Empirical results confirm the method's effectiveness, and the paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with comprehensive experiments.

Weaknesses:
- The abstract lacks specificity, and the overall motivation and method description are vague.
- The algorithm's clarity is insufficient, particularly regarding how it scales to larger models beyond GPT-2.
- The results are challenging to interpret without clearer guidance, and related works on feature visualization and adversarial examples are not adequately discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the abstract by providing more specific details about the method and its applications. Clarifying the algorithm and its scalability to larger models is essential. Additionally, we suggest including a graphic to illustrate the transition from source transformer activations to preimage samples and enhancing Figure 2 to highlight key conclusions. Clearly stating the tasks and findings before delving into technical details would also aid reader comprehension. Finally, we encourage a more thorough discussion of related work, particularly similarities and differences with GAN inversion techniques, to facilitate understanding across disciplines.
