### Key Points
This paper investigates the first-order query complexity of two-player zero-sum games, specifically focusing on the necessary number of first-order queries to compute min-max equilibria when the game matrix is unknown. The authors establish that at least $\Omega(K)$ queries are required for an exact min-max equilibrium, aligning with the complexity of a naive algorithm that first learns the matrix. For an $\epsilon$-approximate min-max equilibrium, $\Omega(\log(1/\epsilon K))$ queries are needed, which approximately matches the best-known upper bound of $O(\frac{\log K}{\epsilon})$. The paper also discusses the implications of these results for no-regret dynamics and introduces techniques that could further clarify first-order query complexity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The first-order complexity model is well-motivated and directly relates to the information exchange model of no-regret dynamics, providing valuable insights into convergence rates.
- The paper introduces interesting techniques that may help settle the first-order query complexity for computing min-max equilibria.
- It addresses a fundamental problem in game theory, presenting the first non-trivial lower bounds for noiseless first-order methods in two-player zero-sum games.

Weaknesses:
- The current lower bound does not match the existing upper bound concerning the dependence on $\epsilon$.
- The exposition lacks clarity and coherence, making it difficult to follow the arguments and understand the results.
- There are no empirical evaluations or experiments to support the theoretical results, limiting the practical applicability of the findings.
- The significance of the results is uncertain, and the paper would benefit from a discussion on their broader implications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and coherence of the exposition by restructuring the paper and using clear, concise language. Ensure that the abstract and introduction provide a straightforward overview of the key ideas and contributions, avoiding overly technical jargon. Each theoretical concept should be clearly defined and explained, with relevant background and assumptions stated explicitly. 

In the results section, the authors should not only present their findings but also discuss their implications in relation to the problems outlined in the introduction. Including empirical evaluations or experiments would enhance the practical understanding of the proposed methods. Finally, we suggest adding a discussion on the broader significance of the results to clarify their impact on the field.
