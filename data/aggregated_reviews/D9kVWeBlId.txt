### Key Points
This paper presents a novel algorithm, Inside-Out Nested Particle Filter (IO-NPF), for amortized sequential Bayesian experimental design in a non-exchangeable setting. The authors propose a method that replaces the MCMC kernel with a jittering kernel from the nested particle filter, demonstrating improved performance and enhanced amortized time efficiency. The introduction of backward sampling to mitigate trajectory degeneracy is a significant contribution, supported by both theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The IO-NPF algorithm is a fully recursive and provably consistent alternative to existing methods, addressing issues of degeneracy.
- The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation, including convergence guarantees and a computational complexity analysis of O(TÂ²).
- The backward sampling technique effectively counters trajectory degeneracy, enhancing algorithm performance.
- Empirical results on a stochastic pendulum problem show superior performance in achieving higher expected information gain (EIG).

Weaknesses:
- The validation is limited to a single example, which restricts the generalizability of the findings.
- There is a lack of comparative analysis with other state-of-the-art amortization methods, limiting understanding of IO-NPF's relative advantages.
- The assumption of static noise in the dynamics is acknowledged but not thoroughly discussed regarding its implications.
- Clarity issues exist in the appendix, particularly concerning the explanation of backward sampling and its Rao-Blackwellization.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors expand the experimental validation to include more challenging and diverse problems to demonstrate the algorithm's performance and scalability. Additionally, including comprehensive comparisons with other state-of-the-art amortization methods for Bayesian experimental design would highlight IO-NPF's strengths and weaknesses. The authors should also discuss the implications of the static noise assumption and explore potential extensions for non-static noise scenarios. Finally, we suggest improving the clarity of the appendix by providing clearer notation and a more detailed explanation of the backward sampling algorithm and its Rao-Blackwellization.
