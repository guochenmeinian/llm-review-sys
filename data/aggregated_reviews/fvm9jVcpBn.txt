Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method to efficiently remove view triplets from a pose graph when the minimum angle falls below a threshold, addressing a significant issue in global SfM algorithms related to uncertain translation scale estimation. The authors propose an edge filtering algorithm integrated into a global SfM pipeline, demonstrating its effectiveness on the 1DSfM dataset. The results indicate that the proposed method reduces the condition number of the angle matrix and consistently lowers translation errors.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The analysis of the sensitivity problem in translation averaging is novel and well-supported by strict proofs.
- The proposed edge filtering algorithm is efficient and effectively improves algorithm accuracy and convergence speed.
- The paper is well-written and presents a clear theoretical foundation.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments lack comparisons to other filters, making it difficult to assess the proposed method's improvements over state-of-the-art solutions.
- The use of the 1DSfM dataset is questionable, as it does not adequately represent scenarios where skewed triangles are problematic; more realistic datasets should be considered.
- The motivation for removing skewed triangles instead of single edges is unclear, and the potential loss of important information needs further justification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve their experimental section by including comparisons to other filters, such as 1DSfM, to clarify the proposed method's contributions to the state of the art. Additionally, we suggest evaluating the method on more realistic datasets, such as KITTI or EuRoC, where the challenges of scale estimation are more pronounced. The authors should also provide a clearer justification for their choice of triangle removal and consider adding qualitative results to strengthen their claims. Finally, enhancing the clarity of sections 4 and 5 with more intuitive descriptions and visual aids would improve reader comprehension.
