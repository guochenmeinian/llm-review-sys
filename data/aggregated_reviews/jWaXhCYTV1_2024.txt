Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to causal representation learning (CRL) by focusing on identifying mechanism shifts among latent nodes within a linear structural causal model (SCM). The authors propose a method that relaxes traditional assumptions in interventional CRL, allowing for the identification of shifted nodes using fewer environments than causal variables. They develop an algorithm that leverages a test function to score noise factors from independent component analysis (ICA) and empirically validate their approach on synthetic and psychometric datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and accessible, with clear explanations of mathematical concepts.
- The identification of mechanism shifts is an interesting and potentially impactful problem, particularly for real-world applications.
- Extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness in identifying latent shifts in data distributions.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on linearity in both the mixing and SCM may limit practical applicability.
- There are contradictions between Proposition 2 and Theorem 3 regarding the conditions for identifying shifted nodes, which need clarification.
- The simplification of the problem may raise concerns about the significance of the contributions compared to existing methods, particularly regarding the relationship with prior work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the motivation behind bypassing the estimation of the mixing function $G$ and the SCM $B$, as this seems central to the understanding of causal representation learning. Additionally, please address the strong assumption regarding access to a test function, as it appears unrealistic and may limit the work's significance. We suggest providing more insight into the connection between linear ICA and this work, particularly how the identification of mechanism shifts differs from recovering the full causal structure. Finally, we encourage the authors to compare their method against existing CRL techniques to enhance the experimental results and discuss the implications of the sample complexity observed in their experiments.
