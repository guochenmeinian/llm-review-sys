Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an unsupervised pipeline for 3D shape-to-shape registration, aligning two shapes using a pre-trained orientation regressor, obtaining soft correspondences via a Point Feature extractor, and optimizing these correspondences with a Deep Functional Maps schema. The method incorporates various unsupervised regularizations and iteratively deforms the source shape using a Deformation graph. It is tested on humanoid datasets and compared against numerous approaches, yielding promising results. Additionally, the authors propose a hybrid approach for matching unstructured point clouds undergoing significant deformation, combining learning-based and optimization-based methods. A self-supervised learning scheme is introduced to infer intrinsic-aware features effectively. However, inconsistencies in algorithm descriptions between the main submission and the supplementary material raise concerns about the clarity of the stopping criteria and the role of hyperparameters.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method effectively combines existing techniques to achieve good results in unsupervised shape correspondence, an area with limited methods available.
2. It demonstrates competitive performance against both supervised and unsupervised approaches, appealing to the shape-matching community.
3. The hybrid approach addresses the challenge of matching unstructured point clouds effectively, with the self-supervised learning scheme being a notable contribution that allows for flexibility and efficiency.
4. The paper is well-structured and clear, facilitating understanding and potential re-implementation.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the method is questioned, as its components are derived from prior works without significant modifications, leading to concerns about its originality.
2. The applicability of the method is unclear, particularly regarding its performance on real-world noisy data and larger datasets, as it is primarily tested on humanoid shapes with ample labeled data.
3. Inconsistencies in algorithm descriptions create confusion regarding the stopping criteria and the role of hyperparameters.
4. The justification for claims of superiority over existing methods lacks fairness due to differing initialization conditions.
5. The organization of the methodology section could be improved for better clarity, and several technical details require further elaboration.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the general applicative context of the method, explicitly stating its capability to handle point clouds and detailing the Gaussian noise considered in experiments. Additionally, we suggest discussing the scalability of the approach and testing it on more complex datasets with less labeled data, such as chairs, to strengthen claims about its robustness. Furthermore, we advise that the authors ensure consistency between the main submission and the supplementary material, particularly regarding the stopping criteria in Algorithm 1. A fair comparison with existing methods should be provided by initializing them similarly to the proposed approach. We also suggest including a detailed discussion of hyperparameters, including the threshold in correspondence filtering and the values of $\lambda_{cd}, \lambda_{corr}, \lambda_{arap}$, and how they are chosen. Clarifying the roles of these parameters in different stages of shape registration is essential. Lastly, we recommend revising the claims regarding alignment and matching to ensure they are well-supported by experimental results, and consider renaming "correspondence filtering" to "Geodesic filtering" and "feature extractor" to a more specific term that reflects its function.
