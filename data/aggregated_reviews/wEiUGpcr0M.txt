Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a self-supervised learning model that integrates persistent homology (PH) into contrastive learning for molecular representation. The authors propose a topological distance-based contrastive loss and a "stronger filtration function" to enhance the representation of molecular structures. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in molecular property prediction tasks, showing promising results compared to existing methods. However, concerns arise regarding the clarity of the persistent homology analysis, the theoretical grounding of the contributions, and the novelty of the approach relative to prior work, particularly in its loss function and empirical evaluations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The incorporation of persistent homology into contrastive learning is novel, and the results are promising.
- The experimental design is comprehensive, with in-depth analyses and various setups.
- The authors have attempted to clarify their methodology and engage with reviewer feedback, indicating a willingness to improve.
- The empirical evaluations show some improvements in performance metrics, particularly with the new filtration function.
- The paper is well-written and presents the ideas clearly.

Weaknesses:
- The explanation of the persistent homology model is unclear, and the theoretical basis for the contributions is perceived as weak.
- The novelty is questioned, as the approach appears similar to existing methods, particularly in its loss function.
- The claim regarding the incorporation of domain knowledge through the filtration function is seen as overstated, with insufficient explanation of its implications for domain experts.
- Experimental results show limited improvements in some cases, and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods are lacking.
- The construction of persistent homology is criticized for not utilizing clique complexes, which may weaken the analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the persistent homology analysis, ensuring that the mathematical foundations are rigorously presented. Additionally, the authors should enhance the theoretical grounding of their contributions by providing clearer insights into how their methods improve upon existing approaches. It would be beneficial to clarify the meaning of "stronger filtration" and its practical implications for domain experts, including guidance on selecting the best filtration. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors address the lack of discussion regarding the novelty of their approach compared to existing literature, particularly in relation to the work by Wang et al. (2022). Including comparisons with established baselines and state-of-the-art results would help substantiate their claims of improvement and contextualize their findings. Lastly, we recommend that the authors consider incorporating more robust persistent homology vectorizations, such as Silhouette or landscape, in their loss function and provide a more detailed rationale for the use of topological fingerprints in molecular representation learning.
