Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the GITA framework, which integrates visual graphs into general graph reasoning tasks for LLMs, enhancing comprehensibility and flexibility. The authors propose the Graph-based Vision-Language Question Answering (GVLQA) dataset, the first of its kind for graph reasoning, and demonstrate the advantages of layout augmentation and pretraining on this dataset. GITA shows improved performance over existing LLM approaches on various graph reasoning tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The integration of visual graphs into graph reasoning tasks represents a novel approach, effectively combining visual and textual modalities to enhance comprehension.  
2. The creation of the GVLQA dataset fills a significant gap in available datasets for graph reasoning by incorporating both visual and textual elements.  
3. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of GITA, providing strong empirical support for the authors' claims.  
4. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, facilitating understanding of the GITA framework and dataset construction.

Weaknesses:  
1. The motivation for GITA is questioned, as the advantages over traditional graph reasoning methods like GNNs are not clearly demonstrated. The zero-shot performance of LLM-based methods is poor for many questions, necessitating fine-tuning.  
2. The paper lacks comparisons with dedicated GNN models, which would help illustrate GITA's performance relative to specialized graph reasoning methods.  
3. There is insufficient analysis of GITA's scalability with larger graphs, and the paper does not explore the alignment between visual and textual modalities in detail.  
4. Some terminological inconsistencies and unclear explanations need to be addressed for clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for GITA's advantages over GNNs by providing direct comparisons and demonstrating its performance in terms of generalizability and user-friendliness. Additionally, including comparisons with dedicated GNN models would strengthen the paper. A more comprehensive evaluation of GITA's scalability and a detailed analysis of modality alignment should be included. Lastly, we suggest ensuring consistency in terminology and clarifying any ambiguous explanations within the text.
