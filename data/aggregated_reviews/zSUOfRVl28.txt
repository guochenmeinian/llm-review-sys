### Key Points
This paper presents a framework called SOCIALSENSE, which aims to predict personalized user responses to news items by incorporating user beliefs into a belief-centered graph. The framework utilizes large language models (LLMs) to infer social values from user beliefs and employs a heterogeneous graph transformer to learn user and news representations. Experimental results indicate significant performance improvements, particularly for lurkers and unseen users, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The incorporation of user beliefs enhances the explainability of predictions.
- Significant performance gains in both zero-shot and supervised settings, particularly for lurkers.
- The novelty of using LLMs for practical applications is commendable, and the empirical evaluation includes multiple baselines and ablation studies.

Weaknesses:
- The outcomes of LLMs as data annotation tools require further verification, particularly in unsupervised contexts.
- Lack of clarity on the reliability of LLM predictions for user beliefs, especially for lurkers.
- The introduction of value nodes may increase complexity and noise, and model details, such as the choice of meta-paths, are insufficiently specified.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the annotation results from LLMs to verify their effectiveness. Additionally, the authors should clarify how LLMs can accurately predict user beliefs for lurkers and analyze the prediction quality of these beliefs. It would be beneficial to provide insights into the interaction between users and beliefs, including the distribution of identified beliefs. The authors should also consider including other evaluation tasks beyond sentiment intensity and polarity prediction to strengthen their framework's applicability. Lastly, addressing the writing style for conciseness and improving the structure of the paper would enhance clarity and flow.
