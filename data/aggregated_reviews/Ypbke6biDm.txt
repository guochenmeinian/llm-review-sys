### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the tradeoffs between various resources in feature learning, specifically focusing on learning parity functions with a two-layer MLP. The authors explore the impact of model size, dataset size, training epochs, and stochasticity, revealing a tradeoff between network width and sample size under different initialization conditions. The results suggest that a larger width can enhance sample efficiency and improve the likelihood of identifying "winning lottery ticket" neurons. Extensive experiments complement the theoretical findings, demonstrating that neural networks can outperform traditional tree-based methods on tabular datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides solid theoretical results and extensive empirical evidence, highlighting the importance of understanding resource tradeoffs in large-scale machine learning.
- The connection to the lottery ticket hypothesis is insightful, showing that wider networks can facilitate finding optimal configurations.
- The writing is clear, and the figures effectively illustrate the high-level concepts.

Weaknesses:
- The lower bound on training samples in the abstract is misleading, as it only pertains to gradient precision without establishing a definitive bound. 
- The paper's organization could be improved for clarity, particularly in presenting insights and theoretical contributions.
- The study's applicability to other problems is uncertain, and the authors should address potential limitations more thoroughly.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the appendix, particularly by providing a detailed explanation of the training algorithm and an overview of the proof structure. Additionally, conducting ablation studies on other problems could substantiate the generalizability of the findings. We suggest exploring varying batch sizes in experiments and clarifying the implications of SGD's convergence in Proposition 3. Lastly, a more formal comparison with existing literature on learning parities would help delineate the distinct contributions of this work.
