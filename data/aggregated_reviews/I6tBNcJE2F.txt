Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to real-world image dehazing, addressing the challenges of accurately modeling haze distributions and the scarcity of paired real-world data. The authors propose the CORUN model, which integrates atmospheric scattering with image scenes to incorporate physical information into deep networks. Additionally, they introduce the Coherence-based Label Generator (Colabator) to create high-quality pseudo labels for training, enhancing the network's generalization in haze removal.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The CORUN model effectively integrates physical information, utilizing Transmission and Scene Gradient Descent Modules to restore haze-contaminated details.
2. The method is built on a proximal gradient descent approach within a deep unfolding network, providing strong interpretability.
3. The Colabator framework enhances the performance of models pretrained on synthetic datasets when fine-tuned with real degraded images, incurring no additional computational cost during deployment.
4. Experimental results validate the model's capability to effectively model real-world haze and restore scenes.

Weaknesses:
1. There are inconsistencies in symbol usage, affecting readability, including a misspelling of the pseudo-label symbol and unnecessary tildes in line 175.
2. Equations (5) and (7) lack clarity regarding the consistency of channel numbers between the Transmission Map and the image.
3. The paper's ablation studies are insufficient; more comprehensive studies on different datasets are needed to validate the method's effectiveness.
4. The derivation of equations (7) and (10) is unclear, and the use of DA-CLIP as a haze density evaluator lacks detail.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the consistency of symbol usage throughout the paper and correct the identified typographical errors. Additionally, the authors should clarify the derivation of equations (7) and (10) and provide more detailed explanations regarding the use of DA-CLIP. We suggest conducting more comprehensive ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the CORUN model and its components across various datasets. Furthermore, providing additional results of the Colabator framework's fine-tuning on various tasks would strengthen the claims made in the paper.
