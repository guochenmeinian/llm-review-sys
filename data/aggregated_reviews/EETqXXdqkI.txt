Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents methods to estimate confidence sequences for the solution of differential equations under noisy boundary conditions, proposing various methods of differing complexity. The authors introduce Physics-Informed Confidence Propagation (PICProp), a bi-level optimization approach, to propagate confidence intervals from boundary points throughout the domain. The paper includes theoretical guarantees and computational experiments, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem of determining confidence sequences is clearly articulated, and the approximation via exhaustive search is well-defined.
- Innovative methods incorporating meta-learning techniques and surrogate solutions are presented.
- The paper is well-structured, balancing technical detail between the main text and appendices effectively.
- The theoretical analysis provides valuable insights into the method's workings.

Weaknesses:
- The main assumption regarding the accuracy of the machine learning model is overly simplistic, as it does not account for the variability introduced by the number of training points.
- The validation of derived confidence sequences against Definition 3.1 is not adequately addressed.
- Some benchmark results are incomplete, particularly concerning SimPICProp's performance across different scenarios.
- The computational efficiency claims lack sufficient demonstration, and the experiments primarily focus on toy examples rather than real-world applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the validation of confidence sequences against Definition 3.1 to ensure robustness. Additionally, the authors should consider discussing the impact of training point variability on model accuracy. It would be beneficial to complete the benchmark results for SimPICProp across various scenarios and include comparisons with traditional UQ methods in the main text. We also suggest that the authors provide more extensive experiments on real-world applications to demonstrate the practical applicability of their methods, addressing the limitations noted in the review.
