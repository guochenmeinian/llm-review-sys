Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to identifying necessary and sufficient causal graphs (NSCGs) that focus on relevant variables for a specific outcome. The authors leverage probabilities of causation to assess feature importance and propose an algorithm that learns a subgraph from observational data. The method has been evaluated on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating its applicability in causal discovery. Additionally, the authors propose a variable selection method aimed at enhancing causal structure learning efficiency by incorporating causal effects into the optimization objective, which they claim improves computational speed compared to existing methods like NOTEARS. They clarify that their method can be applied flexibly to both known and unknown causal graphs, potentially increasing its practical utility. The implementation of the PC algorithm is specified as using the Peter-Clark function from the causal-learn Python package with default settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and clearly motivated, addressing an important problem in causal discovery.
- It provides comprehensive mathematical definitions and theoretical support for the proposed method.
- The empirical results show consistent improvement over existing baselines across various metrics.
- The authors provide detailed responses and additional experimental results, addressing many reviewer concerns.
- The proposed method shows promise in improving computational efficiency and is competitive with leading benchmarks.
- The incorporation of new evaluation metrics enhances the assessment of the method's performance.

Weaknesses:
- The mixture of potential outcome (PO) framework and graphical causal model framework is somewhat confusing, particularly the use of notation from the PO framework, which may not be essential.
- The assumption that the target variable is a leaf node limits the method's applicability to broader causal inference questions.
- The experimental evaluation is limited, with a small number of baseline methods and a maximum sample size of only 100, raising concerns about scalability and generalizability.
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion on the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm compared to existing methods.
- There are ongoing concerns regarding the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm, particularly in practical applications.
- The PC algorithm's performance raises questions, as it is noted to be computationally expensive in real-world scenarios, especially with larger datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by separating the notation used in the PO framework from that of graphical causal models. Additionally, the authors should discuss the implications of the assumption that the target variable is a leaf node and explore the method's applicability to other causal inference questions. Expanding the experimental evaluation to include more recent causal discovery algorithms and larger datasets would enhance the robustness of the findings. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the computational complexity and runtime of the NSCSL algorithm compared to existing methods should be included to establish its practical utility. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity around the computational complexity of their method, particularly in practical applications, to enhance its perceived utility. Providing more details on the specific variant of the PC algorithm used could help address concerns regarding its computational expense. Lastly, consider exploring a more equitable experimental setup for baseline comparisons to strengthen the validity of the results, and incorporating a notation table and addressing parameter sensitivity analysis would improve the paper's readability and comprehensiveness.
