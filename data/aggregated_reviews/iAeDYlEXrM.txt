### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for document understanding models, focusing on the effects of model modality, pre-training, and fine-tuning. The authors find that spatial information is critical for document OOD detection and propose a spatial-aware adapter to enhance performance. The study includes extensive experiments on various datasets, demonstrating that the proposed adapter can outperform the baseline RoBERTa model and match the performance of multi-modal methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a thorough empirical study on document OOD detection, supported by extensive experimental results.
- The proposed spatial-aware adapter shows promise for improving OOD detection performance in transformer-based models.

Weaknesses:
- The distinction between in-domain OOD and out-domain OOD is not sufficiently elaborated, and the motivation behind dataset selection is unclear.
- The evaluation of the proposed adapter lacks convincing comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, such as DocFormer, and the zero-shot setup for vision models is not clearly justified.
- Some findings are intuitive, and the paper could benefit from incorporating additional ID tasks beyond classification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the selection of baselines, particularly addressing the omission of DocFormer for comparison. Additionally, the authors should clarify the zero-shot setup for vision models and provide more robust metrics, such as AUPR_OOD and comparisons with distance-based methods using Mahalanobis distance, to substantiate the effectiveness of their approach. Furthermore, introducing more diverse ID tasks could enhance the understanding of the proposed method's applicability.
