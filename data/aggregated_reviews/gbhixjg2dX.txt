Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a synthetic combinations estimator that computes causal effects for unseen treatment combinations based on reasonable assumptions about the data generating process. The authors propose a two-step algorithm that efficiently utilizes information sharing across units and treatments, demonstrating its flexibility compared to existing methods. The analysis is grounded in established theory while extending beyond current methodologies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The topic is timely and the manuscript is exceptionally clear, making complex formalisms accessible.  
- The theoretical results are robust and well-founded, with sound and well-motivated analysis.  
- The proposed algorithm is intuitive and scales well with the number of intervention combinations.

Weaknesses:  
- A significant critique is the absence of empirical results in the main text, which could enhance the manuscript's impact.  
- The reliance on numerous assumptions raises concerns about their practical applicability, particularly the low-rank assumption on the matrix of Fourier coefficients.  
- The discussion of assumptions lacks depth, particularly regarding their justification and implications if violated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the manuscript by including empirical results in the main text, particularly moving Fig. 2 and expanding on the empirical evaluation. Additionally, consider integrating some of the CART results into the main body. We also suggest that the authors justify the low-rank assumption with practical examples to strengthen their contributions. Emphasizing the experimental design framework in Section 7 could help address concerns about the assumptions' applicability in real-world datasets.
