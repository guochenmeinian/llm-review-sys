Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of releasing information about graphs, specifically subgraph counts, under differential privacy (DP). The authors propose using approximation techniques for sensitivity calculations and the quantity of interest to address the computational challenges associated with existing methods. The study focuses on triangles, paths, and trees as subgraphs of interest, demonstrating that approximation can yield bounds while maintaining privacy. The paper also introduces a method leveraging approximate smooth sensitivity to enhance the efficiency of DP algorithms for subgraph counting, particularly triangle counting, and provides experimental results that show alignment with accurate values.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses fundamental questions about privacy in subgraph counting, contributing to theoretical understanding and practical algorithm design.
- The use of approximate smooth sensitivity is a natural and interesting approach to improve algorithm efficiency.
- Experimental results indicate significant speedups in triangle counting, validating the proposed methods.

Weaknesses:
- The running time for DP algorithms remains inefficient, particularly for arbitrary subgraphs, with a complexity of \(O(n^{2\ell})\).
- The paper lacks sufficient contrast with recent works, particularly the black-box approach of Blocki et al., and does not adequately discuss limitations or future work.
- Some empirical evaluations are missing, and comparisons with existing solutions are insufficient, particularly regarding time complexities and utility guarantees.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with recent works, especially the black-box approach of Blocki et al., to provide a clearer context for their contributions. Additionally, including a comprehensive table that compares their method with existing solutions, detailing time complexities, tasks, and utility guarantees, would enhance clarity. The authors should also address the limitations of their approach more thoroughly and expand Section 7 to discuss future work. Furthermore, clarifying the delineation between utility and privacy tradeoffs in their algorithms and ensuring that all empirical evaluations are included would strengthen the paper.
