Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a 3D-aware framework for generative image compositing, utilizing a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) fine-tuned on a custom counterfactual dataset to predict object bounding boxes and depth values. The method enhances 3D spatial comprehension by integrating depth information into the image composition pipeline, addressing limitations of existing 2D methods. The authors claim significant improvements in usability, visual quality, and realism over previous approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The practical design of leveraging MLLM for 2.5D location prediction and pretrained diffusion models for 3D-aware object compositing is impactful.
- The dataset generation process for fine-tuning both MLLM and diffusion models is innovative.
- The paper is well-written, with solid and extensive experiments demonstrating clear qualitative improvements in realism and quality.

Weaknesses:
- The clarity of the instruction generation process for the dataset is insufficiently described, particularly in lines 150-151 and the caption of Figure 3.
- The paper lacks quantitative results on '3D awareness', which is central to its claims, and does not adequately discuss generalization with respect to related works.
- The reliance on a single depth value for objects may lead to inaccuracies, particularly for larger objects, and the computational efficiency of the proposed method is not sufficiently addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the dataset generation process, particularly regarding the instruction generation. Additionally, we suggest incorporating quantitative metrics for '3D awareness' and providing more empirical evidence on generalization compared to related works. The authors should also consider discussing the computational costs and runtime of their method. Finally, we advise exploring the use of multiple depth values or object masks to enhance accuracy in depth prediction.
