Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on feature representations for learning tasks involving inputs from a symmetry group, proposing MatrixNet, a neural network architecture that learns matrix representations of group element inputs rather than relying on predefined representations. The main contributions include: 
1. Formulating the problem of learning over groups as a sequence learning problem with invariance to group axioms and relations.
2. Demonstrating that MatrixNet achieves higher sample efficiency and generalization compared to several baselines in prediction tasks over the symmetric group and Artin braid group.
3. Introducing a matrix block method to ensure the network adheres to group axioms, supplemented by an additional loss term for learning group relations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper effectively links group representation theory, learning tasks, and neural networks, particularly through the formulation of learning over groups and the matrix block method.
2. The architecture design is clever and mathematically justified, leading to improved learning outcomes compared to traditional methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation behind the study is unclear, as it seems to focus on abstract group theory rather than practical applications, leaving questions about the relevance of the proposed representations for real-world tasks.
2. The experiments are limited in scope, primarily addressing simple mathematical problems without exploring larger group orders or providing sufficient insight into the learned representations compared to precomputed ones.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for their work, explicitly addressing how their approach applies to real-world learning tasks. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide more experimental results, particularly with larger symmetric groups, and clarify the distinction between predicting and determining the order of group elements. It would also be beneficial to evaluate the contributions of the decomposition of group elements into generators and the trainable representation separately. Finally, addressing the limitations of the current experiments and exploring groups with different properties could enhance the robustness of the findings.
