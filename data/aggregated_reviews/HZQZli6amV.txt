Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an empirical study on the correlation between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) performances of models in vision and NLP. The authors argue against the common belief that ID and OOD performances are positively correlated, providing evidence that negative correlations can exist in real datasets. The study includes various datasets, a toy example illustrating the trade-off between ID and OOD, and critiques previous methodologies that oversimplify this relationship. The authors also discuss how the correlation tends to be positive only under mild distribution shifts, while larger shifts may lead to negative correlations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work challenges the prevailing notion of a positive correlation between ID and OOD, presenting a fresh perspective that could influence future research methodologies in the OOD community.
- The paper is well-written and presents its arguments clearly, making it accessible to a broad audience.
- The empirical results are comprehensive and align with the theoretical analysis, providing valuable insights into the ID-OOD relationship.

Weaknesses:
- Section 6, which presents a toy example of ID and OOD correlation, is deemed unnecessary and could be replaced with more substantial experimental results.
- The experimental results in Section 5 are not well presented, and the section is considered too brief.
- There is a lack of clarity in how the theoretical analysis in Section 6 relates to the empirical findings, particularly regarding the implications of spurious features.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve Section 5 by expanding the experimental results and enhancing their presentation. Additionally, we suggest removing Section 6 or relocating its theoretical analysis to the appendix to maintain cohesion with the empirical findings. The authors should also address the question of whether there are real datasets with mild shifts that exhibit negative correlations between ID and OOD performances, as this could further clarify the applicability of their findings.
