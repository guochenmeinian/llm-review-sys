### Key Points
This paper presents an acquisition function designed to select a batch of locations for evaluating an underlying process, aiming for the surrogate model to converge to the same result as a sequential observation approach. The proposed acquisition function seeks to maximize information gain, assuming the current model is correctly specified, thereby enhancing the convergence rate of the surrogate model to the ground truth.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.  
- The experiments conducted on a reasonably large number of 2D functions are commendable.

Weaknesses:  
- The introduction lacks an abstract and does not explicitly reference Bayesian optimization.  
- The arguments for the acquisition function feel rushed, lacking clear intuition.  
- The motivation for the superiority of batch design over sequential design is insufficiently articulated.  
- The "strong greedy pattern" is not clearly demonstrated in the plots, and the implications of symmetry in the sequential strategy are unclear.  
- Algorithm 1 lacks clarity regarding the handling of $\mathcal{D}_{n + s(t)}$ and its connection to the primary optimization problem.  
- The paper does not address existing literature on batch settings for Bayesian experimental design, raising concerns about the novelty of the proposed methodology.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by including an abstract and explicitly referencing Bayesian optimization. Additionally, the authors should provide a clearer motivation for why the batch design is superior to the sequential design. Clarifying the "strong greedy pattern" and its implications in the plots would enhance understanding. The authors should also clarify the handling of $\mathcal{D}_{n + s(t)}$ in Algorithm 1 and its relevance to the main optimization problem. Finally, we encourage the authors to review and characterize their methodology against existing literature to substantiate its novelty.
