### Key Points
This paper presents a method for identifying symmetries and conservation laws from dynamics data using a deep neural network trained on time series data. The authors propose a framework that separates transformations into coordinate and linear transformations to extract nonlinear symmetries. Preliminary experimental results on a system of central force potentials indicate that the method successfully identifies invariant transformations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach addresses the gap in the study of nonlinear symmetries in physical systems, which is often overlooked.
- The introduction effectively explains the motivation for developing alternative methods to reduced models.

Weaknesses:
- Limited experiments are presented, with only one experiment lacking detail on execution and result interpretation.
- The paper does not compare its method with prior works on discovering conservation laws, which diminishes its contextual relevance.
- The applicability of the method is restricted to global linear/affine transformations, and the authors do not demonstrate how to generalize this for unknown transformations.
- The reliance on autoencoder reconstruction accuracy for symmetry identification is questioned, as it may be sensitive to the architecture.
- Some claims are inadequately supported, lacking empirical evidence or proofs.
- The anonymity of the authors is compromised by repeated references to their previous work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by providing more detailed descriptions of their methodology and results. It is crucial to include comparisons with existing methods for discovering conservation laws to contextualize their contributions. Additionally, the authors should address the limitations of their method's applicability by demonstrating how to handle unknown transformations. Clarifying the rationale behind using autoencoder reconstruction accuracy and providing empirical evidence for claims made in Section 3.1 would strengthen the paper. Finally, we urge the authors to anonymize their references to prior work to comply with submission guidelines.
