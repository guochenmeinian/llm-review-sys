Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of the Bahncard Problem, proposing a new learning-augmented algorithm, PFSUM. The authors investigate the problem's structure, independent of the primal-dual framework, and provide theoretical guarantees for the algorithm's consistency and robustness. PFSUM is designed to handle fractional and non-uniform inputs while utilizing short-term predictions. The paper includes detailed mathematical proofs and empirical results that validate the proposed method against existing solutions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well-written and addresses a theoretically and practically interesting problem, yielding significant improvements over prior works. The algorithm is intuitive, and the proofs are presented clearly, aiding comprehension. The authors effectively explain the development of PFSUM from preliminary ideas, and the empirical results convincingly validate the proposed method.

Weaknesses:  
The contributions are somewhat narrow and ambiguous, particularly regarding the robustness of PFSUM when β approaches 0, which raises concerns about reliability. The paper lacks a thorough analysis of how variations in the parameter T affect the competitive ratio. Additionally, the related work section omits recent literature that could contextualize the study's contributions, and the experimental validation relies on only two benchmarks, limiting the demonstration of the algorithm's generalizability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section by including recent publications that explore similar problems, such as "Online algorithms with costly predictions (2023)" and "Learning-Augmented Online Algorithm for Two-Level Ski-Rental Problem (2024)." This inclusion would provide a more comprehensive view of the field. 

We also suggest that the authors clarify the robustness of PFSUM, particularly in scenarios where β is small, and provide a detailed analysis of how variations in T impact the competitive ratio. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to expand their experimental validation by incorporating additional benchmarks to better demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness and generalizability. Addressing these points will strengthen the paper's contributions and enhance its impact in the field.
