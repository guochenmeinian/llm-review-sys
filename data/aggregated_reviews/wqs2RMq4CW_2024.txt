Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies corruption-robust linear bandit optimization, characterizing the regret bound in terms of weak and strong corruption measures. The authors propose a phased elimination algorithm under the stochastic setting, achieving regret bounds that match the lower bound. For the adversarial setting, two algorithms are introduced for the respective corruption measures. Additionally, the paper examines gap-dependent misspecification through reduction and discusses a use case for linear MDPs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces regret bounds for both corruption measures, notably the first introduction of the bound depending on \(C_\infty\).
- The theoretical results are well-supported with detailed proofs.
- The writing is generally clear and well-structured.

Weaknesses:
- The computational complexity of the proposed algorithms is not discussed.
- A conclusion section is absent.
- Some claims regarding the equivalence of strong adversaries and corruption measures are unclear and potentially misleading.
- The algorithms do not significantly differ from previous works, though this is a minor point.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the computational cost of the proposed algorithms. Additionally, we suggest adding a conclusion section to summarize the findings. Clarifying the claims made on page 9 regarding Theorem 6.2 and the implications of the impossibility result would enhance understanding. Finally, we encourage the authors to explain the necessity of the gap-dependent misspecification assumption (Assumption 1) and to consider presenting the \(\sqrt{dT \log k}\) results in the main theorem for clearer comparison with previous works.
