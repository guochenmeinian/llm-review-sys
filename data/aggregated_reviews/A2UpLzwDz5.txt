### Key Points
This paper presents a method called Dynamic Negative Guidance to guide the diffusion model in avoiding the generation of sensitive images. The authors address the problem of machine unlearning in diffusion models, proposing a solution when fine-tuning is not feasible. The motivation for the study is clearly articulated in the introduction, making it suitable for a workshop setting.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed method shows good results compared to the baseline, as illustrated in Figure 2.  
- The theoretical perspective of the approach is interesting and relevant to the field.  

Weaknesses:  
- The method appears to be only marginally better than existing techniques like negative prompting and safe latent diffusion, with results in Figure 3 being unconvincing.  
- There is a need for further work on the experimental setting and justification for the model's use.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental evaluation to provide clearer distinctions between their method and existing approaches. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the justification for the choice of the model to strengthen the overall argument of the paper.
