Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents new update rules for block-coordinate descent (BCD) methods aimed at minimizing a smooth function subject to a summation constraint. The authors demonstrate that the greedy 2-coordinate descent method achieves a linear convergence rate under proximal PL conditions in the L1-norm. They introduce a new update rule, GS-1, which is computationally efficient and shows improved convergence rates compared to existing methods. The theoretical results are supported by experiments on a synthetic linear least squares problem with equality and box constraints.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides novel linear convergence rates for greedy 2-coordinate updates and establishes a connection between these updates and steepest descent in the L1-norm.
- The GS-1 update rule is shown to be more efficient than previous methods, requiring only $O(n \log n)$ iterations.
- The writing is clear and the theoretical contributions are well-articulated.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental validation is limited to synthetic data and a simple problem, lacking application to more complex scenarios such as SVM training.
- The convergence analysis may not be sufficiently robust, as the dependency on the dimension is not clearly justified.
- The results in the experiments do not convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods over existing ones.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including tests on practical datasets, particularly SVM problems, to better illustrate the applicability of the GS-1 update. Additionally, we suggest providing a more rigorous comparison of the complexity of their methods against existing approaches to clarify their advantages. It would also be beneficial to include zoomed-in plots for small values of $f(x)-f^*$ to better visualize convergence behavior. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the justification for the proximal-PL condition in the context of the L1-norm and provide examples of functions that satisfy this condition.
