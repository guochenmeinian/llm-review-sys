### Key Points
This paper presents a study on learning the expected core of a strictly convex cooperation game using a bandit-based sampling algorithm called Common-Points-Picking (CPP). The authors demonstrate that strict convexity is a sufficient condition for achieving the expected core with a polynomial number of samples. The algorithm outputs a point in the expected core with high probability, given an oracle that provides noisy samples of the simplex's vertices.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper discusses the learnability of the expected core and establishes that strict convexity guarantees this learnability.  
- The proposed CPP algorithm is novel and theoretically sound, with rigorous proofs.  
- The sample complexity of the algorithm is polynomial in the number of players.  

Weaknesses:  
- The assumption of strict convexity may not be natural; it would be beneficial to validate this assumption by discussing known applications of cooperative games that satisfy it.  
- While the upper bound of sampling complexity is provided, the tightness of this bound is unclear, and a tight lower bound would enhance the analysis.  
- The paper lacks a discussion of other sampling-based algorithms for computing the core, which could help clarify its position in the existing literature.  
- Simulation results to validate sample complexity and geometric intuitions would strengthen the paper, as would illustrations of the algorithm's concepts.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the validation of the strict convexity assumption by including discussions on known convex games, such as induced subgraph games and airport games, that relate to the parameter \(\varsigma\). Additionally, providing a tight lower bound for sample complexity would be ideal. We suggest including a discussion of other sampling-based algorithms, such as those presented in references [7] and [8], to contextualize the proposed approach. Finally, incorporating simulation results and illustrations would enhance the paper's clarity and empirical validation.
