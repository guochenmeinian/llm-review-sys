### Key Points
This paper presents an extensive analysis of biases in ranking algorithms, specifically focusing on PageRank and HITS. The authors investigate how these algorithms reflect or amplify biases in network structures, particularly under the Biased Preferential Attachment Model (BPAM). They argue that while PageRank tends to mitigate degree bias, HITS exacerbates it, and they propose a randomized approach to improve fairness in HITS. The study combines theoretical analysis with empirical validation, addressing a significant issue in ranking algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles an important and timely problem regarding bias in ranking algorithms.
- It provides a strong theoretical analysis of bias and extensive empirical validation.
- The authors offer potential solutions to mitigate bias in HITS.

Weaknesses:
- The analysis lacks consideration of other structural properties of networks that may contribute to bias, such as assortativity and clustering.
- The limited use of only three real-world datasets may not sufficiently validate the authors' conclusions.
- The theoretical analysis, particularly regarding PageRank, is underdeveloped, with no rigorous results presented.
- Some technical aspects, such as the clarity of terms and definitions in Theorem 3.2, are vague and require further elaboration.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve their analysis by considering additional structural properties of networks, such as assortativity and community structure, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of bias. Expanding the dataset to include a wider range of real-world examples would enhance the validation of their findings. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the definitions and implications of terms used in their theoretical results, particularly in Theorem 3.2, and provide a more rigorous theoretical analysis of PageRank. Finally, exploring alternative measures for network homophily and techniques for addressing long-tail problems, such as reweighting or rebalancing, could further contribute to mitigating bias in HITS.
