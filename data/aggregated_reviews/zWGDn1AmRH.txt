Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework called ReFSQL for text-to-SQL semantic parsing, which includes a structure-enhanced retriever and a generator. The retriever utilizes question semantics and schema structure to obtain similar SQL grammar samples through a two-stage retrieval process. Additionally, the authors incorporate Mahalanobis contrastive learning to improve the decoding process and facilitate the transfer of samples toward specific knowledge distributions. Experiments on the Spider dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The structure-enhanced retriever is designed to improve the retrieval of similar samples.
2. The methods generalize well across different model sizes, such as T5-small and Flan-T5.
3. Extensive experiments on various Spider dataset variants showcase the robustness of the model.

Weaknesses:
1. The writing quality is poor, with bad typesetting and figures that are not vector diagrams.
2. The proposed method is complex and difficult to follow, which may hinder reproducibility.
3. The ablation study is insufficient, lacking definitive answers regarding the contributions of individual modules.
4. There is a lack of experiments verifying the superiority of Mahalanobis contrastive learning over standard methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and organization of the writing to enhance comprehension. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the intuition behind each component of the architecture and justify their usage. We also suggest including a comprehensive ablation study in the main paper to clarify the contributions of the various modules. Finally, the authors should conduct experiments to analyze the impact of the proposed method's complexity on training and inference speed.
