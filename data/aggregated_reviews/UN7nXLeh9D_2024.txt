### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of online learning in repeated multi-unit uniform price auctions, particularly focusing on the strategic participation of electricity producers in the day-ahead market. The authors propose a new modeling of the action space to the EXP3 algorithm, achieving regret bounds of $\tilde{O}(K^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$, $\tilde{O}(K^{5/2}\sqrt{T})$, and $\tilde{O}(K^{4/3}T^{2/3})$ for full information, all-winner, and bandit feedback, respectively, while also providing lower bounds for each case. The paper aims to close gaps in regret rates and characterizes learning rates from previously unconsidered feedback types.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper provides regret bounds for various feedback settings, including full, partial, and bandit feedback.  
2. The proposed algorithm significantly improves the regret bound through a novel action space model.  
3. It offers insights into repeated multi-unit uniform price auctions, contributing to the understanding of online learning in this context.

Weaknesses:  
1. The setting is not clearly articulated and diverges from previous work without adequate justification, particularly regarding the allocation policy and the role of valuation $v_l$.  
2. The manuscript lacks sufficient detail on the DAG equivalence method and other technical aspects, making it challenging to fully appreciate the proposed improvements.  
3. The paper does not explore strategic settings where other bidders also learn, which could yield interesting dynamics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the setting and provide a motivating example to justify the allocation policy. Additionally, the authors should clarify the role of valuation $v_l$ and provide more intuitions regarding the method of Branzei et al. (2024) and Algorithm 2, particularly the weight-pushing sampling. Addressing the potential dynamics if other bidders were to learn would also enhance the paper's contribution. Finally, we suggest proofreading for typographical errors and ensuring all equations are correctly formatted.
