### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for self-supervised extrofitting of word vectors that operates without external semantic resources, making it applicable across various languages. The authors demonstrate the method's effectiveness through experiments in word similarity, dialogue state tracking, and text classification, achieving performance comparable to traditional extrofitting methods. The approach leverages latent semantic analysis to identify related words, enhancing the utility of pretrained embeddings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is simple and language-independent, reducing reliance on external resources.
- The paper includes comprehensive related work and multiple experiments evaluating intrinsic and extrinsic quality.
- Results indicate that the self-supervised method can achieve quality similar to lexicon-driven approaches, particularly beneficial for languages with limited resources.

Weaknesses:
- The discussion of experimental results lacks depth, providing minimal insight into performance enhancement and limitations.
- There is insufficient explanation of the intuitions behind the method, particularly regarding the necessity of SVD-based dimensionality reduction on already compressed vectors.
- The intrinsic evaluation results fall short of state-of-the-art benchmarks, and statistical significance of results is not addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of experimental results to provide deeper insights into how the proposed method enhances performance and its limitations. Additionally, we suggest including significance testing for the results and clarifying whether other metrics beyond accuracy were used in text classification. The authors should also enhance the explanation of the method's intuitions and address the context of intrinsic evaluation results more thoroughly. Finally, addressing the quality of word groups in Table 6 through qualitative analysis would strengthen the paper.
