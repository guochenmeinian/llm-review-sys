Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to social motion prediction through a large-scale multi-person 3D motion dataset characterized by intense and strategic interactions. The authors formulate the problem using a multi-agent reinforcement learning perspective and integrate behavioral cloning and generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) to enhance learning efficiency and generalization. They develop a cognitive hierarchy framework to predict strategic human social interactions, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in long-term social motion predictions. The dataset aims to capture the complexities of real-world human behavior, enabling models to learn not just motion patterns but also intentions and decision-making processes. The authors acknowledge the need for comprehensive comparisons with other relevant datasets and commit to including additional discussions and experiments in the revised manuscript.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces and critically analyzes the limitations of existing datasets for multi-person motion prediction tasks.
2. The use of GAIL is proposed to improve the generalization ability of learned policies.
3. The dataset addresses a significant gap in existing research by focusing on strategic interactions.
4. Comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods show promising results.
5. The paper is well-written, with clear figures, a detailed experimental section, and a strong motivation rooted in human cognitive abilities.

Weaknesses:
1. The dataset's novelty is questioned due to insufficient comparisons with more recent datasets; the authors should provide a broader distribution comparison.
2. The claim of being a large-scale dataset is undermined by the dataset's duration of less than an hour.
3. The choice of a 1-second prediction horizon is questioned, as it may not capture the complexity of social interactions adequately.
4. The rationale for selecting action prediction as a task could be more explicitly stated.
5. There are minor writing issues, including orphan rows and incorrect references to figures.
6. Some reviewers express concerns about the dataset's reliance on 15 joints, questioning its adequacy for capturing complex movements in sports contexts.
7. The authors' claims regarding the dataset's challenges and contributions lack sufficient experimental validation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset comparison by including more recent datasets and providing a comprehensive distribution analysis. Additionally, the authors should clarify the dataset's scale and justify the claim of being large-scale. We suggest elaborating on the motivation behind the focus on intense, strategic interactions and how these characteristics enhance the task's performance. Furthermore, consider extending the prediction horizon beyond 1 second to better capture the dynamics of social interactions. To address the foot sliding issue, explore training techniques such as foot contact loss and data augmentation. We also recommend providing experimental results that support the assertion that existing methods do not generalize well to their dataset and including a freezing score metric to better assess motion quality. Lastly, addressing the concerns regarding the use of 15 joints and exploring alternative data formats may enhance the dataset's utility for future research.
