Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for pruning large language models (LLMs) using a task-agnostic approach called LLM-Pruner. The authors propose a three-step process: Discovery, Estimation, and Recovery, which allows for efficient pruning without access to the original training dataset. Experiments demonstrate that the method can reduce parameters by 20% while retaining 90-94% of original performance across various models, including LLaMA (7B), VICUNA (7B), and ChatGLM (6B).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses the critical need for efficient language models, especially as model sizes increase.
- It employs a novel, efficient pruning method and evaluates the pruned models across a wide range of tasks.
- The results indicate that significant performance can be preserved despite the reduction in parameters.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a comparison between the pruned model and the next smaller model variant, which could strengthen its claims.
- It does not explore the scalability of the method with larger models (e.g., 13B, 20B, 40B) or provide insights on efficiency with increasing parameters.
- There is insufficient information regarding the GPU specifications used for efficiency comparisons, particularly in terms of GPU hours.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including a comparison of the pruned model's performance against a smaller unpruned model to substantiate the effectiveness of their approach. Additionally, providing results on larger models would clarify the scalability of the method. It would also be beneficial to include a latency analysis to assess the practical implications of deploying the pruned models and to specify the GPU hardware used for efficiency comparisons. Lastly, a discussion on how the proposed method compares with distillation techniques like DistilBERT would enhance the paper's depth.
