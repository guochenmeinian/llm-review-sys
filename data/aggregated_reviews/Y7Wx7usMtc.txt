### Key Points
This paper presents a multimodal system that classifies tweets (text and image) into different categories in a hierarchical manner, organized into four interdependent tasks. The authors propose that their system is effective for crisis events like natural disasters, supported by a solid augmented dataset and a clear pipeline. The experiments utilize state-of-the-art text and image embeddings, yielding an overall F1-score of 83%. However, the average execution time of 1.32 seconds per tweet raises concerns regarding the system's responsiveness during critical situations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Convincing motivations for using social media and multimodality in disaster assessment.
- Clear summary of the four subtasks and associated methods.
- Solid augmented dataset and a well-structured pipeline for integrating existing tools.
- Thorough evaluation with state-of-the-art embeddings.

Weaknesses:
- Lack of originality in the techniques used, despite an attractive combination of methods.
- The term 'hierarchical' may not accurately describe the proposed method; 'sequential' might be more appropriate.
- The execution time of 1.32 seconds per tweet is considered excessive for real-time disaster response.
- The balancing of the dataset may weaken the applicability of findings to real-world scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the term 'hierarchical' by considering the use of 'sequential' instead. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide comparisons of their F1-score with related works, particularly those addressing subtasks of their system, to better situate their contributions within the state of the art. It would also be beneficial to discuss the reasons for the multimodal approach not yielding significantly better results compared to text-only methods. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to address the quality of Figure 1 and clarify the rationale behind using SMOTE for textual tweets but not for other tasks. Lastly, we recommend that the authors explore the potential for incorporating other types of textual and multimedia data in future work.
