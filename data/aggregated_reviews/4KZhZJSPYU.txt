Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical analysis of confidence-based deferral rules for cascades of machine learning models, identifying conditions under which these rules succeed or fail. It introduces a new post-hoc deferral method that aims to improve upon traditional confidence-based approaches by utilizing additional information. The authors conduct experiments to validate their claims, demonstrating that post-hoc deferral can outperform confidence-based methods, particularly in scenarios involving specialist models and label noise.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a solid theoretical framework and provides valuable insights supported by both theoretical and empirical evidence.
- The originality of introducing post-hoc deferral rules addresses significant limitations of existing confidence-based methods.
- The clarity of presentation and the structured approach enhance the understanding of complex concepts.

Weaknesses:
- Certain technical aspects, such as the explanation of Lemma 4.1 and the treatment of the cost parameter \( c \), lack clarity and precision, leading to confusion.
- The empirical evaluation is limited to a narrow range of datasets and tasks, primarily focusing on image classification, which may affect the generalizability of the findings.
- The assumption that post-hoc models are lightweight compared to base models may not hold in all practical scenarios, potentially complicating the cost-benefit analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Lemma 4.1 by explicitly stating what is meant by "the same ordering" in the main body of the paper. Additionally, we suggest expanding the empirical evaluation to include a wider variety of datasets and tasks beyond image classification to enhance the robustness of the findings. It would also be beneficial to clarify the conditions under which post-hoc models are appropriate, particularly regarding their computational efficiency compared to the base models, to avoid potential misunderstandings about their practical applicability.
