Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Optimal Flow Matching (OFM) algorithm, which aims to solve the optimal transport problem by generating exact straight trajectories and recovering the optimal transport map in one iteration. The authors propose a flow matching loss minimized by a velocity field derived from a convex function. The optimization involves solving a convex problem iteratively to obtain the inverse of the flow map, demonstrating that this approach is equivalent to minimizing the dual optimal transport loss. The empirical validation includes performance assessments on the Wasserstein-2 benchmark and qualitative results on FFHQ.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an important problem in optimal transport and presents a sound theoretical foundation.
- The derivation of a new training procedure based on restricted Flow Matching is insightful, showing the equivalence of minimizing OT loss and Flow Matching under specific conditions.
- The experiments are well-designed, particularly the 2D experiments with varying reference distributions, which convincingly illustrate the method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The implementation of OFM is computationally expensive, and the paper lacks a comparative analysis of training times across different methods.
- The presentation is unprofessional, with unclear theorem structures and insufficient proof sketches, particularly for Theorem 1.
- There is a lack of quantitative results for unpaired image-to-image translation tasks, making it difficult to generalize findings.
- The paper does not adequately contextualize related work, particularly in comparing OFM with existing methods like the one proposed in [1], which outperforms it on the Wasserstein-2 benchmark.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by restructuring theorems and providing accessible proof sketches, especially for key results like Theorem 1. Including a table to compare training times of different methods and a figure illustrating convergence as a function of computation time would enhance the practical understanding of OFM's efficiency. Additionally, we suggest incorporating quantitative metrics for unpaired image-to-image translation experiments, such as FID, to strengthen the empirical validation. A comparative discussion with related work, particularly regarding the performance of [1], should be included to contextualize the contributions of OFM effectively.
