Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a self-guiding exploration (SGE) framework that integrates exploration-of-thought, decomposition, and refinement prompting strategies to address NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). The authors demonstrate that SGE enhances problem-solving capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by autonomously generating and refining solution paths, achieving significant performance improvements over existing methods. Experimental results indicate a 27.84% enhancement in optimization performance and a 2.46% increase in accuracy for various reasoning tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The SGE framework is innovative and general, representing a substantial advancement in AI problem-solving.
- The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with extensive empirical evaluation across various COPs and reasoning tasks.
- The concept of LLMs autonomously identifying and handling subtasks is a notable contribution.
- Source code availability enhances reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- Figure 2 lacks detail; a comprehensive example with prompts and outputs is needed.
- The decomposition process appears non-parallelizable due to dependencies on preceding subtasks.
- The review of related work is limited, missing recent studies on LLMs/FMs and learning-based methods in combinatorial problems.
- The experimental setup is weak, focusing only on small problem sizes (5-30 nodes), which is insufficient for the NCO community. The optimality gap and inference time should be reported, and additional baselines are necessary.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve Figure 2 by including a detailed example with prompts and outputs. Additionally, the authors should address the parallelization of the decomposition process and expand the review of related work to incorporate recent studies. To strengthen the experimental contributions, we suggest evaluating larger problem sizes and reporting the optimality gap and inference time compared to traditional solvers. Finally, including more diverse baselines would enhance the robustness of the findings.
