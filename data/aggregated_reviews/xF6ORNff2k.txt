### Key Points
This paper presents a solution for aspect-based sentiment classification (ABSC) through fully-automatic Graph Structure Learning (GSL) using pre-trained language models (PLMs). The authors propose inducing graphs based on attention, kernel, and cosine similarities, complemented by a Frequency Filter (FLT) and an Automatic Filter Selector (AFS) for frequency selection. The approach is evaluated on three datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and the utility of its components.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed model shows strong theoretical foundations and achieves good performance on benchmark datasets.
- The paper is generally easy to follow and provides promising experimental results.

Weaknesses:
- Explanations and results are sometimes unclear, particularly regarding the relationship between frequency and context, hyper-parameter tuning, and the comparison between FLT and AFS.
- The novelty of the techniques employed is questioned, as many are not new to the field.
- The writing requires polishing, including clarity on input/output of the model and proper citation formats.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the explanations, particularly regarding the input and output of the proposed model, and provide more detailed descriptions of hyper-parameter tuning. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the comparison between FLT and AFS in terms of accuracy. The authors should also ensure that all bold text followed by a paragraph has a dot at the end and correct citation formats throughout the paper. Lastly, enhancing Figure 1 with input/output arrows and defining the prediction head's role would improve comprehension.
