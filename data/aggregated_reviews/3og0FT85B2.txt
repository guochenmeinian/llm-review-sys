Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Dynamic Multi-Gaussian Soup (D-MiSo) pipeline, which incorporates multi-Gaussian components and two deformation networks to model global transformations and local deformations in dynamic scenes. The authors propose a training strategy that enhances rendering quality and editing capabilities, reportedly outperforming existing motion-based sparse control point deformation methods. The framework allows for easier editing of dynamic objects over time, linking parameterized Gaussian splats to form a mesh representation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of multi-Gaussian components facilitates the modeling of large 3D scene elements, representing a novel approach.
2. D-MiSo improves upon SC-GS by allowing individual modifications through Core-Gaussians and Sub-Gaussians.
3. The editing results demonstrate significant improvements over SC-GS, particularly in handling extreme motions.

Weaknesses:
1. The contribution of multi-Gaussian representations is diminished by their similarity to SC-GS's control points, and the paper lacks an ablation study.
2. Most demonstrations rely on synthetic datasets, with a need for results on real-world datasets to enhance credibility.
3. The writing style is unclear, making it difficult to follow the numerous components involved in the pipeline.
4. There is insufficient discussion on the performance of D-MiSo compared to gs2mesh-based and cage-based methods, as well as human-NeRF methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing to better convey the complex components of the D-MiSo pipeline. Including more real-world dataset results would strengthen the paper's credibility. Additionally, we suggest conducting a thorough ablation study to clarify the roles of various components, particularly the `Sub-Rot Network` mentioned in the text. The authors should also include comparisons with gs2mesh-based and cage-based methods, as well as a discussion of human-NeRF methods to provide a more comprehensive context. Finally, addressing minor typographical errors and reorganizing the "Related Works" section would enhance the overall presentation.
