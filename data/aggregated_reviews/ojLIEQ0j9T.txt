Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a normative recurrent circuit designed to address an optimal transport problem, specifically focusing on the Gaussianization of natural image statistics. The authors investigate how local interneurons can transform natural image statistics into a spherical Gaussian distribution using an integral probability metric framed as a constrained minimax optimization problem. This approach combines recurrent neural dynamics with gain modulation, activation function adaptation, and local Hebbian plasticity. The study also includes experimental results on natural images processed through wavelet transformations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The writing is clear and the problem formulation is elegant, representing a significant advance in whitening circuits.  
- The theoretical contributions are solid and original, effectively justifying the use of spherical Gaussian distributions.  
- The model demonstrates effective transformation of input signals into targeted distributions, enhancing data analysis and interpretation.  
- The online operational capability allows for real-time data processing and continuous learning.

Weaknesses:  
- Concerns regarding the biological realism of the model, particularly the implications of inhibitory neurons not adhering to Dale's law.  
- The model requires different parameters for varying stimuli, limiting its biological plausibility.  
- Several aspects of the methodology remain unclear, particularly the mechanism supporting learning and the justification for the model's assumptions.  
- The paper's focus on low-dimensional inputs raises questions about its applicability to high-dimensional data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity by explicitly defining $p_{target}$, $p_{marginal}$, and $p_r$. Additionally, further discussion on the biological plausibility of the activation functions is warranted, particularly regarding their adaptation in biological systems. We suggest addressing the concerns about the model's reliance on pairs of wavelet coefficients and the implications of using a batch size of 10 for online learning. It would be beneficial to clarify the scaling of inhibitory neurons with input dimensionality and to provide further evidence supporting the approximate form of the activation functions. Lastly, we encourage the authors to incorporate the suggested references and address the identified typos throughout the manuscript.
