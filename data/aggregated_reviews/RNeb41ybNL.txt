Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of the Langevin process for sampling from multimodal distributions, highlighting its slow convergence and tendency to get "stuck" in dominant modes. The authors provide theoretical results demonstrating that even with annealing, Langevin dynamics can fail to reach certain modes. They propose a new method, "Chained Langevin Dynamics," which samples from conditional distributions to improve mode-seeking properties. The authors empirically validate their method and prove its effectiveness in approximating the target distribution in linear time.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors provide a formal proof of the limitations of Langevin dynamics and its annealed variant, contributing valuable insights to the sampling community.
- The proposed Chained Langevin Dynamics algorithm is novel and shows promise in improving sampling from multimodal distributions.

Weaknesses:
- The assumptions regarding the initialization of the distribution and the implications of Theorems 1 and 2 are not sufficiently justified, leading to potential misunderstandings about the limitations of the proposed methods.
- There is a lack of clear connection between the experimental results and the theoretical findings, and the descriptions of the experiments could be more precise.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity surrounding the assumptions made about the initialization of the distribution, particularly regarding the necessity for $p_0$ to follow $P_0$. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more detailed explanation of Theorem 2, addressing its implications for annealed Langevin dynamics and reconciling it with empirical observations. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to elaborate on why sampling from conditional distributions simplifies the problem compared to sampling from the joint distribution, providing high-level arguments to support this claim. Lastly, enhancing the connection between the theoretical results and experimental outcomes would strengthen the overall presentation of the paper.
