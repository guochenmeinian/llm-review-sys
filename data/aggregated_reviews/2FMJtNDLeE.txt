### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of equivariant models under mismatches between model symmetries and data distributions, introducing the concepts of correct, extrinsic, and incorrect pointwise equivariance. The authors propose bounds on the error for equivariant neural networks sensitive to data distribution, demonstrating scenarios where equivariant models may hinder learning performance. The theoretical framework extends previous work by Wang et al. (2023) to derive lower bounds for classification and regression tasks, supported by empirical experiments. Additionally, the authors discuss the necessity of p-wise equivariance in Section 5, clarifying that Proposition 5.4 utilizes pointwise equivariance, although it can be reformulated without it. They acknowledge that the bounds in Section 5 are applicable to all probability densities and agree that their significance is currently undersold. The authors also address the dependence of p-wise equivariance on specific group elements and clarify terminology regarding conjugates in the context of measure.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The theoretical bounds are more general than those in Wang et al. (2023) and are mathematically solid, providing valuable insights into the interaction between data distribution and model symmetries.
- The paper is well-structured and accessible, with intuitive illustrations and examples that effectively demonstrate the underlying mathematical principles.
- Experimental results substantiate the main claims regarding error bounds and the detrimental effects of extrinsic equivariance.
- The authors provide clear explanations regarding the use of pointwise equivariance and its implications for the bounds presented.
- They demonstrate a willingness to revise the paper based on reviewer feedback, indicating responsiveness to critiques.

Weaknesses:
- Certain presentation issues obscure the clarity of concepts like pointwise equivariance, as equivariance should pertain to maps rather than spaces.
- The necessity of the definitions in Section 4 for the bounds in Section 5 is unclear, as the bounds seem independent of these definitions.
- Some sections, particularly Section 6, appear trivial and could be repositioned to serve as motivating examples for the bounds.
- The title may not accurately reflect the paper's content, as it lacks a precise characterization of the proposed general theory.
- The importance of the bounds in Section 5 is currently not emphasized adequately.
- The definitions of p-wise equivariance may benefit from greater clarity and specificity, particularly regarding their dependence on group elements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definitions related to pointwise equivariance, specifying that it pertains to functions with respect to specific group elements. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the necessity of the definitions in Section 4 for the bounds in Section 5, potentially emphasizing the bounds as a separate significant contribution. It may also be beneficial to move Section 6 earlier in the paper to serve as a motivating example for the bounds. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the emphasis on the significance of the bounds in Section 5, presenting them as a co-equal contribution to the theoretical concepts in Section 3. We also suggest revising the definitions of p-wise equivariance to clarify their dependence on $x$ and group elements, while ensuring that essential information is retained. Finally, we recommend supplementing the discussions on limitations in Section 8 with the insights provided in the response to enhance the overall depth of the paper.
