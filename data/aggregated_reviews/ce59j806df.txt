Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new methodology for Semi-Supervised Domain Generalization (SSDG) called Class-Wise Adaptive Exploration and Exploitation (CWAEE). The authors propose a two-step approach that utilizes one-vs-rest classifiers, class-wise adaptive thresholds, and consistency regularization based on Fourier Transformation to distinguish known from unknown classes. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, showing improvements over existing SSDG techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, organized, and easy to follow.
- It addresses a realistic scenario where known classes are mixed with unknown classes, which is a significant contribution to the field.
- The proposed methodology shows strong performance on datasets, supported by extensive experiments and an adequate ablation study.

Weaknesses:
- The training pipeline deviates from established baselines, such as FixMatch, which typically involves 10k epochs, whereas this paper only uses 80 epochs.
- The reliance on an ImageNet pre-trained model raises concerns about the potential influence of pre-training on the results.
- The evaluation is limited to the authors' specific settings, lacking broader applicability across competitive benchmarks like WILDS.
- The method's computational cost for one-vs-rest classifiers increases with the number of classes, and the calibration requires validation data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental setup by evaluating their algorithm in more competitive settings, such as those provided by WILDS, to validate the applicability of their methodology. Additionally, the authors should discuss the implications of using an ImageNet pre-trained model and consider conducting experiments from scratch. Clarifying the rationale behind the class-wise adaptive thresholds and addressing the computational challenges associated with one-vs-rest classifiers would also enhance the paper's depth. Lastly, we suggest including a visual overview of the consistency regularization in the main paper for better clarity.
