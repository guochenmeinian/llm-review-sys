Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an adaptive domain learning (ADL) approach for cross-domain raw image denoising, which allows training models with limited target domain data by leveraging data from various source domains. The authors introduce a modulation module to encode sensor type and ISO, aiming to help the network adapt to different noise distributions. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms prior work on public datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed ADL strategy effectively utilizes existing source domains while filtering out harmful data, making it useful for cases with limited target domain data.
2. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate the robustness of the method, even with misaligned data.
3. The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations of methodology and results.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the proposed pipeline is questioned, as it employs common techniques in domain adaptation without significant innovative insights.
2. Qualitative results are limited to error maps; actual denoised images in sRGB should be provided for better visual comparison.
3. The method struggles with adapting to new sensor data due to its one-hot encoding approach, which may limit flexibility.
4. The paper lacks a comprehensive comparison with existing few-shot domain adaptation methods, which could provide a clearer context for its contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of the paper by incorporating more innovative insights that align with the standards of the NeurIPS community. Additionally, the authors should provide actual denoised images in sRGB for qualitative analysis and consider including metrics like LPIPS for quantitative evaluation. To enhance flexibility, we suggest revising the one-hot encoding approach to better accommodate new sensor types. Furthermore, a more thorough comparison with relevant few-shot domain adaptation methods would strengthen the paper's contributions. Lastly, clarifying the practical benefits and specific conditions under which the ADL strategy excels would enhance the paper's clarity and relevance.
