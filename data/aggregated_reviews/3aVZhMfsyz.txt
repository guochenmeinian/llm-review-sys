Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for improving grid-based NeRF by enhancing both quality and training speed. The authors propose conditioning the MLP on volume-rendered voxel features rather than original point features, allowing the MLP to run once per pixel instead of multiple evaluations. A pilot network is introduced to warm up the scene, and a new spherical-harmonic-based view-direction feature encoding is employed, resulting in state-of-the-art quality. Experiments demonstrate superior quality and training speed compared to previous methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The improvement in quality and speed is solid and promising, with the method being adaptable to other techniques.
- The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, benefiting future research.
- Extensive evaluation against various baseline methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets is conducted.

Weaknesses:
- The absence of videos to showcase improvements in view-dependent effects is a notable limitation.
- Questions remain regarding the integration of features along the ray and the clarity of the pilot network's role.
- The technical contributions are questioned, as similar techniques have been previously explored in generative NeRF tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding the integration of features along the ray, particularly in how the density field is predicted. Additionally, it would be beneficial to provide a clearer explanation of the pilot network's function and its relationship to standard volume rendering. We suggest including animations or videos to demonstrate the smoothness and 3D consistency of rendered outputs. Furthermore, we advise the authors to refine the discussion of their contributions in relation to existing works, emphasizing the non-trivial adaptation of feature integration to NeRF reconstruction.
