Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a cross-view reconstruction-based multi-view clustering algorithm (AIMC-CVR) to tackle the anchor shift problem in scenarios with missing data. The method employs an affine combination-based reconstruction strategy, which is theoretically justified as superior to convex combinations. The authors validate their approach through comparative experiments across multiple datasets with varying missing rates, demonstrating effective clustering capabilities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The anchor shift problem addressed is a significant challenge in multi-view clustering that has received limited attention.
- The proposed method effectively resolves the identified issues through the collaboration of two modules, yielding strong experimental results.
- The theoretical analysis clearly illustrates the advantages of the affine combination framework over previous methods.

Weaknesses:
- The paper contains inaccuracies, such as the claim that matrix decomposition has n^2 complexity, which is misleading.
- A lack of a symbol table diminishes readability, and some symbols, like n_p, are not precisely defined.
- There is a contradiction in Algorithm 1 regarding the application of k-means, and the paper does not explore the potential use of spectral clustering as an alternative.
- The relationship between the cross-view learning approach and the broader multi-view learning field is not well articulated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the descriptions in the ablation study and provide precise definitions for all symbols used. Additionally, the authors should address the inconsistencies in the experimental figures and enhance the writing quality, particularly in the conclusion section. We suggest that the authors clarify the relationship between the two modules in AIMC-CVR and provide a more detailed explanation of the missing data construction process. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore the implications of using spectral clustering in Algorithm 1 and to articulate the connection between their work and existing literature on multi-view learning.
