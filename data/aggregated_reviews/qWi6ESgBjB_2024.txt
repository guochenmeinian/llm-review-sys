Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative image retargeting method that combines a content-aware seam-carving technique with an adaptive repainting module using diffusion models. The approach aims to preserve important semantic regions while avoiding artifacts, demonstrating significant improvements over previous methods. The authors introduce two evaluation metrics, the Saliency Discard Ratio (SDR) and a user study metric, to assess the effectiveness of their method, which shows superior performance across varying target ratios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method significantly enhances semantic completeness and coherence in retargeted images.
- The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations and effective visual representations.
- The proposed idea is novel and offers a fresh perspective in the image retargeting field, particularly through the use of diffusion models.
- The ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the key designs.

Weaknesses:
- Some key concepts lack detailed explanations, such as the computation of x_0 and the ARRD module's determination process.
- The inference speed needs improvement; adopting accelerated diffusion models is recommended.
- The paper would benefit from comparisons with recent deep learning methods in image editing/generation to better demonstrate its advantages.
- The subjective evaluation lacks visual samples to illustrate the complementarity of the evaluation metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of key concepts by providing detailed explanations, particularly regarding the computation of x_0 and the ARRD module. Including comparisons with recent deep learning methods related to image editing would strengthen the demonstration of advantages. Additionally, enhancing the subjective evaluation with visual samples to illustrate the metrics' complementarity is advised. Finally, addressing the inference speed by considering accelerated diffusion models could significantly enhance the method's practicality.
