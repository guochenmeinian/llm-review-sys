Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Cloud Object Detector Adaptation (CODA), a novel problem aimed at adapting object detectors for specific target domains using knowledge from cloud-based detectors. The authors propose a method called COIN, which utilizes CLIP for knowledge distillation in a divide-and-conquer approach. The framework includes knowledge dissemination, separation, and distillation stages, and extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Good writing and readability, with clear organization and effective presentation.
2. Novelty of the method, leveraging CLIP for knowledge distillation in CODA.
3. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
4. Good computational efficiency for edge devices.

Weaknesses:
1. The definition of "Cloud Object Detector Adaptation" lacks precision.
2. The gradient alignment mechanism requires clearer explanation.
3. The performance degradation of cloud detectors for certain categories needs more thorough elaboration.
4. The generalization ability of the method is limited due to reliance on Faster R-CNN architecture.
5. The methodology section is somewhat confusing regarding the roles of CLIP and the target detector.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definition of "Cloud Object Detector Adaptation" to enhance understanding. Additionally, the principle of the gradient alignment mechanism should be explained more thoroughly to provide better insight into its functionality. We suggest that the authors elaborate on the performance degradation observed in cloud detectors for specific categories, potentially analyzing how incorrect predictions from CLIP may hinder knowledge transfer. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide more detailed problem settings for CODA, including scene and category gaps, and to validate the architecture on different cloud detectors to strengthen the generalizability of their findings.
