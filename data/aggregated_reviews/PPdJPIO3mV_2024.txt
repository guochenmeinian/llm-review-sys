Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Protect Informative Tokens Merging (PIToMe), a novel token merging method that prioritizes and safeguards crucial information-bearing tokens before merging. PIToMe calculates an energy score for tokens, marking the highest scored tokens as candidates for merging. The method demonstrates superior performance compared to previous techniques like ToMe, DiffRate, and ToFu, while preserving the spectral properties of the original token space. The authors provide theoretical analysis and empirical validation across multiple tasks, including image classification and visual question answering.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of the energy score for token merging is a novel concept that effectively distinguishes between informative and redundant tokens.
2. The theoretical foundation for preserving spectral properties is a unique contribution, enhancing the paper's significance.
3. Extensive empirical validation across various tasks supports the effectiveness of PIToMe.

Weaknesses:
1. The improvements over baseline methods, particularly ToMe, are not always significant, raising questions about practical benefits.
2. Some visualizations, such as those in Figure 11, show unreasonable token merging, leading to doubts about effectiveness.
3. The paper's dense mathematical content impacts readability, making it challenging for readers to grasp core contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of ambiguous formulas and inferences, particularly regarding the margin $m$ and its implications for energy score calculations. Additionally, we suggest providing results for higher merging ratios to strengthen the practicality of PIToMe. A more thorough discussion of related works, such as CrossGET and TRIPS, would enhance the context and novelty of the proposed method. Finally, simplifying the mathematical derivations or providing intuitive summaries could improve accessibility for readers.
