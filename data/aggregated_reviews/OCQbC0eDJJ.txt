Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on online fair division of indivisible items, where items arrive sequentially and must be assigned to players immediately. The authors aim to maximize utilitarian welfare while adhering to either envy-freeness in expectation (EFE) or proportionality in expectation (PE). They propose a randomized allocation method that satisfies fairness constraints at each time step, justifying this approach by demonstrating that EFE algorithms achieve limited cumulative envy and do not incur welfare loss compared to end-of-process EFE. The main contribution is a simple explore-then-commit algorithm achieving regret of $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ with respect to welfare.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The presentation is clear and accessible, effectively justifying modeling choices that initially seemed unintuitive.
- The main result, including the explore-then-commit algorithm and the regret bound, is satisfying.
- The either-uniform-allocation-or-slack property is an interesting and intuitive result that may have independent significance.

Weaknesses:
- The real-world relevance of the mathematical model is questionable, particularly the food bank analogy, which may not accurately reflect the complexities of utility allocation.
- The assumption of additive utility is criticized for lacking realism, and the connection to real-world scenarios is tenuous.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the food bank analogy, addressing concerns about its applicability and exploring alternative real-world scenarios that align with their model. Additionally, we suggest naming the either-uniform-allocation-or-slack property for clarity. The authors should also clarify the independence of distributions in their definitions and consider revising certain notations for standardization. It may be beneficial to highlight that allocations are envy-free in expectation with high probability and to present the main algorithm earlier in the paper for better clarity. Lastly, including a discussion on the empirical validity of the additive utility assumption could enhance the paper's relevance.
