Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the two-level misalignment issues (task and data) in adapting CLIP to downstream tasks. The authors propose the Causality-Guided Semantic Decoupling and Classification (CDC) method, which includes Visual-Language Dual Semantic Decoupling (VSD) and Decoupled Semantic Trusted Classification (DSTC), to mitigate the impact of task-irrelevant generative factors. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of CDC in enhancing CLIP's performance across various settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized, with clear writing and detailed experimental settings that enhance reproducibility.
- The motivation for CDC from a causal perspective is significant, and the proposed methods are intuitive.
- Comprehensive experiments reveal the effectiveness of CDC in improving CLIP's generalization.

Weaknesses:
- There is insufficient evidence showing that CDC improves predictions in specific cases; comparisons of failure cases would be beneficial.
- The paper does not explore how misalignment changes with more powerful models like ViG-Large or discuss the implications for MLLMs.
- The definition of data misalignment is vague; a clearer explanation of label and distribution misalignment is needed.
- The experiments are limited to image classification tasks, and adapting the method to other tasks like object detection or image captioning would demonstrate broader applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Figure 1's caption and provide a precise definition of data misalignment, including explanations of label and distribution misalignment. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons of failure cases to illustrate CDC's effectiveness, exploring the method's adaptability to various vision-language models, and expanding the discussion on misalignment in the context of MLLMs. Lastly, consider clarifying the term "fuse" in Figure 3 and addressing the accuracy of zero-shot testing for CDC.
