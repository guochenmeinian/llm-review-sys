Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an examination of a federated learning competition focused on privacy-preserving document visual question answering (VQA). It details the competition's structure, the evaluation metrics of utility, communication cost, and privacy, and the winning solutions. However, it primarily summarizes results without offering deeper insights that could influence future research in federated learning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The topic addresses significant issues of communication and privacy in federated learning.
- The manuscript provides a clear overview of the competition's structure and the winners' solutions.
- It summarizes tasks and expectations comprehensively, with a dedicated section on lessons learned.

Weaknesses:
- The analysis lacks depth, failing to provide strategic insights necessary for guiding future research in federated learning.
- The evaluation is limited, deploying only one model and one dataset, and does not sufficiently discuss the differences between this benchmark and existing ones.
- Communication cost calculations are based on a synthetic model, neglecting real-world complexities and overheads.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the manuscript by conducting a more detailed investigation into all competition entries, including insights from other submissions to enrich the findings. Additionally, the authors should provide a comprehensive evaluation that accurately reflects the complete communication overhead associated with federated learning, considering real-world implementations. It would also be beneficial to include more quantitative performance comparisons from various perspectives and to discuss the technical differences between this paper and related works. Lastly, clarifying the dataset statistics and the impact of heterogeneity in the FL setting would enhance understanding.
