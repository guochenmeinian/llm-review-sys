### Key Points
This paper presents a novel machine learning task aimed at predicting drug combination dose response surfaces. The authors propose a new GNN-based model, ComboPath, which integrates a biophysically-motivated model for enhanced specification and leverages domain knowledge to mitigate degeneracy in observational data. The authors assert that this method serves as a leading tool for combinatorial drug design, facilitating the rapid identification and screening of combination therapy candidates.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The integration of a biophysically-motivated model enhances the specification of the ComboPath model.  
- The approach addresses degeneracy in observational data, which is a significant challenge in drug combination studies.  
- The proposal is innovative and has the potential to improve the explainability of deep learning models in this domain.  

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty of the task is questionable, as similar work appears to have been done in ComboFM.  
- The methodology for selecting ground truth data lacks clarity, particularly regarding the use of experimental values versus sampling processes.  
- The performance metrics, primarily using MAE, may not adequately capture long-tail performance differences.  
- Comparisons between methods are poorly executed, lacking quantification and clarity in the definition of "ground truth."  
- The writing contains several unclear and ungrammatical sections, detracting from overall readability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their claims regarding the novelty of the task, specifically addressing the similarities with ComboFM. Additionally, the authors should quantify how closely the selected cell lines match the original in the dose response assays. It would be beneficial to clarify the rationale for their ground truth methodology, considering the use of direct experimental values over sampling processes. We suggest exploring alternative performance metrics beyond MAE to better capture long-tail performance. Furthermore, the authors should enhance the comparisons between methods by providing additional baselines and quantifying results in a table format. We encourage the authors to refine the writing for clarity and coherence, ensuring consistent terminology throughout the paper. Lastly, the authors should provide more detailed specifications regarding the training procedure, including the loss function, number of epochs, and model parameters.
