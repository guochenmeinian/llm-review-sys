Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Any2Policy, a framework designed to enable robots to understand tasks and environments through the integration of multiple modalities, including text, audio, images, video, and point clouds. The authors introduce an embodied alignment module to effectively process these multi-modal inputs and utilize ImageBind and TokenLearner to enhance training efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations across 30 real-world tasks and three simulation benchmarks demonstrate the framework's effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a crucial topic in robot learning, focusing on multi-modal inputs essential for developing generalist agents.
2. It is well-written and effectively presents its research goals and ideas.
3. The methods introduced significantly improve policy learning through multi-modal integration, validated by thorough evaluations.

Weaknesses:
1. Replicating real-world results may be challenging for future researchers; demonstrating effectiveness in simulated experiments would aid benchmarking.
2. The impact of multiple random seeds on results is not assessed, which could provide more robust statistical insights.
3. Results from meta-world evaluations are omitted, despite claims of their inclusion.
4. A comparison with MUTEX could enhance the analysis, given the limited baseline methods evaluated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and detail regarding the dataset, including the diversity and representativeness of the tasks. Additionally, expanding the comparative analysis to include a wider variety of baseline models, such as RT-1, RT-2, and others, would strengthen the paper. We also suggest conducting more extensive ablation studies to better understand the contributions of different components within the Any2Policy framework. Finally, addressing the questions regarding the dataset and experimental details would enhance the overall clarity and robustness of the submission.
