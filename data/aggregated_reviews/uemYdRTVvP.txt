### Key Points
This paper presents a method called SeqXGPT for detecting AI-generated text (AIGT) at the sentence level, utilizing log probability lists from white-box language models as features. The authors propose a novel approach that demonstrates promising results in both sentence and document-level detection challenges, filling a significant gap in the literature. The experimental results indicate that SeqXGPT outperforms baseline methods like DetectGPT and Sniffer, showcasing strong generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution datasets. Additionally, the authors construct a sentence-level AIGT detection dataset, which is crucial for this fine-grained detection task.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses the important task of fine-grained AIGT detection, representing a significant advancement over existing document-level methods.  
- SeqXGPT shows superior performance in sentence-level detection and exhibits strong generalization capabilities.  
- The construction of a dedicated sentence-level AIGT detection dataset is a valuable contribution.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks a thorough comparison with state-of-the-art methods and does not provide statistical significance tests for performance claims.  
- The experimental evaluation is limited, primarily focusing on synthetic datasets, which may not reflect real-world scenarios.  
- There is insufficient analysis of the limitations of the proposed approach, including the impact of semantic features and diversified instructions on detection.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental evaluation by including a comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art methods and conducting statistical significance tests to support performance claims. Additionally, we suggest expanding the dataset to mitigate potential biases and enhancing the out-of-distribution testing to better reflect real-world scenarios. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide a more thorough analysis of the limitations of SeqXGPT, including the exploration of semantic features and the effects of different instructions on AIGT detection.
