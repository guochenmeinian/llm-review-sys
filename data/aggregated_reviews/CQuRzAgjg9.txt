Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the clustering bandit problem with misspecified reward functions, introducing the RCLUMB and RSCLUMB algorithms. The authors establish upper bounds on regret that align with state-of-the-art results in certain degenerate cases and provide numerical evaluations using both synthetic and real datasets. The study addresses the challenges of model misspecification and the bandit process, aiming to minimize total regret over time.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The integration of clustering bandits and misspecified bandits is a relevant and realistic topic.
2. The paper is well-organized, with key contributions clearly described, particularly in Lemma 5.7 regarding regret bounds due to misclustering.
3. The algorithm design for RCLUMB is intuitively explained, especially in Section 4, which details the steps of cluster detection and user statistic updates.
4. Section 5 offers a clear analytical description of RCLUMB, making the discussion and proof sketch for Theorem 5.3 easy to follow.
5. The empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

Weaknesses:
1. While it is noted that CB algorithms designed for non-misspecified bandits incur large regret, the paper lacks an upper bound on their regret in the context of misspecification.
2. A lower bound is not provided, which could help assess the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.
3. The motivation behind RSCLUMB is insufficiently justified, and the paper does not adequately compare the two algorithms theoretically.
4. The experimental evaluation is limited in scope, with only 1000 items and users, and lacks comparisons with other recommender system algorithms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical comparison between RCLUMB and RSCLUMB, discussing their applicability to the same problems and highlighting their respective advantages and disadvantages. Additionally, we suggest providing an upper bound on the regret for CB algorithms in the context of misspecification and including a lower bound to assess the efficiency of the proposed algorithms. Clarifying the motivation for RSCLUMB and expanding the experimental evaluation to include comparisons with other algorithms would also enhance the paper's contributions. Finally, a discussion on the limitations and potential failure cases of the proposed algorithms would provide valuable insights for future research directions.
