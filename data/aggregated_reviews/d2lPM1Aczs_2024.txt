Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel semi-supervised learning algorithm for deep regression models, incorporating an auxiliary classification head that classifies pairs of examples based on their target values. The authors propose a weighted loss combining supervised regression and semi-supervised classification, alongside a distribution alignment loss to enhance performance. Experiments across three regression domains—images, audio, and text—demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing semi-supervised regression algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The submission introduces a clever approach to semi-supervised regression by framing it as a label ranking problem, leveraging existing semi-supervised classification techniques.  
- The inclusion of a distribution alignment loss for regression contributes to performance improvements.  
- The manuscript is well-structured and presents solid experimental results.

Weaknesses:  
- Concerns arise regarding the influence of augmentation on results, particularly whether weak augmentation was consistently applied across all configurations.  
- The method description lacks clarity, with several variables (e.g., ℓarc, ℓregression) remaining undefined.  
- The novelty of the proposed components, RankUp and Regression Distribution Alignment (RDA), is questioned, as they appear to combine existing methods without sufficient discussion on related work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method description by defining all variables used and enhancing the explanations in Section 3.3. Additionally, it is crucial to clarify whether weak augmentation was applied consistently across all semi-supervised and supervised configurations. We also suggest including more discussion and ablation studies on the individual contributions of RankUp and RDA to better understand their effectiveness in semi-supervised regression tasks.
