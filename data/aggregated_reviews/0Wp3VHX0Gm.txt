### Key Points
This paper presents the Lévy-Ito Model (LIM), a novel score-based generative model (SBGM) that utilizes isotropic α-stable Lévy processes for noise injection. The authors address issues of mode collapse and slow convergence in traditional SBGs that rely on Brownian motion. They provide a rigorous proof of the time-reversal formula for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with Lévy processes and introduce fractional denoising score matching to elucidate the training process of LIM. Empirical results demonstrate that LIM achieves superior mode estimation, sample diversity, and faster convergence compared to previous diffusion models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a valuable contribution by rigorously proving the time-reversal formula for SDEs driven by Lévy processes, establishing a solid foundation for the proposed method.
- Clear and comprehensive proofs and demonstrations of the reverse SDE formula, sampling equation, numerical solver (v-Euler-Maruyama), and fractional denoising score matching are presented.
- The writing is clear, concise, and well-structured, making it accessible to readers.
- Empirical results show promising improvements in mode estimation and sample diversity across various datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The primary improvement of LIM over previous models is enhanced diversity; however, more experiments on mode estimation and sample diversity would strengthen the findings.
- The discussion on convergence rates lacks depth, and the influence of factors like network architecture and noise scheduling should be analyzed more thoroughly.
- The paper does not provide sufficient evidence for claims regarding mode collapse in conventional SBGs.
- Some experimental results, particularly in Figure 3 and Tables 1, 2, and 3, require clearer explanations and statistical significance assessments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental sections by conducting additional experiments on mode estimation and sample diversity to reinforce their claims. A more detailed analysis of convergence rates, including the impact of network architectures and noise scheduling, would enhance the discussion. Clarifying the evidence supporting claims about mode collapse in previous models is essential. We also suggest revising the related work section to include a more comprehensive review of recent developments. Lastly, addressing minor grammatical errors and ensuring the accuracy of equations in the appendix will improve the overall clarity and quality of the paper.
