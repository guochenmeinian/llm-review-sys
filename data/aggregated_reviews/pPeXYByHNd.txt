### Key Points
This paper presents MSAGPT, a novel method for generating multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) using 2D evolutionary positional encoding, reformalizing MSA generation as a one-dimensional sequence generation task optimized with a GPT objective. The authors propose incorporating feedback from AlphaFold2 to minimize hallucinations during MSA generation through DPO fine-tuning. Experimental results indicate that MSAGPT enhances protein structure prediction in low-MSA scenarios, achieving improved structural reconstruction scores. The paper also demonstrates that generative models can replace traditional MSAs, particularly for orphan proteins lacking natural relatives.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, easy to follow, and presents a simple yet effective framework that is straightforward to implement.
- The innovative use of 2D positional encoding allows for zero- or few-shot MSA generation under a flexible in-context learning framework.
- It produces impressive performance improvements for protein structure prediction, particularly for query proteins that are distant from known natural proteins.
- The evaluation includes comparisons with multiple recent papers on generating virtual MSAs and systematically investigates the selection of generated virtual sequences.

Weaknesses:
- **Efficiency Concerns:** Flattening 2D sequences into 1D increases time complexity, necessitating a comparison with other MSA generative models for efficiency.
- **Limited Evaluation Sets:** The evaluation metrics are based on very small sets, raising concerns about statistical significance and representativeness for broader distributions of orphan proteins.
- **Missing Experimental Details:** The paper lacks crucial details regarding pretraining, hyperparameter selection, and measures to prevent data leakage, impacting credibility and reproducibility.
- **Limited Use Case:** The practical application of generating virtual MSAs is restricted to models that utilize MSAs, such as MSA Transformer or AlphaFold.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the efficiency analysis by providing a detailed comparison of MSAGPT with other MSA generative models. Additionally, the authors should expand the evaluation setup to include larger datasets to ensure statistical significance and representativeness of the results. It is also crucial to include detailed explanations of the pretraining process and hyperparameter selection to enhance reproducibility. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the metrics used for "prediction accuracy" and address the minor inaccuracies and ambiguities noted in the review.
