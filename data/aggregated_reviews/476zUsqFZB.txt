Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an approach to enhance the interpretability of reaction prediction methods by modeling step-wise polar reactions using the PMechDB dataset. The authors propose a new system, PMechRP, which reportedly achieves the highest top-5 accuracy. The work evaluates various machine learning models and aims to integrate reaction mechanism information, addressing the limitations of existing models that overlook intermediate states.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Several existing chemistry reaction prediction models are benchmarked on the PMechDB dataset.
- A new benchmark is introduced, improving the interpretability and causality of chemical reactions.
- The motivation for exploring intermediate electron transfer is clear and significant for understanding reaction mechanisms.

Weaknesses:
- The paper suffers from substantial clarity issues, with insufficiently informative table captions and inconsistent figure formatting.
- Citation quality is poor, lacking references to prior work, particularly in section 3.3, and the introduction of PMechDB is unclear regarding its contribution.
- The novelty is not prominent, as similar tasks have been addressed in prior work, such as OrbChain.
- Evaluation is insufficient, lacking source code for reproduction, global dataset evaluations, error bars, and benchmarks against comparable methods.
- The writing quality is poor, and the paper may be more suitable for a dataset and benchmark track rather than the main conference track.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the manuscript by enhancing table captions and ensuring consistent formatting of figures. Additionally, the authors should provide more comprehensive citations to prior work and clarify the contribution of PMechDB. To strengthen the novelty, we suggest discussing more reaction models and clearly describing the evaluation metrics and new tasks. Furthermore, the authors should include source code for reproduction and evaluate the models on global datasets to demonstrate generalizability. Lastly, we encourage the authors to refine the writing quality to better convey the significance of their work.
