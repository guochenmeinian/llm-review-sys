Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents improved core-set construction algorithms aimed at maximizing diversity under partition constraints, specifically focusing on two diversity measures: sum-of-pairwise distances and sum-of-nearest-neighbor distances. The authors validate their algorithms through real-world applications, achieving a 100x speedup with minimal diversity loss while enhancing space usage in streaming contexts. The study introduces coresets for fair diversity measures, defined as partition matroids with fixed item counts from each part, and compares these against existing baselines, demonstrating practical performance improvements.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The algorithms provide significant insights, particularly through proofs of approximations, appealing to a broad research community.
- The problem addressed is challenging and natural, with a non-trivial analysis that shows core-set sizes are independent of data size and distribution.
- The methods are practical, simple, and efficient, leading to better run times for large datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The paper's structure requires revision for clarity, particularly the placement of the 'Overview of the Algorithms' section.
- The renaming of 'Diversity Maximization under Partition Constraints' to 'Fair Diversity Maximization' lacks clear distinction, causing confusion regarding contributions.
- The theoretical guarantees, especially for the NN-distance diversity notion, are weak, and the rationale for certain experimental choices appears arbitrary.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper's structure by relocating the 'Overview of the Algorithms' to the relevant sections and balancing the length of the first section. Clarifying the distinction between 'partition constraints' and 'fairness constraints' is essential to enhance understanding. Additionally, the authors should ensure that the GMM Algorithm is accurately defined and that key terminologies, such as "aspect ratio," are correctly used and sufficiently defined. We also suggest providing a clearer rationale for experimental choices and maintaining consistent naming and notation throughout the paper. Finally, the authors should explore additional applications of the coresets, particularly in distributed or streaming algorithms, to strengthen the paper's impact.
