Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework called SElf-weighted Multi-view contrastive learning (SEM) to address the limitations of contrastive learning (CL) in multi-view scenarios, particularly representation degeneration due to inconsistent semantic information. The contributions of the SEM framework include: alleviating representation degeneration through a self-weighted contrastive loss that adaptively strengthens useful pairwise views and weakens unreliable ones; introducing a self-supervised reconstruction term to regularize hidden features of encoders; and extensive experimental validation demonstrating significant performance improvements across public multi-view datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposal of SEM is well-motivated, effectively tackling representation degeneration in multi-view scenarios.
- Flexibility in weighting strategies is provided, including class mutual information, JS divergence, and maximum mean discrepancy.
- Significant performance improvements and thorough ablation studies validate SEM's effectiveness in mitigating representation degeneration in existing CL methods.

Weaknesses:
- Concerns exist regarding the rationale for the reconstruction module; clarification is needed on why an additional encoder is used post-representation H instead of directly reconstructing representation z. More details on the reconstruction's position within the encoder and its relationship to performance improvement should be provided.
- The enhancement from the reconstruction regularization appears more pronounced than that from the self-weighted module, necessitating a detailed explanation in the experimental section.
- Presentation and captions of Figures 1 and 5 could be improved, with a summary of conclusions and connections among the data displayed in these figures.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the rationale behind the reconstruction module, specifically addressing the use of an additional encoder. Further analysis of the relationship between discriminative information and performance improvement should be included in both the method and experimental sections. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed explanation of why reconstruction leads to greater improvements compared to the self-weighted module. Enhancing the presentation of Figures 1 and 5, along with summarizing the conclusions drawn from the data, would also strengthen the paper.
