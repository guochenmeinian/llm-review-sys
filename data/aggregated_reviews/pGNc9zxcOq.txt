### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the performance of the SP-voting rule within two rank-order models: concentric mixtures of Mallows and Plackett-Luce models with more than two groups. The authors derive theoretical conditions for the SP-voting rule to identify the ground-truth ranking and validate its effectiveness through empirical assessments on real-world and synthetic datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces innovative methodologies, extending existing models to accommodate multiple groups, enhancing the understanding of voter behavior.
- The authors provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, detailing conditions for recovering ground truth rankings and analyzing sample complexity, which is crucial for practical application.
- Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that SP-voting outperforms traditional methods, particularly in terms of sample complexity and accuracy.

Weaknesses:
- Some theoretical and numerical results lack sufficient justification and clarity, potentially hindering reader comprehension.
- The comparison with the Copeland rule is limited; broader comparisons with other ranking aggregation methods could strengthen claims regarding SP-voting's effectiveness.
- The proposed models may be too specific, and the paper does not clearly delineate the information available to different participants.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by providing additional justification and intuitive explanations for the theoretical results, particularly regarding the conditions in Lemmas 3.3 and 3.4. We also suggest elaborating on the suitability of the concentric models for capturing group ranking behaviors and exploring scenarios where the Concentric Mixture of Mallows may outperform the Plackett-Luce model. Additionally, we encourage the authors to include more detailed implementation guidelines or pseudo-code for the proposed models to enhance reproducibility and to broaden the comparison with other ranking aggregation methods beyond the Copeland rule.
