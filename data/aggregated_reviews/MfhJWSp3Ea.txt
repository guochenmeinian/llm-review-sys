Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the "AircraftVerse," a publicly available dataset focused on aerial vehicle design, comprising over 27,000 diverse air vehicle designs. Each design is represented through multiple modalities, including symbolic design trees, STEP model data, 3D CAD designs in STL format, 3D point clouds, and performance metrics from high-fidelity physics models. The authors propose baseline surrogate models that utilize these modalities to predict design performance metrics, aiming to facilitate machine learning applications in aircraft design and cyber-physical systems (CPS). Additionally, the authors introduce a probabilistic design generator that incorporates expert knowledge while ensuring diversity in design samples. They have added a limitations section to clarify the target audience and the purpose of the benchmark, emphasizing that the dataset serves as a tool for machine learning researchers and domain experts. Updated documentation and tutorials have been provided to facilitate user engagement with the dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is a significant contribution, being the largest corpus of complex engineering designs in the field.
- It addresses a gap in multi-modal holistic engineering design, providing diverse aircraft designs with associated performance metrics.
- The inclusion of high-fidelity physics model evaluations enhances the dataset's utility for performance analysis.
- The incorporation of a probabilistic design generator enhances the dataset's utility by integrating expert knowledge.
- Improved documentation and tutorials make the dataset more accessible.
- The dataset's complexity and multi-modality are well-articulated, distinguishing it from existing CAD datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The methodology for ensuring diversity in design selection is unclear, raising questions about the search process and expert heuristics used.
- The explanation of baseline surrogate models, particularly the transformer encoder's processing of symbolic representations, lacks detail.
- The paper does not adequately assess the dataset's potential for developing innovative aircraft structures, focusing instead on characterizing existing designs.
- The benchmark's purpose remains somewhat unclear despite elaboration.
- The related work section lacks depth, failing to adequately highlight the dataset's significant value.
- Some reviewers noted that the tutorials and target user descriptions are still limited.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the search methodology for design selection, including how diversity was ensured. A more detailed explanation of the transformer encoder model and its integration with the dataset would enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest that the authors evaluate the dataset's capability to foster innovative aircraft designs rather than solely characterizing existing ones. We also recommend improving the clarity of the benchmark's purpose to better guide potential users. Enhancing the related work section to more explicitly convey the unique contributions of the dataset to the field of aircraft design would be beneficial. Expanding the tutorials to cover more use cases and providing clearer descriptions of the target audience would further strengthen the paper. Finally, we encourage the authors to consider adding more baseline models, such as PointNet, to enhance the benchmarking process.
