Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical convergence analysis of the Sequential SL (SSL) algorithm, demonstrating its performance against Federated Averaging (FedAvg) in heterogeneous data settings. The authors attribute SSL's superior performance in certain scenarios to the nature of data heterogeneity, supported by empirical evidence. The study highlights the implications of these findings for federated learning algorithms, particularly in resource-constrained environments. However, the paper lacks a thorough discussion on the practical applications of its results and the conditions under which SSL consistently outperforms FedAvg.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a comprehensive theoretical analysis of SSL's performance compared to FedAvg, particularly in heterogeneous settings.
- Empirical validation of theoretical findings enhances the credibility of the claims made, particularly through simulations involving one-dimensional quadratic functions and practical scenarios.

Weaknesses:
- The focus on SSL and FedAvg may limit the generalizability of the findings, as other influencing factors are not considered.
- A more detailed discussion on the practical implications of the findings is needed to enhance the paper's value.
- The analysis does not sufficiently explore why SSL outperforms FedAvg in heterogeneous settings or how to mitigate FedAvg's limitations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the implications of their findings for real-world applications, providing insights into how these results can be applied practically. Additionally, further exploration of the conditions under which SSL outperforms FedAvg, along with potential strategies for addressing FedAvg's limitations in extremely heterogeneous environments, would significantly enhance the paper's contribution. We also suggest extending the experimental evaluation to include larger datasets and more contemporary models, which would provide a more rigorous test of the SSL algorithm and increase the relevance of the research.
