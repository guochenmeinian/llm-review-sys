Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel class of membership inference attacks utilizing quantile regression on confidence score distributions, which offers computational efficiency compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The authors claim that their approach is competitive with traditional shadow model attacks while being more scalable and efficient. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, although some results raise questions about its performance consistency across different datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a topical issue in membership inference attacks and introduces a novel, computationally efficient method.
- The proposed attack competes well with SOTA methods without requiring multiple shadow models, which is a significant practical advantage.
- The paper is well-written and presents clear motivations and technical details.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation lacks additional metrics, such as TPR@lowFPR, which are crucial for assessing attack effectiveness.
- There is insufficient empirical evidence supporting claims of computational efficiency, particularly regarding the time and resource costs compared to other methods.
- The theoretical results are not adequately supported by empirical data, and the paper does not address the sensitivity of the quantile regression model to different architectures.
- The paper's writing could benefit from improved organization and clarity, particularly in explaining the significance of membership inference attacks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including more metrics, specifically TPR@lowFPR, to provide a comprehensive assessment of their method's effectiveness. Additionally, we suggest that the authors compare their approach with model-based and metric-based attacks to contextualize their results better. It would also be beneficial to report the computational costs associated with their method to substantiate claims of efficiency. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the observed performance discrepancies across datasets, particularly why the proposed method performs worse on C-10 and C-100 but better on IN-1k. Lastly, a sensitivity analysis regarding the architecture of the quantile regression model should be included to clarify its impact on performance.
