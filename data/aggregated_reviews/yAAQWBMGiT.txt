Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on data selection for finetuning large pre-trained models, focusing on the variance-bias tradeoff in high dimensions. The authors provide a theoretical analysis and propose a two-stage algorithm called Sketchy Moment Matching (SkMM), which utilizes gradient sketching to identify a low-dimensional subspace and moment matching to reduce variance. Empirical validation is conducted on synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating the method's effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a rigorous generalization analysis for data selection in both low and high-dimensional contexts, with detailed and sound proofs.
- The SkMM method is straightforward to implement and scalable, showing promising results against various algorithms, including leverage scores.

Weaknesses:
- Some theoretical results depend on assumptions (e.g., low intrinsic dimensionality) that may not hold in practice; a discussion on the implications of these violations is needed.
- The introduction of new hyperparameters (e.g., sketching dimension, moment matching strength) lacks guidance on optimal settings.
- The experimental focus on linear probing limits the evaluation scope, and the synthetic setup does not present a sufficiently challenging scenario.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the implications of theoretical assumptions when they are violated. Additionally, providing guidance on setting hyperparameters optimally would enhance the practical applicability of the method. Expanding the experimental evaluation to include more challenging scenarios, such as scaling up the synthetic experiments and testing on Cifar-100, would also be beneficial. Furthermore, clarifying the optimization process after data subsampling and comparing with margin sampling in the experimental results would strengthen the paper. Lastly, addressing the computational efficiency of SkMM in comparison to other methods would provide valuable insights for readers.
