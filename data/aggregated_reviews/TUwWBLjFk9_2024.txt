Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for causal structure learning on Poisson Branching Structural Causal Models (PB-SCM) by exploring its identifiability using the Probability Generating Function (PGF). The authors develop a closed-form solution for the PGF, enabling the identification of local causal structures through component appearances. A practical algorithm is proposed for learning causal skeletons and identifying causal directions, with effectiveness demonstrated through experiments on synthetic and real datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The use of PGF to address the identifiability of PB-SCM is a novel approach.  
- The derivation of a compact, exact closed-form solution for the PGF establishes a significant connection to the causal structure.  
- The proposed algorithm is well-detailed and validated through experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness and theoretical soundness.  
- The writing is clear, well-organized, and effectively conveys the intuition behind the proposed method.  

Weaknesses:  
- Additional experiments on a wider variety of real-world datasets are needed to strengthen the argument for the method's generalizability.  
- The symbols T and corresponding formulas in Figure 3 are explained later, potentially causing confusion.  
- The term ch(i) in Formula 3 lacks a definition and may be intended to be Des(i).  
- The proposed method cannot handle high-dimensional covariates, and the orientation of edges is not detailed.  
- The soundness of the method relies on the causal sufficiency assumption, limiting its applicability.  
- More illustrations in the toy example would help clarify the connection between PGF and the graph, enhancing understanding.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Figure 3 by explaining the symbols T and related formulas earlier in the text. Additionally, please define the term ch(i) in Formula 3 to avoid ambiguity. To enhance the generalizability of the method, we suggest conducting further experiments on diverse real-world datasets. We also encourage the authors to elaborate on the benefits of using the local property of PGF and discuss the potential for using the global PGF. Lastly, we recommend including more case studies in the experiments to provide deeper insights into the method's performance.
