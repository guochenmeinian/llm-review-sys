### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to online ad auctions by incorporating user-targeted coupon recommendations, modeling the interaction between advertisers and the platform as a two-stage game involving coupon bidding and auction bidding. The authors propose two mechanisms: a distribution-free model compatible with second-price auctions and an advanced revenue-optimal mechanism aligned with Myerson auctions, simplifying prior complex payment calculations. The evaluation through synthetic and industrial data indicates that these mechanisms enhance advertiser utility and platform revenue, fostering a mutually beneficial structure through strategic coupon use.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a relevant problem, exploring the potential of targeted coupons to increase revenue and welfare for the platform, advertisers, and users.
- The proposed mechanisms are straightforward and demonstrate incentive compatibility and simplicity.
- Experimental results are compelling, showing significant improvements for both advertisers and the platform.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty and technical contribution are diminished by the existing work of Liu et al. [10], which raises questions about the implementability of the authors' mechanism compared to Liu's.
- The assumption that coupons improve user utility is questionable, as it relies on advertisers maintaining constant prices, which may not reflect realistic pricing strategies.
- The insights from synthetic experiments are unclear, as they replicate the theoretical setting without providing additional value.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the implementability issues associated with Liu et al. (2024) and justify the complexity introduced by their two-stage bidding mechanism. Additionally, it would be beneficial to address the potential for coupons to decrease user utility due to price discrimination. We suggest that the authors introduce the assumptions on $h_i$ earlier in the paper and clarify the role of increasing differences in the proof of Lemma 4. Lastly, we encourage the authors to elucidate the purpose of the synthetic experiments and their insights beyond the theoretical results.
