Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Kangaroo, a novel self-speculative decoding framework aimed at accelerating large language model (LLM) inference through a double early exiting strategy. The authors propose leveraging a shallow sub-network of the target LLM to create a self-drafting model, which employs a dynamic early exiting mechanism to enhance efficiency while maintaining the same sampling distribution as the original model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Kangaroo achieves significant speedups, up to 2.04×, with fewer additional parameters compared to existing methods. Additionally, the paper provides a comparative analysis of early exit layers in the Vicuna-7B model, highlighting that only the second and third layers fall within the recommended robust range of $[1/16, 1/10]$. While Medusa excels in translation tasks due to its use of second-to-top-layer features, Kangaroo performs better in summarization, mathematical reasoning, and retrieval-augmented generation due to its auto-regressive adapter and early exits at shallow layers. The paper emphasizes the importance of contextual relationships in task performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a double early exiting strategy is a unique approach that effectively enhances LLM efficiency without sacrificing performance.
- Kangaroo demonstrates substantial wall-time speedups over previous methods, outperforming competitors like Medusa with significantly fewer parameters.
- The dynamic early exiting mechanism optimally balances token acceptance rates and drafting efficiency, validated through comprehensive empirical experiments across multiple tasks.
- The analysis of early exit layers provides valuable insights into model performance.
- The differentiation between Medusa and Kangaroo based on task-specific capabilities is well-articulated.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks detailed implementation specifics for the extension to tree decoding, which could hinder reader comprehension.
- Optimal settings for the early exit layer and dynamic threshold η may require extensive tuning, potentially limiting generalizability across tasks.
- The focus on Vicuna-7B and Vicuna-13B models necessitates broader experimentation with various model sizes to substantiate claims of scalability.
- The comparison of methodologies lacks a comprehensive evaluation of temperature sampling results against other methods.
- There is insufficient exploration of the differences between Medusa and Kangaroo in the context of their respective performance metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the implementation details for the tree decoding extension to facilitate reader understanding. Additionally, providing a more comprehensive exploration of the adapter network design across different model architectures would enhance generalizability. We suggest including a rational basis for the chosen size of the shallow network, potentially through ablation studies or sensitivity analyses. A deeper discussion on the comparative performance of Kangaroo across various tasks, particularly in relation to translation, would provide valuable insights. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to justify the number of training epochs chosen and to conduct additional experiments verifying speedup claims across diverse hardware setups. Lastly, we recommend that the authors improve the comparison of temperature sampling results more extensively with other methods and explore further differences with Medusa, incorporating more baseline methods and conducting a comprehensive comparison for temperature sampling in the final version to enhance the manuscript's robustness.
