Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ChatTracker, a novel VL tracking framework that integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enhance visual object tracking. The authors propose a Reflection-based Prompt Optimization (RPO) module that iteratively refines text prompts based on tracking feedback, leading to improved tracking performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ChatTracker achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) results across various datasets. Additionally, the paper reflects the authors' thorough research and understanding of the topic, contributing valuable insights to the existing literature.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents a clear framework that leverages MLLMs for visual tracking.
- The proposed method shows competitive performance against state-of-the-art trackers and includes adequate ablation studies.
- The authors exhibit a strong grasp of the subject matter and provide valuable insights that enhance the existing literature.

Weaknesses:
- The input specifications in the paper are inconsistent, particularly regarding the mention of template frames.
- There is a lack of clarity on the choice of visual coders and the absence of certain SoTA trackers in performance comparisons.
- The fusion process of linguistic descriptions with visual features is not adequately explained.
- The paper does not address the potential temporal changes in video content that could affect prompt optimization.
- The review does not highlight any specific weaknesses or areas for improvement.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of input specifications by consistently mentioning template frames. Additionally, please provide more results for MixFormer-B and ARTrack-L to enhance performance comparisons. We suggest elaborating on how linguistic descriptions are integrated with visual features in Section 4.3. To strengthen the experimental results, we encourage the authors to include performance metrics on the LaSOT_ext and OTB_Lang datasets. Furthermore, addressing the temporal dynamics in video content and their impact on prompt optimization would significantly enhance the framework's robustness. Lastly, we advise expanding the related works section to contextualize the limitations of manual text annotations in existing benchmarks and consider incorporating more detailed discussions on potential limitations of their findings to provide a more balanced perspective.
