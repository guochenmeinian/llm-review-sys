Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a self-supervised video prediction model inspired by the Fourier shift theorem, aiming to leverage perceptual straightening for accurate predictions. The authors validate their method on simple toy cases and demonstrate its superiority over motion compensation and standard deep learning models in next-frame prediction. They connect their model to early visual processing in biological vision, suggesting a principled approach to natural video representations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The methods are well thought-out, with a clever connection between perceptual straightening and the Fourier shift theorem.
- The use of local and multi-scale processing is grounded in human visual processing principles.
- The model's analyses are robust, with validation on synthetic and larger natural video datasets like DAVIS, and inclusion of good baselines.

Weaknesses:
- There is a lack of sufficient baseline comparisons to existing video prediction methods, limiting understanding of the model's performance relative to state-of-the-art approaches.
- Only basic CNNs are used for comparison, and the evaluation metrics are limited to PSNR, lacking other informative metrics like SSIM or FVD.
- More detail on compute and training requirements is needed to clarify the significance of the approach.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve their evaluation by including comparisons with more advanced video prediction models, such as PredNet, and reporting additional performance metrics like MSE, SSIM, and LPIPS. Incorporating another dataset, such as Kinetics, would enhance the robustness of their findings. Additionally, providing more details on compute and training requirements would help contextualize their results. We also encourage the authors to elaborate on potential applications of their video representation learning framework beyond next-frame prediction, and to discuss limitations and challenges in greater detail.
