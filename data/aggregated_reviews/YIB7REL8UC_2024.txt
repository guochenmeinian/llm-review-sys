Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of how belief states are represented in the residual stream of transformers using a theoretical framework from Computational Mechanics. The authors demonstrate that belief states can be linearly decoded from transformer representations, revealing that transformers encode not only the data-generating process but also the current belief about its state. This capability is argued to enhance next-token prediction, as a model that accurately infers the hidden state can better predict future tokens. The study employs a toy model based on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and finds that the belief-state geometry emerges throughout training, with implications for understanding transformer computations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research is well-executed, with clear writing and adequate examples that facilitate understanding of complex concepts.
- The paper provides significant empirical contributions to the interpretability field, particularly in demonstrating that belief states are represented in the transformer structure.
- Visualizations, such as those depicting fractal geometry, are well-crafted and informative.

Weaknesses:
- The formalization in Section 2.2 is ambiguous, requiring clarification.
- The findings are primarily based on the HMM model, limiting their applicability to more complex tasks without ground truth data-generating models.
- There is a lack of discussion on related work, making it difficult to contextualize the findings within the broader literature.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the formalization in Section 2.2 and provide more detailed explanations for ambiguous terms and equations. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion of related work to better situate the findings within the existing literature. To enhance the robustness of the results, we encourage the authors to conduct experiments with a larger number of hidden states and vocabulary sizes, as well as to explore the implications of their findings beyond the HMM model.
