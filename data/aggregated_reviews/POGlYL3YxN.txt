### Key Points
This paper presents the CATALOG model, designed for phishing detection on Ethereum by capturing both local and global behavioral patterns. The motivation is clearly articulated, addressing existing challenges in the field. The architecture integrates local temporal correlation analysis, global correlation analysis, and contextual enrichment through a bi-directional masked language modeling transformer. The authors demonstrate the model's effectiveness through extensive experiments, although the experimental setup does not fully reflect real-world scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper conducts real data analysis in the Introduction to support the construction of CATALOG.
- It addresses a significant security issue and contributes a new dataset for Ethereum 2.0.
- The methodology is well-developed, combining dual cross-attention mechanisms with a transformer architecture.

Weaknesses:
- The definition of phishing users is unclear, and the unique challenges of detecting them on Ethereum are not convincingly articulated.
- The proposed model architecture lacks novelty and contains several ambiguities and missing details.
- The experimental results, particularly the claimed improvements in F1-score, appear to be selectively presented, and there is a lack of cross-validation results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definition of phishing users on Ethereum and explicitly state the unique challenges associated with detecting them. Additionally, we suggest providing more detailed explanations regarding the model architecture, particularly the justification for the choice of local correlation calculations and the complexity introduced by CATALOG. It would be beneficial to include experiments comparing CATALOG with the original transformer architecture and to clarify the hyperparameters used in the model. Furthermore, we advise addressing the computational complexity, memory demands, and training time of CATALOG to assess its scalability in real-world applications.
