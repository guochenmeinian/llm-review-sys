### Key Points
This paper presents a weakly-supervised approach utilizing the SNOMED-CT ontology to enhance training data for deep learning classifiers aimed at identifying contradictory medical sentences. The authors propose creating an antonym lexicon from SNOMED-CT interpretation values, which is then applied with compositional heuristics to classify PubMed abstract sentence pairs as contradictory or non-contradictory. The study reports significant improvements in model performance using this ontology-supplemented data and highlights the importance of subtree sampling and pre-denoising irrelevant sentence pairs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces an innovative and cost-effective method for data augmentation in clinical contradiction detection, leveraging the SNOMED database.
- It provides state-of-the-art results, clear writing, and meaningful comparisons with existing literature.

Weaknesses:
- Some proposed heuristics are considered crude, raising doubts about the validity of results, particularly in context-sensitive evaluations.
- The paper's clarity is inconsistent, with scattered heuristics making it difficult for readers to follow the methodology.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by organizing the heuristics more cohesively and minimizing the need for cross-referencing the appendix. Additionally, we suggest revisiting the terminology used for "contradiction" and "contradictory," as it may be misapplied in some contexts. Addressing the concerns about the crude heuristics and providing more detailed explanations for the methods employed would strengthen the paper's overall rigor. Lastly, we encourage the authors to ensure that all technical terms, such as RTE, are properly defined for clarity.
