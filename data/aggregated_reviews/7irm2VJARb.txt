Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents "Structure from Duplicates" (SfD), an inverse graphics framework aimed at reconstructing the 3D structure, material, and illumination of multiple identical objects from a single image. The authors propose a novel "single-view duplicate objects" setting that distinguishes itself from traditional multi-view single-instance frameworks. The method identifies duplicate objects, estimates their 6DoF poses using a carefully designed matching scheme integrated into a bundle adjustment framework, and applies an inverse graphics pipeline to deduce information about the objects' shape, material, and scene lighting. By leveraging the appearance of multiple instances, the approach creates a multi-view supervision signal, transforming the single-view multi-object reconstruction problem into a better-constrained multi-view single-object reconstruction problem. The authors utilize NeuS as the neural surface model and Siren for the visibility field, emphasizing that their pose estimation process is more than a straightforward application of COLMAP.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method effectively outperforms baseline techniques in both single-image multi-object setups and multi-view inverse rendering scenarios.
- It introduces a distinct and valuable setting in inverse graphics, expanding the scope of existing methodologies.
- The authors provide detailed technical contributions, including the use of NeuS and Siren, and a customized procedure for pose estimation.
- The paper is well-written, with clear descriptions and strong experimental validation, demonstrating good qualitative and quantitative results.

Weaknesses:
- The approach relies heavily on the assumption that instances are nearly identical, raising concerns about robustness to variations in geometry and appearance.
- The method's applicability to real-world scenarios is limited, as it primarily addresses a niche problem that may not frequently occur.
- Visualizations are limited to input viewpoints and masked renderings, obscuring the assessment of reconstruction quality.
- There are unresolved questions regarding the accuracy of poses and correspondences, particularly in the crane and paint bottle examples.
- The presentation lacks detailed analyses, such as the contribution of each key component and robustness to noisy inputs or variations in instance counts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis section by including quantitative ablation studies to outline the contribution of each key component, such as the six loss terms and rotation-aware data augmentation. Additionally, we suggest exploring the robustness of the method to real-world data with non-identical duplicates and varying object structures. Addressing the potential segmentation errors, especially with glossy and specular objects, would also enhance the paper's strength. Furthermore, we recommend improving the visualizations by rendering full 3D models from various viewpoints instead of only input views to provide clearer insights into the reconstruction quality. Including numerical evaluations of pose and geometry, such as angle deviations of normals, would substantiate claims of pose improvement. Clarifying the implementation of instance variations and providing a list of rotation angles for each instance could enhance understanding of correspondences. Finally, addressing the initial noisy poses and their origins in more detail would strengthen the paper's contributions.
