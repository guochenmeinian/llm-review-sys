### Key Points
This paper presents the Mask-Based Membership Inference Attacks (MBA) framework aimed at enhancing Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. The authors propose a method that masks specific words in a target document, prompting the RAG system to predict these masked words, thereby inferring membership based on prediction accuracy. The evaluations across three public QA datasets indicate that MBA achieves approximately 50% ROC AUC, outperforming existing state-of-the-art MIAs against RAG.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a new attack vector in MIA utilizing masking techniques is innovative.
- The method demonstrates good performance with the chosen datasets, showing significant improvements over baseline models.
- The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations and comprehensive experimental results.

Weaknesses:
- The threat model is insufficiently described, lacking depth in discussing the effectiveness of MBA across different RAG implementations.
- There is a notable absence of discussions on potential mitigations and the efficiency of the MBA method.
- The experiments do not address the robustness of the MBA against various RAG defense strategies or the impact of different proxy language models on performance.
- The reliance on hyperparameters, such as M and \(\gamma\), may hinder performance for adversaries with limited prior knowledge.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the description of the threat model to clarify how MBA interacts with various RAG implementations and retrieval strategies. Additionally, including discussions on potential mitigations for the attack would enhance the paper's depth. We suggest conducting experiments to evaluate the efficiency of MBA compared to other MIAs and exploring the relationship between document size and attack effectiveness. Furthermore, clarifying the impact of different proxy language models on the masking strategy and providing a more comprehensive evaluation, including false positive rates, would strengthen the findings. Lastly, addressing the clarity of certain sections and ensuring access to the source code would improve the overall quality of the paper.
