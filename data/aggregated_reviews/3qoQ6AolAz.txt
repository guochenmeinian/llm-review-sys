Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Mars, an interactive environment designed to benchmark and enhance models' capabilities in situated inductive reasoning. Mars modifies the Crafter game by altering terrain, survival settings, and task dependencies, creating a challenging context for agents to derive rules and make decisions. The authors evaluate various reinforcement learning (RL) and large language model (LLM) methods, including a novel approach called Induction from Reflection (IfR), which shows improved performance in this complex environment. The main contributions include advancing situated inductive reasoning, providing a unique testbed for model evaluation, and fostering the development of adaptive AI systems. Additionally, the authors respond comprehensively to reviewer comments by incorporating suggested baselines utilizing LLMs for reward design, conducting further experiments with the LLaMA-3.1-8B-instruct model, and clarifying the use of few-shot demonstrations for inductive reasoning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Mars serves as a novel and challenging environment for studying situated inductive reasoning, offering a valuable testbed for evaluating machine intelligence.
- The paper effectively addresses the complexities of situated inductive reasoning, emphasizing the need for dynamic understanding in various contexts.
- The exploration of Induction from Reflection demonstrates the potential for reflective thinking to enhance inductive reasoning capabilities.
- The authors effectively incorporated reviewer feedback, enhancing the paper's robustness.
- Additional experiments and clarifications demonstrate a commitment to addressing concerns.

Weaknesses:
- The modifications to the environment may lead to counter-commonsense scenarios that could confuse LLMs, making it difficult for them to reconcile internal knowledge with new rules.
- The experimental results do not clearly identify the sources of challenges faced by models, raising questions about whether difficulties stem from inductive reasoning limitations or the complexity of the environment.
- Some implementation details and data statistics are lacking, such as hyperparameter settings and dataset statistics.
- Some reviewers did not express new concerns, indicating potential areas for deeper exploration or clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the benchmark by curating it to include real-world rules with contradictions, allowing LLMs to function as agents in the new environment. This would yield more practical insights for designing inductive agents. Additionally, further discussions on the sources of challenges in the experiments would enhance understanding, and conducting manual checks on sampled cases could justify observed difficulties. We also suggest providing detailed hyperparameter settings and dataset statistics, particularly regarding the conversion of visual signals into text for LLM processing. Finally, consider including emerging methods for reward design as baselines in the experiments to broaden the evaluation scope and improve the depth of discussion regarding the implications of their findings while addressing any remaining ambiguities in the methodology to further strengthen the paper.
