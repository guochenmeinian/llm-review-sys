Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the uncertainty-perception trade-off in generative models, particularly relating to the fidelity-naturalness trade-off in image restoration. The authors define an uncertainty-perception (UP) function and demonstrate that it is globally lower-bounded by inherent uncertainty, establishing that perfect perceptual quality necessitates at least double the inherent uncertainty. The theoretical framework connects uncertainty with mean squared error (MSE), resembling the perception-distortion trade-off, and is empirically validated through experiments with image super-resolution algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- This is a timely theoretical analysis addressing the hallucination phenomenon prevalent in generative models.
- The proposed framework aids practitioners in understanding the trade-off between uncertainty and perceptual quality, facilitating model tuning for safety-sensitive applications.
- The writing is clear, and detailed proofs are provided, enhancing the paper's credibility.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on full-reference image quality metrics (LPIPS, MSE, PSNR, SSIM) may not be ideal; adopting no-reference metrics could be more appropriate for quantifying perception.
- The experimental section is relatively weak, lacking sufficient quantitative examples and visual results, particularly in demonstrating hallucinations.
- The theoretical analysis does not sufficiently address practical applications or the challenges of estimating high-dimensional entropy in real-world scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including more quantitative examples and visual results that illustrate hallucinations, particularly in Figure 5. Additionally, we suggest exploring the application of the proposed method to other restoration tasks beyond image super-resolution and incorporating experiments on diverse, real-world datasets. The authors should also elaborate on the practical estimation methods for computing divergence and uncertainty, addressing the challenges associated with high-dimensional data. Finally, providing intuitive explanations for the theoretical concepts, such as the conditional convergence measurement for perception, would enhance reader comprehension.
