Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents RecPiece, a novel anchor-based knowledge graph embedding (KGE) model that utilizes a relational clustering-based strategy to select representative anchors. The method clusters features of factual triplets rather than entities, using the number of relation types as the cluster count. Extensive experiments on link prediction and entity classification demonstrate that RecPiece achieves superior performance with comparable or fewer parameters than previous models like NodePiece, highlighting its efficiency and scalability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The relational clustering-based anchor selection strategy is novel and effectively leverages the representative ability of cluster centroids and the descriptive ability of relation types.
2. RecPiece is tailored to the characteristics of knowledge graphs, enhancing its suitability for this data type.
3. The extensive experiments across multiple datasets showcase the model's effectiveness, efficiency, scalability, and transferability, with notable improvements in metrics such as MRR and Hits@10.
4. RecPiece serves as a simple, plug-and-play module that can be integrated with various KGE models to reduce space complexity without significant performance loss.

Weaknesses:
1. Despite promising results, RecPiece exhibits some performance loss compared to non-anchor-based KGE models on certain datasets, warranting a theoretical analysis of this performance gap.
2. The paper should address writing mistakes and improve clarity by breaking long paragraphs and unifying reference formats.
3. The experimental settings lack detailed descriptions of compared baselines and evaluation metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors provide a more thorough explanation of the compared baselines in the experimental settings to enhance reader understanding. Additionally, we suggest discussing the potential integration of LLM-based models to enhance the proposed strategy. It would also be beneficial to explore the impact of clustering algorithms on RecPiece's performance and consider the use of multi-modal information during feature preparation.
