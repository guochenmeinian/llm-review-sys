Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an empirical study on the reliability and transitivity of the Elo rating system in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors conduct experiments using both simulated data and real-world scenarios, suggesting specific parameter setting guidelines to stabilize evaluation results. The findings indicate that Elo ratings are sensitive to the order of comparisons and hyperparameter choices, particularly the K-factor, impacting the reliability of model rankings. The authors provide empirical guidelines for robust Elo-based evaluations, emphasizing the importance of multiple match permutations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a comprehensive experimental analysis of the Elo rating system's applicability to LLMs, providing valuable insights for future research.
- It effectively explores the influence of various factors on Elo rating results, including sequence arrangements, the number of games, K-factor, and win rates.
- The combination of synthetic and real-world data enhances the reliability of the findings.

Weaknesses:
- The study is limited to experiments with only three models, which restricts the generalizability of the conclusions.
- The presentation is criticized for being unclear and messy, making it difficult for readers unfamiliar with the Elo rating system to understand the content.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by including a more detailed explanation of the Elo rating system and the K-factor in the main text, rather than relegating them to the appendix. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments with a larger number of models and match permutations to enhance the robustness of the findings. Clarifying the results related to K-factor and ensuring consistency in terminology, such as using "game orders" instead of "permutations," would also benefit the paper. Finally, addressing the readability issues through thorough proofreading and restructuring would significantly enhance the paper's overall quality.
