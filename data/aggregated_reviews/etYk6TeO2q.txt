Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for causal discovery in multivariate time series data sampled at constant skips, proposing a non-parametric constraint-based algorithm that leverages proxy variables to mitigate biases from hidden variables. The authors demonstrate the theoretical advantages of their approach and provide experimental results showing improved performance over existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The contribution is clear, with a novel approach to causal discovery that addresses significant challenges in subsampled time series data.  
- The methodology is well-formulated, with rigorous theoretical foundations and clear explanations.  
- The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with effective experimental validation.

Weaknesses:  
- There is insufficient discussion of competing methods for causality under subsampling, particularly regarding the current state of the art and how the proposed method compares.  
- The assumptions made, such as the one-step window and faithfulness, may be too strong and limit the applicability of the method.  
- The paper could benefit from a larger-scale experimental evaluation and a clearer explanation of the algorithm's scalability and the implications of selecting invalid proxy variables.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on previous work by explicitly comparing their method with competing approaches in the context of subsampling. Additionally, consider addressing the limitations of the assumptions made, particularly regarding higher-order Markovian effects and the implications of non-self-caused variables. It would also be beneficial to include larger-scale experiments to demonstrate the method's effectiveness in denser causal graphs. Finally, clarify the algorithm's steps, particularly in testing conditional independence, and ensure that all necessary assumptions are transparently discussed.
