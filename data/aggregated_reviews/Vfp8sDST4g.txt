### Key Points
This paper presents a method for estimating the precision matrix of Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) constrained by the multivariate totally positive of order two (MTP2) condition, as well as a method for graph-based clustering of indexed time series data using MTP2 GGMs. The authors propose a bridge-block decomposition approach, which allows the optimization problem to be divided into smaller subproblems, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. They clarify that their approach involves 46 observations over 24,000 time points and extends the understanding of closed-form solutions beyond acyclic graphs, emphasizing applicability to non-acyclic graphs. The authors acknowledge the temporal correlation in their data, consisting of satellite images captured at five-day intervals, and assert that their findings reveal significant conditional dependencies among different crop types. The paper also provides closed-form solutions for the elements of the precision matrix corresponding to bridges and demonstrates the method's effectiveness through numerical experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The bridge-block decomposition framework is a novel contribution that could reduce computational and memory costs significantly.
- The authors provide a clear clarification of the data structure and methodology, enhancing the manuscript's precision.
- The proposed decomposed approach for non-acyclic graphs offers broader applicability than existing methods.
- The paper provides a clear structural theorem and closed-form solutions, which are beneficial for practical applications.
- Experimental results indicate promising computational performance and valuable insights into conditional dependencies among crops.

Weaknesses:  
- The presentation could be improved, as some concepts are not clearly articulated, leading to confusion about the methodology.
- The assumption of known threshold graphs and the regularization matrix $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ may limit the applicability of the proposed method; the paper does not adequately address scenarios where the graph structure is unknown or the regularization matrix is not known.
- The choice of datasets, particularly the crop image data, raises questions about the appropriateness of the MTP2 constraint and the interpretation of results.
- The manuscript could benefit from a more detailed interpretation of the real data analysis results, particularly regarding the implications of the estimated graph.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by adding more detailed explanations of the bridge-block decomposition and its role in the proof. Additionally, it would be beneficial to discuss the implications of using known versus unknown graph structures and to provide insights into the robustness of the proposed methods under noisy conditions. We suggest that the authors clarify the rationale for using specific datasets, particularly the crop image data, and provide a more thorough interpretation of the conditional dependency structures derived from their analysis. Incorporating color labels in Figure 6(a) would enhance the visual representation of the findings. Lastly, addressing the assumption regarding the regularization matrix $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ with practical computation methods, such as those proposed by Nie et al. (2016), would strengthen the manuscript.
