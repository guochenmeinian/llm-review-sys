### Key Points
This paper presents a tuning-free rule accumulation framework (TRAN) that enables LLMs to generate rules from their mistakes, guiding future predictions. The framework allows LLMs to autonomously manage and maintain a collection of rules, enhancing efficiency and performance across various scenarios, particularly in multi-choice question answering and text classification tasks. The experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements, with a focus on online learning and rule maintenance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed framework effectively prevents frozen LLMs from repeating mistakes by allowing them to generate and utilize rules based on past errors.
- The experiments are comprehensive, evaluating the method in both online and conventional settings, and considering cross-domain scenarios.
- The paper is well-written and presents a novel approach to guiding LLMs in correcting predictions.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental setup lacks clarity, particularly regarding the online rule accumulation on the test set and the implementation of baselines like CoT and few-shot learning.
- The evaluation is limited to multi-choice QA and text classification tasks, raising questions about the framework's applicability to other tasks, such as decision-making or long-form responses.
- There is insufficient analysis of the frequency and quality of the generated rules, including potential incorrect rules that could negatively impact performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental setup, particularly regarding the online rule accumulation process and the implementation details of the baselines. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include a broader range of tasks in the evaluation to demonstrate the framework's generalizability. We also suggest providing more examples and analysis of the generated rules to assess their effectiveness and potential drawbacks.
