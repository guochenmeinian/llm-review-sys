### Key Points
This paper presents a topic entity-aware method for language model pretraining, aiming to enhance entity and relation representations by integrating topic entities from Wikipedia pages. The authors propose a fusion method and a topic-entity-aware contrastive loss to achieve this. The framework, named Knowledge-Enhanced Pre-trained LanguagE model with Topic entity awareness (KEPLET), systematically analyzes the impact of topic entities on existing knowledge-enhanced pre-trained language models (KEPLMs) and introduces an entity fusion module.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors identify the importance of topic entities in improving language model pretraining, which is a novel contribution not addressed in previous work.
- The proposed model is thoroughly evaluated, demonstrating improvements on state-of-the-art performance across several entity-centric benchmarks.
- The paper is well-written, with clear explanations and strong arguments supporting the model design.

Weaknesses:
- The improvements reported are minimal and lack statistical significance, making it difficult to assert that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods.
- The motivation for the inclusion of topic entities appears weak, as the contribution seems incremental rather than groundbreaking.
- The complexity of the training phase due to the contrastive loss does not yield a corresponding performance benefit, raising questions about the cost-benefit ratio.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the added pre-training overhead and its implications for performance. Additionally, please include the ablation studies for LUKE-base+KEPLET without Entity Identification and LUKE-base+KEPLET without Entity Fusion in the main draft. Finally, we urge the authors to address the missing references highlighted by reviewers to strengthen the paper's foundation.
