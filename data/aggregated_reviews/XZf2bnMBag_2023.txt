### Key Points
This paper presents a synthetic financial transaction dataset generator and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) datasets, addressing challenges associated with money laundering by providing realistic benchmarks for training machine learning models. The authors propose an improved methodology that incorporates sophisticated settings for simulating agent interactions, enhancing the realism of the generated data. The datasets offer complete ground truth labels for laundering activities, facilitating effective model training and evaluation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The addressed problem is significant and relevant to real-world challenges.  
2. The paper is well-written and clearly presented, contributing to its overall cohesiveness.  
3. The transaction generation process is realistic and closely matches actual transactions.  
4. The proposed IT-AML generator utilizes advanced algorithmic design, establishing a potential new standard for AML tools.  
5. The publicly available datasets on Kaggle encourage collaboration and further research in AML detection.  

Weaknesses:  
1. Ethical implications arise from the potential for the synthetic data to incentivize new money laundering schemes.  
2. The research aspects are limited, lacking clarity on the specific research questions that can be investigated using the generated datasets.  
3. Concerns exist regarding the reliability of the shared dataset as a benchmark, particularly in relation to the stability and consistency of the generated data.  
4. The paper does not adequately address discrepancies between model performance on synthetic versus real data, nor does it provide a comprehensive evaluation of various metrics for comparing AML models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the ethical implications of their work, particularly regarding the potential misuse of synthetic data for illegal purposes. Additionally, the authors should provide a more comprehensive examination of the dataset's reliability, including insights into validation procedures, stability, and sensitivity analyses. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors address potential discrepancies between model performance on synthetic and real data and include more state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in their evaluation of GNN-based models to strengthen the validity of their approach.
