### Key Points
This paper presents ZSCLR, a novel method that integrates logic rules into zero-shot image classification, utilizing a visual perception module composed of CNN and attention networks. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and focuses on extracting discriminative features through a logic adapter that refines image features via rule prompts and evidence lower bounds.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.
- It effectively focuses on discriminative features.
- The structure of the paper is clear, with a well-defined methodology and adequate illustrations.

Weaknesses:
- The relevance of the work to the conference track needs clarification.
- Figures 2 and 3 lack a unified style, with overly complex color schemes and excessive text in Figure 2, hindering readability.
- Section 3 is not concise, requiring multiple readings to understand key terms like "pr1" and "pr2," which need clear definitions.
- The analysis of performance differences in Table 3 is insufficient, particularly regarding why ZSCLR underperforms compared to GZSL(S) and other methods.
- The paper includes only one ablation study, which is inadequate for validating the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the relevance of their work to the conference track. Additionally, we suggest unifying the styles of Figures 2 and 3, simplifying their color schemes, and reducing text in Figure 2 for better readability. It would be beneficial to place tables and figures closer to their text descriptions and to enhance the clarity of Section 3. The authors should provide a detailed analysis of the performance differences noted in Table 3, explaining ZSCLR's lower performance relative to GZSL(S) and other methods. Expanding the ablation study with additional experiments will also strengthen the validity of the claimed findings. Lastly, addressing the clarity of attribute labels and the dataset annotation process will improve the overall comprehensibility of the paper.
