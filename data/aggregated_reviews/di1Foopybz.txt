### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to implicit hate speech detection in social media conversational contexts by incorporating the authorâ€™s historical context, social context, and conversational context. The authors propose the CoSyn model, which is evaluated against six datasets, demonstrating performance improvements over baseline methods. The paper also extends the annotation scheme for these datasets through crowdsourcing, which could serve as a valuable resource for future research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed architecture, CoSyn, is technically sound and outperforms baselines across six datasets.  
- The paper is well-written, with a clear problem definition and transparent methodology, contributing to reproducibility.  
- The qualitative analysis provides interesting interpretations of the results.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper is difficult to follow, with unclear motivations for certain design choices, such as the use of Fourier transforms.  
- The novelty of using conversation trees and hyperbolic learning is questionable, as similar approaches exist in recent literature.  
- There is a lack of an error analysis section, which is critical for understanding model failures. Additionally, concerns about the quality of crowdsourced annotations are raised.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing a more detailed explanation of the motivations behind the proposed model and the use of Fourier transforms. Additionally, including an error analysis section with examples of systematic failures for both explicit and implicit hate speech would enhance the paper's impact. An analysis of the computational complexity of the CoSyn model compared to baselines should also be included to address concerns regarding potential computational overload.
