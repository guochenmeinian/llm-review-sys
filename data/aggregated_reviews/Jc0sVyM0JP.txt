### Key Points
This paper presents ParsingDST, a novel In-Context Learning (ICL) method for zero-shot Dialogue State Tracking (DST) that reformulates DST as a text-to-JSON task. The authors propose new state-updating strategies following the text-to-JSON conversion, which allows for manual updates. The paper claims to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MultiWOZ 2.1 benchmark, although concerns about the dataset's annotation quality are raised.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces an interesting and useful method with strong performance, supported by a detailed ablation study and case studies that provide insights into its effectiveness.
- The architecture of the model is well-defined, and the writing is coherent and easy to understand.

Weaknesses:
- Evaluation is limited to MultiWOZ 2.1, which is known for noisy annotations, and the paper lacks depth in explaining data preprocessing and evaluation methods.
- Some technical claims are not sufficiently supported, and the methodological section could benefit from clearer exposition.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 2.4, specifically distinguishing between LLM and rule-based functions. Additionally, we suggest expanding on the updating strategy and data preprocessing details, potentially adding a dedicated section in the appendix. Finally, releasing the code would facilitate further research and application of this work.
