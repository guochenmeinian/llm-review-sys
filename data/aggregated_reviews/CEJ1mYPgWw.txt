Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel prompting method called Visualization-of-Thought (VoT) aimed at enhancing the spatial reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). VoT prompts LLMs to visualize their reasoning processes, inspired by human cognitive abilities, and is evaluated across three spatial reasoning tasks: natural language navigation, visual navigation, and visual tiling. The authors demonstrate that VoT significantly improves performance compared to Chain-of-Thought prompting and other variations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of VoT represents a significant advancement in eliciting spatial reasoning in LLMs, an area that has been relatively unexplored.
- The paper is well-structured, balancing necessary details in the main text with extensive supplementary information, and provides robust evidence of VoT’s effectiveness through well-conducted experiments.
- The consideration of openly available models enhances the study’s reproducibility, and the authors provide a thorough discussion of results and limitations.

Weaknesses:
- The tasks used to evaluate spatial reasoning capabilities may be relatively simple compared to real-world challenges, which could limit the generalizability of the findings.
- Some descriptions, such as the definition of the visuospatial sketchpad and the nature of visualizations, are unclear and require further explanation.
- The effectiveness of VoT appears sensitive to specific prompt wording, which may limit its robustness in practical applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of descriptions regarding the visuospatial sketchpad and the nature of visualizations, specifying whether they are text or image outputs. Additionally, we suggest including more complex and varied real-world spatial reasoning tasks to better evaluate the generalizability of VoT. It would also be beneficial to investigate ways to reduce the sensitivity of VoT to specific prompt wording, enhancing its robustness for practical use.
