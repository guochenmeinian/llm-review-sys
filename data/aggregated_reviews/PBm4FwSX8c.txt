### Key Points
This paper presents InArt, a framework designed to enhance distributed training (DT) through in-network aggregation (INA) and routing selection in a multi-parameter server (PS) architecture. The authors formulate a constrained programming problem that incorporates model splitting, dynamic traffic, and resource constraints, aiming to optimize the gradient sending rate. The proposed two-phase approach includes a Lagrange multiplier-based algorithm for model splitting and a randomized rounding-based algorithm for INA and routing. Evaluation results demonstrate that InArt can reduce communication time by 49% compared to state-of-the-art solutions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The manuscript effectively extends existing work on distributed training with practical network applications.
- It is the first to apply INA with routing selection in a multi-PS architecture.
- The introduction and motivation sections are well-written and clear.
- Extensive evaluation on both hardware and software platforms supports the claims made.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical novelty is limited, with many solutions inherited from prior works.
- Claims regarding performance improvements are not consistently supported by experimental results.
- The evaluation lacks a simulation study for varying numbers of PSs.
- Some mathematical symbols and equations are introduced without adequate prior explanation, leading to confusion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by addressing the overhead and accuracy loss introduced by programmable switches. Additionally, please provide a detailed description of the model splitting process and clarify the specific roles of P4 in the implementation. Including an analysis of the accuracy loss due to INA would strengthen the paper. We also suggest revising the presentation of formulas to enhance clarity, as some are not essential and complicate the narrative. Finally, consider including a table summarizing all parameters for reference and discussing the feasibility of arbitrary model splits in real applications.
