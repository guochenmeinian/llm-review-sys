Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to offline policy adaptation in multi-agent games, addressing the challenges of distributional shift and risk-free deviation. The authors propose a new learning objective called conservative offline adaptation and introduce the Constrained Self-Play (CSP) algorithm, which trains an adaptation policy and a proxy model with regularizations. The paper provides theoretical proof of CSP's effectiveness and demonstrates its superiority over non-conservative methods through empirical evaluations in various environments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The specific problem of offline policy adaptation is meaningful and has a wide range of potential applications.
2. The paper is well-written, easy to follow, and includes comprehensive background and related work sections.
3. The proposed solution is supported by theoretical results and extensive experimental validation.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the offline policy adaptation problem may be limited, as it resembles existing opponent modeling problems.
2. The theoretical analysis lacks clarity and connection to the CSP algorithm, with overstatements regarding its risk-free nature.
3. The paper does not address the computational and time costs associated with offline adaptation.
4. The term "risk-free" is used ambiguously and requires clearer definition or examples.
5. Ethical concerns related to human-AI interaction are not adequately discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the theoretical analysis and its connection to the CSP algorithm. Additionally, we suggest including comparative experiments to highlight the differences between offline adaptation and opponent modeling. It would be beneficial to provide a more specific description of what "risk" entails in the context of the paper, along with examples. Finally, addressing the ethical implications of the proposed approach would enhance the paper's comprehensiveness.
