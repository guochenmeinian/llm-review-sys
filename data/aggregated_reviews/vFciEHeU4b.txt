**Key Points:**
The paper introduces a novel metric for evaluating 3D cameras, specifically tailored for robotic and autonomous driving applications focused on collision avoidance. This metric assesses the camera's effectiveness in facilitating safe navigation, addressing a significant gap in existing evaluation methods that often overlook real-world performance.

**Strengths and Weaknesses:**
Strengths include the application-oriented nature of the Collision Avoidance metric, which enhances the evaluation of 3D cameras by focusing on their primary function of ensuring safe robot operation. It effectively identifies optimal tolerances for collision detection and offers clear interpretability regarding false positives and negatives. The comprehensive evaluation against various 3D sensors and stereo camera baselines showcases the metric's effectiveness and versatility. However, weaknesses include the need for a more formal mathematical formulation and justification of the metric, a deeper analysis of input parameter impacts on rankings, and a comparative analysis with other application-specific metrics in the literature.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
We suggest enhancing the paper by providing a more formal mathematical formulation and justification of the metric. Additionally, a more detailed analysis of how input parameters, such as gripper size and tolerance values, affect final rankings would be beneficial. Finally, including comparisons to other application-specific metrics could offer valuable context and insights.
