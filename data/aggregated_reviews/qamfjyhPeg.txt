Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel test-time adaptation method utilizing martingales and online learning to detect when testing samples require adaptation based on sequential entropy values. If adaptation is necessary, a pseudo-entropy value is computed. The authors propose a framework that aligns test entropy values with those of the source domain, demonstrating improved accuracy and calibration under distribution shifts compared to traditional entropy minimization methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The replacement of entropy minimization with entropy matching is an intriguing approach, leading to natural proposals for online drift detection and model adaptation.
2. The integration of betting martingales in test-time adaptation is a novel and interesting direction.
3. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations and rich visualizations.

Weaknesses:
1. The experimental validation is limited, focusing solely on the ImageNet-C dataset and neglecting other datasets like CIFAR10-C and CIFAR100-C, which would provide a broader understanding of the method's performance.
2. The use of the term "domain adaptation" may cause confusion, as it traditionally implies multiple epochs and separate training/testing samples, which does not align with the test-time adaptation context.
3. The requirement to calculate the source CDF introduces computational overhead and potential privacy concerns, which have not been adequately addressed.
4. The paper lacks a sensitivity study and does not compare its results with state-of-the-art TTA baselines.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including results on additional datasets such as CIFAR10-C and CIFAR100-C to enhance the robustness of their findings. A clearer distinction between test-time adaptation and domain adaptation terminology should be established to avoid misinterpretation. Additionally, the authors should discuss the computational implications of calculating the source CDF and propose solutions to mitigate privacy concerns. Including a sensitivity study and comparisons with state-of-the-art TTA methods would further strengthen the paper's contributions.
