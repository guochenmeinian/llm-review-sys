### Key Points
This paper presents an algorithm for discovering implicit concepts in taxonomies using deep learning methods. The authors propose a three-step approach: clustering, generating new concepts, and locating them within taxonomies. The results demonstrate positive performance compared to existing methods and ChatGPT. However, the applicability of the method is limited, as it primarily targets e-commerce datasets and focuses on second-layer concepts in taxonomies. The experiments mainly evaluate the re-discovery of artificially hidden concepts rather than the discovery of genuinely new concepts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with clear technical achievements and a solid structure.
- The combination of different learning models is innovative and relevant to the field.
- The motivating examples and related work are effectively presented.

Weaknesses:
- The limitations of applicability are not clearly defined, particularly regarding the focus on e-commerce datasets and second-layer concepts.
- The claim of discovering implicit concepts is questionable, as the experiments primarily validate the re-discovery of existing concepts.
- There is a lack of references to source code or datasets for reproducibility, and the definition of "implicit concepts" is not formally established.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the limitations regarding the applicability of their method beyond e-commerce datasets. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a formal definition of "implicit concepts" and clarify the rationale behind their approach, especially for the first subtask of implicit concept discovery. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include references to source code and datasets to enhance reproducibility. Lastly, we recommend a more substantial critique of related work to highlight the novelty and advantages of their approach.
