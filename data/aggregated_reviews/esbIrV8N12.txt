### Key Points
This paper presents an empirical study assessing MathBoard's effectiveness in enhancing learner engagement and social constructivism among pre-service teachers, demonstrating significant improvements over traditional text-only methods. The authors propose a novel integration of large language models (LLMs) with Board Writing (BW) in a cross-modal system tailored for elementary-level math education. The methodology is well-articulated, particularly regarding cross-modal interaction, although the study is limited to a small sample size of 34 participants, which may affect generalizability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The multimodal approach enhances social construction of knowledge and learner engagement.
- The integration of verbal and visual teaching with generative AI is innovative.
- The framework is grounded in Schema Theory, supporting scalability and adaptability for real teaching scenarios.
- The study provides quantitative evidence of significant improvements in engagement and social constructivism.

Weaknesses:
- The limited scope to elementary mathematics restricts broader applicability.
- The small and homogeneous sample size limits generalizability.
- Some sections, such as related work and experimental design, are insufficiently explained.
- There is a lack of discussion on data privacy and ethical implications related to LLM use in education.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental setup and main findings to enhance understanding. Additionally, addressing the limitations of the sample size and scope would strengthen the paper's impact. We suggest including a section on related work to contextualize the study within existing literature on LLMs in education. Furthermore, a more thorough explanation of the multi-agent system's architecture and synchronization algorithms is necessary for reproducibility. Lastly, discussing the long-term implications and ethical considerations of using LLMs in educational settings would provide a more comprehensive perspective.
