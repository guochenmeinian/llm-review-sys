Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents FABind, a novel end-to-end model for protein-ligand docking that integrates pocket prediction and docking processes. The authors propose a regression-based approach that enhances prediction accuracy and inference speed. FABind employs a learned equivariant representation of proteins and ligands, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods like DiffDock and TANKBind, particularly in blind docking scenarios. The model's architecture includes components such as independent message passing, cross attention updates, and interfacial message passing. Additionally, the authors utilize the native docking structure as a ground-truth label during training, allowing the model to predict pockets directly during inference. The method effectively handles multiple binding sites by considering both protein and ligand information, facilitating unique ligand-pocket pairs. The authors acknowledge the importance of allosteric binding sites in drug discovery and plan to incorporate this perspective in future work.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The integration of pocket prediction and docking in a single model is a significant advancement.
2. Empirical tests indicate that FABind outperforms several alternatives in terms of speed and accuracy.
3. The model exhibits significant speed and performance in pocket prediction and docking.
4. The ability to handle multiple binding sites and configurations is a notable feature.
5. The authors provide a clear explanation of the performance differences between FABind and FABind + SMINA, attributing it to the compatibility of their integrated approach.

Weaknesses:
1. Clarity issues exist in the method section, particularly regarding the initialization of ligand positions and the relationship between pocket prediction and docking phases.
2. The model's reliance on a regressive approach may lead to challenges in scenarios with symmetric binding pockets or multiple binding sites, which are common in real-world applications.
3. Claims regarding performance improvements and efficiency need to be substantiated, as some results appear comparable or inferior to existing methods.
4. The method currently relies on rigid protein structures, which may limit performance when there are significant differences between holo and apo forms.
5. There is a lack of exploration regarding allosteric binding sites, which are crucial in drug discovery.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method section, specifically detailing how ligand positions are initialized and how the pocket and docking phases interact. Additionally, addressing the limitations of the regressive approach in handling symmetric pockets and multiple binding sites is crucial. We suggest that the authors provide a more thorough explanation of the hyperparameter selection process and clarify discrepancies in baseline performance metrics. Introducing the apo-structure during training as a form of data augmentation could enhance generalization. Furthermore, modeling the protein in a flexible manner during docking could accommodate structural changes, improving accuracy for both holo- and apo-structures. Lastly, further exploration of allosteric binding sites should be prioritized in future research, as they are important in drug discovery. Including documentation for the provided code is essential for reproducibility.
