Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies distributed mean estimation under privacy and communication constraints, focusing on the characterization of the recently defined notion of $f$-DP for communication-efficient mechanisms, which can be converted to the standard $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP. The authors analyze the $f$-DP of various known mechanisms and propose a new algorithm called ternary compression. The paper claims that this mechanism optimizes communication and privacy through sparsification, allowing local users to send fewer messages while maintaining privacy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The investigation of distributed mean estimation is relevant, particularly in federated learning contexts.
- The paper is well-written and presents a clear motivation for considering communication efficiency, privacy, and accuracy together.

Weaknesses:
- The contributions of the paper are limited; the analysis of $f$-DP for known mechanisms lacks novelty and does not provide new insights.
- The proposed ternary compression mechanism is not novel, as it resembles existing coordinate sampling and quantization methods.
- The expressions for $f$-DP are not in closed form and may be computationally expensive for large parameters.
- The paper does not adequately clarify the claimed advantages of the ternary mechanism over existing methods, particularly regarding the trade-offs between privacy, communication, and accuracy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their contributions by providing clearer insights into the challenges and implications of their analysis of $f$-DP. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the uniqueness of the ternary compression mechanism compared to existing methods and provide a more detailed comparison of the privacy-utility trade-offs. It would also be beneficial to include closed-form expressions for $f$-DP and discuss the computational feasibility of these expressions. Finally, addressing the questions raised regarding the open problems and trade-offs in the paper would enhance clarity and depth.
