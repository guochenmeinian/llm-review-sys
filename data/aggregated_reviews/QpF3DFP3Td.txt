Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Archaeoscape, a large-scale open-source dataset designed for analyzing airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, covering 888 kmÂ² in Cambodia with 31,141 annotated archaeological features. It is the first open-access ALS archaeology dataset and establishes a benchmark for semantic segmentation using various modern deep learning models. The authors aim to promote open-access policies in archaeology while addressing challenges related to data misuse. Additionally, the authors propose using macro-average IoU for evaluation, which is deemed standard and appropriate, countering concerns about potential bias from weighting by class size. They acknowledge the challenge of modifying class imbalance in the training set, which could be an interesting area for future exploration.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is the first open-access and high-resolution ALS archaeology dataset, significantly larger than previous datasets.
- It includes a solid set of benchmark experiments with comprehensive analysis.
- The paper is well-written, clear, and features informative figures and tables.
- Efforts have been made to prevent data misuse through a custom license and removal of georeferencing information.
- Valuable dataset contribution and well-conducted experiments.
- Appropriate choice of macro-average IoU for evaluation.

Weaknesses:
- The benchmarking and experimental evaluations are insufficient, lacking thorough testing and reproducibility.
- The claims regarding the importance of context in archaeological feature recognition are not adequately substantiated by results.
- The generalizability of findings is unclear, as the dataset focuses solely on Khmer archaeology.
- The choice of error metrics is not well-justified, potentially skewing results.
- Difficulty in modifying class imbalance in the training set.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the benchmarking by conducting additional ablation studies, particularly on the impact of pre-training on model performance. Furthermore, the authors should elaborate on how to leverage the dataset's structure to enhance performance and explore the integration of multi-source data from LiDAR and RGB channels more comprehensively. Additionally, clarifying the choice of error metrics and addressing class imbalance in the dataset would strengthen the evaluation. We also recommend that the authors explore the potential of modifying class imbalance in the training set, as it could provide additional insights despite the inherent challenges in a segmentation setting. Finally, providing a section on the dataloader and considering a preprocessed ML-ready format for the dataset could enhance usability.
