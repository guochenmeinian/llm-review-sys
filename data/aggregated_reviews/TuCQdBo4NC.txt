Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a robust algorithm for spiking neural networks (SNNs), introducing a frequency-domain filter and trainable neuron leakage parameters. The authors aim for biological interpretability and propose a unified framework to enhance SNN robustness against adversarial disturbances. They propose a frequency encoding (FE) method that captures varying frequency information while suppressing noise, and an evolutionary membrane potential leak factor (EL) that allows neurons to learn optimal robustness leak factors over time. The experimental results indicate improved robustness through the proposed FE and EL methods, validated across various adversarial attack types.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The authors demonstrate better robustness against disturbances, verified through various adversarial attack methods (GN, FGSM, PGD, BIM, CW).
- The theoretical framework is well-supported by empirical results, showing consistent robustness improvements.
- The FE method enhances defense accuracy while maintaining clean accuracy, validated through data observation.
- The implementation of the EL method is effectively demonstrated, contributing to state-of-the-art defense accuracy against SNN-specific attacks.
- The unified framework for SNN robustness provides insights into previous work and inspires enhancements in encoding methods and leak factors.

Weaknesses:  
- The theoretical analysis lacks significant differentiation from existing methods, particularly StoG, making the innovation unclear.
- The cognitive motivation for the FE method could benefit from a more data-driven approach.
- The implementation of FE may lead to valid information loss, raising questions about its overall benefit compared to direct coding.
- The lack of detailed ablation studies for the FE and EL methods limits understanding of their individual effectiveness.
- The robustness improvement is not consistently significant, with instances where FEEL performs worse than FE.
- There is a lack of clarity regarding the energy consumption implications of the FE method in practical applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical framework to provide a more rigorous analysis that clearly distinguishes their contributions from existing methods. Additionally, we suggest conducting a detailed ablation study to evaluate the effectiveness of the FE and EL methods individually and expanding this study to provide clearer insights into the effectiveness of each module. Clarifying the implementation details of the adversarial attacks, particularly regarding the differentiability of the FE module, would enhance the paper's clarity. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the energy consumption implications of the FE method to address potential concerns regarding its practical application.
