Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a large-scale dataset containing over 90K human sketches with varying levels of abstraction, collected from more than 5K participants. The authors propose a benchmark for evaluating the alignment between human and machine visual abstraction in sketch recognition, utilizing 17 different models. The study reveals significant insights into the differences in sketch understanding between humans and machine learning systems, particularly highlighting that none of the models closely approximated human response patterns. Additionally, the paper focuses on human sketch production and understanding, examining the impact of drawing time on sketch detail and its implications for machine learning models. The authors introduce the SEVA dataset aimed at analyzing human visual abstraction and its application in developing human-like models for better generalization in unseen data, while addressing potential overlap in participant groups across different studies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The dataset is extensive and well-structured, providing valuable resources for future research.  
2. The motivation for understanding human perception of abstraction levels is significant and relevant.  
3. The paper incorporates a comprehensive evaluation of multiple models, enhancing the understanding of their capabilities.  
4. The authors provide rigorous statistical analyses and visual evidence supporting their claims about drawing time and sketch detail.  
5. The inclusion of supplementary materials enhances transparency regarding actual drawing times across conditions.  
6. Key findings from the benchmark study are intriguing and could inspire further research in sketch recognition, articulating the relevance of human visual abstraction for advancing AI models.

Weaknesses:  
1. The rationale for the experimental design, particularly the random assignment of participants to drawing conditions, could lead to biases that affect analysis.  
2. Concerns remain regarding the influence of drawing tools on sketch abstraction levels, which could affect the validity of conclusions drawn from the dataset.  
3. The use of various input devices for sketching may introduce inconsistencies in the data.  
4. The practical applications of the dataset for training models to achieve human-like generalization are not clearly articulated, leaving questions about its broader impact.  
5. The paper lacks a thorough discussion on the societal implications and limitations of the dataset.  
6. Some references from the computer graphics community are still missing, which could enhance the completeness of the literature review.  
7. Some conclusions drawn may seem obvious, lacking deeper insights into the implications of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental design rationale, particularly regarding the random assignment of participants to drawing conditions, to address potential biases. Additionally, the authors should consider discussing the impact of different input devices on sketch quality and consistency. We suggest that the authors improve clarity on how the dataset can be utilized to train models for better generalization, providing specific examples or use cases. Furthermore, we recommend reporting conclusions based solely on data gathered using a single drawing tool to mitigate the impact of tool variability on abstraction levels. It would also be beneficial to include a more comprehensive analysis of the societal implications of the dataset and its potential biases, as well as a description of the log response time used in supplementary figures. Lastly, we encourage the authors to incorporate more references from the computer graphics community to strengthen the literature review and address the text cut-off issue in figures.
