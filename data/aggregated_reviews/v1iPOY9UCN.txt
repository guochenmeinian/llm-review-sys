### Key Points
This paper presents a multi-granularity feature fusion framework for code summarization tasks, named MGF-ESE. The framework integrates CFG, AST, token sequences, and docstring sequences, utilizing a traditional transformer architecture. The authors claim that experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MGF-ESE compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The experimental results indicate that the model performs well, particularly with CFG features, enhancing the quality of output summaries.
2. The model shows effectiveness across both Python and Java datasets, indicating broad applicability.
3. The introduction is well-structured, clearly outlining the significance and limitations of existing methods, making the content accessible.

Weaknesses:
1. The foundational model relies on BERT without incorporating advancements from contemporary large language models (LLMs).
2. There is no open-source code provided for reproducibility.
3. The approach introduces an additional embedding layer without significant innovation.
4. The paper requires thorough proofreading to clarify technical details and improve readability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the novelty regarding the exploitation of AST features compared to existing literature. Additionally, the authors should provide more details on the CFG graph generation procedure and share the source code for reproducibility. Clarifying the extraction method for AST in the Java dataset is essential. We suggest including an example input and output for the problem studied, as well as a detailed explanation of how $H_{cross\_Token}$ and $H_{cross\_AST}$ are combined in the MGF-ESE Decoder. Simplifying some introductory content could create space for more technical details, such as an illustrative example or figure. Lastly, terms like "BPE" and MGF-ESE should be defined in full upon first mention, and the authors should address the relevance of the submission to the conference track.
