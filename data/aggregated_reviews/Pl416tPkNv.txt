Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel formalization of the Neural Sampling Code (NSC) aimed at quantitatively aligning normative theory with neuronal recordings. The authors propose a framework for fitting NSC generative models directly to neuronal activity, allowing for richer models and standard metrics to evaluate different generative models. They compare classical and deep learning-based generative models on population recordings from the macaque primary visual cortex (V1) in response to natural images, claiming their framework outperforms classical models in generative and predictive performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The authors provide a clear and well-motivated study that presents a practical framework for analyzing high-dimensional neural data using NSC.  
- The comparison of classical and deep learning-based generative models offers valuable insights into their capabilities in capturing neuronal response structures.  
- The paper includes a thorough discussion of limitations and future research directions, fostering ongoing dialogue in the field.  

Weaknesses:  
- The generative models and fitting methods employed lack biological plausibility, failing to explain the underlying mechanisms of the neural system.  
- The performance of the generative model in predicting neural responses is poor compared to standard feedforward neural network models, raising questions about the effectiveness of this approach.  
- The use of latent variables (z) is controversial and seen as unnecessary by some reviewers, complicating the connection to the original NSC framework.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of mathematical notations and provide explicit explanations for key equations, particularly Eq.(1) and the terms used therein. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the role of latent variables in their model, addressing concerns about their necessity and how they relate to observable variables. It would be beneficial to explore the model's performance across different brain regions to validate the claims made. Finally, we encourage the authors to discuss how their approach can be applied in empirical experiments to enhance its relevance and practical utility.
