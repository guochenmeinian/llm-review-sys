Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SyncTREE, a graph attention network designed for predicting delay and slew in IC interconnects using a Tree Contrastive Loss. The authors claim that SyncTREE achieves lower prediction errors compared to other GNN methods across synthetic and RISC-V benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is novel, effectively leveraging prior knowledge in timing analysis, resulting in superior performance on both synthetic and RISC-V benchmarks.
- The manuscript addresses an important problem, aiming to enhance the speed of timing analysis in IC design.

Weaknesses:
- The modified aggregation mechanism's claim to preserve resistance information lacks supporting ablation studies or evidence. Additionally, the network designs introduced are not evaluated through ablation studies, raising questions about their contributions.
- The fixed layers in the trained GAT may hinder performance on deeper RC trees, limiting the propagation of timing information.
- The claim of improved accuracy on larger circuits contradicts observed trends in Figure 4(d), where prediction error worsens with circuit size, necessitating further investigation into this generalization gap.
- Runtime comparisons lack clarity regarding hardware platforms, potentially skewing comparisons between GAT and CPU-based SPICE simulations.
- The significance of the prediction error, particularly the 0.05 ps MAE, is unclear, and its impact on critical path delay or total negative slack requires discussion.
- Generalization and transfer learning aspects are insufficiently explored, particularly regarding the physics-informed loss function's role in enhancing data efficiency.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by conducting more ablation studies to validate the modified aggregation mechanism and network designs. Additionally, addressing the generalization to different circuits and enhancing discussions on data efficiency would strengthen the manuscript. Clarifying the hardware platforms used in runtime comparisons and providing explicit discussions on the significance of prediction errors in practical terms are also essential. Finally, a guideline for setting the number of hidden dimensions and layers would facilitate practical adoption of SyncTREE.
