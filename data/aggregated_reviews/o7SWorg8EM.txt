### Key Points
This paper presents a new manually annotated dataset for the entity linking task in tables, specifically targeting machine learning experimental results reported in scientific papers. The authors propose a method for automatically detecting and linking table cells, which includes four steps: extraction and typing of mentions, identification of relevant reference papers, and filtering candidate mentions for final linking. The end-to-end method reportedly outperforms the general method TURL. The dataset addresses the challenge of linking ambiguous table mentions, primarily acronyms or abbreviations, to entities defined in the Papers with Code website.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and structured, making it easy to follow.
- The dataset is large-scale and relevant for the community, setting a precedent for future dataset construction in similar tasks.
- The proposed baseline model achieves good results and provides a thorough analysis of the methods.

Weaknesses:
- There is a lack of clarity regarding the precise objectives of the task, particularly concerning the extraction of internal cell values.
- The description of the reference knowledge base (KB) is insufficient, lacking details on its components, relationships, and how they relate to table content.
- The discussion on table structure is inadequate, failing to address the dependencies between row and column meanings in complex tables.
- The inter-annotator agreement rate of 66% is below standard, and the reasons for this lack of agreement are not analyzed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the task objectives, specifically addressing whether internal cell values are extracted and linked. The paper should provide a formal description of the KB components, data types, and relationships, as well as clarify how "topics" are extracted and their relevance to the method. Additionally, the authors should discuss how complex table structures are handled in their entity linking method. An analysis of the low inter-annotator agreement rate should be included to identify potential causes, such as annotation guidelines or the complexity of the KB. Finally, we suggest revising Section 2.2 to focus more on the specific subject matter and removing irrelevant general references.
