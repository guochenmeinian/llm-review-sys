### Key Points
This paper presents a new benchmark, Wikidata5M-SI, for semi-inductive link prediction (SI-LP) in knowledge graphs (KGs), specifically targeting the prediction of facts for new, unseen entities. The dataset is derived from Wikidata5M and supports transductive, k-shot, and 0-shot link prediction tasks, allowing evaluation with varying levels of contextual information, including KG structure and textual descriptions. The authors evaluate multiple models on this benchmark and find that semi-inductive performance generally lags behind transductive performance, highlighting the need for further research in integrating context and textual information.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a significant benchmark for semi-inductive link prediction, addressing important design goals such as focusing on long-tail entities and providing a controlled experimental setting.
- It offers valuable insights into the impact of different types of contextual information on link prediction performance.
- The thorough evaluation of various state-of-the-art models contributes to understanding their effectiveness in different scenarios.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for the importance of semi-inductive link prediction is insufficiently articulated, and the distinction from existing transductive and inductive benchmarks is unclear.
- The benchmark construction lacks novelty and does not involve new techniques or methods, raising questions about its significance.
- The abstract is overly brief, failing to adequately summarize the contributions, methodology, and results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for the semi-inductive link prediction task, clarifying its significance in the broader context of knowledge graph research. Additionally, we suggest providing a stronger justification for the benchmark's novelty and importance, possibly by elaborating on the unique aspects of the dataset construction. The authors should also consider expanding the abstract to give a more comprehensive overview of the paper's contributions and findings. Finally, addressing the ambiguity in the definition of semi-inductive settings and the implications of using long-tail entities would enhance clarity.
