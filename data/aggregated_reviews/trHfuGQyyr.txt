Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Disentangled Counterfactual Learning (DCL) approach for physical audiovisual commonsense reasoning, aiming to infer objects' physics commonsense from video and audio inputs. The DCL method introduces a Disentangled Sequential Encoder and a Counterfactual Learning Module (CLM) to enhance multimodal data utilization and causal reasoning. The authors claim that the DCL method can be integrated as a plug-and-play module into various baseline models, demonstrating significant performance improvements on the PACS dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces an innovative framework for physical commonsense reasoning, with a well-designed disentangled sequential encoder and counterfactual learning module.
- The modular nature of the DCL method enhances its adaptability across different baseline approaches.
- The experimental evaluation shows significant accuracy improvements on the PACS dataset, supported by qualitative results that illustrate enhanced material reasoning performance.
- The writing is clear and accessible, effectively conveying complex ideas.

Weaknesses:
- The main experiment is limited to the PACS dataset, raising concerns about the generalizability of the DCL method to other VQA tasks and unseen data distributions.
- The ablation analysis lacks convincing evidence that performance improvements stem from the unique design of the DCL method rather than an increase in parameters; additional quantitative experiments are needed.
- The presentation of quantitative results in tables is suboptimal, and the t-SNE visualization in Figure 3 lacks distinct clusters and clarity.
- The final performance improvement over baselines is marginal, and the paper does not adequately address the robustness of the PACS dataset or the implications of using a small test set.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of the DCL method by testing it on additional VQA tasks and diverse datasets. To strengthen the ablation analysis, we suggest conducting further quantitative experiments, such as replacing the Disentangled Sequential Encoder (DSE) with a naive module to isolate performance gains. We also advise enhancing the clarity of the tables presenting quantitative results and improving the t-SNE visualization in Figure 3 to better illustrate distinct clusters. Additionally, we encourage the authors to provide concrete examples of potential tasks that could benefit from the DCL method and to clarify the reasoning behind the audio processing approach. Finally, addressing the robustness of the PACS dataset and discussing the implications of its size would strengthen the paper's contributions.
