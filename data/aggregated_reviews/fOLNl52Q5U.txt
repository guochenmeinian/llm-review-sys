Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SimVG, a transformer-based framework for visual grounding that decouples multimodal fusion from downstream tasks, utilizing a modified BEiT-3 architecture. The authors propose a dynamic weight-balance distillation (DWBD) method to enhance the lightweight MLP module's efficiency and a text-guided query generation (TQG) module to integrate text information. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method across multiple visual grounding datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Directly employing a multi-modality encoder for feature extraction simplifies the model structure.
2. The DWBD module enhances inference efficiency through distillation.
3. Competitive performance across various benchmarks indicates robustness and effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. The technical contribution appears limited, primarily building upon BEiT-3 with additional components that may complicate the architecture.
2. The writing quality needs improvement, particularly in clarity and conciseness.
3. The inference process requires clearer explanation in the main text.
4. Some comparisons in experiments are missing, such as with PolyFormer-L and OFA-L.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation and writing throughout the manuscript, addressing grammar issues and typos. Additionally, please clarify whether the model was pretrained from scratch or if existing BEiT-3 weights were utilized. It would be beneficial to include a comparison with PolyFormer-L, OFA-L, and m-PLUG in Table 3 for a fair evaluation. Lastly, a clearer explanation of the synchronous distillation process and its advantages over traditional methods would enhance understanding.
