Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel algorithm, KFNN (K-free Nearest Neighbor), aimed at enhancing label integration for crowdsourcing by adaptively determining the optimal neighborhood size for each instance based on its attributes and noisy labels. The authors propose a two-component solution involving label distribution enhancement and K-free optimization, utilizing Mahalanobis distance and a Kalman filter to mitigate noise. The theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the effectiveness and robustness of KFNN against existing algorithms in various scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The KFNN algorithm is innovative, addressing the limitations of fixed neighborhood sizes in existing methods by automatically determining optimal sizes based on instance attributes.
2. The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation and comprehensive experimental validation, demonstrating expected performance improvements across a wide range of datasets.
3. The writing quality is high, with a logical structure that facilitates understanding, supported by effective use of figures and tables.

Weaknesses:
1. There is limited discussion on the computational efficiency and scalability of KFNN; the algorithmic flow and time complexity analysis should be moved from Appendix A to the main text.
2. Some sections contain repetitive sentences and structures that need condensing, particularly Sections 5.1 and 5.2.
3. While the experiments are comprehensive, further analysis of the optimal neighborhood size determined by KFNN is needed, especially regarding its performance relative to baselines on specific datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on computational efficiency and scalability by moving the algorithmic flow and time complexity analysis to the main text. Additionally, condensing repetitive content in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 will enhance clarity. We also suggest adding a detailed analysis of the optimal neighborhood size determined by KFNN, including a discussion of its performance anomalies compared to baselines, to provide deeper insights into the algorithm's effectiveness.
