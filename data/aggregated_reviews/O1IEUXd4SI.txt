### Key Points
This paper studies the task of distinguishing synthetic texts from human-written texts, proposing that synthetic texts may lack emotional patterns present in human-written texts. The authors developed a detection model that incorporates emotion awareness by first fine-tuning on an emotion classification dataset and then on a dataset of synthetic and human-written texts. Experiments demonstrate that this additional fine-tuning improves detection performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The idea of leveraging emotional patterns to aid in the detection of synthetic texts is novel and interesting.
- The proposed method is straightforward, and the main experiments indicate that fine-tuning on an emotion classification dataset enhances detection performance.
- The authors conducted several ablation experiments to elucidate factors affecting model performance.

Weaknesses:
- There is insufficient analysis to substantiate the claim that emotion-awareness aids in detecting synthetic texts, particularly since experiments are limited to the news domain, which typically features fewer emotional expressions.
- Contradictory evidence is presented in Table 6, where certain models fine-tuned with emotion data perform worse than those without, suggesting that emotion-awareness may not be beneficial.
- The paper lacks a thorough analysis of why emotion data improves detection performance, such as whether synthetic texts simply lack emotion or contain inconsistent emotions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis supporting the main claim by conducting experiments across various domains, such as movie reviews and blog posts, where emotional expressions are more prevalent. Additionally, we suggest providing examples where predictions were corrected after fine-tuning with emotion data to clarify how emotion-awareness contributes to detection. Furthermore, addressing the statistical validation of results and including classic machine learning models as baselines would strengthen the study's robustness. Lastly, we advise the authors to carefully proofread the paper to correct grammatical errors and improve overall clarity.
