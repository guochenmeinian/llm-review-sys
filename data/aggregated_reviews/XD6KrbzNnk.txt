### Key Points
This paper presents a Hierarchical Graph Signal Processing (HiGSP) method for collaborative filtering in recommender systems. The authors propose a dual-module approach, consisting of a cluster-wise filter module that identifies unique user interaction patterns within clusters and a globally-aware filter module that captures general user interaction patterns. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of HiGSP compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The HiGSP method is innovative, addressing user interaction pattern recognition effectively.
- The manuscript provides a comprehensive literature review and extensive empirical studies, showcasing HiGSP's superiority over existing methods.
- The structure of the paper is clear, with a detailed explanation of the proposed method and promising results.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for the manuscript is unclear, lacking a clear distinction from mainstream cluster-based item collaborative filtering methods.
- The method section lacks logical coherence, with inconsistencies in the description of the clustering module's focus.
- Key details, such as the loss function and training mode, are insufficiently emphasized.
- The adaptability of the HiGSP method to evolving data and its computational complexity are not adequately discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for HiGSP, explicitly articulating its differences from existing methods. The authors should enhance the logical flow in the method section and ensure consistency in the description of the clustering module. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide more details on the loss function and training mode. To address concerns about adaptability, the authors should discuss how HiGSP can adjust to changes in user behavior over time. Finally, including hyperparameter configurations for the baselines would facilitate reproducibility of the experiments.
