Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework for deconvolving complex neuronal networks into task-specific elementary networks, termed "canonical task connectomes," using supervised non-negative matrix factorization (SupNMF). The authors tackle the challenge of identifying these networks from task-specific fMRI data, demonstrating that SupNMF can effectively predict tasks and reveal physiologically interpretable cognitive "building blocks." The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms other supervised factoring techniques in terms of prediction accuracy and interpretability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a valuable supervised decomposition method, showcasing its potential in analyzing neuronal networks.
- It provides compelling results that suggest unique markers for each task within the learnable networks, contributing to the understanding of task representation in the brain.
- The findings align well with existing physiological research, offering a solid foundation for future studies.

Weaknesses:
- The study lacks reproducibility and generalizability, as it has only been applied to a single dataset; additional datasets or resampling are needed.
- There is insufficient comparison with other supervised decomposition methods, such as Partial Least Squares regression, limiting the understanding of the proposed method's relative performance.
- The authors do not provide an in-depth analysis of the weight parameter \(\lambda\), which is crucial for balancing loss terms, leaving readers unclear about the effectiveness of supervision signals.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the reproducibility of their findings by applying the proposed method to additional datasets or resampling the existing dataset. Additionally, a comparison with other supervised decomposition methods, particularly Partial Least Squares regression, would enhance the understanding of the proposed method's effectiveness. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors conduct a sensitivity analysis regarding the weight parameter \(\lambda\) to clarify its impact on the results. Lastly, addressing the missing details on variable descriptions and providing a reference and explanation for UMAP would benefit readers unfamiliar with these concepts.
