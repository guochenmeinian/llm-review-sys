Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for calculating the Laplace approximation of the posterior of neural networks with a prior defined directly in the functional space, utilizing Gaussian processes. The authors propose a functional Laplace approximation approach that incorporates function space priors, addressing the limitations of existing weight space methods. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of this new approach in capturing epistemic uncertainty in function fitting and classification tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an important problem in Bayesian deep learning, focusing on posterior approximation and uncertainty quantification.
- The methodology is well-motivated and generally well-written, with clear notation and sufficient background information.
- Experimental results indicate that the proposed method performs well compared to standard Laplace approximations.

Weaknesses:
- The justification for Laplace approximations relies on the Bernstein-von Mises theorem, which requires specific assumptions that may not be met in practice, particularly for neural networks.
- The proofs provided, especially for Propositions 1 and 2, lack clarity and rigor, relying on external references without sufficient internal elaboration.
- Comparative experiments with various efficient Laplace approximation methods are insufficient, and the paper does not adequately address the relationship with existing works, such as Sun et al. (2019).
- The sampling strategy for context points in high-dimensional datasets may be inefficient and impractical.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and rigor of the proofs for Propositions 1 and 2 by providing detailed derivations within the manuscript. Additionally, we suggest including a more comprehensive comparison with various efficient Laplace approximation methods and addressing the relationship with Sun et al. (2019) to clarify the differences in approaches. It would also be beneficial to discuss the limitations of the context point sampling strategy, particularly in high-dimensional settings, and to confirm the numerical significance of the term mentioned in line 195.
