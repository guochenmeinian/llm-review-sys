### Key Points
This paper presents a new task and benchmark for interactive facial image editing through dialogues, introducing the ChatEdit benchmark to evaluate AI models in image editing and conversation response generation. The authors propose a model that integrates a dialogue module and an image editing module, utilizing a large-scale dataset of 12,000 images annotated from the Celeb-HQ dataset. The approach emphasizes state tracking to enhance robustness by tracking user requests throughout the dialogue history.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The large-scale benchmark and comprehensive dataset analysis provide a solid foundation for evaluating the proposed model.
- The integration of dialogue state tracking helps prevent error cascading across multiple interaction turns.

Weaknesses:
- The editable attributes are limited to only four types (expression, hair color, hair, and makeup), raising concerns about robustness with unseen attributes during testing.
- The necessity of the T5 dialogue system is questioned, as ChatGPT could potentially handle user intention understanding effectively on its own.
- The work is perceived as an incremental improvement over existing systems, lacking significant novelty in the dialogue/image generation construction.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the diversity of editable attributes to enhance the model's robustness with unseen slots and values. Additionally, we suggest conducting further studies, such as testing the model in a zero-shot setting with unseen attributes and performing more extensive ablation studies to strengthen the results. Clarifying the term "predefined policy" in L244 is also essential for understanding. Lastly, we encourage the authors to address the perceived incremental nature of their contributions to better highlight the novelty of their work.
