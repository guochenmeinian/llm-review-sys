### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to classifying schizophrenia and bipolar disorder using dynamic high-order functional connectivity (dHOFC) and divisive normalization. The authors demonstrate that their method outperforms traditional low-order connectivity analyses, achieving notable improvements in classification accuracy, with an AUC of up to 96.61%. The study leverages resting-state fMRI data, providing valuable insights into the functional connectivity patterns that differentiate these disorders.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
* The integration of dynamic and high-order functional connectivity is innovative and addresses limitations of previous methods.
* The use of divisive normalization enhances feature representation and classification performance.
* The dataset (B-SNIP) is well-established, ensuring robustness.

Weaknesses:
* Section 2.4 lacks clarity regarding the parameters, particularly the meaning of $ \tau $ in Eq. 3 and the distinction between tHOFC and aHOFC.
* The results show a concerning imbalance in sensitivity and specificity, with low sensitivity (3.78%) suggesting poor recognition of schizophrenia.
* The parameter tuning process for divisive normalization is insufficiently described, and the comparison with deep learning methods is limited.
* Some sections, particularly the introduction to divisive normalization and certain equations, could be clearer for broader accessibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 2.4 by explicitly defining $ \tau $ and differentiating tHOFC from aHOFC. Additionally, we suggest revising the results section to address the sensitivity and specificity imbalance, perhaps by adjusting the classification threshold or applying class weighting. Including visualizations of sample high-order functional graphs for bipolar patients in Figure 3 would aid in interpretation. A more thorough explanation of the parameter selection process in Equation 6 is necessary. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to expand comparisons with contemporary deep learning methods and provide a more intuitive introduction to divisive normalization. Lastly, demonstrating the method's utility in real-world diagnostic settings would enhance its practical significance.
