### Key Points
This paper extends conformal prediction to conditional normalising flows for multi-step time series forecasting, enabling adaptive and efficient predictive inference. The authors propose a novel scoring method for conformal prediction using conditional density estimates from a normalizing flow model, focusing specifically on time series applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The intuition behind the paper is strong, providing a clear improvement in uncertainty quantification for multivariate time series.
- The application of the conformal method to handle multimodal distributions is novel and clever.

Weaknesses:
- The combination of normalising flows with RNNs or transformers introduces significant complexity, raising questions about practical applicability.
- There is limited discussion on empirical results, with only one-time results reported, which may be unstable. No efficiency metrics or comparisons with baselines like MultiDim_SPCI are provided.
- Assumptions regarding exchangeability at any point in time, conditionally on $\mathbf{h}_T$, are unclear.
- The quality of experimental results is hard to assess due to the lack of visualizations, standard errors, or training details.
- The focus on time series is oddly specific, given the broader applicability of the method.
- Notation needs clarification, particularly regarding whether $y$ belongs in the calibration set, and the term "hypothesised" should be changed to "predicted."
- References should cite original works rather than literature reviews, unless explicitly mentioned.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on empirical results by including additional experiments, efficiency metrics, and comparisons with relevant baselines. Clarifying assumptions about exchangeability and enhancing the quality of experimental results through visualizations and training details would strengthen the paper. Additionally, we suggest broadening the scope of the application discussion and refining the notation for clarity. Finally, we encourage the authors to cite original works directly to improve the precision of references.
