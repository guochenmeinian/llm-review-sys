### Key Points
This paper presents a Unified Summarization Benchmark (USB) that encompasses eight interconnected summarization tasks derived from human-annotated Wikipedia content. The authors propose a sophisticated preprocessing pipeline and conduct human annotation to identify relevant evidence for each sentence in the candidate summary, leading to the creation of parallel data. They evaluate the benchmark using fine-tuned models and large language models (LLMs), demonstrating that fine-tuned models outperform LLMs, particularly in tasks related to factuality. The paper also analyzes out-of-domain performance and the influence of human-annotated data compared to silver data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, providing clear motivation for each step of dataset construction and experimentation.
2. The USB benchmark serves as a valuable resource for future research on evidence mining and factuality, covering eight tasks and six domains.
3. Extensive experiments and insightful findings are presented, particularly regarding the performance of different models.

Weaknesses:
1. The quality of the summaries is uncertain, as it is unclear whether the overview section of Wikipedia serves as an adequate summary, potentially missing key information.
2. Some proposed tasks may not be natural, as the dataset is edited rather than written, leading to concerns about the authenticity of the summaries.
3. There is a lack of an ethics consideration section, raising data quality concerns related to the human annotation process.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the ethical consideration section by providing detailed information about the background of human annotators, including their education level and compensation. Additionally, the authors should assess the reliability of the human evaluation results by measuring inter-annotator agreement, such as kappa. To enhance the dataset's credibility, we suggest incorporating thorough human evaluation of the summaries to address concerns about their quality. Furthermore, the authors should conduct a more in-depth analysis of experimental outcomes, particularly focusing on the performance gaps observed in tasks beyond generation. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the differences between their dataset and other human-annotated datasets, as well as to include relevant citations for recent benchmarks like MACSum and SummZoo.
