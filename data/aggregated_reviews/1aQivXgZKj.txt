Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on incentivizing data sharing in federated bandits, proposing a solution called Inc-FedUCB that operates in a linear contextual bandit setting. The authors demonstrate that Inc-FedUCB achieves near-optimal regret levels while ensuring guarantees on communication and payment costs. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of their incentive designs across various environments. The paper also introduces an online federated learning protocol where clients participate based on the utility gained from incentives, contrasting with traditional models where clients unconditionally share information.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is the first to formulate and prove theoretical guarantees for incentive design in federated bandit learning.
2. The topic is significant, and the mechanism based on monetary and non-monetary incentives is novel.
3. The theoretical claims are robust, and the empirical experiments support these claims effectively.
4. The paper is well-organized and covers extensive literature relevant to the topic.

Weaknesses:
1. The presentation lacks clarity, particularly regarding the utility design and assumptions about clients sharing the same $\theta_{\star}$.
2. The paper assumes that clients truthfully report their costs, which may not be realistic and could be exploited by adversarial clients.
3. There is insufficient support for the participation standard in Algorithm 1, particularly regarding the determinants of matrices.
4. Figures 1 and 2 lack error bars, and minor typographical errors are present throughout the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the utility design and address the assumptions made regarding clients' cost reporting. Specifically, clarify whether all clients are assumed to share the same $\theta_{\star}$ and provide a more explicit definition of variables such as $g$ in $V_{g,0}$. Additionally, we suggest including error bars in Figures 1 and 2 and correcting any typographical errors. Finally, consider discussing the potential fairness issues arising from the monetary incentive mechanism to enhance the paper's comprehensiveness.
