Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a connection between causal representation learning (CRL) and parameter identification in dynamical systems, proposing that existing CRL methods can effectively estimate parameters with identification guarantees. The authors demonstrate the applicability of their approach on both simulated and real-world climate data, showing its effectiveness in solving parameter identification tasks. The work aims to bridge the gap between CRL and the AI/ML for Science communities, particularly in the context of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and latent variable identifiability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper addresses an important and emerging topic in parameter identification within dynamic systems, leveraging existing CRL techniques.
2. The proposed approach offers a novel perspective by framing parameter identification as a causal representation learning problem, which is conceptually appealing.
3. Empirical results indicate competitive performance in predictive tasks and parameter identification, particularly in climate modeling.

Weaknesses:  
1. The contribution is limited; much of the discussion is centered on CRL without sufficiently demonstrating practical effectiveness in dynamic systems. Specific examples of dynamic systems would enhance understanding.
2. Important related works on parameter identification with identifiability guarantees are not adequately discussed, particularly those that could provide context for the proposed methods.
3. The experimental evaluation is insufficient, focusing only on simulated wind data and sea surface temperature, necessitating a broader range of dynamic systems and ablation studies for verification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the practical effectiveness of their approach by providing specific examples of dynamic systems. Additionally, it is crucial to include a more thorough review of related works, particularly those addressing identifiability guarantees in parameter identification. Expanding the experimental evaluation to include a variety of dynamic systems and conducting ablation studies where the true functional form is known would strengthen the paper. Finally, clarifying the assumptions made in the context of dynamic systems and addressing the conceptual differences between ODE parameters and latent variables in CRL would enhance the theoretical foundation of the work.
