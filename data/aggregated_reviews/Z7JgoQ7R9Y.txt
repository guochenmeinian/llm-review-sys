### Key Points
This paper presents a retrieval-based query reformulation method aimed at enhancing zero-shot text classification by augmenting contextual information from retrieved document categories. The authors utilize a retriever model (BM25 or Dense Retriever) to recall relevant categories, concatenate them with the original query, and employ existing word embedding models (e.g., word2vec) for classification based on similarity scores. The paper provides results across six datasets and includes hyperparameter studies, demonstrating that the proposed method improves performance for weaker models but shows limited gains for stronger contextual embedding models like GPT-3-large.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The problem is clearly stated and relevant, with a well-described methodology that is accessible even to non-experts.  
- The paper is easy to read and presents a logical motivation for the proposed method.  
- Experimental results indicate significant improvements for weaker embedding models like Word2Vec and FastText.

Weaknesses:  
- The proposed method tends to decrease performance for stronger models, suggesting it may only be suitable for weaker embeddings.  
- The paper relies on outdated models and does not incorporate recent large models like LLaMa for experimentation.  
- The originality of the proposed framework is questioned, as it resembles existing query expansion techniques.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve their experimental design by incorporating stronger baselines, particularly newer embedding models, to justify the claims made regarding the effectiveness of their method. Additionally, the authors should clarify why users might prefer older models like Word2Vec over more advanced options. It would also be beneficial to provide more definitions of basic concepts used in the paper to enhance understanding for a broader audience.
