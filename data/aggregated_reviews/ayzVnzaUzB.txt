### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach that jointly infers the target group for a hateful/toxic comment, predicts the likely annotation from an annotator within that group, and utilizes this information to enhance annotation quality across various metrics. The authors construct a model that predicts individual annotator ratings on problematic language, outperforming a baseline model by significant margins in predicting individual and aggregate ratings. The paper emphasizes the importance of considering annotator backgrounds in data annotation, addressing ethical dimensions in machine learning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a crucial topic in human data annotation, highlighting the influence of annotator backgrounds on machine learning models.
- The model architecture is innovative, with a differentiated training approach for identifying targeted demographics in hate speech.
- The writing is clear and the experimental design is intuitive, leading to promising results.

Weaknesses:
- The limitations statement is limited, raising concerns about potential tokenism and the need for a more explicit discussion on intersectionality.
- There is skepticism regarding the claims of increased privacy and reduced invasive data collection, particularly in relation to the necessity of annotator IDs.
- The paper lacks empirical results detailing specific cases of model performance, missing opportunities to highlight significant findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the limitations section to explicitly address concerns about tokenism and intersectionality. Additionally, we suggest providing an error analysis of the target group model to clarify where mistakes occur and their implications. It would also be beneficial to include a breakdown of results by major target groups to better relate findings across different demographic categories. Finally, consider discussing how to introduce this study in future annotation sessions to enhance its practical application.
