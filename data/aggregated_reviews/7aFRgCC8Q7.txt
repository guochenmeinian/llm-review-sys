Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on online forecasting algorithms aimed at achieving multiclass U-calibration. The authors propose an algorithm that achieves O(sqrt(KT)) U-calibration error, proving this to be tight. They also explore subclasses of loss functions where stronger U-calibration bounds can be obtained, such as O(log T) for Lipschitz-bounded and decomposable proper scoring rules. The paper builds on the randomized online forecaster introduced by Kleinberg et al. and modifies the perturbation distribution to achieve the optimal error rate. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant open problem in U-calibration, providing a comprehensive solution and improving existing bounds.
- The theoretical analysis is sound, and the methods employed are appropriate, leading to important results that advance the state of the art.
- The presentation is clear and well-organized, making complex concepts accessible.

Weaknesses:
- The originality of the work is somewhat limited, as it builds on existing techniques without introducing significantly new methods.
- Clarity could be improved in certain sections, particularly towards the end, where the exposition may not adequately inform the reader.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the exposition in the latter sections to ensure that all readers can fully grasp the content. Additionally, emphasizing the novel contributions of the work more clearly would enhance its perceived originality. Addressing minor grammatical issues, such as those noted on Page 6 Line 228 and Page 7 Line 280, would also improve the overall quality of the paper.
