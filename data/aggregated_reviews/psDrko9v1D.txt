Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Heat Diffusion Optimization (HeO) method, which utilizes thermodynamic principles to enhance combinatorial optimization (CO) problems by integrating heat diffusion equations into gradient-based optimization. The authors propose transforming discrete problems into continuous ones to improve efficiency and escape local minima. The empirical evaluation demonstrates the method's advantages across various CO problems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of heat diffusion as a mechanism for combinatorial optimization is novel and well-developed.
2. The paper is generally well-written, with a good balance of examples, explanations, and discussions.
3. Extensive experiments validate the proposed method across different optimization problems, illustrating its effectiveness and versatility.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation appears to diverge from the original goal of enhancing search-based combinatorial optimization, as the method focuses on changing the objective function rather than addressing constraints in combinatorial problems.
2. The paper lacks a detailed discussion on the scalability of the method in large-dimensional spaces and does not fully analyze combinatorial problems with constraints.
3. There is insufficient theoretical and empirical analysis of the HeO algorithm, including convergence properties and computational complexity.
4. The submission lacks appendices or supplementary materials to verify the soundness of the theorems presented.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on how the proposed HeO method can be customized for specific problems to enhance performance. Additionally, a deeper theoretical and empirical analysis of the HeO algorithm, including convergence properties and computational complexity, should be included. The authors should also provide a clearer explanation of the projection map in equation (9) and elaborate on the method for determining the value of K in the multilinear polynomial. Finally, addressing the scalability of the method in large-dimensional spaces and including more baselines would strengthen the paper.
