### Key Points
This paper investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to handle character-level scrambled text through two tasks: scrambled sentence recovery and scrambled question answering. The authors propose two new datasets and evaluate the performance of GPT-4, which demonstrates superior results compared to other models like GPT-3.5 and Text-davinci-003. The findings indicate that GPT-4 excels in processing inputs with unnatural errors, contributing to the understanding of LLM capabilities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an interesting research question and proposes a novel benchmark for evaluating LLM performance on scrambled text.
- It is well-grounded in current literature, citing recent advances in the field.
- The methodology is simple yet well thought-out, and the investigation could significantly contribute to probing LLM abilities.

Weaknesses:
- The analysis of LLM behavior on scrambled texts is insufficient; there is a lack of deeper exploration into how LLMs encode scrambled tokens.
- The test sets are relatively small, raising concerns about the reliability of the conclusions drawn.
- The paper does not evaluate character-based/tokenizer-free models like T5 or public models such as LLaMa, limiting the scope of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of LLM behavior by investigating how these models encode scrambled tokens and mapping them to original ones. Additionally, we suggest including a comparison with more state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Alpaca and FLAN-T5, to strengthen the validation of the proposed method's effectiveness. Furthermore, adding a method diagram and clearly introducing the weaknesses of existing approaches would enhance the paper's clarity and impact. Lastly, we advise correcting grammatical errors and improving the overall writing quality to ensure clarity and professionalism.
