Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on outlier robust phase retrieval, aiming to recover a real-valued vector from intensity measurements affected by adversarial outliers. The authors propose a nearly-linear time algorithm that employs a two-step process: robust spectral initialization followed by robust gradient descent, leveraging advancements in high-dimensional robust statistics. The theoretical framework claims that the algorithm can accurately recover the true vector despite the presence of outliers.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The two-stage algorithm achieves nearly-linear time complexity, comprising an initial spectral initialization phase and a gradient descent refinement phase.
- The theoretical analysis demonstrates that the algorithm can recover the ground truth signal while maintaining near-optimal sample efficiency.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical results treat the corruption level $\epsilon$ as a constant, neglecting its variability, which undermines the robustness of the findings. A detailed analysis considering $\epsilon$'s variability is necessary.
- There is a lack of numerical validations for the theoretical claims, making it difficult to assess practical applicability.
- The approach adapts existing reweighting phase retrieval algorithms, raising concerns about novelty, as the contamination model has been previously studied in various contexts.
- The paper contains several confusing statements and lacks clarity in its claims, particularly regarding the novelty of the problem and the implications of its results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical framework by explicitly considering the variability of the corruption level $\epsilon$ in their analysis. Additionally, the authors should include numerical validations to support their theoretical claims and compare their algorithm with existing robust Gaussian phase retrieval methods to establish practical relevance. Clarifying the novelty of their approach and providing a more practical setup for the adversarial manipulation of sampling vectors would enhance the paper's contribution. Finally, addressing the numerous typos and inaccuracies in the text will improve the overall presentation and clarity.
