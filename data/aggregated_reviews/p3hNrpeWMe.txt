Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) called Hadamard-derived Linear Binding (HLB), which enhances computational efficiency and performance in classical VSA tasks and deep learning applications. HLB utilizes the Walsh-Hadamard transform for binding and unbinding operations, achieving linear complexity and addressing limitations of traditional VSAs like Tensor Product Representation (TPR) and Holographic Reduced Representation (HRR). The authors provide theoretical foundations, derivation processes, and empirical evaluations demonstrating HLB's efficacy across various tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well organized, with clear explanations of concepts.
- The theoretical foundations and empirical evaluations convincingly demonstrate HLB's effectiveness.
- The noise-reducing projection step is a novel application within the context of Hadamard-derived binding.
- HLB is efficient, relying solely on element-wise operations.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for using the Walsh-Hadamard transform is not clearly articulated.
- The presentation contains several typos and organizational issues that hinder clarity.
- There is a lack of comparison with other parameterizable binding schemes, such as those discussed in "Steinberg and Sompolinsky, Associative memory of structured knowledge."
- The experimental details are insufficiently summarized, deferring too much to referenced works.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind the use of the Walsh-Hadamard transform. Additionally, we suggest addressing the organizational issues and typos throughout the paper to enhance readability. It would be beneficial to include a comparison with other parameterizable binding schemes and to provide a brief summary of the experimental details rather than relying solely on referenced works. Furthermore, elaborating on the hyperparameter search procedure and the relevance of the proposed correction factor in specific contexts would strengthen the paper.
