Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on optimal transport (OT) with elastic costs, focusing on the Monge problem. The authors propose a method for generating OT maps using proximal gradient descent, which allows for visualization of Monge maps beyond traditional gradient-convex Brenier maps. The work introduces subspace elastic costs defined by a matrix \(A\) and provides sample-complexity estimates for the MBO estimator. The results demonstrate improved predictive ability in synthetic and single-cell data applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper offers the first visualizations of Monge maps beyond standard gradient-convex Brenier maps, showcasing practical applicability. The empirical validation of the MBO estimator's performance and the recovery of \(A\) in various data tasks is a significant contribution.

Weaknesses:  
The exposition is unclear in several areas, particularly regarding the notation and the integration of various components. The theoretical contributions appear limited, as they largely build on existing work without introducing substantial new insights. Additionally, the introduction lacks elaboration on jargon terms from the optimal transport literature.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the exposition by providing a detailed "algorithms box" that outlines the complete process for applying their method. This should include the interplay between learning \(A\) and the transport map, along with tuning decisions. Additionally, we suggest including numerical comparisons with other methods, particularly OT without the subspace constraint, and addressing the theoretical contributions more robustly, especially in sections 5 and 6. Lastly, we advise elaborating on jargon terms in the introduction to enhance accessibility for readers unfamiliar with the field.
