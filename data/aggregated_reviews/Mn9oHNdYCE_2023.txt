Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents XES3G5M, a large-scale dataset for knowledge tracing (KT) focused on 3rd-grade math questions from TAL Education Group. It includes rich auxiliary information about questions and their associated knowledge components (KCs), comprising 7,652 questions, 865 KCs, and 5,549,635 interactions from 18,066 students. The dataset offers extensive contextual information, such as tree-structured KC relations and question types. The authors conduct a comprehensive benchmark on 15 state-of-the-art deep learning-based knowledge tracing (DLKT) models, demonstrating the effectiveness of utilizing the auxiliary information while addressing various inquiries regarding the dataset's characteristics, including data privacy and representativeness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The XES3G5M dataset is extensive and rich in auxiliary information, enhancing its utility for research and effective knowledge tracing.  
- It includes a substantial number of interactions from a diverse student population, making it suitable for training and evaluating KT models.  
- The authors have taken significant steps to ensure data privacy through rigorous anonymization processes.  
- The comprehensive benchmark of 15 DLKT models offers a thorough evaluation of model performance and showcases the benefits of leveraging auxiliary information.  

Weaknesses:  
- The dataset exhibits imbalances in question types and interaction frequencies, which may pose challenges in modeling student behavior.  
- The absence of duration information for each interaction limits the ability to estimate students' knowledge states over time.  
- There is a lack of comprehensive characterization of the dataset's question content, which could enhance understanding.  
- The dataset's representativeness is narrow, focusing primarily on 3rd-grade students, which may limit generalizability to other educational levels and contexts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the impact of data imbalances and potential mitigation strategies, such as exploring data augmentation techniques or synthetic data generation. Including duration information for interactions could provide valuable insights into the temporal aspects of knowledge tracing. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed characterization of the dataset's question content through statistics and visualizations. Disaggregating performance by student characteristics could enhance understanding of model effectiveness across different interaction levels. Clarifying the inputs and outputs of the models in Section 4.1 and including more examples of questions in the Appendix would also be beneficial. Finally, enhancing documentation regarding data availability and maintenance would aid potential users of the dataset.
