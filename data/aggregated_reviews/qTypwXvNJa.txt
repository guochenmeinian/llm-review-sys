Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method, Geodesic Optimization for Predictive Shift Adaptation (GOPSA), aimed at predictive regression modeling through multi-source domain adaptation, specifically using EEG data for age prediction. The method incorporates a domain-specific re-centering operator and is built upon a Riemannian mixed-effects model, allowing for generalization across domains without retraining. The authors claim that their approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is innovative, employing a Riemannian-based solution for regression tasks with multi-source domain adaptation.
- The paper is well-written, with clear theoretical foundations and effective visualization of EEG data variability.
- Extensive experiments have been conducted on a large public EEG dataset, demonstrating good performance improvements over baselines.

Weaknesses:
- The method assumes knowledge of the average target label $\bar y_T$, raising concerns about potential information leakage and generalizability to unseen data.
- There is a lack of comparison with other alignment techniques and Riemannian-based methods, as well as state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for age prediction.
- The motivation for investigating domain adaptation on the SPD manifold is not convincingly articulated, and the unique challenges posed by domain shifts in this context remain unclear.
- Performance differences between GOPSA and baseline methods are not substantial in some cases, and the statistical assumptions of the T-test used for analysis need clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for their study, specifically addressing the unique challenges of domain adaptation on the SPD manifold. Additionally, the authors should include comparisons with other alignment techniques and state-of-the-art methods to substantiate their claims of achieving state-of-the-art performance. It would be beneficial to provide an interpretation of the age prediction model, including pivotal frequency bands and electrodes. Furthermore, we suggest adding statistical tests to performance tables and discussing the potential application of the learned transport on actual multichannel data. Lastly, addressing the assumptions of the T-test and exploring the implications of non-overlapping source and target distributions would enhance the robustness of the findings.
