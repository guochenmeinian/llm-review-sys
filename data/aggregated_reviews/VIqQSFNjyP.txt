Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method to enhance the quality of pseudo labels for unlabeled target data in cross-domain semantic segmentation. The authors propose Semantic Connectivity-driven Pseudo-labeling (SeCo), which includes Pixel Semantic Aggregation (PSA) to refine pseudo-labels for 'stuff' and 'things' categories and Semantic Connectivity Correction (SCC) to rectify connectivity noise through a classification task guided by loss distribution. Extensive evaluations demonstrate significant performance improvements across various semantic segmentation tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The design of pixel semantic aggregation is well-motivated and clearly ablated.
- The experiments are extensive, evaluating various cross-domain semantic segmentation tasks and different pseudo-labeling methods.
- The ablation studies effectively demonstrate the contributions of each module, and the method is well-motivated with clear technical details.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the SCC module is limited, as it adapts techniques from DivideMix (ICLR 2020) without significant innovation.
- A discussion on related work in noisy label learning would be beneficial, particularly since SCC focuses on noisy label recognition and correction.
- The use of domain generalization with synthesized data is atypical and may not accurately represent DG, especially since x_t is not accessible in Eq. 1.
- Implementation details of CLIP+SAM are unclear, and further quantitative results regarding prompting and semantic alignment without separation of categories would enhance clarity.
- The impact of the enlargement factor for the bounding box area and the number of training iterations for the connectivity classifier should be addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty discussion of the SCC module by clearly differentiating it from DivideMix at the connectivity level. Additionally, we suggest including a more comprehensive analysis of related work on noisy label learning. Clarifying the implementation details of CLIP+SAM and providing quantitative results for various configurations would strengthen the paper. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore broader segmentation tasks beyond the standard datasets used.
