Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel weakly supervised semantic segmentation task that utilizes pixel-level categorical distributions as labels during training, employing KL divergence as the training loss. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method through experiments on three public segmentation datasets, achieving performance comparable to more expensive labeling methods. The approach aims to reduce annotation costs while maintaining accuracy and robustness to size target errors.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed task is innovative, offering the community an alternative for segmentation with reduced annotation effort.
2. The KL divergence loss is effective, as evidenced by experiments across multiple datasets, achieving results comparable to methods requiring more detailed labels.
3. The method shows robustness to size target errors, enhancing its practicality.
4. The writing is fluent and accessible.

Weaknesses:
1. The labeling effort required for complex images is not adequately addressed; the authors should demonstrate annotation efforts on more complex datasets like Cityscapes and ADE20K.
2. Model performance on complex images needs evaluation to provide a comprehensive understanding of the proposed method.
3. The paper lacks detailed analysis on the robustness to size target errors and does not sufficiently compare with the latest models.
4. The title may be misleading, as it suggests that approximate size targets are sufficient while also using image labels for supervision.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation of their method on more complex datasets, such as Cityscapes and ADE20K, to better understand the labeling effort and model performance in challenging scenarios. Additionally, we suggest including ablation studies to analyze the impact of the two losses on model performance and providing more information on the time comparisons for labeling across various methods. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of the method, particularly regarding the scalability to larger datasets and the potential challenges of size target annotations, would enhance the paper's depth. Lastly, we advise revising the title to more accurately reflect the use of image labels alongside size targets in the supervision process.
