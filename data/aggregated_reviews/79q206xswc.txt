Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Place3D, a comprehensive pipeline for optimizing LiDAR sensor placements to enhance 3D scene understanding, particularly in adverse conditions. The authors introduce the Surrogate Metric of the Semantic Occupancy Grids (M-SOG), an innovative metric that evaluates LiDAR placement quality by measuring information gain and scene understanding capability, while also handling occlusions. The optimization strategy employs the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) to refine LiDAR configurations, ensuring placements are close to the global optimum. The authors provide a large-scale dataset of 364,000 frames collected under various conditions, including both clean and adverse scenarios, demonstrating that optimized placements significantly improve performance in LiDAR semantic segmentation and 3D object detection tasks, outperforming existing baselines by approximately 9%. The paper addresses limitations in existing datasets that often overlook adverse weather and sensor failure scenarios, showcasing the robustness of the proposed method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work addresses an important but underexplored aspect of 3D scene understanding, potentially opening new research directions.
- M-SOG is an innovative metric that incorporates semantic information, enhancing accuracy over previous methods.
- The extensive dataset includes various adverse conditions, showcasing the robustness of the proposed method.
- The revisions clarify the core formulation and improve the explanation of the optimization approach using CMA-ES.
- Inclusion of a scatter plot enhances the interpretability of results.
- Higher-resolution LiDAR experiments and discussions on sensor placement are well-supported by reviewer suggestions.

Weaknesses:
- The representation of M-SOG and the optimization method may be confusing, as they appear task-independent while being applied to specific tasks.
- The clarity of the paper's writing and explanations needs significant improvement, particularly regarding the optimization process and notation.
- Some aspects of the theoretical analysis could still benefit from further elaboration.
- The clarity of figures and writing, while improved, may still require additional refinement for optimal understanding.
- The experiments primarily conducted in simulation raise questions about real-world applicability, and more justifications are needed regarding computational resource requirements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing and explanations, particularly concerning the optimization approach and notation. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments to explore the influence of the number of LiDARs on performance and discussing how M-SOG can reflect scene coverage in specific local areas. We also recommend improving the theoretical analysis to provide deeper insights into their optimization strategy. Finally, further refinement of figures and writing clarity would enhance the overall presentation of the manuscript, and we encourage the authors to consider extending their benchmarks and optimization strategies to other 3D scene understanding tasks for broader applicability.
