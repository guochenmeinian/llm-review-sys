Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel end-to-end algorithm named E2E-MFD for multimodal image fusion and object detection. The authors propose a synchronous joint optimization approach that simplifies the fusion detection process into a single training step, enhancing efficiency over traditional multi-step methods. A Gradient Matrix Task-Alignment method is introduced to harmonize losses between the image fusion and object detection networks, addressing task dominance and conflicting gradients. An image fusion network with an Object-Region-Pixel Phylogenetic Tree is designed to perceive information at varying granularity levels. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in both image fusion and object detection tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The simultaneous learning of image fusion and object detection tasks is both intriguing and reasonable, effectively avoiding local optimum issues in multi-stage training models.
- The introduction of specific modules like Gradient Matrix Task-Alignment and Object-Region-Pixel Phylogenetic Tree enhances the learning process and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing pipelines.
- The paper is well-structured, with clear descriptions, effective use of formulas, and comprehensible figures.

Weaknesses:
- There are some typographical errors, such as inconsistencies in the notation of L_SSIM and unclear elements in figures.
- The novelty of the proposed method may be questioned, as it appears to combine existing techniques rather than introduce fundamentally new concepts.
- The writing lacks clarity in certain areas, and the motivation for the proposed work is not sufficiently strong compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing and the motivation behind their work to better highlight its novelty. Additionally, addressing the typographical errors and providing clearer explanations for figures would enhance the paper's comprehensibility. We suggest including more detailed justifications for the chosen datasets and the specific implementation details of the Gradient Matrix Task-Alignment method. Furthermore, incorporating ablation studies for CFDP and comparing with the latest YOLO versions would strengthen the experimental validation. Lastly, the advantages of ORPPT and GMTA over existing techniques should be explicitly demonstrated to clarify their contributions to performance improvements.
