### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to enhancing the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization of pre-trained encoders through embedding-space ensembles, termed Ensemble-InfoNCE. The authors aggregate aligned ensemble means in the hyperspherical latent embedding space, demonstrating improved performance in zero-shot learning compared to single models. The theoretical foundation is robust, particularly regarding the near orthogonal transformation, yet the experimental evaluation is limited to the MNIST dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Clear problem statement and thorough discussion of challenges with unlabeled data.
- Strong explanations of key concepts and a well-structured methodology.
- Promising experimental results indicating improved OOD generalization.

Weaknesses:
- Limited experimental evaluation, relying solely on the MNIST dataset and two metrics (Recall@1 and MAP@R).
- Lack of comparisons with recent OOD generalization techniques.
- Potential computational cost and scalability issues due to the need for separate alignment networks for each model in the ensemble.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method by providing more examples of how interpretability is retained, including visual or qualitative analyses of aligned embeddings. Additionally, clarifying the process of creating positive and negative pairs for InfoNCE without image augmentation would enhance understanding. To address scalability concerns, we suggest including an ablation study on the impact of learning different $R_j$ matrices for each encoder. Finally, expanding the experimental evaluation to include larger and more complex datasets would strengthen the validity of the approach and its applicability to real-world scenarios.
