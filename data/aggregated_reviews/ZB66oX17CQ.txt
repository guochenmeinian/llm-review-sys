### Key Points
This paper presents a fine-grained taxonomy of replies to hate speech, focusing on responses that address either the hateful content or its author. The authors apply this taxonomy to a Reddit dataset, providing linguistic analyses and insights into the interactions between hateful content and replies, which can inform the design of effective counterspeech strategies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The proposed taxonomy is grounded in argumentation theories, potentially enhancing counterspeech design for hate mitigation.  
2. The study includes a well-annotated dataset of 3,654 samples, contributing to the understanding of counterspeech dynamics.  
3. The analysis of conversational outcomes based on countering strategies is a valuable addition to the field.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The paper lacks a thorough comparison with existing taxonomies, leaving unclear how the new taxonomy adds knowledge or addresses limitations of prior work.  
2. The analysis does not include a larger, noisy dataset for weak supervision experiments, which could enhance the study's depth.  
3. Some claims require more substantial evidence or references to support their validity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion around existing taxonomies for categorizing counterspeech, clarifying how their proposed taxonomy differs and what unique contributions it offers. Additionally, consider creating a larger dataset for weak supervision experiments to deepen the analysis. We suggest including relevant references to support claims, particularly in the introduction, and addressing the potential overlap with existing taxonomies. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore better sampling techniques and model improvements beyond naive fine-tuning in their experiments.
