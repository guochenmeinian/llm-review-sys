Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an unsupervised algorithm for detecting abnormal nodes in a graph, leveraging the one-class homophily assumption. The authors propose Truncated Affinity Maximization (TAM) to enhance local affinity for normal nodes while iteratively removing non-homophily edges through Normal Structure-preserved Graph Truncation. The method demonstrates competitive performance on datasets with both synthetic and real anomalies, achieving significant improvements in AUROC/AUPRC metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-structured and easy to follow.
2. The motivation for the TAM method is strong, aligning with realistic scenarios where normal nodes and anomalies coexist without known labels.
3. Extensive experiments validate TAM as a robust baseline for unsupervised anomaly node detection.

Weaknesses:
1. The authors should include supervised graph anomaly detection methods in Section 2, such as CARE-GNN, PC-GNN, and Fraudre, to contextualize their work.
2. The applicability of TAM across different GNN backbones beyond GCN remains unclear.
3. The performance of TAM and baselines in Table 1 regarding AUPRC is concerning; including ROC and precision-recall curves would provide clarity.
4. Figure 2(b) lacks clarity; the authors should reorganize this illustration to define $c_1$, $c_2$, and $c_k$.
5. Limitations should be discussed in a separate paragraph or subsection, and the authors should consider any additional shortcomings of TAM beyond those mentioned in the conclusion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section by discussing connections and differences with existing methods, particularly in relation to one-class homophily. Additionally, the authors should test TAM on larger-scale graphs to demonstrate its efficiency and address the empirical investigation of component designs, especially the graph truncation strategy. Clarifying the rationale behind the iterative removal of non-homophily edges and establishing criteria for ideal truncated graphs would strengthen the paper. Finally, addressing the handling of isolated nodes and the impact of node attribute quality on NSGT performance is essential for a comprehensive understanding of TAM's limitations.
