Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents AFBench, an extensive airfoil dataset comprising 200,000 airfoil shapes with geometric and aerodynamic annotations. The dataset integrates airfoils from the UIUC and NACA datasets, designs from COMAC engineers, and augmented airfoils generated through CST, GAN, and diffusion models. The authors propose generative methods for conditional airfoil generation and editing, focusing on diversity, controllability, and quality. The paper includes detailed documentation of the data collection process and evaluation metrics for airfoil generation tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- AFBench is a significant contribution, providing a comprehensive benchmark for airfoil inverse design research with high-quality annotations and an open-source codebase.
- The dataset's diverse sources and robust evaluation metrics enhance its utility for research.

Weaknesses:
- The clarity and organization of the paper could be improved, as some technical jargon is not adequately introduced, potentially hindering understanding for non-specialists.
- The dataset is partially based on a coarse CFD solver, XFoil, which may affect the precision of aerodynamic labels and contains acknowledged biases.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by better introducing specialized terminology, such as CST, to enhance accessibility for non-expert readers. Additionally, addressing the dataset's biases and generalizability to real-world applications would strengthen its practical relevance. We suggest incorporating PCA as a baseline method for comparison in predictive analytics tasks and introducing a PINN-like loss function to ensure that generated airfoils meet physical constraints. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to validate latent space fidelity and reconstruction accuracy for generative models based on diffusion methods. Lastly, we recommend ensuring that all evaluation metrics, including accuracy of reconstruction and diversity between CL and CD, are comprehensively addressed in the analysis.
