Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents LayoutDIT, an end-to-end document image translation framework that integrates layout-aware encoding and a multi-step conductive decoder to enhance translation accuracy. The authors propose a novel architecture that addresses error propagation in traditional methods by jointly modeling text semantics and 2D layout features. Additionally, they introduce the DITrans dataset for multi-domain document image translation, demonstrating promising results on both DITrans and the ReadingBank dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to understand.
- It introduces a clear and rational model architecture that effectively incorporates layout information.
- LayoutDIT achieves state-of-the-art performance and shows advantages in low-resource scenarios.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the layout-aware encoder is limited, as it relies on standard practices in document layout analysis.
- The DITrans dataset is relatively small and lacks analysis on its diversity and complexity.
- The paper does not sufficiently support some main claims, and there are major technical issues that need addressing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of the layout-aware encoder by exploring more innovative approaches beyond standard practices. Additionally, a more comprehensive analysis of the DITrans dataset's diversity and complexity should be included. We suggest conducting more ablation studies to clarify the impact of each component in the decoding process. Finally, leveraging multilingual models like LayoutXLM could enhance generalization across languages, and the authors should consider this in their future work.
