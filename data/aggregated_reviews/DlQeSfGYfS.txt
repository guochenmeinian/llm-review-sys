### Key Points
This paper presents a novel attention layer that utilizes dynamic Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters of order two to process input sequences before applying conventional attention. The approach aims to reduce parameter count and achieve sub-quadratic computational complexity through sequence chunking. The authors provide a stability proof and conduct experimental evaluations across various datasets, demonstrating the method's effectiveness, particularly in audio-based tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The idea is novel, bridging system/signal processing with transformer architectures, potentially benefiting both text and audio tasks.
- The paper includes a comprehensive introduction and detailed analysis of method stability, time complexity, and expressiveness.
- The proposed method shows competitive performance with fewer parameters compared to existing models.

Weaknesses:
- The method section assumes advanced knowledge of system and signal processing, making it difficult for some readers to grasp the implications of design choices.
- There is a lack of statistical analysis of results, including standard deviations for metrics.
- The novelty of the approach is unclear, appearing as a combination of existing techniques, and the experimental section lacks sufficient validation with limited baseline models and simplistic evaluation metrics.
- Several baseline models are outdated, and there is a need for ablation studies to clarify the contributions of the IIR filters.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method section by providing more interpretations of design choices and their impacts on the attention network. Additionally, we suggest including statistical analyses of the results, such as standard deviations, to strengthen the findings. The authors should consider updating baseline models to more recent versions and expanding the experimental section to include diverse datasets and evaluation metrics, as seen in Mega's experimental section. Furthermore, we encourage the inclusion of ablation studies to highlight the benefits of the IIR filters and to clarify the impact of new parameters introduced by the approach.
