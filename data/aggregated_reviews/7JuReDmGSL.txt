Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an empirical study on out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, focusing on contexts that are either beneficial or irrelevant. The authors find that models excelling in one context often struggle in the other. They analyze a population of models and demonstrate that those with more factorized representations and appropriate feature weighting perform better across both OOD settings. Additionally, the paper introduces novel data augmentation methods aimed at enhancing model generalization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper provides a detailed analysis of generalization and identifies key factors influencing performance. It is well-written, systematically examines how context impacts visual recognition, and emphasizes generalization to OOD, which is often overlooked in other models. The results are clearly presented, and the regression and probing analyses are commendable.

Weaknesses:  
The motivation for the proposed data augmentation method lacks strong support, particularly in its connection to the adaptive use of context for object recognition. The method requires additional annotations and segmentation, limiting its practicality. Concerns are raised regarding the generalizability of results due to the limited diversity in the training dataset, which consists of only 16,000 images.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the proposed data augmentation method by clearly establishing its connection to the motivation of adaptively using context. Additionally, we suggest that the authors address the limitations of their method regarding the need for dense annotations and demonstrate its feasibility on more complex datasets. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore the implications of their findings with larger training datasets to assess the generalizability of their results.
