Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new Newton-type algorithm for entropic-regularized optimal transport (OT) that incorporates sparsification and safeguard techniques, achieving global convergence and local quadratic convergence. The authors propose a novel sparsification method for the Hessian matrix and adaptive mechanisms for hyper-parameter adjustment. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper is well-written, organized, and presents significant theoretical contributions.  
2. The proposed sparsification method is novel and ensures positive definiteness of matrices.  
3. The self-adaptive mechanism for hyper-parameter adjustment appears innovative.  
4. The numerical experiments demonstrate clear advantages in error performance and computational complexity.

Weaknesses:  
1. The safeguard mechanism is essentially a standard trust region technique.  
2. The scalability of the proposed method is limited, with experiments conducted on small feature dimensions.  
3. The experimental results seem cherry-picked, lacking comprehensive coverage of the datasets.  
4. There is no comparison with the SNS method, which could provide valuable context.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion around Theorem 2 by addressing the largest and smallest eigenvalues when using the original Hessian. Clarification is needed on what "safe" refers to in the context of Theorem 2 and the trust region update. Additionally, the authors should provide dimension information for the MNIST and ImageNet experiments, replicate results from the SNS paper, and explore the performance of their method with varying feature dimensions. Lastly, we suggest including a runtime analysis similar to the Sinkhorn algorithm to enhance the practical understanding of their method.
