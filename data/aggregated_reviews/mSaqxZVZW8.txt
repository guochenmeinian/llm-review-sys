Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel search strategy, SeeA*, which utilizes a selective sampling process to optimize node expansion during heuristic search. The authors propose that SeeA* theoretically outperforms A* search under specific assumptions, particularly when the heuristic value function significantly deviates from the true state value function. Experimental results demonstrate that SeeA* surpasses state-of-the-art heuristic search algorithms in problem-solving success rates and solution quality while minimizing node expansions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Theoretically, SeeA* shows improved efficiency over A* under certain assumptions.
- The paper provides extensive experimental validation across diverse applications in chemistry, circuit design, and puzzle-solving, showcasing the algorithm's efficiency.
- Multiple sampling strategies are employed to balance exploration and exploitation effectively.

Weaknesses:
- A significant amount of information is relegated to the appendix, including algorithm pseudocode and parameter results, which should be included in the main text.
- The theoretical analysis relies on strong assumptions, and the paper lacks a comprehensive examination of the other proposed sampling strategies.
- The experimental focus is primarily on synthetic search problems, limiting insights into real-world applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by moving critical content, such as the algorithm pseudocode and results of different parameters, from the appendix to the main text. Additionally, consider providing a more detailed theoretical analysis of the other sampling strategies beyond uniform sampling. To enhance practical relevance, we suggest conducting experiments on real-world domains with unreliable heuristics. Furthermore, clarify the termination condition in Algorithm 1 to prevent indefinite node expansion in cases where solutions may not exist. Lastly, addressing the potential drawbacks of the uniform sampling strategy and providing empirical evidence regarding the clustering strategy's performance would strengthen the paper.
