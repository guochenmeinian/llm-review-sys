Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents PriorBand, an extension of HyperBand that enhances hyperparameter optimization (HPO) for deep learning models by integrating expert priors and a novel sampling technique called the Ensemble Sampling Policy (ESP). The authors propose a weighting mechanism to balance three sampling distributions: random, locally random near the incumbent, and a prespecified prior. The empirical study indicates that PriorBand performs well across various benchmarks, fulfilling key requirements for practical HPO.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed algorithm is simple yet effective, demonstrating clear improvements over baseline methods.
- The paper is well-structured and written, with clear motivation and reproducibility efforts.
- Section 7.2 effectively shows that the ESP extends to other Successive Halving (SH)-based methods.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for the work may seem artificial, lacking a detailed explanation of how the proposed adjustments make hyperparameter optimization more practical in deep learning.
- The contributions appear incremental, primarily building on existing methods without introducing original ideas.
- There is insufficient discussion on the impact of incumbent-sampling on performance and the theoretical guarantees of Hyperband.
- The use of average relative rank for efficacy demonstration is questioned, as it does not indicate statistical significance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of how modifying the random sampling component of HyperBand can reduce costs associated with tuning deep learning models. Additionally, we suggest conducting ablation studies to investigate the individual contributions of the hyperparameters involved in the perturbation operation and the sampling methods. Clarifying the impact of incumbent-sampling on overall performance and addressing the theoretical guarantees of Hyperband in light of the proposed changes would strengthen the paper. Finally, we encourage the authors to rearrange the paper to include more informative figures in the main text and to refine the presentation of their findings regarding the desiderata for HPO methods.
