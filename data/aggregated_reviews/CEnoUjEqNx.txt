### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the convergence properties of no-swap-regret dynamics in symmetric two-player zero-sum games. The authors prove that in almost all such games, if both players utilize identical no-swap-regret algorithms with symmetric initializations, their joint strategy profiles will exhibit frequent-iterate convergence to a Nash equilibrium. The proof relies on two main lemmas: the first establishes that time-averaged convergence of symmetric action profiles leads to frequent-iterate convergence, and the second shows that almost all symmetric zero-sum games possess a unique Nash equilibrium. The paper also clarifies that no-swap-regret algorithms cannot be solely determined by the cumulative cost from the opposing player's strategy, contrasting with some no-regret algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is self-contained, providing a solid background on game theory and convergence notions.
- It is well-written, with clear and easy-to-follow proofs.
- The exploration of no-swap-regret dynamics and their convergence properties is novel and significant for the learning in games community.

Weaknesses:
- The paper's guarantees are weaker than those of existing algorithms that achieve last-iterate convergence to Nash equilibrium without the symmetry and uniqueness constraints.
- The abstract is misleading, claiming last-iterate convergence when only frequent-iterate convergence is demonstrated.
- The introduction suggests that agents can use any no-swap-regret algorithms, but the convergence requires identical algorithms and symmetric initializations, which limits its applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the abstract by accurately reflecting the nature of the convergence achieved, specifically emphasizing "frequent-iterate convergence." Additionally, we suggest expanding Section 4 to better articulate the significance of the main result and to connect it more effectively with the results in Section 3. It would also be beneficial to include results on the rates of convergence in terms of the swap regret guarantee and to address the implications of using non-identical no-swap-regret algorithms. Finally, we encourage the authors to define "frequent-iterate convergence" in the abstract to avoid confusion with traditional notions of "last-iterate convergence."
