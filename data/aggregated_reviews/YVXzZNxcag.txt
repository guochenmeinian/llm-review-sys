Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on how language models (LMs) recall factual knowledge by identifying circuits within the model's internals, specifically introducing the concept of a "Knowledge Circuit," defined as the smallest subgraph necessary for recalling specific factual knowledge. The authors propose a reverse-topological approach to trace information through the network, which has shown reliability in prior research. Through experiments, they demonstrate that these circuits can elucidate internal mechanisms for knowledge editing and model behavior interpretation, enhancing performance on test sets by isolating relevant knowledge from noise. The authors also analyze the impact of knowledge editing methods and address issues like hallucinations and in-context learning. A comparative analysis of the discovered circuit, a random circuit, and a complementary circuit indicates that the discovered circuit significantly contributes to knowledge recall.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The exploration of internal mechanisms of LMs' factual recall is significant for enhancing knowledge-related capabilities.
- The reverse-topological approach effectively isolates variable effects, enhancing causal inference.
- The methodologies and findings regarding the Knowledge Circuit provide a novel perspective and may inspire further research.
- The circuit-standalone performance metric is a standard and reliable method for validating the constructed circuits.
- The paper is well-structured and presents experimental details clearly, with strong evidence from comparative analysis.

Weaknesses:
- The findings largely confirm existing knowledge rather than offering new insights, as many discovered circuit components are already documented in prior literature.
- The methodology lacks technical depth, primarily applying standard causal mediation analysis without rigorous justification.
- The circuit-discovery method has acknowledged limitations, suggesting room for improvement and the need for updates based on emerging research.
- Interpretations of mechanisms are often subjective and insufficiently supported by statistical evidence, leading to questions about the robustness of the knowledge circuit construction method.
- The writing could be clearer, with certain terms and figures needing better explanations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the technical rigor of the methodology by providing a more detailed justification for the circuit discovery process and ensuring that results are consistent across different traversal orders. Additionally, we suggest incorporating insights from recent works aimed at enhancing circuit quality into the circuit-discovery method. We encourage the authors to include more formal definitions of key concepts such as mover head, relation head, and mixture head to enhance clarity. Furthermore, the authors should consider expanding the analysis of knowledge editing methods and providing a clearer context for their findings by incorporating relevant literature into the introduction. Finally, we advise improving the writing quality by clarifying terms and enhancing figure captions for better comprehension, as well as discussing the limitations of their approach to provide a clearer understanding of the challenges faced in circuit discovery.
