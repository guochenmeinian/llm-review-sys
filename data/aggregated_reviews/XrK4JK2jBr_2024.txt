Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a white-box approach to human-machine teaming (HMT) that allows human teammates to view and adjust their virtual counterpartsâ€™ policies. The framework utilizes differentiable decision trees and introduces contextual pruning for enhanced training and interpretability. The authors quantify the benefits of interpretability in HMT, exploring the tradeoff between interpretability and accuracy, and conduct a statistical analysis comparing white and black box conditions, culminating in guidelines for HMT.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel concept that significantly contributes to the field, emphasizing the importance of interpretability in HMT for fostering collaboration.
- It is well-written, with clear ideas and detailed reproducibility steps, supported by comprehensive statistical analysis.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed pruning strategy lacks empirical validation regarding its effectiveness in simplifying training and enhancing interpretability; time and memory usage assessments are recommended.
- The paper contains unsupported claims, particularly in the text, and lacks sufficient technical details about the methodologies and experimental design, making it difficult for readers to fully grasp the work.
- The human subject study has limitations, including potential population bias and unclear participant demographics, which may affect the generalizability of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the validation of the pruning strategy by providing time and memory usage assessments and IV1-C1 analysis with and without pruning. Additionally, the authors should substantiate unsupported claims with arguments or citations and clarify the technical details of their methodologies, including the size of the ICDTs used in the study. It would also be beneficial to address the population bias in the human subject study and explore the implications of participant demographics on the findings. Finally, enhancing the clarity of the evaluation metrics and linking the methodology with the experimental results would strengthen the paper's overall coherence.
