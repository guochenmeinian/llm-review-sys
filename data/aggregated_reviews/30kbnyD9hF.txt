### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method called "Exchange-of-Thought" (EoT) aimed at enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in mathematical and common-sense reasoning tasks. The authors propose four communication modes—debate, report, relay, and memory—to facilitate interaction among multiple LLMs, generating intermediate reasoning steps. Experimental validation demonstrates that this approach outperforms existing methods, showing significant improvements across nine datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a relevant issue by enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.  
- The interactive, multi-agent approach is novel and interesting.  
- Extensive experiments and analyses indicate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.  

Weaknesses:  
- Insufficient literature support for the communication modes, lacking references to relevant work in argumentation theory.  
- The communication modes are not utilized jointly, leading to a perception of multiple trivial ideas.  
- Clarity issues in figures, particularly Figure 3 and Figure 4, hinder understanding.  
- Careless writing and some inaccuracies in referencing prior work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by including references such as Parsons and McBurney (2003) to support the communication modes. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the joint utilization of the four communication modes to strengthen the paper's contributions. Enhancing the clarity of figures, especially Figure 3 and Figure 4, is crucial for better comprehension. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide a detailed analysis of the computational costs associated with EoT compared to standard CoT methods. Lastly, we advise correcting any inaccuracies in references, such as the mention of Wang et al. (2023) regarding Exchange-of-Thought prompting.
