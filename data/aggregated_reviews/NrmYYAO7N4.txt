### Key Points
This paper presents a novel technique named DocGen for data augmentation, which generates synthetic documents from queries through a three-step pipeline: "query expansion," "query highlighting," and document generation. The authors also introduce DocGen-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL) enhanced version that improves the keyword highlighting process. The performance of DocGen and DocGen-RL is evaluated against several benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements over existing data augmentation methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed methods show substantial performance improvements and are easy to reproduce.
- The combination of query highlighting and RL is innovative, with clear experimental results supporting the effectiveness of the approach.
- The paper is well-structured, providing comprehensive analyses and ablation studies.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks results from different models and qualitative analyses of generated documents.
- Presentation could be clearer, as some sections are verbose and contain repeated concepts.
- There are concerns about the reliance on specific models and the absence of comparisons with existing methods like Promptagator.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by addressing verbosity and ensuring that repeated concepts are minimized. Additionally, including results from various models and a qualitative analysis of generated documents would strengthen the findings. It would also be beneficial to clarify the rationale behind selecting only the top-1 document in the consistency filtering process and to consider including a Top-K analysis. Finally, addressing the computational cost of DocGen and DocGen-RL compared to previous methodologies would provide valuable insights.
