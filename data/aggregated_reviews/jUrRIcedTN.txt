Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel contrastive learning method for metaphor interpretation, introducing a new task focused on predicting highlighted aspects in metaphors. The authors propose a multitask learning scheme to jointly predict source domains and highlighted aspects, leveraging insights from linguistic research. The study shows that this approach can enhance predictive performance, although the results lack statistical significance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The newly proposed task is both novel and useful, deepening understanding in NLP and linguistic research.
- The paper is well-written and clear, with a detailed analysis of experimental results.
- Good conclusions, particularly in the "limitations" section.

Weaknesses:
- The contributions are limited, primarily focusing on a new task while the multitask learning approach lacks novelty, as it follows established methods in the NLP community.
- The experimental section includes only one baseline model, and results lack statistical significance, raising questions about their robustness.
- The narrow focus on a specific corpus with limited annotations restricts broader applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the statistical analysis of their results to validate the significance of their findings. Additionally, consider expanding the experimental comparisons beyond a single-task baseline to include more diverse models. Address the inter-annotator agreement issues in the dataset and acknowledge the limitations of using a single dataset in the limitations section. Finally, clarify the contributions of the multitask setups to enhance the paper's overall impact.
