Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the release of multi-agent offline data derived from various environments, including SMAC, MaMuJoCo, Pettingzoo, Flatland, VoltageControl, and CityLearn. The datasets cover a broad spectrum of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) aspects, such as different behavior policies, scenarios with partial information, and both continuous and discrete action spaces. The primary goal is to provide a reliable resource for the research community, facilitating advancements in the field and serving as an accessible starting point for newcomers. Additionally, the authors propose a comprehensive offline MARL benchmark that addresses the need for standardized datasets, extending beyond conventional game-like environments. The paper is well-written and offers a comprehensive analysis of prior research and related datasets, although concerns are raised regarding the implementation of the OMAR baseline and its performance compared to CQL and other related works.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The datasets encompass a wide range of MARL aspects and environments, facilitating thorough evaluations.
- The paper is clearly written and well-structured, enhancing comprehension.
- It provides initial baseline results and benchmarks for various MARL algorithms.
- The paper addresses the need for standardized offline MARL benchmarks, enhancing its applicability to the research community.

Weaknesses:
- The practical utility of the datasets is questionable, particularly in benchmarking MARL algorithms across diverse real-world environments.
- The datasets are exclusively generated by online MARL policies, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios.
- The implementation of the OMAR baseline is questioned, with issues such as missing functions and installation challenges.
- There are discrepancies between the authors' findings and those reported in prior works regarding OMAR's performance, raising concerns about the reliability of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the practical applicability of the datasets by providing examples that showcase how to effectively utilize them for benchmarking MARL algorithms in specific real-world contexts. Additionally, consider offering an API that allows users to generate their own datasets with various environments and configurations. It would also be beneficial to include data from other types of expert policies, such as human or heuristic controllers, to enhance the diversity and relevance of the datasets. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors improve the clarity of the discussion surrounding the discrepancies in OMAR's performance compared to prior works, possibly by including this information in the appendix to aid reader understanding. We also encourage the authors to address the concerns regarding the implementation of OMAR more thoroughly, ensuring that all necessary functions are defined and installation instructions are clear.
