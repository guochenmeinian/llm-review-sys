### Key Points
This paper presents a fairness-aware dataset for job recommendation in advertising, highlighting issues of bias in AI-driven ads and the challenges of maintaining fairness while adhering to privacy regulations. The authors detail the ad delivery process, identify potential bias sources, and propose a metric for measuring bias. The dataset, comprising approximately 1 million examples with 59 features, aims to foster research in algorithmic fairness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The problem of fairness in job recommendation is well-motivated and significant, given the impact of ads on user engagement.  
- The dataset is large, well-constructed, and provides a comprehensive overview of bias in advertising.  
- The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of the dataset's creation, limitations, and the implications of bias.  
- The authors acknowledge the limitations of their proxy for gender and discuss the challenges of inferring demographic information.  

Weaknesses:  
- The dataset's representation of real-world complexity is questionable, as it relies on a single dataset.  
- The introduction may overstate the dataset's generalizability across various domains beyond job advertising.  
- The clarity around certain features, such as the "Senior" field, is lacking, potentially leading to confusion about its definition.  
- There is a need for baseline experimental results to demonstrate the dataset's utility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification of the dataset's representativeness for real-world scenarios. Additionally, consider providing baseline experimental results to validate the dataset's effectiveness. It would be beneficial to explore alternative methods for inferring gender, such as analyzing social networks, and to estimate the accuracy of the proxy method. Furthermore, we suggest refining the introduction and conclusion to more accurately reflect the dataset's scope and significance, and to clarify the definitions and assumptions related to the dataset's features. Lastly, addressing minor typographical errors would enhance the overall quality of the paper.
