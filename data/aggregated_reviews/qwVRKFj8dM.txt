### Key Points
This paper presents a novel metric for comparing image representations across different models by leveraging the Fisher information matrix to assess sensitivity to local distortions. The authors propose a framework that defines "principal distortions" to differentiate between models and applies this method to both early visual system models and deep neural networks, demonstrating its utility in analyzing model behaviors.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method and problems are clearly and rigorously stated.
- The extension of eigen-distortions to the multi-model case is valuable and well motivated.
- The paper clearly explains the details of the framework and tests it on both simple models and deep neural networks.

Weaknesses:
- The figures in the experimental section are not referenced in the main text, affecting clarity and flow.
- The experiments are fairly simple and lack depth, with insufficient results to confirm improvements over previous methods.
- Insights from the experimental section are unclear, particularly regarding early visual models and the quantification of structuredness of noise in deep networks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by referencing figures in the main text. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the depth of the experiments by pushing evaluations toward more challenging scenarios, such as comparing early visual models with deep neural networks. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide deeper insights into the experimental results, particularly clarifying the key takeaways from early visual models and the structuredness of noise in adversarially trained networks.
