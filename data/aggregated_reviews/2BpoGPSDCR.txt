Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach leveraging score matching to reverse physical processes defined by forward stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The authors propose a method to deduce initial conditions from a given system state at time \( t=T \) by applying a reverse-time diffusion process, incorporating a reverse physics simulator and the score of the data distribution. The main contribution includes introducing both a 1-step and multi-step loss for training a network to learn the diffusion and score terms necessary for solving the reverse SDE. The authors demonstrate the equivalence of their training objectives to vanilla denoising score matching and a related variational objective in the multi-step case, supported by extensive experiments and ablation studies. Additionally, the authors introduce a method for solving inverse problems in time-evolved physical systems by integrating a time-independent reverse physics simulator with a learned time-dependent correction term, referred to as score matching via differentiable physics (SMDP). This method is evaluated on four physical systems, demonstrating superior performance compared to various baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The originality of considering the drift term in forward SDEs as a realistic physical process is commendable, establishing a connection between physics-defined differential equations and score-based models.
- The paper is well-structured, clearly explaining the task and proposed solution, with well-defined models and quantities.
- Extensive experiments grounded in real-world processes showcase superior performance compared to baselines, with well-illustrated figures enhancing clarity.
- The numerical evaluations effectively compare the method against baseline approaches like implicit score matching and other neural network models.
- The multi-step training regime for score estimation shows effectiveness in synthetic data applications.

Weaknesses:
- The loss in Eq (2) is deemed incorrect, as it should reflect \( x_m \) minus the right-hand side of Eq (1).
- There is insufficient discussion of prior work on the inverse problem, with related methods only mentioned towards the end. If no state-of-the-art methods exist for this problem, this should be explicitly stated.
- Some experimental details could be relegated to the appendix to allow more space for motivation and design choices, as section 2 currently lacks sufficient context.
- The central theoretical result regarding the equivalence of the correction term to the score function is not empirically verified, particularly in the discrete case. This verification should be attempted, especially for the simpler 1D toy problem.
- The organization of sections could be improved by first discussing typical score matching SDEs before introducing the physics-based formulation.
- Concerns regarding the memory expense of multi-step training are not adequately addressed.
- The relationship between forward and reverse simulators is unclear, particularly regarding the authors' claim of equivalence for decreasing time step \( \Delta t \).
- The tasks are closely aligned with practical applications, necessitating clearer explanations for non-expert readers.
- The novelty of the method is limited, as it primarily refines a standard reverse time-stepping simulation, suggesting a more in-depth analysis of the learned correction term could enhance its perceived contribution.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the loss function in Eq (2) to ensure it aligns with Eq (3) when expanded. Additionally, consider moving some experimental details to the appendix to enhance the focus on motivation and design choices in the main text. We suggest improving the discussion of related work on inverse problems, ensuring clarity on the novelty of their approach. We also recommend that the authors empirically verify the theoretical equivalence of the correction term to the score function, particularly for the simpler tasks. A more detailed description of the tasks and methodologies used, especially for non-expert audiences, would enhance accessibility. Addressing the memory concerns related to multi-step training in the main paper would strengthen the discussion. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the relationship between forward and reverse simulators to eliminate ambiguity in their claims and to explore a more thorough analysis of the learned correction term and its properties to bolster the paper's contribution.
