Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents TFS-NeRF, a template-free NeRF-based framework for 3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes, focusing on semantic reconstruction of both rigid and non-rigid entities. The authors employ an Invertible Neural Network (INN) for linear blend skinning (LBS) prediction and utilize semantic-aware ray sampling to enhance reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the method's efficiency and effectiveness in reconstructing complex interactions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized and easy to follow, with clear qualitative results demonstrating promising reconstruction performance.
- Experimental evaluations on multiple benchmarks and ablation studies highlight the unique contributions of design choices.

Weaknesses:
- The introduction lacks clarity, making it difficult to follow the storyline and understand the contributions.
- Key details regarding the generation of semantic masks and the separation process for deformable and non-deformable objects are missing.
- The reliance on existing methods (TAVA, INN) limits the novelty of the contribution.
- The paper does not adequately address the impact of input mask quality and pose accuracy on reconstruction results.
- The experimental results primarily focus on single entities, raising questions about the model's capability to handle multiple dynamic entities with complex interactions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction to better articulate the contributions of the paper. Additionally, please provide detailed explanations of the semantic mask generation process and the separation of points into deformable and non-deformable sets. It would be beneficial to include experiments addressing the robustness of the method to input mask quality and pose accuracy. We also suggest expanding the experimental results to include scenarios with multiple dynamic entities to validate the model's capabilities. Lastly, please clarify unclear expressions and formatting issues throughout the paper to enhance readability.
