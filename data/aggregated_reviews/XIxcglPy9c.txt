### Key Points
This paper presents LAMODY, a simulator for molecular dynamics operating within a latent space, achieving approximately a 20-fold speed improvement over traditional simulations. The authors propose a sophisticated SE(3)-invariant encoder-decoder architecture sensitive to chirality, alongside a recurrent neural network for modeling temporal dynamics. The results indicate that LAMODY accurately and rapidly reconstructs realistic trajectories and free energy surfaces, capturing essential dynamic and conformational features, marking a significant advancement in the field.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed method significantly accelerates the molecular dynamics process.  
- The empirical results demonstrate convincing speedup and generalizability.  
- The writing is clear, well-organized, and easy to follow.  
- The idea is novel and addresses an interesting problem of generalizing to unseen molecules.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks an intuitive concept figure to clearly delineate each step (encoding, propagation, decoding) and illustrate the role of each step.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology by including a more intuitive concept figure that clearly separates each step (encoding, propagation, decoding) and shows the role of each step.
