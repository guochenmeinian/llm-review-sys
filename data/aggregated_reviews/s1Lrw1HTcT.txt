Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an empirical study investigating whether ChatGPT can replace crowdsourcing for generating paraphrases in intent classification. The authors replicate a previous study (Larson et al., 2020) and find that ChatGPT produces higher diversity and comparable model robustness in data collection for intent classification. The study raises important questions about ChatGPT's capabilities in paraphrase generation and its potential as a cost-effective alternative to human workers.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides valuable insights into the use of ChatGPT for synthetic data generation, demonstrating its ability to yield diverse paraphrases.
- The experiments on lexical and syntactic diversity are well-executed, showing measurable improvements in out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets for intent classification.
- The limitations of the study are thoughtfully discussed, indicating a strong understanding of the research context.

Weaknesses:
- The investigation is limited in scope, focusing solely on intent classification without exploring other potential applications of ChatGPT.
- There is a lack of comparison with other open-source LLMs, which could provide additional insights into the effectiveness of ChatGPT.
- The writing lacks clarity in some areas, with inconsistent tense usage and vague explanations of certain methodologies.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors broaden the scope of their investigation to include a wider range of tasks beyond paraphrase generation. Additionally, we suggest that the authors compare ChatGPT's performance with other LLMs, such as GPT-3, Falcon, and Vicuna, to provide a more comprehensive analysis of its effectiveness. It would also be beneficial for the authors to explore other diversity-encouraging methods beyond taboo words and to consider using ChatGPT itself for intent classification to assess its direct applicability. Lastly, we advise improving the clarity of the writing by addressing the inconsistent tense usage and providing clearer explanations of methodologies, particularly regarding parameter design and validation processes.
