Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the performance of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) combined with hypernetworks in the context of meta-reinforcement learning (Meta-RL). The authors propose the RNN+HN method, which outputs neural network weights instead of a vector, and demonstrate its effectiveness against various baselines in gridworld and Mujoco environments. The study claims that RNN+HN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, outperforming more complex methods. New experiments also show that RNN+HN matches the performance of VI+HN on ML10, addressing previous concerns regarding the significance of results. The authors argue that their findings challenge the assumption that complex task-inference methods are necessary for competitiveness. However, the empirical evidence supporting the SOTA claim is limited, primarily focusing on two environments, and the authors have clarified their terminology regarding SOTA claims, emphasizing the difficulty of establishing benchmarks in meta-RL.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper presents a clear and novel approach by coupling RNNs with hypernetworks, which is well-articulated and supported by rigorous empirical experiments.
- The results indicate that RNN+HN outperforms many baselines, and the paper is well-written and structured, making it accessible to readers.
- The new experiments provide compelling evidence that RNN+HN can match or outperform existing methods in various environments, including MineCraft.
- The authors have addressed reviewer concerns regarding statistical significance and the interpretation of results from previous studies, particularly those by Beck et al. (2022).
- The authors conduct thorough hyperparameter tuning and include additional ablation studies in the appendix, contributing to the meta-RL field by challenging prevailing assumptions about the necessity of complex task-inference methods.

Weaknesses:
- The claims regarding RNN+HN being SOTA are overly strong given the limited empirical evaluation, which lacks sufficient external baselines and coverage of more complex environments.
- Some reviewers remain unconvinced about the significance of the performance gains and the changes made to the claims regarding SOTA.
- The reliance on the results from Beck et al. (2022) is questioned, as their findings were not statistically significant, which could mislead interpretations of performance comparisons.
- The paper does not adequately justify the choice of hyperparameters or the architecture details, leaving some aspects unclear.
- The analysis of why the proposed method achieves its performance could be further developed, and the reference formatting needs correction.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical evaluation by including more diverse environments, such as Meta-World and RLBench, to substantiate their claims. Additionally, they should consider comparing RNN+HN against established methods like MAML and PEARL to provide a more comprehensive assessment of its performance. We suggest improving the clarity of their statistical analyses, particularly in relation to the significance of performance differences. Furthermore, providing more detailed explanations of the hyperparameters used in the MineCraft experiments would enhance reproducibility. Clarifying the hyperparameter choices and providing more details on the architecture would enhance the paper's rigor. Lastly, we suggest revising the introduction and methods sections to emphasize that this is an empirical study rather than a novel method proposal, adding a summary table of the tested methods for clarity, and addressing minor issues such as reference formatting and providing a more detailed analysis of the hypernetwork component's contribution.
