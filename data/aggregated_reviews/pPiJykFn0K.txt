### Key Points
This paper presents a study on human-AI text co-creation for news headline generation, evaluating three interaction strategies: guidance, selection, and post-editing. The authors operationalize prior work by Cheng et al. (2022) in a real-world context, analyzing headline quality, task effort, and perceived control and trust. The study includes a dataset of human-rated headlines and aims to provide insights into effective assistance types for headline writing.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The exploration of human-AI text co-creation is timely and relevant, particularly with the rise of LLMs in writing tasks.
- The study is well-designed, with a controlled experimental setup and detailed presentation of results.
- It contributes a dataset of human-rated news headlines, which could be valuable for future research.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental analysis lacks depth, particularly regarding the effects of post-editing and the manual condition's low quality.
- The limited number of articles (20) and the lack of control over evaluators' rankings raise concerns about the robustness of the findings.
- The guidance variant is overly constrained, and subjectivity in headline quality preferences is not adequately addressed.
- The study's scale obscures significant trends, particularly in relation to task difficulty and participant experience.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the depth of discussion regarding experimental results, particularly addressing why post-editing has no significant effect and the low quality of the manual condition. Additionally, consider increasing the diversity of articles rather than the number of participants to enhance the analysis. It would be beneficial to allow participants more freedom in prompting or interacting with the model to better reflect realistic conditions. Lastly, we suggest addressing the subjectivity of headline quality more thoroughly and exploring how different models impact perceived difficulty and quality.
