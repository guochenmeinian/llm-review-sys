### Key Points
This paper presents a novel bias mitigation method aimed at addressing geographic biases in LLM-generated texts. The authors define "erasure" as the 'KL divergence' between true and predicted distributions for 'erased' sets, constructed using a user-defined threshold r. They probe four different LLMs across ten model sizes, finding that approximately 82.7% of countries do not experience erasure at r=3, while identifying ten countries consistently 'erased' across all models. The analysis suggests that the training data (the Pile) is a likely source of this erasure. The authors demonstrate that their metric can be utilized for fine-tuning to mitigate geographic biases with minimal impact on model performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study provides a compelling examination of geographic bias in LLMs, presenting a sound method and insightful analysis applicable across various models and sizes.
- The proposed measure for erasure is interpretable, computationally easy, and generalizable to other types of erasure, enhancing its utility for future research.

Weaknesses:
- The transferability of the proposed method to other biases is limited, particularly where ground-truth distributions are hard to obtain.
- The assertion that training data is a key source of geographical erasure is strong and requires further experimental validation to establish causation.
- The presentation of the ER measurement lacks interpretability, relying heavily on frequency and probability without sufficient elaboration.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the limitations section by addressing the transferability of their method to other biases. Additionally, we suggest hedging the claim regarding training data as a source of erasure, emphasizing the need for further experiments to establish causation. To enhance clarity, we encourage the authors to include a clear table summarizing experimental results and case studies, as well as to elaborate on the ER measurement for better interpretability. Finally, addressing the potential impact of stochasticity in model generation, such as temperature parameters, would strengthen the analysis.
