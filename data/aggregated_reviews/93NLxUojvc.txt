Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies the recommendation unlearning problem, focusing on the exact unlearning approach. The authors propose a redefined framework from an ensemble-based perspective, decomposing the error into three components. They introduce a new optimal balanced clustering algorithm to enhance efficacy and efficiency and simplify the model aggregator to improve overall performance. Extensive experiments are conducted on three real-world datasets to validate their approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The topic of recommendation unlearning is significant and timely, addressing a critical scenario in machine unlearning.  
2. The authors provide a theoretical foundation for their modifications, distinguishing their work from prior intuition-based approaches.  
3. The proposed optimal balanced clustering algorithm effectively addresses the trade-off between user similarity and shard balancing.  
4. The paper is well-organized and presents extensive experimental evaluations, including performance metrics for two unlearning goals and an ablation study.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The optimization process of Eq (5) lacks clarity; further details are needed to clarify its relationship to prior work.  
2. The time costs of the modified stages I and III do not significantly improve overall performance compared to stage II, raising questions about the overall impact.  
3. There are minor typographical errors present in the manuscript.  
4. The paper does not discuss approximate unlearning methods, which are relevant for efficiency in recommendation unlearning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the optimization process in Eq (5) by providing more details on its relationship to prior work. Additionally, it would be beneficial to discuss the time costs associated with the modifications in stages I and III to better contextualize their overall impact. We also suggest correcting the identified typographical errors and including a discussion on approximate unlearning methods to enhance the paper's relevance and comprehensiveness.
