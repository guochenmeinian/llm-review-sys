Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SETBENCH, a benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of large language models (LLMs) in performing set operations under various conditions. The authors analyze five LLMs and find that these models exhibit limited robustness when faced with analytical and lexico-semantic transformations. The benchmark focuses on a narrow set of four set operations, raising concerns about its comprehensiveness and applicability to broader tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant gap in LLM evaluation by focusing on robustness to variations in set operations and operands.
- It is well-structured, clearly written, and systematically executed, with a principled approach to varying parameters.
- The authors provide thorough experiments and detailed analyses, contributing valuable insights into the limitations of current LLMs.

Weaknesses:
- The scope of the benchmark is limited, focusing only on four set operations, which may not adequately represent the broader capabilities of LLMs.
- The use of a single prompt template restricts the variability needed to assess robustness effectively.
- There is insufficient justification for the exclusive focus on set operations over other mathematical operations, and the choice of accuracy as a metric may be too broad.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the benchmark by expanding the scope to include a wider range of mathematical operations and varying the prompt structures to enhance robustness evaluation. Additionally, providing a thorough justification for focusing on set operations compared to other mathematical tasks would strengthen the paper. We suggest incorporating a more nuanced metric than accuracy to better reflect real-world applications of set operations. Finally, exploring the relationship between model size and performance could yield valuable insights into the scalability of robustness measures.
