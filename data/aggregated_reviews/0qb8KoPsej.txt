Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on finding a maximum-weight basis of a matroid using a two-oracle model, incorporating both a clean oracle that provides accurate answers and a dirty oracle that may yield imprecise results. The authors propose an algorithm that minimizes the number of queries to the clean oracle while leveraging the free queries to the dirty oracle. The main result shows that the number of clean queries required interpolates between \(n - r + k\) and \(n(1 + 1/k)\), depending on error parameters that measure the quality of the dirty oracle. The paper also discusses improvements when using rank queries instead of independence queries and extends the results to the matrix intersection problem.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides essentially tight bounds and presents non-trivial algorithms that are clear and logically structured.
- The theoretical techniques are strong, with detailed proofs supporting the bounds on oracle calls.
- The two-oracle model is a significant advancement over traditional methods requiring \(n + 1\) clean calls.

Weaknesses:
- The improvement of the algorithm for independence queries relies on \(n - r\) being sub-linear in \(n\), raising questions about its practical applicability.
- The organization of the paper is confusing, with preliminary material included in the introduction and a lack of a conclusion.
- The paper lacks empirical experiments to validate the theoretical results, which diminishes its practical relevance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization of the paper by providing a clearer outline at the end of the introduction and potentially subdividing the lengthy introduction for better readability. Additionally, including empirical experiments or illustrative figures, such as a toy example of the algorithm, would enhance understanding of the proposed concepts. Finally, we suggest clarifying the terminology around "robust" algorithms to avoid confusion with established meanings in the optimization community.
