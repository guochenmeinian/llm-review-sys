Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an imitation learning method called Information Maximizing Curriculum (IMC), which models multi-modal behaviors using a mixture of experts (MoE) approach. IMC aims to avoid mode-seeking behavior by employing multiple model components that selectively focus on different data distributions while maximizing joint information projection. The authors provide extensive experiments in simulated robotics environments, demonstrating IMC's superior performance compared to major generative models and basic MoE methods. Additionally, the authors propose a method for learning policies through a mixture distribution approach, where the distribution is influenced by weights assigned to individual policies. They clarify the conditioning in their KL divergence minimization formulation and emphasize that their method does not require prior knowledge of the number of modes in the data distribution for setting the number of components, \(N_z\).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. IMC is a well-motivated approach for multi-modal density estimation, offering an elegant reverse KL-based solution.
2. The experiments across various low-dimensional control environments are extensive, with IMC outperforming significant generative models and addressing the mode-averaging issue effectively.
3. The visualization of learned trajectories clearly illustrates the distinct modes captured by IMC.
4. The authors provide a thorough explanation of their approach, enhancing understanding of the mixture distribution and its components.
5. They address technical concerns effectively, promising to include additional references, a convergence proof, and clarifications in the camera-ready version.
6. The planned visualizations and ablation studies will improve the presentation of results and insights into policy mixing behavior.

Weaknesses:
1. The presentation in the experiment section could be enhanced, as the subsections largely reiterate similar conclusions without emphasizing unique aspects of different environments or baselines.
2. The work closely resembles that of Li et al. (2023), lacking a direct comparison that would clarify the contributions of this paper. The authors should address this similarity to justify their work's novelty.
3. The paper's structure and notation require improvement for better clarity.
4. The method's reliance on knowing the number of modes in advance poses practical challenges, despite the authors' claims to the contrary.
5. Some technical details remain informal, which could hinder comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experiment section by emphasizing unique findings for different environments and baselines rather than repeating similar conclusions. Additionally, we suggest that the authors include a direct comparison with Li et al. (2023) to substantiate their contributions, either by demonstrating superior performance on shared tasks or by showcasing how IMC scales to more complex environments. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to improve the structure and notation of the paper to enhance clarity. To address the concern regarding hyperparameter selection, we recommend providing more explicit guidance on determining \(N_z\) without expert knowledge. Lastly, we advise adding a convergence proof and further technical details to support the claims made about the objective's behavior, as well as including visualizations and ablation studies to better illustrate the individual policies and curricula.
