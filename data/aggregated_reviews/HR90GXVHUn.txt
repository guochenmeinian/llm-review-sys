### Key Points
This paper presents REMEMO, a novel pretraining task designed to predict temporal relations between sentences in a document by identifying time tokens and constructing normalized time spans. The authors demonstrate that REMEMO significantly enhances the performance of the T5 model on various temporal question answering datasets. The framework aims to address the challenges of capturing complex temporal dependencies, which are often overlooked in existing approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed REMEMO framework effectively models complex temporal dependencies, providing a more nuanced understanding of temporal contexts.
- Experimental results show substantial performance improvements over the baseline T5 model, particularly in handling long-range temporal dependencies.

Weaknesses:
- The use of "Graph" to explain the method may confuse readers, as the motivation for identifying temporal relations could be presented more clearly.
- The comparison with existing methods, particularly TempT5, is insufficient, lacking a comprehensive evaluation against other state-of-the-art models.
- The approach for extracting temporal information is limited, as it primarily focuses on explicit timestamps and does not adequately address sentences without time tokens or ambiguous temporal expressions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their explanation regarding the use of "Graph" in the context of REMEMO. Additionally, the authors should include a more thorough comparison with existing temporal reasoning models to better contextualize their results. It is also crucial to discuss how REMEMO handles ambiguous or conflicting temporal information and to explore methods for assigning temporal relations to sentences lacking explicit timestamps. Finally, incorporating a discussion on the efficiency of REMEMO, including training time on various datasets, would enhance the paper's applicability to real-world scenarios.
