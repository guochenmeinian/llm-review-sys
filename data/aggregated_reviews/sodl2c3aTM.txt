Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) through online continual learning, addressing the challenge of GAN training instability. The authors propose a mechanism to detect when the discriminator's learning slows down and apply dynamic masking to its features, facilitating quicker adaptation to new data distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that this method outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) GANs and advanced diffusion models across multiple datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The method is well-explained and supported by a clear flow chart.
2. Promising results are evidenced by FID scores across various datasets.
3. The paper is well-organized and easy to follow, with a comprehensive review of related work.

Weaknesses:
1. The supplementary video is confusing and lacks clarity.
2. There is insufficient theoretical justification for the "Dynamically masked discriminator."
3. The notation in the method description is inconsistent, and the visualization results lack significant comparative analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the supplementary video and provide a more intuitive explanation or theoretical proof for the proposed "Dynamically masked discriminator." Additionally, we suggest including a comparison of the mean and variance between the proposed method and StyleGAN-2 in Figure 2, along with details on the number of samples used. Clarifying the feature maps in Figures 3 and 5 is essential, as is addressing the potential computational cost of the proposed method. Lastly, we encourage the authors to conduct an ablation study on the retardation detection mechanism and explore the implications of removing this detection in their training process.
