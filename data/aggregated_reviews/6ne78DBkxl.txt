### Key Points
This paper presents a new LLM for passage ranking method called DQL, which is shown to be effective through experiments. The authors propose a difficulty-based demonstration selection strategy to enhance passage reranking performance by utilizing few-shot examples. The work investigates the capacity boundaries of LLMs in this context and aims to improve a previous retrieval reranking method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed technique is simple and effective, providing a significant improvement in re-ranking performance under specific conditions.
2. The experiments conducted are helpful for future research and demonstrate state-of-the-art results.
3. The paper is well-written and effectively motivates the proposed approach.

Weaknesses:
1. The formal definition of DQL is lacking, and the detailed calculation process is not adequately explained.
2. The effectiveness of the method is verified on limited LLMs and datasets, which may not be convincing.
3. Many related works are missing, and there is insufficient analysis to justify the proposed demonstration selection strategy.
4. The contribution is not clearly articulated, and the variance of the proposed strategy compared to random selection is not demonstrated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the formal definition of DQL and elaborate on the detailed calculation process. Additionally, the authors should include comparisons with related works and provide in-depth analyses to substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed DBS. It would also be beneficial to clarify the rationale for using specific model architectures and to demonstrate the variance when using the Difficulty-based Selection strategy. Lastly, enhancing the description of the LLM re-ranking process and the proposed selection strategy with more detailed equations would aid reader comprehension.
