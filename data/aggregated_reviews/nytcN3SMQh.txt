### Key Points
This paper presents a study that explores the biological motivation for using weight decay as a mechanism for simulating neurodegeneration. The authors propose a detailed discussion regarding the high standard deviation in results observed at elevated levels of 'model injury'.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The authors effectively address notable comments from reviewers, enhancing the clarity and depth of their work. The incorporation of biological motivation strengthens the relevance of their findings.

Weaknesses:  
The paper may still require further elaboration on certain aspects to fully clarify the implications of the high standard deviation in results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the implications of the high standard deviation in results at high levels of 'model injury' to provide a clearer understanding of its impact on the study's conclusions.
