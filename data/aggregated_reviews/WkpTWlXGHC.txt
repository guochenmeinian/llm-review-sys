### Key Points
This paper presents a scalable dialogue state correction (DSC) model that addresses the error accumulation problem in dialogue state tracking (DST). The authors propose a T5-based transformer that identifies errors in DST outputs while treating the DST as a black box. The system is trained on the MultiWOZ dataset, augmented with induced slot errors, and shows comparable or slightly improved results over the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The proposed approach can be integrated as a post-processor with existing DSTs, demonstrating effectiveness across multiple models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation to address error accumulation in DST is clear and significant.
- The proposed model shows strong performance improvements and can be applied to various DST models.
- Empirical studies are rigorous, with multiple baselines and analyses of error types.

Weaknesses:
- The requirement for enumerated slot options and manually crafted templates raises concerns about scalability and generalizability to new datasets.
- The experiments are limited to a single dataset (MultiWOZ), which may not fully demonstrate the approach's applicability.
- Key details regarding the experimental setup and types of errors addressed are insufficiently explored.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how the proposed approach handles different types of errors, including a detailed analysis of error rates per domain/slot. Additionally, expanding experiments to include more diverse datasets, such as the Schema Guided Dialogue (SGD) dataset, would enhance the generalizability of the findings. It is crucial to clarify the experimental setup, particularly regarding the use of slots in MultiWOZ 2.2 compared to other datasets. Furthermore, addressing the practical limitations of using a DSC model, including latency and deployment challenges, would strengthen the paper. Lastly, we suggest revising the introduction to correct any inaccuracies regarding the use of dialogue history in existing DST approaches.
