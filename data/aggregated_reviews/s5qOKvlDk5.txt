### Key Points
This paper presents an algorithm, Prompt-enhanced Federated Content Representation (PFCR), aimed at addressing the privacy-preserving cross-domain recommendations problem. The authors propose a federated learning approach that utilizes local differential privacy, vector quantized item text, and prompt tuning. The algorithm consists of a pre-training stage where item text embeddings are learned through federated learning, resulting in a global code embedding table. The second training stage involves fine-tuning content representation using prompt encoding. The authors conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the algorithm against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is mostly easy to understand and applies federated learning to privacy-preserving cross-domain recommendations effectively.
- The authors conduct clear experiments that show the algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines.
- The work addresses significant limitations in previous methods and contributes technically to the privacy-preserving cross-domain recommendation task.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments on hyperparameters yield uninteresting results, particularly regarding the impact of small epsilon on performance. Further exploration of performance as epsilon approaches infinity may be warranted.
- The definition of neighboring datasets for the differential privacy guarantee needs clarification.
- The motivation for the work requires further elaboration, particularly regarding the reliance on atomic IDs.
- Some illustrations and figures lack clarity and sufficient explanation, which could hinder understanding.
- The experiments are not well explained, including the rationale for dataset selection and the testing of certain parameters.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for the work, particularly regarding the reliance on atomic IDs. Additionally, providing an illustrated example could enhance understanding of how natural language generality addresses the non-overlapping issue. The authors should further discuss the advantages of using description texts over pure IDs and elaborate on the limitations and application scope of their method. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors clarify the definitions and roles of various parameters and hyperparameters in the experiments, as well as ensure that all figures and illustrations are adequately explained. Finally, addressing any inconsistencies in the text and ensuring a unified format for references would enhance the overall quality of the paper.
