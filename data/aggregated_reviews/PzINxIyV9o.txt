### Key Points
This paper presents the InterFair framework, which iteratively incorporates user feedback to reduce model reliance on biased input features. InterFair utilizes a large language model (GPT-3) to convert open-ended user feedback into per-token bias weights and updates model rationales through differentiation. The results indicate that user interactions enhance the comprehensiveness and sufficiency of model rationales without sacrificing prediction performance in named entity recognition tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and intuitively structured.
- The motivation for incorporating human feedback into model decision-making is clearly articulated.
- The proposed methodology is novel and shows potential for improving model performance and bias mitigation.

Weaknesses:
- The background section lacks an overview of previous debiasing methods, making it difficult to assess the novelty of the proposed approach.
- The evaluation metrics and baselines are not clearly defined, complicating interpretation of results.
- The mechanism for incorporating feedback is ambiguously described, and the absence of code or detailed appendices hinders reproducibility.
- The choice of natural language feedback over direct token editing is not well justified, and details regarding the human study are insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the background section by including an overview of previous debiasing methods to clarify the novelty of their approach. Additionally, a thorough description of the evaluation metrics and baselines should be provided to enhance interpretability. The authors should also clarify the feedback incorporation mechanism, ensuring that it is specific and reproducible. Justifying the choice of natural language feedback over simpler methods would strengthen the rationale for their experimental design. Finally, providing more details about the human study, including participant backgrounds and feedback distribution, would enhance the paper's rigor.
