### Key Points
This paper investigates latent post-treatment bias in causal models involving proxy variables for latent confounders and post-treatment variables. The authors derive a general form of latent post-treatment bias, which is often intractable, and propose an identifiable VAE-based causal inference algorithm under the assumption that at least one dimension of each sufficient statistic of the latent prior is invertible. The proposed method, evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrates its capability in causal effect estimation amidst latent confounders and post-treatment variables.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a significant issue in causal inference, particularly with observational data.  
- The necessary assumptions for the identifiability of true latent variables are clearly articulated, and the reasoning behind the dimensions of $\boldsymbol{C}$ and $\boldsymbol{M}$ is well presented.  
- The theoretical foundation of the proposed method is robust, and the experimental analysis is comprehensive, comparing multiple benchmarks.  

Weaknesses:  
- The illustrative example in the introduction lacks explicit specification of the post-treatment variable.  
- Existing works on identifying latent confounders based on the iVAE architecture are not referenced.  
- The role of post-treatment variables $\boldsymbol{M}$ is ambiguous, particularly regarding the validity of Theorem 4.1 across different relationships with $Y$.  
- Assumption 3's illustration is somewhat confusing, requiring further clarification on the extra degree of freedom concerning the prior parameters of $\boldsymbol{Z}$.  
- The empirical evaluation is limited to one real-world dataset, which restricts the generalizability of the proposed method.  
- The paper relies on strong assumptions that may be difficult to verify in practical scenarios, and the experimental setup lacks sufficient detail.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the illustrative example by explicitly specifying the post-treatment variable. Additionally, they should include relevant existing works on latent confounders in the related work section. To address the ambiguity of the role of post-treatment variables $\boldsymbol{M}$, the authors should clarify the applicability of Theorem 4.1 across various relationships with $Y$. Further explanation regarding Assumption 3's illustration would enhance understanding. Expanding the empirical evaluation to include multiple real-world datasets would strengthen the applicability of the proposed method. Lastly, the authors should provide more detailed information about the experimental setup and discuss the limitations and potential societal impacts of their work more thoroughly.
