### Key Points
This paper presents BlockDFL, a blockchain-based federated learning framework designed to address issues such as privacy leakage and poisoning attacks prevalent in traditional federated learning models. The authors implement a PBFT-based voting mechanism and a two-layered scoring system to enhance the resilience of the framework against malicious participants. Experimental results indicate that BlockDFL achieves comparable efficiency and scalability to traditional federated learning while tolerating up to 40% malicious users.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper proposes a decentralized framework that effectively addresses key issues in federated learning, including malicious nodes and privacy concerns.
- Comprehensive experiments quantitatively evaluate the framework's performance against malicious nodes and qualitatively compare it with other decentralized solutions.
- The writing quality is high, making the paper accessible and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- Key components, such as the threat model and threat to validity, require more explicit discussion to clarify the framework's limitations and the capabilities of malicious users.
- The evaluation lacks a quantitative analysis of privacy leakage protection, which is only discussed textually.
- The choice of datasets (MNIST and CIFAR-10) raises concerns about generalizability, and the paper does not benchmark against FHE- or MPC-based solutions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the threat model and include a section on the threat to validity to better illustrate the limitations of their work. Additionally, we suggest conducting quantitative experiments to evaluate the protection against privacy leakage. The authors should also consider using more complex datasets to enhance the generalizability of their findings and benchmark BlockDFL against FHE- and MPC-based solutions to provide a clearer understanding of its trade-offs. Furthermore, clarifying ambiguous statements and improving the analysis of experimental results will strengthen the paper's conclusions.
