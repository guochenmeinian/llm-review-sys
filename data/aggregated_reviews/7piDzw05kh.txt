**Key Points:**
We find that the paper presents an impressive Automatic Data Engine (AIDE) that utilizes vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) to automate the data engine pipeline for open-world object detection in autonomous driving. The authors effectively tackle the challenge of continuous model improvement for the long-tailed distribution of objects on the road, and their system shows significant advancements over existing methods.

**Strengths and Weaknesses:**
We appreciate the authors' identification of a crucial problem in autonomous driving and their systematic approach through AIDE. The integration of VLMs and LLMs across various components is a clever application, and the experiments demonstrate substantial improvements while reducing labeling costs. However, we note that the paper lacks a thorough discussion of the limitations and potential failure modes of the AIDE system, particularly regarding the reliability of the VLM and LLM components. Additionally, while human oversight is mentioned, more details on the human-in-the-loop aspects would enhance the paper. The explanation of how the individual components of AIDE work together could also be more intuitive.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
We suggest that the authors provide a more comprehensive discussion of the limitations and failure modes of the AIDE system. Including more details on the human-in-the-loop aspects would strengthen the paper, as would a clearer explanation of the cohesive functioning of the individual components. Addressing these minor points in the camera-ready version would improve the overall quality of the work.
