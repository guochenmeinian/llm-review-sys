### Key Points
This paper presents a novel online PCA-based algorithm to solve self-consistent field (SCF) equations, a type of nonlinear generalized eigenvalue problem relevant in quantum chemistry. The authors propose a connection between the SCF equations and PCA, demonstrating improved convergence over traditional fixed-point iteration methods. The method shows promising results on the QM9 dataset, achieving convergence for all tested molecules, albeit requiring 2-3 times more iterations than existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and addresses an important problem in computational science, specifically in quantum chemistry.  
- The proposed method demonstrates superior performance in a theoretical case study and shows clear improvements in convergence rates compared to existing baselines.  

Weaknesses:  
- The contribution to machine learning and data science is not clearly articulated, making it appear more relevant to computational science.  
- The experimental comparisons are limited to a single dataset and baseline, lacking a broader context within quantum chemistry.  
- Certain sections, such as the algorithm boxes and the explanation of the role of F in Figure 2, are confusing and require clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion in the conclusion to better articulate how this work contributes to machine learning. Additionally, we suggest expanding the experimental section to include comparisons with a wider range of existing methods, such as RMM-DIIS and Blocked Davidson iterations, to strengthen the case for the proposed approach. Clarifying the significance of the convergence rates in the context of quantum chemistry and addressing the confusion in the algorithm boxes and Figure 2 would enhance the paper's clarity and impact.
