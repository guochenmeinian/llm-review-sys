### Key Points
This paper presents a study on three types of factor graph inference for planning, specifically focusing on their connection to optimal planning. The authors utilize the well-known $\exp(\lambda R(x, a, x'))$ factor and explore MAP inference, marginal inference, and marginal MAP inference, establishing their relationships to the dual LP formulation of MDPs. Additionally, the authors propose a framework for understanding probabilistic planning through variational inference, encompassing marginal, MAP, and marginal MAP (MMAP) inference to compare their effectiveness in bounding optimal expected rewards. The experiments investigate the interplay between MDP stochasticity and inference approximation to optimal planning, validating the theoretical claims made in the paper. The authors introduce a new variational objective, $F_\text{planning}(q)$, which generalizes the maximization of expected cumulative reward and contrasts with existing inference objectives.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- **Originality & significance**: The paper introduces original concepts in the "planning as inference" literature, particularly the connection between variational and dual LP formulations, and the notion of "reactivity."
- **Quality & clarity**: The writing is clear, with well-defined notation and exposition, making it accessible to those familiar with the field. The main narrative and results are clearly articulated and comprehensible.
- **Experimental validation**: The experiments are diverse and well-justified, with results that substantiate the theoretical assertions. The paper adequately covers related work.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a limitations section and does not adequately discuss the computational costs or weaknesses of the proposed inference techniques.
- The clarity of the paper is a significant weakness; it could be more self-contained with better motivation and explanation in certain sections, rather than relying on appendix references. Some equations and technical details appear ambiguous and poorly defined.
- The exposition could be improved for broader accessibility, particularly in the introduction and background sections, which currently lack sufficient references and context.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the exposition by expanding the introduction to include more context on the standard notion of maximizing expected cumulative reward. The authors should consider moving some discussions from the Related Work section into the introduction to better motivate their variational formulation. Additionally, we suggest reorganizing the paper to first introduce $F_\text{planning}(q)$ as a variational objective before discussing practical optimization methods.

To enhance clarity, we recommend that the authors provide definitions for some notation in the variational inference section, specifically defining what a factor graph is and explaining the function $\langle \cdot \rangle_{q}$ in the 'energy term'. It would also be beneficial to clarify the types of $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{x}$ in Eqn. 1, and to correct the phrase in line 114 to "never access the full joint." The motivation for the Bethe approximation should be introduced earlier instead of referring to the appendix.

Furthermore, the term $H_{\text{Bethe}}$ should be consistently used in the equations, and in Sec 3.3, the sum should not range over $a_t$ if it is defined as the argmax of $Q(x_t, a_t')â€”either bring the equality out of the equations or remove the $a_t$ terms. We suggest adding an explanation of $H_{\text{MDP}}$ as normalized entropies with an additional sentence rather than referring to the appendix. Lastly, ensure that all terms such as $N_e, N_a, N_s$ are defined and clarify whether $H_{\text{MDP}}$ is a new metric or an established one, as there appears to be no reference associated with it. Clarifying theoretical claims, particularly regarding the ranking of inference types and the implications of their findings for the planning community, would enhance the rigor of the paper. We also recommend including a discussion of the computational costs associated with the VBP technique and addressing the role of the $\lambda$ risk parameter more thoroughly in the main text. Lastly, providing derivations for the variational identities in Table 1 and clarifying notational choices would strengthen the paper's clarity and rigor.
