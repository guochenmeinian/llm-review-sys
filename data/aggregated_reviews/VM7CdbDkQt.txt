### Key Points
This paper presents a sensitivity analysis of Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) for galaxy clustering, aiming to scale SBI approaches to future galaxy clustering surveys. The authors evaluate three model types: gravity, halo, and galaxy models, revealing that simulations can be unreliable when building a data-model on small scales. The findings indicate SBI's resilience to changes in the gravity model, regardless of whether accurate N-body or faster particle mesh simulations are used. However, biases can arise from perturbations in halo identification methodologies, and training SBI on complex models yields better inferences than training on simpler models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The research background and motivation are comprehensive and accessible.
2. Extensive experiments and ablation studies provide convincing results and discussions.
3. The findings offer exciting insights that may inspire further research in related fields.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty is limited as all six models utilized are existing methods.
2. None of the models incorporate deep learning techniques, raising questions about potential improvements through such methods.
3. The authors claim that "inference in the current setup is not sensitive to changing the gravity model between N-body and particle mesh simulations," but do not explain the reason for this behavior.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their work by exploring deep learning methods that could enhance performance. Additionally, we suggest that the authors address the reasoning behind the insensitivity of inference to changes in the gravity model, as highlighted in the reviews.
