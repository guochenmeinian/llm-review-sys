Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to topological optimization using diffeomorphic interpolation to address the sparsity and inefficiency of gradient descent in topological data analysis (TDA). The authors propose optimizing point clouds by transforming sparse gradients into smooth vector fields, assigning exponentially decaying weights to each point with a gradient. This method allows for a larger set of points to be optimized in each iteration, accelerating convergence, particularly when combined with subsampling techniques. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through experiments showcasing its fast convergence and applicability to various topological loss functions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method significantly accelerates the optimization of topological loss, addressing a common issue in practical applications.
2. Diffeomorphic interpolation provides a descent direction for the topological loss, supported by a smoothness bound.
3. The method is particularly efficient with subsampling techniques, leading to faster convergence and reduced computation time.
4. The integration of topological information into the latent space of a pre-trained autoencoder is a novel contribution.

Weaknesses:
1. The application of the proposed method to topological registration losses is not experimentally demonstrated, raising concerns about stability in optimization.
2. The theoretical results lack intuitive explanations, particularly regarding Proposition 2, and guarantees for discrete steps are missing.
3. The choice of bandwidth for the Gaussian kernel, a critical hyperparameter, is not discussed, and its impact on results is unexplored.
4. The experimental setup relies heavily on toy examples, lacking real-world applications that would enhance the paper's strength.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of theoretical results by providing intuitive explanations in the main text, particularly for Proposition 2. Additionally, the authors should explore and discuss the implications of discrete step guarantees for their method. A thorough examination of the impact of different bandwidth choices on the results should be included, along with a heuristic for selecting the bandwidth. Finally, we suggest incorporating real-world applications in the experimental setup to strengthen the paper's contributions and relevance.
