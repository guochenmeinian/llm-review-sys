### Key Points
This paper presents a privacy-preserving cardinality counting algorithm that integrates Bloom Filter Encoding, Locally Differentially Private Data Encoding, and a DP-perturbed federated K-Means approach. The authors propose a solution that addresses privacy concerns in cardinality counting, which is vital for sectors like web mining, marketing, cybersecurity, and healthcare. The study emphasizes the importance of privacy during the counting process, which is often overlooked in existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research problem is well-motivated and relevant.
- The paper is well-written, easy to follow, and provides sufficient background information.
- The method is tested on both real-world and simulated datasets, demonstrating robustness.

Weaknesses:
- Key technical details require clarification, particularly regarding the privacy guarantees of the federated K-means clustering.
- There is a lack of practical guidance on hyperparameter selection, which is crucial for balancing estimation accuracy and privacy.
- The paper does not analyze the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm or provide a convergence guarantee.
- Limited discussion of related works and existing literature, which undermines the novelty of the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the technical details, especially regarding the privacy-preserving guarantees of the federated K-means clustering. Additionally, the authors should provide practical guidance on hyperparameter selection, including empirical results on how the number of clusters affects model utility and efficiency. A theoretical analysis of the computational complexity and a convergence guarantee for the proposed algorithm are also necessary. Furthermore, we suggest including a more comprehensive review of related works to strengthen the positioning of the current study and to better highlight its novelty.
