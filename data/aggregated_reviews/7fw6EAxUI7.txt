Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents RIPOR (Relevance-based Identifiers for Prefix-Oriented Ranking), a framework aimed at enhancing generative retrieval models by addressing challenges associated with large-scale data. The authors propose a prefix-oriented ranking optimization algorithm and relevance-based document ID construction, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing generative models and competitive results against state-of-the-art dense retrieval models. The paper includes thorough experiments on standard benchmarks like MS MARCO and TREC DL, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The novel prefix-oriented ranking optimization and relevance-based document ID construction effectively address key limitations of existing generative retrieval models.
2. The methodology significantly outperforms state-of-the-art generative retrieval models on standard benchmarks.
3. The paper is well-organized, with clear writing and thorough ablation studies that analyze the proposed components.

Weaknesses:
1. The complexity and computational cost of the model are not adequately discussed in comparison to other baselines.
2. The related work section lacks comprehensiveness, failing to include significant works that could serve as relevant baselines.
3. The reported results on MSMARCO Dev appear inconsistent with existing literature, raising concerns about the accuracy of baseline metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section by providing a more comprehensive review of significant prior research in generative retrieval. Additionally, please clarify the complexity and computational costs associated with the proposed model compared to other baselines. We suggest including detailed experimental results that demonstrate model performance after each round of fine-tuning to elucidate the contributions of each stage. Furthermore, please address the discrepancies in reported metrics for baseline models and provide evidence of scalability beyond the MS MARCO dataset. Lastly, we encourage the authors to share their code to enhance reproducibility and facilitate further research.
