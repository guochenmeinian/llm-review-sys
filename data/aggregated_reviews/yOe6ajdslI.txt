Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for maximizing the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) in binary classification problems affected by positive distribution shifts. The authors propose a novel approach that utilizes positive and unlabeled data from the training distribution, along with unlabeled data from the test distribution, to effectively address this challenge. The method is theoretically grounded and validated through experiments on four real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed setting is novel and practical for AUC optimization, particularly in contexts where positive data distribution is diverse or time-varying.
- The method is well-presented, with clear derivations and explanations that make it easy to understand and implement.
- The experiments convincingly validate the proposed method's effectiveness across multiple datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The performance on the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets is not significant, and the authors provide no explanation for this inconsistency.
- The comparison with the latest methods in the field is insufficient, lacking evaluations against works such as "Positive-Unlabeled Learning with Label Distribution Alignment" (TPAMI 2023) and others.
- The theoretical derivations rely solely on the sigmoid surrogate loss, raising questions about the applicability of the results to other loss functions, such as square loss.
- There are typographical errors present in the text.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation regarding the performance discrepancies observed in the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets. Additionally, we suggest a more comprehensive comparison with recent methods in the literature to strengthen the paper's contributions. The authors should also explore the extension of their theoretical results to other loss functions beyond the sigmoid surrogate loss. Lastly, we advise correcting the identified typographical errors to enhance the overall clarity and professionalism of the paper.
