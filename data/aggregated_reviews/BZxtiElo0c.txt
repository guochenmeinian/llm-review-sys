Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a benchmark dataset named GeSS, which encompasses particle physics, materials science, and biochemistry to explore the out-of-distribution (OOD) problem. The authors define the OOD problem through three scenarios: no OOD information, only unlabeled OOD data, and OOD data with a few labels. They evaluate three geometric deep learning (GDL) backbones—EGNN, DGCNN, and Point Transformer—using 11 different learning algorithms. The comprehensive analysis provides insights for addressing domain shifts in the future and includes both simulation and experimental data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a detailed analysis of the Domain Shift problem across three specific categories.
- It addresses various scientific applications, highlighting common issues in GDL applications.
- The inclusion of three backbones and 11 learning algorithms makes the study comprehensive.
- The experimental design is detailed, with extensive empirical evaluations revealing the complexity of the problem.

Weaknesses:
- The paper contains numerous acronyms, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the topic; a table of acronyms or explanations would be beneficial.
- A datasheet is missing, which would enhance the completeness of the work.
- The motivation behind the benchmark is unclear, and the authors could better highlight its key contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by including a table of acronyms or providing explanations for them. Additionally, including a datasheet would greatly enhance the completeness of the work. The authors should also consider providing more details on the simulation and experimental datasets, as well as the motivations for selecting the GDL baseline models. Finally, reorganizing the paper to clearly highlight the benchmark's key contributions and designs would strengthen the overall presentation.
