Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework for monocular depth estimation, introducing a frequency domain-based method that formulates the task as a progressive regression in the discrete cosine domain. The authors propose two modules: the PPH module for progressively estimating higher-frequency coefficients and the PFF module that employs a DCT-based downsampling technique to reduce information loss while integrating multi-scale features. The method is validated on the NYU-Depth-V2, TOFDC, and KITTI datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-organized, and the concept is easy to understand.
2. The results are presented clearly, and the discrete cosine domain-based design offers a promising paradigm in depth estimation.
3. The proposed method is interpretable and outperforms prior work across multiple datasets with comparable or fewer parameters.

Weaknesses:
1. The claim of global-to-local depth estimation as a contribution is common in existing literature, lacking novelty.
2. Some descriptions in Section 3.2 are confusing, particularly regarding the grouping strategy and its implications.
3. The DCT-based downsampling technique is not adequately explained.
4. Comparisons with state-of-the-art methods are insufficient, as the paper does not include recent works that could provide valuable context.
5. The depth predictions in Fig. 3 appear identical and should be replaced with actual experimental results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 3.2 by elaborating on the grouping strategy and its implications. Additionally, we suggest providing a more thorough explanation of the DCT-based downsampling technique. To enhance the robustness of the comparisons, we encourage the authors to include more recent state-of-the-art methods in their evaluations and to clarify the depth prediction results in Fig. 3. Finally, we advise focusing on more decimal places in the comparison tables and including publication years and venues for the compared methods to provide better context.
