Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel protein fitness prediction model, the Sequence-Structure-Surface (S3F) model, which integrates protein sequence information from a protein language model, structure information processed through a Geometric Vector Perceptron (GVP), and surface information from the dMaSIF model. The authors claim that S3F outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on zero-shot protein function prediction and demonstrates the benefits of incorporating structure and surface information alongside sequence data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of protein sequence, structure, and surface information is a significant advancement in protein fitness prediction, showing improvements on benchmarks.
- The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations and extensive experimental results that enhance understanding of the model's performance.
- The results indicate that modeling surface information explicitly improves function prediction beyond existing methods.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks adequate references to prior work on similar topics, particularly regarding multimodal fusion and protein surface representation learning, which diminishes its novelty.
- Performance improvements are marginal compared to existing methods, raising questions about the significance of the surface representation.
- Important relevant works are missing, and the methodology for generating surface representations raises concerns about accuracy and potential biases.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by including relevant studies such as GearNet, ProteinINR, and PPIFormer to provide a more comprehensive context for their work. Additionally, a fair comparison with these methods is necessary to substantiate claims of novelty. 

We suggest conducting further experiments to analyze the sensitivity of results to various hyperparameters and to clarify the importance of surface information through additional ablation studies. 

We also recommend addressing the concerns regarding the surface generation methodology, specifically the implications of ignoring side-chain atoms and the randomness introduced by the dMaSIF algorithm. 

Lastly, we advise the authors to clarify the terminology used in the title and throughout the paper, ensuring that "multi-modality" is accurately represented in the context of their work.
