### Key Points
This paper presents a method called AlignedCut, which aims to discover shared visual feature spaces across networks by aligning these spaces with neural responses from human brains. The authors propose that channel-wise responses to images can be aggregated to form feature clusters based on functional connectivity, with the universal feature space defined by neural responses. Additionally, the paper introduces a Nystrom-like approximation to enhance the speed of spectral clustering analysis. The method utilizes spectral clustering to visualize how figure-ground segmentation is represented across various models, revealing insights into the emergence of visual concepts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The AlignedCut method is innovative and provides a unique approach to interpretability by linking visual features to neural responses.
- The use of spectral clustering effectively groups features into meaningful clusters, particularly for vision transformers (ViTs).
- The authors present thorough analyses that bolster confidence in their claims.
- The paper contains significant work, contributing to the interpretation of deep learning models using brain data.

Weaknesses:
- The necessity of aligning features to the brain is unclear; the authors should clarify what insights this alignment provides over aligning features across networks.
- Many results lack robustness checks, raising concerns about the reliability of findings, particularly in figures showing neural response differences.
- The focus on ViTs limits the generalizability of the findings; including results from high-performing CNNs would enhance the paper's impact.
- The methodological details are difficult to understand due to the use of numerous terms and concepts without adequate explanation, which may stem from the authors' inexperience or assumptions about the readers' familiarity with the subfield.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the necessity for aligning features to the brain, potentially exploring whether aligning features across networks could yield similar insights. Additionally, we suggest incorporating robustness checks, such as permutation tests, to validate the significance of the observed differences in neural responses. To broaden the applicability of their findings, the authors should include analyses from high-performing CNNs to compare results with those from ViTs. Furthermore, we advise enhancing the introduction to clearly outline the clustering procedure and its relevance to the study's goals, as well as providing more methodological details in the main text and referencing the appendix appropriately. 

To enhance understanding, we recommend that the authors provide thorough explanations of the terms and concepts used, specifically addressing the following questions:  
1. Clarify the similarities and differences between this work and Yang et al.'s 2024 study.  
2. Define "early" and "late" brain in figure 2's caption and explain the levels of segmentation.  
3. Elaborate on the hypotheses mentioned between lines 42-49.  
4. Clarify how channel responses relate to receptive fields in deeper layers.  
5. Provide experimental evaluations demonstrating the computational speed-ups from the Nystrom-like approximation.  
6. Explain "using brain encoding as supervision" and the term "meanings" in computational terms.  
7. Detail the contributions from points 2 and 3 in lines 77-81.  
8. Specify what "features across different models" refers to in section 2.  
9. Define "brain response prediction" and its sources.  
10. Clarify "all levels of semantics" and their relation to "rich representations."  
11. Move the "Brain Dataset" discussion to the experiments section and clarify the data preprocessing steps.  
12. Describe the training procedures, including dataset usage and hyperparameter selection.  
13. Explain the transformation $V_iW_i$ in the context of "channel alignment" and its implications.  
14. Address how 3D brain voxels were derived from 4D fMRI signals.  
15. Clarify the reference to "the" graph in lines 125 and 126.  
16. Define "brain scores" and "brain prediction scores" in section 2.3.  
17. Specify what equation 5 is "added" to.  
18. Clarify what is meant by "extracted features" in lines 165.  
Additionally, we encourage the authors to discuss the potential negative impacts of their work in the Conclusion section.
