Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a gauge equivariant method for simulating partial differential equations (PDEs) on mesh surfaces, introducing a novel architecture called Hermes that employs non-linear message passing. The authors propose that this integration of gauge-equivariance with non-linear message passing is crucial for object-relational reasoning and modeling complex surface dynamics, extending beyond existing convolutional and attentional architectures. They compare their method against existing frameworks, demonstrating its effectiveness across various applications, including shape correspondences and PDE modeling, while emphasizing the significance of making message passing networks gauge-equivariant to broaden the design space of neural networks for meshes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem addressed is significant, and the proposed architecture is a logical progression from prior works.
- The integration of gauge-equivariance with non-linear message passing is a novel contribution that enhances modeling capabilities.
- The presentation is clear, with well-structured descriptions and properly designed experiments that highlight the method's benefits.
- The paper provides a clear distinction between linear and non-linear message passing, supported by relevant references.
- The inclusion of code enhances reproducibility and accessibility.
- The evaluation includes various state-of-the-art baselines for comparison, strengthening the assessment of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the contribution is limited, as it primarily integrates non-linear activations into existing frameworks without substantial new insights.
- The method's performance is inconsistent, particularly on certain datasets like FAUST, and lacks comprehensive comparisons with standard benchmarks.
- There is insufficient exploration of the implications of non-linear activations, such as their selection and impact on PDE solutions.
- The initial response lacked clarity in articulating the technical contributions and comparisons with related works.
- The paper could benefit from a more comprehensive comparison with additional state-of-the-art methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their contribution by providing deeper insights into the role of non-linear activations, including how to choose them and their effects on solving non-linear PDEs. Additionally, consider revising the title to emphasize the non-linear aspect and include comparisons with more established methods, such as Geo-FNO, and standard benchmarks. Addressing the scalability and computational cost of Hermes in the main text would also be beneficial. Lastly, we suggest expanding the comparison with more state-of-the-art methods to further validate the effectiveness of their approach and improve the clarity of their technical contributions by providing a more detailed comparison with related works.
