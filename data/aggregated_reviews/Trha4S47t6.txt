### Key Points
This paper presents non-parametric hypothesis tests for distribution symmetry, developed for two settings: invariance under a compact group and equivariance of a conditional distribution under a locally compact group. The authors implement these tests in high-energy particle physics applications, successfully identifying or rejecting symmetry presence. The work addresses a significant problem, offers a rigorous formulation of hypothesis tests, and shows promising preliminary results relevant to machine learning in scientific discovery, appealing to the AI4Science community.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The hypothesis test for symmetry is well-motivated, addressing gaps in the application of symmetry in machine learning and physical sciences, with potential applications for validating symmetry assumptions in ML models.
- The authors provide practical implementation guidance, which is valuable for practitioners.
- Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the hypothesis tests in identifying specific symmetries in data.
- The writing is mostly clear and easy to follow, with a good summary in Proposition 1.

Weaknesses:
- The introduction mentions several potential applications for the hypothesis tests but lacks experimental demonstrations of these applications. Showing violations of symmetry assumptions in datasets used by the ML community could highlight the tests' importance, as could applying the tests to check if an ML model exhibits symmetry.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by including experimental demonstrations of the proposed applications. Specifically, can the authors show that symmetry assumptions are violated in datasets used by the ML community, leading to degraded performance in symmetry-informed models? Additionally, it would be beneficial to apply the hypothesis tests to verify if an ML model exhibits symmetry.
