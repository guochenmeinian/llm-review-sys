Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a diffusion-based method aimed at enhancing the realism of fashion images generated through computer graphics pipelines. The authors propose a Texture Preserving Attention Control to improve garment texture appearance and introduce domain-knowledge injection for increased realism. Additionally, they present SynFashion, a synthetic dataset for research, and provide an open-source implementation. The paper includes qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses the significant issue of enhancing realism in computer-generated images.
- The introduction of the SynFashion dataset is a notable contribution, featuring a diverse array of textures and garments.
- The proposed methods are well-motivated, sound, and clearly presented, with supplementary material offering further insights.
- The evaluation includes both qualitative and quantitative results against baselines, indicating improved realism and texture preservation.

Weaknesses:
- The contributions are closely tied to a specific application—garment image generation—limiting the broader applicability of the methods, particularly the Texture-Preserving Attention Control.
- The analysis of related work is insufficient, and the paper lacks clarity in certain sections, leading to convoluted writing.
- The computational cost of the proposed method is significant, making it unsuitable for applications requiring real-time processing, such as interactive virtual try-on. The authors acknowledge this limitation, but it raises concerns about the method's relevance compared to faster graphics engines like Unreal Engine 5.
- The title "Make Fashion Real" is deemed confusing and unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing to enhance readability and address the convoluted sections. Additionally, we suggest expanding the analysis of related work to provide a more comprehensive context for their contributions. To address the computational cost, the authors should explore optimizations or alternative approaches that could make their method more applicable in real-time scenarios. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the potential applications of their modules beyond garment generation. Lastly, we recommend revising the title to better reflect the content and objectives of the paper.
