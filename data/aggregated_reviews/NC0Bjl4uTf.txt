Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Chinese Inertial Generative Adversarial Network (CI-GAN), aimed at generating high-quality training samples for Chinese writing recognition using inertial sensors. The CI-GAN incorporates Chinese Glyph Encoding (CGE), Forced Optimal Transport (FOT), and Semantic Relevance Alignment (SRA) to improve the authenticity and quality of generated inertial signals, addressing the challenge of data scarcity in Chinese character recognition and demonstrating significant classifier performance enhancements.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces innovative methods such as CGE, FOT, and SRA, which contribute meaningfully to the field of inertial writing recognition.  
- The dataset released is a valuable resource for the research community.  
- The paper is well-written, easy to follow, and addresses an important social issue regarding accessibility for disabled individuals.  

Weaknesses:  
- Lack of Detailed Baseline Configuration: The paper does not provide sufficient details on the baseline model settings, hindering replication and understanding of comparative effectiveness.  
- Insufficient Comparison with Other Augmentation Techniques: The study fails to compare CI-GAN with other data augmentation methods, such as random perturbations, leaving the potential benefits of these techniques unexplored.  
- The pipeline lacks novelty, as the employed technologies are widely used in computer vision and natural language processing without innovative design.  
- The dataset used for training and testing is too small to effectively validate the proposed method.  
- The paper does not visualize generated handwritten characters or assess their diversity, which is critical for evaluating CI-GAN's effectiveness.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the baseline model by providing detailed configurations, including the number of parameters. Additionally, consider evaluating how simple data augmentation methods, such as random perturbations, might significantly enhance classifier performance. To strengthen the novelty of the work, we suggest incorporating a more innovative design for CGE and providing an ablation study to validate the effectiveness of the introduced modules. Finally, including visualizations of generated samples and assessing their diversity would greatly enhance the evaluation of CI-GAN's performance.
