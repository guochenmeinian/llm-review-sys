Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an improvement over Choromanski's 2023 method for estimating graph random features (GRFs) by introducing a quasi-Monte Carlo approach that utilizes antithetic termination in random walks. The authors propose a method to correlate the lengths of random walks, which leads to a provable reduction in variance for the estimates of the 2-regularized Laplacian kernel. The theoretical contributions are supported by empirical evaluations demonstrating significant improvements in clustering and node attribute prediction tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is clear, well-written, and presents an original idea with potential broad applications in graph diffusion processes.  
- The introduction of antithetic termination is novel and easy to implement, with extensive empirical validation supporting the theoretical claims.  
- The literature review and problem justification are thorough, and the empirical analysis is robust.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper's scope is limited, primarily focusing on the 2-regularized Laplacian kernel, raising questions about the broader applicability of the proposed method.  
- The proof of variance reduction is lengthy and complex, making it challenging to verify.  
- The introduction bears structural similarities to Choromanski's work, which may require revision to reduce overlap.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction to decrease similarity with Choromanski's work. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the importance of the 2-regularized Laplacian kernel and exploring its applicability to other graph kernels through additional experiments. To enhance the paper's accessibility, consider simplifying the proof of variance reduction or providing a more concise summary. Furthermore, addressing the notation issues and ensuring consistent formatting in references would strengthen the overall presentation.
