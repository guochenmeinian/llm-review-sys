Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for multi-view 3D human and animal pose estimation using a novel Triangulation Residual Loss (TR Loss) that enforces multi-view geometry consistency in a self-supervised manner. The authors propose minimizing the smallest singular value of the triangulation matrix to achieve this. The effectiveness of TR Loss is validated through experiments on both laboratory mouse and human pose estimation datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on the Human3.6M dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- TR Loss is a simple yet effective approach that self-supervises multi-view geometry consistency without requiring 3D annotations or heavy reprojection computations.
- The construction of a new THmouse dataset establishes a benchmark for laboratory mouse pose estimation.
- The method achieves state-of-the-art MPJPE results on the Human3.6M dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of TR Loss.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks quantitative comparisons with the second group of methods in Fig. 1, particularly regarding accuracy and efficiency.
- The experiments in Sec. 4.2 on the newly built benchmark for mouse pose estimation appear to be ablation studies, with no state-of-the-art methods applied for direct comparison.
- The choice of weights (0.4, 0.6) in Line 158 raises questions about their impact on predicted confidence and requires further ablation studies.
- Inconsistencies in results for MTFT-Transformer in Table 3 and missing comparisons with methods achieving better results are noted.
- The paper does not discuss limitations or potential societal impacts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including quantitative comparisons with the second group of methods in Fig. 1 to enhance the robustness of their claims. Additionally, it would be beneficial to apply state-of-the-art methods directly on the newly constructed THmouse benchmark to provide a clearer context for their results. We also suggest conducting ablation studies to clarify the impact of the chosen weights (0.4, 0.6) on predicted confidence. Furthermore, addressing the inconsistencies in Table 3 and including comparisons with other relevant methods would strengthen the paper. Lastly, a discussion on the limitations and potential societal impacts of the work should be included to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the research implications.
