### Key Points
This paper presents a study on Natural Language Inference (NLI), emphasizing the vulnerability of Transformer-based models to adversarial attacks. The authors propose a model-agnostic defense strategy that utilizes natural language explanations. They explore a two-stage explain-then-predict paradigm as a potential defense mechanism against adversarial attacks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and thorough, analyzing the impact of adversarial attacks on premise and hypothesis using two attack methods.  
- It claims that generating an explanation as an intermediate step may enhance robustness, with results in Tables 4 and 5 showing improvements over the baseline.  
- The qualitative analysis of the attacks is insightful and provides valuable intuition for the experiments.  

Weaknesses:  
- The improvement is not consistent across all seq-2-seq methods tested; some encoder-decoder models perform worse than the baseline, and further intuition on this inconsistency would be beneficial.  
- It is unclear if the observed robustness reflects the underlying encoder's robustness, particularly since roberta outperforms other encoders in Table 5.  
- Some improvements are minimal, raising questions about whether they are statistically significant; a variance report would be useful.  
- The claim regarding the association between the linguistic quality of explanations and model robustness is confusing, lacking clear evidence.  
- The arrangement of results in Tables 4 and 5 is confusing; transposing the tables would enhance clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the consistency of results across seq-2-seq methods and provide insights into why some models perform worse than the baseline. Additionally, clarifying the relationship between encoder robustness and performance would strengthen the paper. A variance report should be included to address concerns about the significance of improvements. We also suggest revising the claim regarding explanation evaluation to provide clearer evidence and transposing Tables 4 and 5 for better readability.
