### Key Points
This paper presents a method for generating specular highlight data with near-perfect alignment and introduces SHDocs, a dataset comprising over 3000 document scenes and 19000 images of specular highlights. The SHDocs dataset is the only openly available real-world dataset for this purpose and includes a benchmark for evaluating specular highlight removal models based on image quality and OCR performance. The proposed method is efficient and cost-effective, addressing the scarcity of real-world datasets in this field.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method generates high-quality specular highlight data at a low cost.
- The dataset effectively fills a gap in the availability of specular highlights on document images.
- The method, dataset, and evaluation code are open-sourced, promoting accessibility.

Weaknesses:
- The ground-truth image still contains specular highlights from unpolarized light sources, indicating sub-optimal generation.
- The dataset is generated solely from the FUNSD dataset, which lacks stylistic diversity.
- There is a lack of benchmark experiments that train and evaluate on the SHDocs dataset.
- Generalization studies have not been conducted across different hardware setups, which may affect results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset by including a more diverse range of document styles beyond the FUNSD dataset. Additionally, we suggest that the authors conduct experiments using the same training dataset for generalization evaluations to provide clearer insights into model performance. It would also be beneficial to include failure cases of models trained on the proposed datasets to help identify significant issues in the community. Finally, addressing the presence of unfiltered specular highlights in the ground-truth images would enhance the overall quality of the dataset.
