Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework for offline meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) called Meta Decision Transformer (Meta-DT), which utilizes transformers and world model disentanglement to enhance task generalization without requiring expert demonstrations. The approach employs a context-aware world model to encode task-relevant information, guiding the transformer in generating task-oriented sequences. Experimental results indicate that Meta-DT achieves superior few-shot and zero-shot generalization across various benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in RL applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Generalization without Experts: Meta-DT effectively generalizes across unseen tasks without expert demonstrations, marking a significant advancement in meta-RL.
- World Model Disentanglement: The context-aware world model enhances robustness and accuracy in task representation.
- Efficient Use of Transformers: The innovative application of the transformer architecture improves policy generation and adaptation.
- Empirical Validation: Comprehensive experimental results show that Meta-DT outperforms existing baselines in few-shot and zero-shot tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The paper does not address environments or tasks where Meta-DT's performance may be limited, nor does it discuss challenges in extending the model to such environments.
- The process and benefits of world model disentanglement in Meta-DT are not elaborated, particularly regarding its impact on generalization in dynamically changing environments.
- The evaluation primarily covers homogenous environments, with limited differentiation in performance across diverse tasks, particularly in non-MuJoCo settings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the limitations of Meta-DT, particularly regarding its performance in diverse environments and tasks. It would be beneficial to elaborate on the process and advantages of world model disentanglement and its implications for generalization. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments with a broader range of training tasks to better assess the generalization capabilities of Meta-DT. Finally, including a comparison with the CMT baseline and addressing the runtime for fair comparison with existing methods would strengthen the paper.
