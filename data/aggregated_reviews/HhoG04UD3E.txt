### Key Points
This paper presents PMIndiaSum, a multilingual and cross-lingual summarization dataset that supports 14 languages and 196 language pairs across 4 language families. The authors provide benchmark results for monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual summarization using various paradigms: fine-tuning, prompting, and translate-and-summarize. The dataset, focused on Indian languages, is the largest of its kind for summarization tasks and includes over 76k monolingual document-headline pairs and 620k cross-lingual pairs. The authors also conduct extensive experiments and present quantitative analyses of the dataset's qualities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, clear, and easy to follow.
- It contributes significantly to summarization research by providing a large dataset for under-resourced languages.
- The methodology is repeatable, allowing for future research extensions.
- The dataset's size and scope are impactful for the research community.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset is domain-specific and biased toward political news, raising questions about its generalizability for evaluating PLM capabilities.
- Some analyses lack detail, potentially due to page limits.
- The use of external translation models complicates the isolation of the dataset's impact on performance.
- There are concerns about redundancy in the summaries and the clarity of certain dataset characteristics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the detail of their analyses in the camera-ready version to provide a comprehensive understanding of the experiments. Additionally, please clarify the discrepancy regarding the number of English articles in Table 2 to avoid misunderstandings. To ensure the abstractive nature of the summaries, consider addressing the removal of summaries that may appear in the middle or end of documents. Lastly, provide an explanation for the significantly higher oracle performance on the **te** language and discuss how the quality of the external translator is ensured, especially for low-resource languages.
