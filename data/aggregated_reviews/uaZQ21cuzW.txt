### Key Points
This paper presents a recursive visual explanation method for step-by-step vision-language explanation generation, building upon the BLIP-2 model. The authors propose a few-shot self-training mechanism that enables training with generated pseudo-explanations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method across three datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow.
- Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its data efficiency.
- The few-shot self-training mechanism addresses the challenge of scarce annotations.

Weaknesses:
- The first contribution lacks detailed description, with only 5% of human-annotated explanations provided, making it difficult to assess its significance.
- The novelty of the recursive method appears incremental, as similar techniques exist in the multimodal domain.
- The evaluation metrics are unclear, leading to confusion regarding whether they pertain to answers or explanations.
- The convergence of the recursive algorithm is questionable, with marginal improvements observed across iterations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the description of the first contribution by providing more comprehensive information regarding comparison methods, experimental settings, and detailed analyses. Additionally, the authors should clarify how the proposed method extends beyond existing techniques to justify its contribution. A thorough analysis of the performance gap between the proposed method and state-of-the-art methods is essential for a comprehensive evaluation. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors provide clearer guidance on interpreting the evaluation metrics and address the convergence concerns by offering persuasive motivation for the step-wise improvement in the recursive process. Lastly, consider reducing the number of tables and figures, particularly on pages 6, 7, and 8, and moving some to the appendix.
