Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a steganographic cover optimization framework that enhances existing methods by utilizing a pre-trained DDIM to reconstruct cover images, optimizing the latent space to reduce message extraction errors. The authors analyze the steganographic encoder's workings and verify their findings both experimentally and theoretically. The results indicate a reduction in message extraction error rates and improved quality of stego images. Additionally, the paper introduces an innovative cover selection framework that optimizes within the latent space of pretrained generative models, distinguishing it from traditional exhaustive search methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors propose a novel approach to cover optimization using DDIM, which reduces message extraction error rates while enhancing stego image quality, providing stronger interpretability than previous methods.
2. The paper includes a thorough analysis of the encoder's mechanism, confirming that messages are encoded in low-variance pixel positions, consistent with waterfilling principles.
3. Extensive experiments validate the framework's superior performance in message recovery and image quality.

Weaknesses:
1. The description of the method framework lacks detail, particularly regarding which models (DDIM or LISO) are trainable or fixed, necessitating clarification in Section 3.1.
2. The experiments on steganalysis are insufficient, focusing only on XuNet without including more advanced networks like SRNet, and Section 5.3 lacks a detailed experimental setup description.
3. The quality of images used in experiments is generally low, suggesting a need for higher-quality datasets in future work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the framework description in Section 3.1 by specifying which model parameters are trainable and which are fixed. Additionally, we suggest expanding the steganalysis experiments to include evaluations against more advanced networks such as SRNet, along with a detailed description of the experimental setup in Section 5.3. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to enhance the quality of images used in experiments and consider using high-quality datasets to validate the framework's effectiveness. Lastly, we advise modifying the terminology from "cover selection" to "cover generation" or "cover reconstruction" to accurately reflect the process described in the paper.
