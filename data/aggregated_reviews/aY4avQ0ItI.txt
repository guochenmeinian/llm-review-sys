### Key Points
This paper presents a systematic study of task performance disparities in multilingual task-oriented dialogue (ToD) systems, introducing new quantitative measures of absolute and relative equivalence to evaluate disparities across and within languages. The authors empirically analyze the performance of ToD systems across four languages (Arabic, English, French, and Turkish) using the MULTI3WoZ dataset, addressing four research questions related to task nature, pre-trained models, and data quality. The findings highlight the influence of adaptation and intrinsic biases in ToD systems and provide insights for future data collection and system development.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a pioneering systematic analysis of performance disparities in multilingual ToD systems, introducing novel quantitative equivalence measures and conducting comprehensive experiments on the MULTI3WoZ dataset.
- It provides meaningful empirical evidence supporting its findings and emphasizes the importance of high-quality data for effective multilingual system development.
- The writing is clear and well-structured, with detailed tables and figures that enhance understanding.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on only four languages raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings to a broader linguistic landscape, potentially biasing conclusions.
- Some insights, such as adaptation and intrinsic biases, may not be groundbreaking, as similar observations have been noted in prior research.
- The paper lacks a well-defined central theme, with some research questions appearing unrelated to the main objective, and excessive focus on dataset introduction detracts from the core analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by considering a more diverse set of languages in future studies. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the rationale behind the choice of research questions, particularly RQ 3 and 4, to ensure they align with the main focus on task performance disparities. It would also be beneficial to provide more detailed explanations regarding the need for finer details at the annotation stage and the rationale for training an English system instead of a multilingual model. Finally, condensing the dataset introduction and frontloading the main focus of the paper will enhance clarity and emphasize the primary contributions.
