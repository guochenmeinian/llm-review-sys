### Key Points
This paper presents the Genomics Long-Range Benchmark (LRB) aimed at evaluating DNA language models (LMs) on biologically significant tasks, particularly focusing on long-range genomic contexts. The authors propose nine tasks, methods for arbitrary sequence length inputs, improved fine-tuning techniques, a visualization tool, and context-length extension methods. The benchmark evaluates several DNA LMs, revealing competitive performance in tasks like genome annotation but shortcomings in others, such as gene expression prediction.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The LRB is the first benchmark to systematically evaluate long-range capabilities of DNA LMs, addressing a critical need in genomics.
- It includes biologically relevant tasks, enhancing the practical utility of DNA LMs in research.
- The visualization tool allows for in-depth analysis of model performance, potentially guiding future developments.

Weaknesses:
- The benchmark overlooks recent state-of-the-art DNA LMs, particularly VQDNA, limiting its comprehensiveness.
- It is restricted to the human genome, failing to assess generalization across species, which is vital for comparative genomics.
- Key tasks, such as enhancer-gene pairing prediction and chromatin structure prediction, are missing, representing significant limitations.
- There is insufficient hyper-parameter tuning and sensitivity analysis, raising concerns about the reliability of model performance assessments.
- The analysis of context length impact is limited, and the absence of multi-task evaluation scenarios reduces the benchmark's relevance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the benchmark by including recent state-of-the-art DNA LMs, such as VQDNA and Caduceus, to ensure a comprehensive evaluation. Expanding the scope to include multiple species would enhance the benchmark's applicability in genomics. Additionally, incorporating crucial tasks like enhancer-gene pairing and chromatin structure prediction would provide a more robust assessment of model capabilities. We also suggest conducting a thorough hyper-parameter tuning and sensitivity analysis to validate model performance. Finally, a detailed exploration of context length effects across tasks and the inclusion of multi-task evaluation scenarios would significantly strengthen the benchmark's relevance and utility.
