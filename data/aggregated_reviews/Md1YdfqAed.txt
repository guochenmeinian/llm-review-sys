### Key Points
This paper presents Dual Bank Normalization (DBNorm), a post-processing solution aimed at addressing the hubness problem in cross-modal retrieval (CMR). The authors propose two methods, Dual Inverted Softmax (DualIS) and Dual Dynamic Inverted Softmax (DualDIS), and provide a theoretical demonstration that hubs exhibit high similarity across different data modalities. Experimental results across eight diverse benchmarks indicate that DBNorm outperforms existing normalization methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed DBNorm effectively addresses a fundamental issue in CMR, potentially enhancing retrieval performance.
- The paper offers a rigorous theoretical foundation and motivation for normalizing both query and gallery data.
- Extensive experimental validation demonstrates superior performance across various cross-modal retrieval tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The contributions appear to be incremental compared to prior work, particularly the single-bank normalization method DIS.
- The performance of DualIS and DualDIS is not universally effective across all tasks, with minor improvements noted in specific datasets like MSVD.
- The paper lacks comprehensive statistics on the hubness problem and analysis of lower performance instances with DBNorm.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the statistical analysis of the hubness problem in CMR to provide a clearer context for their contributions. Additionally, a more detailed examination of the performance discrepancies in tasks such as MSVD should be included. Enhancing the presentation of Algorithm 1 and moving the open-source contribution to a footnote could also improve clarity. Finally, highlighting RQ1 and RQ2 in bold would enhance their visibility.
