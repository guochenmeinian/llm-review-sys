Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach, the MoGU framework, aimed at enhancing the safety of large language models (LLMs) while maintaining usability. The authors propose a dynamic routing mechanism that balances the contributions of two specialized LLM variants: one focused on usability and the other on safety. The results indicate that MoGU outperforms existing defense methods and achieves a significant improvement in model robustness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed dynamic routing mechanism effectively balances safety and usability compared to prior works.
- Extensive experiments are conducted, including ablation studies and comparisons with numerous baseline methods.

Weaknesses:
- The soundness of the method is questionable, particularly regarding the reliance on the router's accuracy and the necessity of training separate response components ($Glad_{resp}$ and $Unwill_{resp}$).
- The deployment of the framework poses risks, especially for open-sourced models, as it could be exploited by malicious actors.
- The paper lacks clarity in its presentation, with overly detailed mathematical descriptions and insufficient discussion on the selection of instructions and the impact of modified tokens.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by simplifying the mathematical descriptions and providing a more insightful analysis of the experimental results. Additionally, addressing the concerns regarding the router's reliability and the risks associated with deploying the framework in open-sourced models is crucial. It would also be beneficial to extend the method's application beyond defense scenarios and explore its effectiveness throughout the entire generation process.
