Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel RL-driven object detector guided by Evidential Q-learning, introducing an adaptive hierarchical object detection paradigm that mimics human visual attention through top-down searching. The authors propose an evidential Q-learning method with a unique reward function that addresses both positive and uncertain patches, alongside a theoretical guarantee for the fast convergence of the algorithm. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of their method across multiple datasets. Additionally, the authors have successfully addressed all concerns raised by the reviewers in a rebuttal, leading to a positive assessment for acceptance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation and proposed method are interesting and technically sound.
2. The manuscript is mostly clearly written and easy to understand.
3. Sufficient ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
4. The authors effectively addressed all reviewer concerns, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the feedback provided.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks comparisons with the latest works in dense object detection, relying on weak baselines. It raises questions about the potential for improving state-of-the-art models.
2. The inclusion of RL baseline comparisons in the main experiments is questionable.
3. The AIRS method's performance on large objects in the COCO dataset is unexpectedly poor, and the exploration/exploitation mechanism's impact on larger objects is unclear.
4. No additional weaknesses were identified in the review of the rebuttal.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with recent dense object detection techniques, such as those referenced in [1] and [2], to better contextualize their contributions. Additionally, we suggest including RL baseline comparisons in the main experimental results to strengthen the findings. To address the performance issues with large objects, the authors should clarify the exploration/exploitation mechanism's role and consider evaluating on more complex datasets with a higher density of small objects. Furthermore, a clearer definition of "false positive" cases and visual examples would enhance the understanding of the proposed method's effectiveness. We also recommend that the authors continue to engage with feedback in future submissions to maintain the high standard demonstrated in this rebuttal.
