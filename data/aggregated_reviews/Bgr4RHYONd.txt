### Key Points
This paper presents an evaluation of large language models (LLMs) for narrative-driven movie recommendations, comparing their performance against traditional recommendation systems like doc2vec. The authors analyze 38 LLMs of varying parameter sizes using a dataset sourced from Reddit's movie suggestion community, employing various prompting strategies. The findings indicate that LLMs, particularly larger models, outperform traditional methods, with zero-shot prompting proving effective while more complex strategies show minimal improvement.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The evaluation encompasses a diverse range of LLMs, enhancing the findings' relevance for the recommendation community.
2. The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with rigorous experimental design that addresses potential data leakage and response variance.
3. The authors provide source codes, promoting reproducibility of the experiments.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of LLMs performing well in zero-shot settings is moderate, as their proficiency in processing natural language queries is expected.
2. The study's focus on a single dataset within one domain limits the generalizability of the results.
3. The reliance on community-provided comments for ground truth raises concerns about the validity of model evaluations based on these comments.
4. The evaluation primarily features older baseline methods, lacking exploration of more advanced models like seq2seq.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by evaluating LLM performance across multiple domains. Additionally, we suggest incorporating a human analysis of the LLM recommendations to assess their relevance beyond mere precision statistics. Addressing the ambiguity in the prompt engineering process and clarifying the handling of missing recommendation results would enhance the paper's clarity. Furthermore, exploring more sophisticated prompting strategies, such as chain-of-thought prompting, could provide deeper insights into model adaptability. Lastly, we encourage the authors to investigate the hallucination issue further, specifically the frequency of fictitious movie recommendations generated by the models.
