### Key Points
This paper presents SafeConPhy, a method for safe control of complex physical systems utilizing diffusion models. The authors propose integrating safety constraints into deep learning-based control, developing a certifiable upper bound on safety scores through conformal prediction techniques, and designing an iterative safety improvement process. The method is evaluated on the 1D Burgers' equation and 2D incompressible fluid control tasks, demonstrating its ability to meet safety constraints while achieving effective control objectives.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The innovative combination of diffusion models, conformal prediction, and safety constraints addresses a critical gap in safe control.
- The approach is theoretically sound, providing certifiable safety guarantees prior to deployment.
- An iterative refinement process enhances model safety using derived bounds.
- Empirical evaluations on challenging control problems show improved performance compared to traditional methods and safe reinforcement learning (SRL) approaches.
- Development of new datasets for safe physical system control facilitates further evaluation.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental evaluation is limited to only two physical systems, necessitating more diverse applications to strengthen generality claims.
- There is a lack of ablation studies to isolate the contributions of different components of the method.
- The computational complexity and scalability of SafeConPhy are not thoroughly discussed.
- The simplicity of the experimental setup raises concerns about the method's scalability and robustness in more complex real-world scenarios.
- The novelty of the diffusion control method is diminished as it builds on previously established work without significant advancements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental evaluation by including more complex, higher-dimensional physical systems to demonstrate scalability and robustness. Additionally, conducting ablation studies would help clarify the impact of various components of the method. The authors should also address the computational complexity and scalability concerns more thoroughly. Clarification is needed regarding the use of DDIM versus DDPM in their proofs, and we suggest enhancing the presentation of figures, such as increasing the legend size in Figure 2 for better readability. Finally, providing open-source code and more robust demonstrations could offer valuable insights for the community.
