### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the efficiency of First Price Auctions (FPA) in the context of auto-bidding, focusing on return on spend (ROS) and budget constraints. The authors measure efficiency using the price of anarchy (PoA), demonstrating that under these constraints, the PoA of FPA is \( n \), which is tight. They also establish that with the assumption that each bidder's value does not exceed their budget, the PoA is 2, consistent with results without budget constraints. Additionally, the paper introduces the Integral Price of Anarchy (I-PoA) and shows that the I-PoA of FPA is also 2. The authors propose two randomized mechanisms, randomized FPA (rFPA) and quasi-proportional FPA, with PoA values of 1.8 and 2, respectively.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1) The study addresses a significant problem in auto-bidding, relevant to web economics and online advertising.
2) It extends previous research by incorporating both ROS and budget constraints, providing a comprehensive view of FPA efficiency.

Weaknesses:
1) The technical contributions are somewhat limited, as many results are extensions of similar analyses, particularly Theorems 3.3, 3.6, and 3.8.
2) The paper's structure could be improved; Section 3 contains multiple results that would benefit from being divided into 2 to 3 subsections for clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper's structure by separating the results in Section 3 into distinct subsections. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the proof in Section 5 regarding the convergence of the price of anarchy and the role of \( \eta \). Finally, we encourage the authors to cite related algorithms papers that address ROS and budget constraints to enhance the literature context.
