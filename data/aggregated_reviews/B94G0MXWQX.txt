Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for constructing adversarial patches that approximates the appearance of the area it covers, utilizing semi-transparent, RGB-valued circles. The authors employ an evolutionary strategy to optimize the properties of each shape and a simulated annealing approach for optimal patch location. The proposed method aims to create camouflaged adversarial patches that are less visible compared to traditional methods, achieving performance that is better or comparable to state-of-the-art techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The research content is meaningful and important, addressing a significant threat to security with camouflaged adversarial patches.
2. The paper is well-written and organized, with clear explanations of the proposed method and experimental setup.
3. The experiments are relatively abundant, providing a thorough empirical evaluation of the method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. The level of innovation is relatively limited, resulting in incremental improvements rather than groundbreaking contributions.
2. Experimentation is insufficient, with evaluations limited to only two CNNs and lacking tests on more models or updated architectures like ViT.
3. The use of the l_2 distance evaluation index may not be suitable for non-patch attacks, and the small sample size of images in the ablation study may impact the reliability of results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental robustness by testing on a larger and more diverse set of images, as the current sample size of only a hundred images may limit generalizability. Additionally, we suggest including a broader range of evaluation metrics beyond the attack success rate (ASR), such as non-normalized residual (nq) and original accuracy, to provide a more comprehensive assessment of performance. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to conduct experiments comparing their method with random methods to clarify the effectiveness and uniqueness of their approach. Lastly, we advise discussing the computational cost of the proposed method and exploring its performance on transformer-based vision models.
