### Key Points
This paper presents a novel active learning strategy that assigns dynamic smoothed weights to individual tokens, addressing the challenge of data imbalance in named entity recognition (NER). The proposed re-weighting-based active learning strategy improves performance in active sequence tagging, as demonstrated by substantial experimental results across multiple datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, logically structured, and easily understandable.
- The method is straightforward and exhibits broad applicability, compatible with various token-level acquisition functions.
- The innovative strategy effectively addresses data imbalance in NER and is empirically validated through performance enhancements.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a comparison with other state-of-the-art active learning strategies for NER, limiting the evaluation of its effectiveness.
- There is insufficient discussion on the limitations and potential drawbacks of the proposed approach.
- The analysis of the hyperparameter Beta is limited, with no experimental results or guidelines for its optimal selection provided.
- Additional details on experimental metrics, such as the distribution of each NER type and precision, recall, and F1 scores throughout the active learning process, are needed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the hyperparameter Beta by providing experimental results and exploring automatic optimization methods. Additionally, the authors should include more detailed metrics in the experimental section, such as the distribution of each NER type and precision, recall, and F1 scores for each type during the active learning process. Furthermore, a comparison with other state-of-the-art active learning strategies would enhance the evaluation of the proposed method's effectiveness.
