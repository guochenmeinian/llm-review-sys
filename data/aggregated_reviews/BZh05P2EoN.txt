Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DPIC (Decoupling Prompt and Intrinsic Characteristics), a novel model for detecting LLM-generated text. The model utilizes an auxiliary LLM to reverse-generate prompts from candidate texts, allowing the detection of intrinsic characteristics by comparing the similarity between the candidate and regenerated texts. The authors claim that DPIC outperforms baseline methods, achieving notable improvements in detection accuracy across various datasets. Additionally, the paper evaluates the semantic similarity between source text and machine-generated text, focusing on three aspects: the measurement of semantic similarity using cosine similarity, the establishment of a baseline similarity for reference, and the assessment of the consistency of high semantic similarity. The authors report an average cosine similarity of 0.6201 for the XSum dataset generated by ChatGPT, which exceeds the baseline similarity of 0.5042, indicating a high degree of semantic similarity. The analysis of similarity scores reveals a standard deviation of 0.1357, suggesting minimal fluctuation and consistent maintenance of high semantic similarity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces an innovative approach that effectively decouples prompts from intrinsic characteristics, enhancing detection capabilities, especially in black-box scenarios.
- Experimental results indicate significant performance improvements over baseline methods, demonstrating robustness across diverse datasets and generative models.
- The authors provide a clear methodology for measuring semantic similarity, including the use of cosine similarity and baseline comparisons.
- The analysis of standard deviation offers insight into the consistency of the similarity scores.
- The writing is clear and the methodology is well-articulated.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation metrics, particularly AUROC, lack detailed explanation, which is essential for academic rigor.
- The testing model is limited to closed-source models, which may not represent real-world scenarios adequately.
- The computational resource consumption of the model is not discussed, raising concerns about practical applicability.
- The paper does not sufficiently address the out-of-distribution generalization ability of DPIC.
- The explanation of the significance of the cosine similarity values could be more detailed to enhance understanding.
- The paper may benefit from additional context regarding the implications of high semantic similarity in practical applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and detail of the evaluation metrics, particularly the AUROC, by including its formula and evaluation steps. Additionally, we suggest incorporating open-source models in the testing phase to provide a more comprehensive comparison and to enhance the validity of the conclusions drawn. It would also be beneficial to include a detailed analysis of the computational resource consumption and to compare it with competitors. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to expand the limitations section to discuss the model's deployment in real-world environments and its potential societal impacts, as well as to analyze current techniques that may help AI-generated text evade detection. Finally, we recommend that the authors enhance the explanation of the significance of the cosine similarity values and provide more context on the practical implications of maintaining high semantic similarity.
