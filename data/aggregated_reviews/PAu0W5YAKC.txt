Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to the causal bandits problem, specifically addressing a setting where the causal graph is unknown, the causal model is linear, and the action set consists of $2^{N}$ soft interventions. The authors propose an algorithm that first learns the causal structure and then employs UCB-based methods to identify the optimal action while minimizing regret. The algorithm's regret is analyzed under both scenarios: with and without prior knowledge of the graph.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper explores a unique scenario where the causal graph is unknown and the structural equation model (SEM) is linear.
2. The organization of the paper is coherent, with detailed discussions of each component of the proposed algorithm.
3. The upper bound of GA-LCB-ID, when the graph is known, shows significant improvement over related works and approaches the minimax lower bound.
4. GA-LCB-ID achieves a reasonable upper bound in cases where the causal graph is unknown.
5. The introduction provides a comprehensive overview of related work.

Weaknesses:
1. The algorithm presumes that the causal graph lacks latent variables.
2. It requires access to identifiability parameters, which is an unrealistic expectation.
3. The intervention set is restricted, allowing only one soft intervention per node.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the identifiability parameter in the regret bound, as its exclusion is not intuitive in this context. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the rationale for taking an expectation in Theorem 2, as the theorem should demonstrate that the regret is bounded with high probability. The authors should also consider revising their approach to the learning of parent sets in stage (1b) to enhance efficiency, focusing on nodes in $\mathrm{An}(Y)$. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to expand their experimental section to include parameter sweeps and comparisons with random directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to validate their theoretical bounds. Lastly, addressing the potential for hidden confounders in their models would strengthen the paper's contributions.
