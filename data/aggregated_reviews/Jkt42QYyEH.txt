Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a language-embedded "interactive neural radiance field" that efficiently reconstructs and controls multiple objects within scenes. The authors propose a framework that decomposes interactive scenes into local deformable fields, allowing for precise modeling of individual object interactions. Additionally, a multi-scale interaction probability sampling strategy is introduced to sample interaction-relevant 3D points, enabling effective control over object dynamics. The authors also contribute the OmniSim and InterReal datasets, which provide scene-level physical interaction data for evaluating interactive scene modeling methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The technical novelty is high, with thorough evaluation and well-considered methods.
- The factorization technique allows for granular control and precise modeling of interactions, addressing challenges faced by previous methods.
- The integration of language control enhances user accessibility and interaction fidelity.
- The paper is well-motivated, with promising results and helpful figures.

Weaknesses:
- The methods section could benefit from clearer language and more detailed explanations of design decisions.
- Some figures may need enlarged text for better readability.
- There is a lack of qualitative results on real-world datasets, and certain qualitative results were missing in the InterReal dataset.
- Notations and definitions in key sections are confusing, which hinders understanding of the methodology.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methods section by providing more detailed explanations of design decisions and definitions. Additionally, consider enlarging the text in figures for better readability. We suggest including qualitative results on real-world datasets to strengthen the evaluation. Furthermore, addressing the confusion around notations, particularly in Section 3.2, would enhance comprehension. Lastly, exploring the model's performance without ground truth interaction values could provide insights into its practical applications and limitations.
