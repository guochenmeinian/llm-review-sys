### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as a form of conspicuous consumption, leveraging a novel dataset that combines NFT transaction data with visual embeddings. The authors aim to demonstrate the presence of the bandwagon and snob effects within the NFT market, drawing parallels to traditional luxury goods. However, the analysis is criticized for its methodological shortcomings, particularly the reliance on a limited set of NFT collections and vague operationalization of social meaning, which is crucial for assessing the validity of the findings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors exhibit a strong understanding of the NFT domain, employing tailored metrics and statistical methods, including Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and rarity computations.
- The paper is well-illustrated, with clear figures that effectively convey the analysis, particularly Figures 2 and 5.
- The dataset is extensive, enabling robust analysis of conspicuous consumption dynamics.

Weaknesses:
- The findings may not generalize well to the broader NFT market due to the limited dataset.
- The operationalization of social meaning is vague, hindering the assessment of its impact on the analysis.
- The necessity of certain experimental methods, such as using a trained GNN, is not sufficiently justified.
- The theoretical contribution regarding conspicuous consumption is seen as predictable rather than innovative, lacking depth in exploring the relationship between consumption, signaling, and social networks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the operationalization of social meaning by clearly defining the criteria or metrics used to quantify its significance. Additionally, we suggest conducting a sensitivity analysis to account for potential confounding factors, such as broader economic conditions and market sentiment, in the analysis of the bandwagon and snob effects. Expanding the dataset to include a wider range of NFT collections would enhance the generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide a more detailed explanation of the figures, particularly Figure 6, and consider alternative visualizations to improve clarity. Lastly, incorporating Natural Language Processing (NLP) analysis on social media platforms could link public sentiment about NFT collections to their conspicuous consumption dynamics, thereby enriching the study's contributions.
