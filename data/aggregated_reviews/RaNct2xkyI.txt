### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to the security of visible-infrared person re-identification (VIReID) systems by proposing a method that utilizes feature-level adversarial attacks. The authors introduce Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAP) to simulate real-world disturbances and employ a Frequency-Spatial Attention Module (FSAM) to enhance feature consistency across modalities. Additionally, an Auxiliary Quadruple Adversarial loss is proposed to amplify modality differences, improving the recognition of features between visible and infrared images. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, SYSU-MM01 and RegDB, validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. This study is pioneering in addressing the security of VIReID systems, filling a significant research gap.
2. The motivation for the proposed method is robust, with UAP generating adaptable adversarial samples across modalities, and FSAM enhancing feature consistency.
3. The authors conducted extensive experiments across various datasets and backbone models, demonstrating the method's effectiveness and generalizability.
4. The paper is well-structured and logically organized.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a clear explanation of the distinctions between single-modality ReID and VIReID, and the necessity of emphasizing adversarial feature alignment and modality differences is not adequately justified.
2. The total loss function is not defined, and the meaning of ‘L_id’ in Figure 2 is unclear.
3. There are no visualization experiments to support the claim regarding the relationship between phase components after Fourier transformation and spatial information.
4. The methods for attacking different VIReID systems are limited, which may not sufficiently validate the proposed approach's generalizability.
5. The effectiveness of the two specific modules explored in Table 3 is not experimentally investigated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the distinctions between single-modality ReID and VIReID, and provide a rationale for the emphasis on adversarial feature alignment and modality differences. Additionally, please define the total loss function and clarify the meaning of ‘L_id’ in Figure 2. We suggest including visualization experiments to substantiate claims regarding Fourier transformation and spatial information. Furthermore, consider expanding the range of VIReID methods used for testing to enhance the generalizability of the proposed approach. Lastly, we encourage the authors to conduct experimental investigations into the effectiveness of the two specific modules mentioned in Table 3.
