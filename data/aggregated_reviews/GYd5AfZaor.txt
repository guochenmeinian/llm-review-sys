Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method to tackle the noisy label regression problem by proposing the ConFrag approach, which transforms regression data into disjoint fragmentation pairs to enhance the distinction between clean and noisy samples. The authors utilize neighborhood agreement among fragments and expert feature extractors to identify noisy labels. The method is validated through experiments on various datasets and introduces a new metric, Error Residual Ratio (ERR), demonstrating consistent superiority over fourteen existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The method leverages the inherent orderly relationship between the label and feature space to identify noisy labels.
2. The presentation of the idea of constructing maximally contrasting pairs is interesting and the fundamental works in regression are discussed in detail.
3. The paper introduces four newly curated benchmark datasets and a novel metric for experiments.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation behind contrastive fragment pairing should be stated more clearly, particularly its connection to the relationship between labels and features.
2. Some illustrations and statements lack clarity, such as the meaning of "f" in the context of noisy labeled data and the elaboration on employing neighboring relations in fragments.
3. The proposed pair construction strategy does not adequately address the order relationship between fragments, which is crucial for regression tasks.
4. There is no ablation study on the amount and type of noise, nor does the paper explore the method's effectiveness across varying noise ratios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for contrastive fragment pairing in the introduction, explicitly stating its relevance to the connection between labels and features. Additionally, the authors should clarify ambiguous statements and illustrations, particularly regarding the meaning of "f" and the use of neighboring relations. We suggest including a discussion on the order relationship between fragments and conducting an ablation study to assess the method's performance across different noise levels. Lastly, validating the method on existing noisy regression datasets would strengthen the contribution of the paper.
