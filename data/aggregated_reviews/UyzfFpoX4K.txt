### Key Points
This paper presents a novel scoring function for the molecular docking process, utilizing the cross-correlation of multi-channel ligand and protein scalar fields alongside an optimization approach using FFT. The authors propose a unique application that distinguishes their work from previous studies, which primarily focus on ML-based scoring functions without addressing computational costs. The paper is well-written and includes solid experimental results, contributing valuable insights to the AI for Science community.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The novelty of applying cross-correlation and FFT in molecular docking is significant and sets this work apart from existing literature.  
- The writing quality is commendable, facilitating reader comprehension.  
- The experimental evaluations are robust, providing solid results that support the proposed approach.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper exceeds the workshop's length limit of 4-8 pages, currently totaling 9 pages.  
- The conclusions and messaging could benefit from refinement to enhance clarity and focus for the audience.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper's length by editing down content and moving less critical information to the appendix to comply with the workshop guidelines. Additionally, consider addressing the issue of insufficient experimental data by further developing the Equivariant GNN, focusing on reliable uncertainty quantification, and exploring active learning approaches to enhance data efficiency.
