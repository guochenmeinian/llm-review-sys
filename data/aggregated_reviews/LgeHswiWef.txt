Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel retrieval-augmented framework for mutation effect prediction, introducing several key contributions: 
- **Structure Motif Embedding Database (SMEDB)**: A vector database storing ESM-IF local structure motif embeddings from the Protein Data Bank.
- **Multiple Structure Motif Alignment (MSMA)**: An efficient method for retrieving and filtering local coevolutionary motifs from SMEDB.
- **MSM-IPA**: A model architecture that utilizes retrieved coevolutionary motif information to predict mutation effects. The approach is validated through benchmarks and a case study on SARS-CoV-2 antibody optimization. The authors describe their method of obtaining embeddings through MSM-IPA and computing feature differences before and after mutations, while emphasizing the importance of dataset size on model performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- **Originality**: The retrieval mechanism using vector databases for local structural motifs is a novel approach, differing from traditional methods reliant on MSAs or domain-level clustering.
- **Quality**: The methodology is clear and comprehensive, with thorough evaluations on protein stability, binding affinity, and antibody engineering.
- **Integration of Advanced Techniques**: The use of ESM-IF for embedding retrieval demonstrates a thoughtful integration of advanced techniques.
- **Clarity**: The paper is well-structured, providing a clear motivation and detailed experimental discussions, along with performance results across various datasets.

Weaknesses:
- **Scalability**: The claim of scalability lacks experimental evidence regarding the impact of database size on retrieval efficiency.
- **Choice of Embedding Method**: The justification for using ESM-IF for embedding is insufficient, with no exploration of alternative methods.
- **Lack of Specificity**: The lack of specific details on the classification head's architecture, including the number of layers, and training parameters limits reproducibility.
- **Exploration of Retrieval Hyper-parameters**: Details on hyper-parameter choices for retrieval are lacking, and their potential impact on performance is not studied.
- **Applicability to Other Benchmarks**: The methodology is not tested on common benchmarks like ClinVar or ProteinGym, raising questions about its broader applicability. The rationale for not benchmarking on these datasets is not fully convincing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on scalability by providing analyses on the effects of varying database sizes on retrieval performance. Additionally, justifying the choice of ESM-IF for embedding and exploring alternative methods, such as ProteinMPNN, would strengthen the paper. We suggest including details on hyper-parameter choices for the retrieval mechanism, as well as conducting evaluations on ClinVar and ProteinGym datasets to assess the method's applicability. Furthermore, we recommend clarifying the architecture of the classification head by specifying the number of layers in the MLPs and providing detailed hyper-parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and training duration to enhance reproducibility. Expanding the discussion in the Figure 1 legend to include more methodological details would aid understanding. Lastly, addressing the challenges of benchmarking on ClinVar and ProteinGym datasets more thoroughly would strengthen the manuscript.
