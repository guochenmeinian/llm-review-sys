Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a data-driven method for character animation retargeting called MeshRet, which utilizes Semantically Consistent Sensors (SCS) and Dense Mesh Interaction (DMI) fields to achieve geometry-aware motion retargeting. The authors propose a transformer model that predicts target character motions based on source SCS, source motion, and source DMI, trained in an unsupervised manner. The paper introduces a new dataset, ScanRet, aimed at enhancing motion retargeting quality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and effectively addresses issues like contact loss and interpenetration.  
- The organization of the paper is clear, and the experiments provide strong evidence of the method's effectiveness.  
- The introduction of SCS and DMI represents a significant innovation in motion retargeting.

Weaknesses:  
- The method's reliance on clean training data raises concerns about its robustness to noisy inputs and varying character geometries.  
- The ablation study lacks exploration of different sensor arrangements and does not compare with all relevant prior works.  
- The selection process for $K \times L$ sensors appears somewhat arbitrary, and the method's applicability to characters with different bone structures is unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the robustness of their method by addressing how it handles noisy inputs and varying body shapes. Additionally, we suggest including a more comprehensive ablation study that examines different sensor arrangements and comparisons with a broader range of existing methods. Clarifying the selection criteria for sensors and discussing the implications of using characters with different bone structures would also enhance the paper's depth.
