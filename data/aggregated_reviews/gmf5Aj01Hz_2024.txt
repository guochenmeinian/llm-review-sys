Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a spatial association reduction method for anomaly detection and diagnosis (SARAD) that identifies anomalous features in multivariate time-series data by analyzing changes in association values derived from an attention mechanism. SARAD integrates a transformer for data reconstruction and an MLP for spatial progression reconstruction, producing an anomaly score that combines both reconstruction scores. The authors evaluate their method across multiple datasets, achieving promising results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed methods are useful for detecting the source of anomalies in multivariate time-series data.
- The manuscript includes a sufficient evaluation of the proposed method.
- The idea of utilizing spatial association descending patterns for anomaly detection is interesting, and the authors introduce new criteria for calculating anomaly scores.

Weaknesses:
- The distinction between detected features and their correlated features is unclear, particularly in Figures 1 and 5.
- The manuscript lacks discussion on the identity shortcut problem common in reconstruction-based methods, which complicates the separation of anomalies from normal features.
- The point-based evaluation on the PSM dataset shows sensitivity to window size and short-term anomalies, and clustering quality for SMD and PSM is inferior compared to other datasets.
- The model size and parameters exceed those of other baselines significantly, raising concerns about fair comparisons.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the distinction between detected and correlated features, particularly in Figures 1 and 5. Additionally, we suggest discussing the identity shortcut problem in detail to clarify how it is addressed in the proposed method. The authors should also consider providing a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's sensitivity to window size and short-term anomalies. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to enhance the related work section by including a detailed discussion of baseline methods and their limitations, as well as comparing SARAD with existing methods that integrate spatial and temporal information for anomaly detection. Lastly, we recommend revising the terminology used to describe spatial associations to avoid confusion.
