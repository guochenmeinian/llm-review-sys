Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel positional encoding technique for spiking neural networks (SNNs) called CPG-PE, inspired by central pattern generators (CPGs) in the human brain. The authors demonstrate that CPG-PE effectively captures positional information in sequential data while preserving the spike-based nature of SNNs. The method is evaluated across various tasks, including time-series forecasting, text classification, and image classification, showing significant performance improvements over traditional SNNs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The bio-inspired CPG-PE technique enhances the sequence processing capability of SNNs.
2. The authors provide a strong theoretical foundation, mathematically relating CPG-PE to conventional sinusoidal positional encoding.
3. Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate consistent performance improvements across multiple domains.
4. CPG-PE is designed with compatibility for neuromorphic hardware, facilitating practical deployment.

Weaknesses:
1. No experiments were conducted on the large-scale ImageNet dataset.
2. The paper lacks discussion of other encoding methods in SNNs, such as rate coding and temporal coding.
3. The implementation of CPG-PE introduces additional parameters and computational overhead, which requires ablation studies to confirm performance improvements are not solely due to these factors.
4. Typographical errors and unclear specifications in the mathematical formulations need correction.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the differences between CPG-PE and other encoding schemes, including rate coding and temporal coding, within the related work. Additionally, please provide experimental results of CPG-PE on the ImageNet dataset to demonstrate effectiveness on large-scale tasks. We also suggest including ablation experiments to validate that performance enhancements are not merely due to the additional parameters introduced. Lastly, please address the typographical errors and clarify the decay mechanism in CPG-PE compared to LIF neurons.
