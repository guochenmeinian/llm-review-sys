### Key Points
This paper presents HyperLoRA, a novel method for image recontextualization that utilizes a hypernetwork to generate parameters for LoRAs (Low-Rank Adaptations) within a generative model (Stable Diffusion). The approach allows for contextualization in generated images without requiring image-specific fine-tuning. Experimental results indicate advantages in garment-to-model recontextualization, showcasing the model's adaptability across multiple modalities and its efficiency compared to existing methods like DreamBooth and LoRA.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- The method is novel, simple, and effective, with potential applications in various modalities.

Weaknesses:
- The related work section lacks a comprehensive discussion of real-time conditioning methods like MagicClothing and IP-Adapter, which are relevant for comparison.
- HyperLoRA exhibits visible mistakes in recontextualizing certain items, such as a black t-shirt, suggesting potential issues with high-frequency detail preservation in its image encoding process. A detailed analysis of these errors and comparisons with other methods would enhance the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section by including a more thorough comparison with real-time conditioning methods like MagicClothing and IP-Adapter to clarify how HyperLoRA differentiates itself. Additionally, we suggest conducting a detailed analysis of the errors observed in recontextualization tasks and comparing these results with other methods to provide a clearer understanding of HyperLoRA's performance. Lastly, please revise the sentence in line 85 to eliminate redundancy: “[…] is a multitask approach **that solves** that also.”
