Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an empirical investigation of InfoGating, a method for modulating information in neural networks through an input-conditioned continuous-valued mask. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of InfoGating in various control-adjacent learning problems, including multi-step inverse dynamics modeling, Q-learning, and fine-tuning pre-trained visual representations for behavior cloning. The experiments show that InfoGating outperforms other information-parsimonious approaches, such as the variational information bottleneck.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The originality of InfoGating, particularly its formulation using input-conditioned masking, is notable.
- The experiments cover a broad scope, validating the approach across three distinct testbeds and various InfoGating variants.
- The methods are clearly described, although some experimental details are insufficient for reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental design lacks robustness, particularly in evaluating generalization capabilities using held-out noise.
- The reliance on a learned input-conditioned mask may shift the burden of generalization to the masking network without adequate evaluation.
- Several statements in the paper are unclear or confusing, and the background material does not directly support the proposed idea.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental design by incorporating evaluations with held-out noise to substantiate generalization claims. Additionally, the authors should clarify the impact of the learned mask on generalization and provide clearer explanations for ambiguous statements. We suggest moving the background material to the experimental section to enhance relevance. Lastly, including comparisons with other masking techniques and addressing the performance across multiple tasks would strengthen the contribution of the paper.
