### Key Points
This paper presents a library called Lineax, developed using the existing frameworks of JAX and Equinox, capable of solving linear equations and linear least squares under various conditions. The authors propose that this library will be beneficial for researchers, particularly in fields like quantum simulation, where solving linear equations is essential.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well-aligned with the workshop's scope and has the potential to be useful across multiple scientific domains.

Weaknesses:  
The review suggests that the authors should provide the time complexity of their library as a function of matrix size and compare it with other linear solver libraries, such as BLAS.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve their submission by including the time complexity of the Lineax library as a function of matrix size and providing a comparison with other linear solver libraries like BLAS.
