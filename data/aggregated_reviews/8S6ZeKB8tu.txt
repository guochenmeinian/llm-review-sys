Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for evaluating the accuracy of noisy binary classifiers in a streaming context using unlabeled data. The authors propose two algebraic evaluators: one based on majority voting and another that is fully inferential, aiming to provide a more accurate estimation of label prevalence and classifier accuracy. The paper discusses the mathematical properties of the proposed evaluators and empirically investigates the relationship between error dependence and evaluation estimates.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a significant problem in machine learningâ€”evaluating binary classifiers on unlabeled data.
2. The proposed methods have potential applications across various fields, enhancing the paper's relevance.
3. Mathematical proofs support the proposed methods, and empirical tests are conducted on benchmark datasets.
4. The algebraic evaluation method offers a novel approach to bypass representation and out-of-distribution issues in machine learning.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper is poorly organized and difficult to read, lacking background information and clear definitions of key concepts.
2. The independence assumption may not hold in practice, particularly with classifiers trained on overlapping datasets.
3. The experimental evaluation is limited, relying on toy datasets without sufficient explanation or comparison to existing methods.
4. The paper does not adequately address related work, particularly in classifier combination techniques, and fails to discuss limitations and potential societal impacts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and organization of the paper by providing a clearer introduction and definitions of key terms. Additionally, we suggest including a comprehensive literature review to contextualize the work within existing research, particularly regarding classifier combination techniques. The authors should also expand the experimental section to include comparisons with other baselines and real-world applications to demonstrate the advantages of their proposed method. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to discuss the limitations of their approach, including potential negative societal impacts, and to clarify the implications of their independence assumption.
