Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents novel symmetry-breaking constraints for optimizing trained graph neural networks (GNNs) and addresses the graph isomorphism issue. The authors propose two mixed-integer optimization formulations and evaluate their methods in the context of molecular design. The theoretical correctness of the proposed approaches is established, and numerical efficiency is demonstrated through experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses the important issue of GNN optimization and demonstrates practical utility through molecular design applications.
2. The authors provide convincing experimental results supporting their claims, underscoring the proposed method's effectiveness.
3. The manuscript is well-written, presenting complex ideas with notable clarity.

Weaknesses:
1. The experiments lack persuasive verification; specifically, the formulation in Section 3.1 requires experimental validation to be considered a contribution, and Section 3.2's results lack baselines.
2. There is insufficient literature review on detecting and breaking MIP symmetry, failing to clarify how previous works relate to the proposed approach.
3. The paper does not adequately explore the compatibility of indexing requirements S1 and S3, nor does it clarify the relationship between structure feasibility constraints and the indexing process.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental validation of the formulation in Section 3.1 and provide necessary baselines for the results in Section 3.2. Additionally, we suggest that the authors enhance the literature review to include discussions on previous symmetry detection methods and their computational costs. It would also be beneficial to explore the compatibility of indexing requirements S1 and S3 in more detail and clarify the interplay between structure feasibility constraints and the indexing process.
