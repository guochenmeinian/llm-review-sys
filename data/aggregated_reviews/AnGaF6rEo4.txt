Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method, FairSync, aimed at enhancing group exposure in recommendation systems during the retrieval stage, addressing a gap where most existing methods focus on the ranking stage. The authors argue that equitable group exposure can be achieved at the retrieval level, and their system is tested on standard benchmark datasets, demonstrating improved performance over other fairness approaches with minimal computational overhead.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem definition is clear, and the goals are well articulated.
- The proposed algorithm is scalable and integrates easily with existing embedding algorithms.
- Extensive experiments show that FairSync meets exposure constraints while maintaining high performance metrics.

Weaknesses:
- The paper contains several editing issues and lacks clarity in some descriptions, particularly regarding Figure 4 and the proof for Theorem 1.
- The discussion on distributed retrieval is generic and lacks detail on how it compares to other systems.
- The method only considers a single type of fairness constraint, and the baseline methods are inadequately described.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Figure 4 and ensure that the descriptions align accurately with the visual data presented.
- We suggest providing a more detailed discussion of the distributed retrieval architecture and how it compares to other systems.
- We encourage the authors to explore the implications of embedding homogeneity on retrieval performance and consider the effects of query-level constraints on their method.
- We recommend enhancing the descriptions of baseline methods in the main text or appendix to clarify their relevance and constraints.
