### Key Points
This paper presents a study of the prophet inequality matching with vertex arrival under non-identical distributions, analyzing two algorithms—ATT($\gamma$) and SAMP($\gamma$)—with a focus on their competitive ratios and variances. The authors characterize the tight competitive ratios, showing that ATT(1/2) achieves the optimal competitive ratio. The algorithms address both matching and pricing issues, aiming to maximize expected total profit.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper tackles a well-motivated model and analyzes two natural algorithms, providing tight results for competitive ratios and variances. The writing quality is good, making the paper easy to follow. The techniques employed are broadly applicable, and the comparison with prior work is well-executed.

Weaknesses:  
Concerns arise regarding the novelty of the paper, as the optimal competitive ratio of 1/2 is previously established and can be achieved by various algorithms. The variance analysis, while a new approach, feels incomplete as it only addresses the variance of matching size rather than total collected revenue. Additionally, the necessity of considering general $m$ in ATT($\gamma$) is questioned, suggesting that focusing on $m = 1$ may be more appropriate.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity in Section 2.2 by explicitly stating that the 1/2-competitive upper bound of the single-item prophet inequality holds in this model. Additionally, we suggest that the authors justify the consideration of general $m$ in Section 2.4, as focusing on $m = 1$ may simplify the analysis. Furthermore, addressing the acceptance/rejection decision's independence from the algorithm's choice could enhance the theoretical framework. Lastly, we encourage the authors to reconsider the term "adversarial" in describing the distributions, potentially opting for "nonstationary," "nonuniform," or "heterogeneous" to avoid misleading implications.
