Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents reinforcement learning (RL) problems where agents can observe one-step lookahead information (rewards or transitions) before selecting actions in episodic tabular MDPs. The authors formalize this lookahead setting, derive Bellman equations for an equivalent new MDP, and develop two algorithms for reward (MVP-RL) and transition lookahead (MVP-TL), achieving the first sub-linear regret bound in this context. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is the first to provide a regret bound in the lookahead learning setting, encompassing various independently studied problems.  
- It is well-written and accessible to non-experts, with core ideas clearly presented and technical proofs in the appendix.  
- A tight regret bound is established, demonstrating the advantages of planning in RL without assuming known environment dynamics.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks empirical validation; experimental results comparing standard RL algorithms with MVP and MVP-RL are necessary to illustrate practical performance.  
- The inference process in Algorithms 1 and 2 is unclear; further explanations on action selection given a certain state are needed.  
- The paper does not adequately address the applicability of the lookahead setting in real-world scenarios and lacks clarity on the source of the baseline for comparisons.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by adding experimental results to validate the theoretical contributions and illustrate the practical performance of the proposed algorithms. Specifically, the authors should check learning curves and discuss practical implementation details. Additionally, we suggest providing a practical guideline for determining the parameter H and clarifying the necessity of the bonuses in the proposed methods. The authors should also address how the method can be extended to off-policy learning and its data efficiency. Lastly, we encourage the authors to enhance the related work section to reflect prior research on lookahead information in RL.
