Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Bi-Sampling Parameter Attribution (BSPA) method to address the unbalanced data bias in single image super-resolution (SISR) training, where flat regions dominate the training samples. The authors propose a bi-sampling strategy that combines uniform and inverse sampling to enhance model representation by focusing on difficult patches. Additionally, an integrated gradient (IG) approach is introduced to identify important parameters and prevent their gradient updates. The experimental results indicate that BSPA improves performance over baseline models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation for BSPA is clearly articulated, addressing a previously overlooked aspect of sampling in SISR.
2. The integration of IG for parameter attribution is a novel contribution that simplifies implementation compared to existing reweighting methods.
3. The paper is well-organized, and the experimental results demonstrate a reasonable improvement over prior methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The bi-sampling framework appears heuristic, lacking clarity on how to prioritize edge and texture regions when only low-resolution (LR) observations are available.
2. The justification for the inverse sampling procedure is insufficient, and the formula P(x)~1/x is unclear.
3. The novelty of the integrated gradient approach is questionable, as it seems derived from existing work (FAIG).
4. The experimental results do not convincingly support claims of significant performance boosts, with limited qualitative comparisons.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the bi-sampling framework, particularly in Fig. 2, to better illustrate the prioritization of edge and texture regions. Additionally, we suggest providing a more robust justification for the inverse sampling procedure and clarifying the derivation of P(x)~1/x. The authors should also emphasize the novel aspects of the integrated gradient method and conduct more comprehensive experiments on larger datasets to strengthen their claims. Finally, we encourage the inclusion of more qualitative comparisons to substantiate the performance improvements of BSPA.
