### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the use of Universal Scene Description (USD) for data storage in AI/ML operations involving 3D point cloud (3DPC) images. The authors propose a neuro-symbolic conversion (NSC) method to facilitate the transition between 3DPC and neuro-symbolic representations. However, the paper lacks a thorough comparison with existing methods and does not adequately address the processing time for image processing, which raises concerns about the practicality of the approach. Additionally, the authors do not clarify the source of the required object image library or the implications of its size on real-time processing.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The authors convincingly argue for the potential of USD in enhancing data storage for 3DPC images.  
- The NSC method appears to provide a useful conversion mechanism between 3DPC and neuro-symbolic representations.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper fails to compare the proposed approach with other modern representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields.  
- There is no discussion of processing times or the efficiency of the NSC method, which is critical for real-time applications.  
- The lack of clarity regarding the object library's origin and its scalability is concerning.  
- The text flows poorly in certain sections, and some technical terms are not adequately defined.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by providing a more detailed comparison with existing methods, particularly Neural Radiance Fields. It is essential to include processing time metrics for image processing to assess the practicality of the approach. Additionally, the authors should clarify the source of the object image library and discuss the implications of its size on real-time processing capabilities. We suggest extending the paper to six or eight pages to include a more comprehensive discussion of the USD representation and neuro-symbolic representation, as well as the space requirements of both representations. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the nature and extent of the efficiency gains offered by NS and USD representations. Lastly, we recommend addressing the identified text flow issues and ensuring that all technical terms are clearly defined.
