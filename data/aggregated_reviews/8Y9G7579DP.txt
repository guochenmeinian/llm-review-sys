### Key Points
This paper presents a dataset on humor detection and investigates the performance of various classifiers, including RoBERTa and Na√Øve Bayes, as well as large language models (LLMs) like Flan-U2 and chatGPT, across nine datasets. The authors also examine the robustness of classifiers to jokes with homonyms and provide a combined dataset to enhance model transferability. The findings indicate that RoBERTa-based models perform best when trained and tested on the same data, while LLMs demonstrate competitive results without relying on memorization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper standardizes humor detection collections, facilitating method comparison.  
- It provides a comprehensive investigation of existing datasets and includes extensive implementation details.  
- The datasets are cleaned, unified, and publicly available, enhancing their utility for future research.  
- The evaluation of zero-shot LLMs offers valuable insights into their understanding of humor.  

Weaknesses:  
- The manuscript presents seemingly trivial results, such as fine-tuned models performing best on their respective datasets.  
- The additional dataset lacks annotations, limiting its practical application for humor detection.  
- The exploration of humor detection in conversational contexts is insufficiently connected to the main content.  
- The experiments are limited to two classifiers and two LLMs, lacking depth in linguistic or theoretical exploration of humor.  
- The presentation of results is primarily numerical, lacking comprehensive interpretation, which diminishes reader engagement.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the depth of the introduction by linking to works on incongruity theory and exploring the linguistic or theoretical aspects of humor more thoroughly. Additionally, we suggest clustering datasets to identify higher-level trends and providing a more interpretative conclusion to the experimental results, rather than just presenting numerical data. Including human evaluations for the supplementary dataset would enhance its applicability. Finally, clarifying the connection between humor detection in conversational scenarios and the paper's content would strengthen the overall narrative.
