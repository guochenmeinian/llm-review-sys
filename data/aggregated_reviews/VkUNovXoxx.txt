Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of nonparametric machine teaching to multiple learners, where each learner learns a component of a vector-valued function. The authors analyze two teaching strategies, Random Functional Teaching (RFT) and Greedy FT (GFT), in both independent and communicated settings. Theoretical and empirical results demonstrate that communication can enhance loss reduction during training.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The problem of teaching multiple learners is interesting and underexplored in the machine teaching community, pushing the frontier of the field.  
- The paper provides solid theoretical analysis of loss reduction and the benefits of communication.  
- Extensive empirical studies validate the proposed teaching strategies.

Weaknesses:  
- The motivation for using multiple learners over a single learner learning a vector-valued function is insufficiently articulated. The introduction hints at computational issues but lacks explicit discussion and supporting experiments.  
- The theoretical assumptions, such as the necessity of a convex loss function, are not clearly stated, and the comparison of teaching performance to standard learning processes is missing.  
- The paper includes only one experiment on RGB channels, limiting the demonstration of generalizability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for the multi-learner approach by explicitly discussing computational advantages and including experiments that showcase these benefits. Additionally, the authors should clarify the theoretical assumptions regarding convexity and discuss the applicability of their results to non-convex loss functions. Finally, we suggest conducting experiments in varied settings to enhance the generalizability of the findings and replacing the Lenna image to avoid perpetuating an uninclusive environment.
