### Key Points
This paper presents a weakly-supervised learning approach to enhance fine-grained multimodal understanding by incorporating visual relation annotations into multimodal pre-training. The authors propose a two-part pre-training strategy: 1) applying verbalized scene graphs to standard multimodal objectives, and 2) introducing masked relation classification to predict relations between entities. Experimental results validate the method's effectiveness across various benchmark datasets, demonstrating improvements in visual spatial reasoning and fine-grained understanding capabilities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained benchmarks with a relatively small amount of data.
- The experiments are extensive and well-analyzed, providing valuable insights into the task's intricacies.
- The paper is well-written, and the figures and tables are visually appealing.

Weaknesses:
- The focus on scene graph-related tasks limits the coverage of other multimodal tasks.
- The baseline and backbone models may be outdated, given the emergence of newer multimodal models.
- There is a lack of visual representation to demonstrate the model's fine-grained comprehension abilities.
- The connection between weak supervision and the paper's motivation is not clearly articulated, and the absence of an ablation study raises questions about the design strategy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the connection between weak supervision and the proposed method, clarifying its distinction from traditional weakly supervised approaches. Additionally, we suggest including visual representations to validate the model's fine-grained comprehension capabilities. An ablation study should be conducted to explore the rationale behind the design choices, particularly regarding the use of location priors without exact mapping information. Finally, addressing the limitations and expanding the applicability discussions in the camera-ready version would enhance the paper's impact.
