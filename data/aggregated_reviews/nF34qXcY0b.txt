Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on identifying observable stochastic nonlinear dynamical systems with linearly parametrized transition functions and additive noise. The authors assume analytic feature functions, i.i.d. inputs, and bounded, semi-continuous noise with nonvanishing variances. The study investigates two estimation methods: the classical least-squares estimator (LSE) and a set membership method, providing finite sample bounds for LSE performance under specific conditions. The authors also present numerical evaluations on pendulum and quadrotor examples to demonstrate convergence rates.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The presentation is clear, and the paper is well-structured with precisely stated assumptions.
- The use of LSE and the set membership approach is relevant and practical.
- The sample complexity analysis addresses an important problem in system identification for nonlinear systems, particularly relevant to control theory.
- The provision of finite sample error bounds under the assumption of analytic features is original and potentially interesting for the community.
- Numerical examples effectively illustrate the theoretical viability of the analytic features assumption.

Weaknesses:
- Many assumptions are restrictive, such as bounded noises and i.i.d. inputs, which may not be realistic.
- The error bounds include terms that are unknown in practice, like \(s_\phi\).
- Corollary 1's controller for the closed-loop case includes an additive noise term, making the statement a simple consequence of Theorem 1; a case without additional input noise would be more compelling.
- Figures do not display the actual bounds derived in the paper, focusing instead on empirical performance, which may be less informative.
- The title could mislead readers, as "analytic" should refer to feature vectors rather than implying that the solution is analytic.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the intuitive meaning of Assumption 5 (tight bound on disturbance) to enhance clarity. Additionally, the authors should explore the potential limitations of the non-asymptotic convergence rate in practical applications. A deeper analysis of the numerical experiments is suggested, particularly regarding the convergence characteristics and the pros and cons of using i.i.d. noise for excitation. Clarifications in the proof sketches, especially regarding the meanings of \(\delta\) and \(\bar{b}_\phi\), would enhance readability. Finally, we suggest including the entirety of the proof of the main theorem in the main text, along with a clearer exposition of how the properties of analytic functions can be utilized to demonstrate the results.
