### Key Points
This paper presents a dataset for inferring constraints and goals from human descriptions within the context of the game Risk, comprising 1053 examples that map to 6 predefined goals and 8 (or 9?) constraint types. The authors propose a Roberta-based model with multiple classification heads, demonstrating its superiority over human and ChatGPT baselines. The study aims to translate natural language descriptions into structured goals and constraints, contributing to the NLP community by providing a benchmark and a comprehensive pipeline from data collection to evaluation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem of inferring human intentions is significant and well-addressed in a grounded game setup.
- The design of multiple classification heads and the use of CE, MSE, OaXE losses are reasonable.
- The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms both human and ChatGPT baselines.

Weaknesses:
- The task's nature is ambiguous, as it may resemble translation or semantic parsing rather than true inference.
- The quality of the annotations is questionable, with concerns about annotator expertise and potential overfitting to personal preferences.
- The applicability of the proposed framework to other contexts beyond Risk is uncertain, and the ChatGPT comparison may be unfair due to differing input conditions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the task definition, distinguishing it from translation or semantic parsing. Additionally, a thorough analysis of the annotation quality should be included to address concerns about its reliability as ground truth. It would be beneficial to conduct experiments that quantitatively assess the impact of improved goal and constraint extraction on game outcomes. Furthermore, we suggest exploring the model's capability for multi-round inference, as many strategic games involve sequential decision-making. Lastly, enhancing visualizations and examples in the paper could improve comprehension and presentation.
