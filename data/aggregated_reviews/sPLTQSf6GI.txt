Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel mathematical description of causal systems, extending traditional frameworks like structural causal models (SCMs) through a measure-theoretic approach based on probability distributions. The authors define causal space and utilize stochastic kernels to formalize interventions, aiming to provide a more general framework for causal reasoning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well-written and offers a rigorous axiomatization of causality grounded in measure-theoretic probability, which is a significant contribution to the field. It effectively illustrates the framework with examples and discusses related work, enhancing its clarity and relevance.

Weaknesses:  
The paper lacks sufficient motivation and examples, making the definitions appear arbitrary. There are also concerns regarding the clarity of certain claims, such as the definition of causal mechanisms and the relationship between interventions and conditioning. Additionally, some technical assertions, particularly regarding the uniqueness of causal mechanisms, require further justification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation and examples throughout the paper to better engage readers and clarify the significance of their definitions. Specifically, addressing the potential for alternative axiomatizations and providing proofs for key claims would strengthen the paper. We also suggest revising ambiguous terminology, such as "product probability space," and ensuring that all technical terms are clearly defined. Furthermore, exploring the philosophical implications of their framework and its relationship to existing theories, like those of Nancy Cartwright, would enhance the depth of the discussion. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the connection between their axioms and the measure-theoretic foundations, particularly regarding the necessity of Ïƒ-additivity.
