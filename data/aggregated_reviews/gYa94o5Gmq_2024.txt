Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Detection Adaptation Score (DAS), an unsupervised method for selecting optimal models in Domain Adaptive Object Detection (DAOD) without requiring target domain labels. DAS is grounded in the flat minima principle and comprises the Flatness Index Score (FIS) and Prototypical Distance Ratio (PDR) to assess model generalization. The authors emphasize the significance of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) as a critical research area in machine learning and clarify that their work aims to contribute to the UDA field, particularly for DAOD, rather than replace target data in real-world applications. Experimental results across various benchmarks indicate that DAS effectively aids in checkpoint selection and hyperparameter tuning, outperforming existing methods. The authors acknowledge the suggestion to test in a domain generalization (DG) setting, noting that DG is typically treated as a distinct task from UDA, with different models and benchmark datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The writing is clear and the motivation is well-articulated.  
2. The perspective on model selection for DAOD is innovative, potentially applicable to other fields requiring optimal checkpoint selection without labels.  
3. The method can be integrated with various DAOD techniques, yielding moderate performance improvements without compromising inference speed.  
4. The work addresses an important problem in the UDA field, specifically for DAOD, which is relevant to ongoing research.  
5. The authors express a commitment to advancing practical applications of their research.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The method has only been tested on the Faster RCNN baseline.  
2. Performance improvements are limited for some detectors under certain conditions.  
3. The applicability of the method to more nuanced tasks, such as instance segmentation, remains untested.  
4. The scope of the paper does not include testing in the DG setting, which some reviewers found interesting.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the adaptability of the proposed method by testing it on additional baselines for DAOD, such as the FCOS-based and DETR-based methods. Additionally, the authors should clarify why DAS does not yield significant gains in specific settings, such as the CMT on Real-to-Art Adaptation. It would also be beneficial to explore the method's applicability to fine-grained tasks like segmentation. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors improve the clarity regarding the distinction between UDA and DG in the paper and consider exploring the DG setting in future work, as it could enhance the relevance and applicability of their findings. Finally, consider providing a more comprehensive review of advanced cross-domain object detection works to strengthen the literature context.
