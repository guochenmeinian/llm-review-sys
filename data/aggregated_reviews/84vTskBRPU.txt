### Key Points
This paper presents a solution for combining numeric range search with text retrieval using z-metric space filling curves and quad trees as the index structure. The authors propose techniques for query optimization, demonstrating substantial efficiency improvements through experiments with three datasets and synthetic queries. However, the focus is primarily on exact matches for numeric ranges, neglecting relevance and retrieval quality. The paper also discusses the clever use of z-order curves for encoding and searching numerical ranges, although it raises concerns about the necessity of encoding entire numeric ranges at the lowest level.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, easy to follow, and provides sufficient examples to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed operators.
- It presents a novel combination of existing methods for managing temporal and numeric expressions, with impressive query processing times.
- The experimental evaluation covers multiple document collections and demonstrates the system's performance against defined baselines.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a focus on relevance and ranked retrieval, which are critical aspects of information retrieval.
- The comparison against standard IR indexing systems is insufficient, limiting insights into the current research landscape.
- The implementation details regarding index representation in HBase are not adequately reported, and the experimental queries are limited to only 100.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the encoding of numeric ranges, particularly the implications of encoding at the lowest level. Additionally, the authors should consider including user-centric evaluation metrics such as P@k and NDCG@k to provide better insights into system performance. A more comprehensive comparison with standard IR systems like Lucene/Anserini would enhance the paper's relevance to the information retrieval community. Finally, providing more details on the implementation and making the source code available would significantly increase the paper's value.
