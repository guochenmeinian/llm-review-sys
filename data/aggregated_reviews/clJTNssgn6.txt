Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a hierarchical vector quantized transformer (HVQ-Trans) framework for multi-class anomaly detection, addressing the "identical shortcut" problem in reconstruction-based methods. The authors propose using discrete iconic prototypes and an optimal transport mechanism to enhance anomaly score calibration. The method is evaluated on MvTec-AD and CIFAR-10 datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation for using discrete iconic prototypes to mitigate reconstruction shortcuts is sound.
2. The method achieves competitive results on established benchmarks.
3. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a logical flow of ideas.

Weaknesses:
1. There is a lack of necessary comparisons with additional datasets, such as the VisA dataset.
2. The details of vector quantization (VQ) are insufficiently presented, particularly regarding its impact on performance.
3. The experimental evaluation does not include comparisons with several recent state-of-the-art anomaly detection models.
4. The claim of being "unsupervised" is questionable, as category labels are assumed available during training.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of figure descriptions, particularly in labeling images and subfigures. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with more challenging datasets to validate the method's robustness. The authors should provide a thorough explanation of the vector quantization method and its implications on performance. Furthermore, we encourage the inclusion of recent state-of-the-art models in the experimental analysis to substantiate claims of superior performance. Lastly, addressing the computational complexity and the criteria for determining the number of prototypes would enhance the paper's depth.
