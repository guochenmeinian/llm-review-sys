Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method to compute the covariance of recorded neurons under specific stimulus conditions using a Bayesian model that imposes smoothness on means and models covariance as \( L (U U^\top + \Lambda) L^\top \). The authors propose leveraging the relationship between similar conditions to improve covariance estimates, validated through experiments on synthetic and real data. The work applies Wishart Processes to estimate neural activity covariance, pooling estimates across parametric variations to enhance reliability despite limited trials. Additionally, the authors introduce technical contributions, including a low-rank structure and a Poisson noise model, aimed at enhancing neural data analysis. They argue that their approach can facilitate more complex analyses and experiments, addressing a gap in current methodologies, particularly in noise correlation analysis, which is typically limited to simple stimulus sets. The authors emphasize the importance of demonstrating measurable impacts on neural data analysis practices.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and addresses a significant problem in neuroscience, particularly in estimating covariance with limited trials.
- The application of Bayesian nonparametric techniques to a new domain is commendable, and the method shows good performance in dense sampling scenarios.
- The approach is innovative in its use of smoothness across conditions, which is a novel contribution.
- The paper introduces incremental yet significant technical advances, such as the low-rank ansatz and Poisson observation model.
- The rebuttal effectively addresses reviewer concerns, clarifying the practical benefits of the proposed model for neural data analysis.
- The new application to Fisher Information is noted as particularly valuable for those in psychophysics and neural physiology.

Weaknesses:
- The exploitation of similar conditions for better covariance estimates is not entirely new, as noted in previous works.
- The experiments appear biased towards the authors' method, lacking comparisons with competitors that utilize both empirical and population covariance estimates.
- There is a notable absence of clear performance metrics on real data, relying heavily on visual inspection rather than predictive tasks.
- Some results are perceived as underanalyzed, relying heavily on visual inspection rather than robust quantitative metrics.
- The initial presentation of the scaling of required observations may have led to confusion regarding its implications for practical applications.
- The model's computational efficiency compared to standard estimators is unclear, and potential issues with hyper-parameter optimization and internal cross-validation are not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparative analysis by including competitors that utilize both empirical and population covariance estimates to provide a fair evaluation of their method. Additionally, we suggest incorporating predictive tasks, such as regression or classification, to demonstrate the method's predictive power rather than relying solely on visual inspection. Clarifying the computational runtime of the proposed method in comparison to standard estimators would also enhance the paper's contributions. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide a clearer explanation of the internal cross-validation process and to address the optimization of \( L \) and the definition of \( \bar{\mu} \) in equation (4). Lastly, we suggest that the authors improve the clarity of their statements regarding the scaling of required observations to avoid potential misunderstandings and enhance the analysis of their results by incorporating more quantitative metrics to support their claims. Including a graphical representation of the generative model and variational inference procedure would aid in understanding the methodology.
