### Key Points
This paper presents a comparative study on various methods for ad-hoc dataset retrieval, focusing on retrieving datasets that match a query with textual descriptions from a large collection. The authors evaluate a field-weighted BM25 baseline against dense retrieval approaches, entity-based methods, and combinations of these techniques using two datasets (ACORDAR and NTCIR-E). The experimental results indicate that combined methods can achieve superior performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is clear and well-written, addressing an interesting and underexplored topic.
- Extensive experimental results provide a useful benchmark for future work in dataset retrieval.
- The study captures a wide variety of approaches and presents a good literature survey.

Weaknesses:
- The re-ranking setup is limited, focusing only on the top-10 results, which restricts the evaluation's effectiveness.
- Insufficient details are provided regarding the training of neural retrieval models and the performance of entity linking systems on in-domain data.
- The paper lacks novel findings and primarily surveys existing approaches, which may not be sufficient for the conference's standards.
- The analysis of experimental results is weak, lacking detailed insights into the observations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation setup by reporting experiments focused on re-ranking a larger set of datasets returned by first-stage retrieval. Additionally, the authors should provide more details about the models and methods used, particularly regarding the training procedures and performance metrics of entity linking systems on in-domain data. We suggest exploring alternative methods for combining retrieval approaches, such as rank fusion techniques, rather than relying solely on arithmetic mean interpolation. Furthermore, the authors should consider experimenting with different similarity functions and provide illustrative examples to clarify the benefits of their proposed methods. Lastly, enhancing the analysis of experimental results with deeper insights would strengthen the paper's contributions.
