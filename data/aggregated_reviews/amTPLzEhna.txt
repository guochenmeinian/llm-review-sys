### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to euphemism identification by formulating the task as a cloze task and proposing a feature fusion and individualization (FFI) method. The FFI method consists of three components: a feature fusion model that integrates dynamic global and static local features, a feature individualization module that projects features into orthogonal space, and a prediction module that combines these features for classification. The authors validate their method through experiments on three datasets: Drug, Weapon, and Sexuality, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The task is important and the problem is well-articulated.
2. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
3. The experimental analysis is comprehensive, including ablation studies and comparisons with existing models.

Weaknesses:
1. A warning about sensitive content should precede the abstract.
2. The motivating goals in lines 92-99 need clearer explanation to differentiate this work.
3. The paper lacks discussion on the discovery of euphemisms, which could enhance its value.
4. Justifications regarding the limitations of GPT-3.5 in lines 745-799 are unconvincing and require revision.
5. The claim that the approach is not time-consuming is questionable, as it requires training a separate model.
6. There is an error in Eq. (2) that needs correction.
7. The novelty of the method relies heavily on simple techniques, and the baselines are not competitive.
8. The results show fragile improvements in Acc@2 and Acc@3 without sufficient analysis.
9. Lack of reproducible content, including data and code.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by providing a warning about sensitive content before the abstract. Additionally, the authors should clarify the motivating goals in lines 92-99 to better highlight the uniqueness of their work. It would be beneficial to include suggestions for identifying euphemisms to enhance the paper's scope. We also suggest revisiting the justifications regarding the limitations of GPT-3.5 to strengthen the argument. The authors should clarify the time consumption claim, considering the training requirements of their model. Furthermore, correcting the error in Eq. (2) is essential. We encourage the authors to explore more competitive baselines and provide a deeper analysis of the fragile improvements in Acc@2 and Acc@3. Lastly, including reproducible content such as data and code would significantly enhance the paper's impact.
