Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method to accelerate simulations of adaptive leaky integrate-and-fire (ALIF) neurons on GPUs by utilizing the absolute refractory period (ARP) to create parallelizable blocks of time. The authors demonstrate significant speedups—approximately 40x in inference and 53x in training—while maintaining accuracy, as validated through simulations on spiking classification tasks and real neural recordings. The approach is novel in its application for GPU parallelization, although similar concepts have been previously employed in other simulators.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-motivated, addressing the critical speed-accuracy tradeoff in biological simulations.
- Two levels of evaluation are effectively designed: training on spiking classification tasks and fitting to real neural recordings.
- The method is mathematically validated to improve speed without sacrificing accuracy, supported by multiple experiments.

Weaknesses:
- The algorithm's reliance on sparse firing during the ARP limits its generalizability to other types of spiking neural networks (SNNs).
- Performance is heavily dependent on manually tuned hyperparameters (ARP and DT), which may not be practical in real applications.
- The absence of additional baseline comparisons under the same experimental conditions raises concerns about the robustness of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their algorithm to standard spiking neuron models, such as the leaky integrate-and-fire model without adaptive firing thresholds and the Hodgkin–Huxley model. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explore automatic optimization of the hyperparameters ARP and DT to enhance practical applicability. It is also crucial to include additional baseline evaluations and comparisons with existing implementations to substantiate the claims of superiority. Finally, clarifying the impact of the refractory period on accuracy through simple simulations could provide valuable insights.
