### Key Points
This paper presents a method (CHARM) for creating mock halo catalogs by matching the spatial and mass statistics of halos. The authors propose calculating one-, two-, and three-point statistics to evaluate performance, demonstrating the accuracy and speed-up of CHARM, achieving a 1000x speedup over conventional methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The research background and data description are clear and detailed.
2. The potential application of this method is promising and could lead to useful discussions.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the multistage deep learning method appears limited compared to references [2, 12, 15, 23].
2. Few related works are presented in the paper.
3. There is a lack of an ablation study and comparison with related works and conventional methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty aspect by providing a more comprehensive comparison with existing methods. Additionally, the authors should include the ResNet and NSF architectures along with the training strategy in the paper. Providing the source code would enhance reproducibility. Furthermore, clarification on how the 1000x speedup is derived is necessary. Lastly, the authors should address the large standard deviation of low $M_{halos}$ as shown in Figure 2.
