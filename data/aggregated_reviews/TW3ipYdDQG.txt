Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the fair PCA problem, introducing a novel formulation based on the "Null It Out" approach and proposing the PAFO-learnability criterion. The authors also develop a streaming algorithm for fair PCA, which demonstrates low memory complexity. The empirical results validate the scalability of the proposed method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and clear, addressing an important and interesting problem.
2. The theoretical framework for PAFO-learnability provides guarantees on the solution quality of algorithms like FNPM.
3. The proposed FNPM algorithm is simple to implement and scalable, validated through a vision task.

Weaknesses:
1. Assumption 6.1 is considered too strong; the paper could demonstrate its validity under common distributions like sub-Gaussian.
2. The tightness of theorems in section 6 raises concerns, as large block sizes may diminish the memory-saving contribution.
3. The experiments lack quantitative results to verify the PAFO-learnability of the FNPM algorithm, focusing instead on visual representations.
4. The results are limited to binary sensitive attributes and two groups, suggesting a need for extension to multi-group scenarios.
5. The paper does not adequately discuss the implications of certain assumptions, nor does it compare with other fair PCA methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the robustness of their assumptions by testing their sensitivity to violations. Additionally, the authors should consider extending their approach to handle multi-group scenarios and provide a more quantitative evaluation of fairness in their experiments. A comparison with other fair PCA methods would enhance understanding of their approach's effectiveness. Finally, we suggest including the complete pseudocode of Alg. 1 in the main paper and discussing the iteration number U's impact on performance more thoroughly.
