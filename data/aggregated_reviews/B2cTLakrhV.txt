Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for learning Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) from observational data by incorporating prior knowledge through partial order constraints, extending existing continuous DAG learning methods like NOTEARS and DAGMA. The authors propose an augmented acyclicity-based method that enhances efficiency and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets. Theoretical motivations and analyses underpin the proposed method, establishing its soundness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The problem addressed is novel and significant, representing a new sub-problem in DAG discovery from observational data.
2. The proposed method is well-motivated both conceptually and theoretically, with rigorously defined notations and definitions.
3. Comprehensive experiments support the claims made in the paper, showcasing improved structural recovery with fewer samples.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a clear comparison between the straightforward method introduced in Eq 8a and the augmented acyclicity-based method regarding performance and efficiency.
2. Certain equations, particularly Eq 9c and 9d, are difficult to understand, raising questions about definitions and formulations.
3. The differentiability of the algorithm concerning $W$ is unclear, particularly in relation to backpropagation through permutations and the operations in Algorithms 2, 3, and 4.
4. The introduction of the hyperparameter $\gamma$ lacks practical guidance for its determination due to the absence of ground truth for validation.
5. The use of Linear NOTEARS as a baseline in real-world data experiments raises questions about the assumptions of linearity in the data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the comparison between the straightforward method and the augmented acyclicity-based method by including performance metrics. Additionally, we suggest providing clearer definitions and explanations for Eq 9c and 9d to enhance understanding. The authors should discuss the differentiability of their algorithms in more detail, particularly regarding backpropagation and the operations in the proposed algorithms. Furthermore, we advise the authors to elaborate on how to determine the hyperparameter $\gamma$ in practice. Lastly, we encourage the authors to address the assumptions regarding linearity in the real-world data experiments to strengthen their findings.
