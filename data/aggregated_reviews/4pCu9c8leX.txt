Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Key-Grid, a novel unsupervised network for keypoint detection in 3D point clouds, capable of handling both rigid and deformable objects. The method employs an autoencoder framework where the encoder predicts keypoints, and the decoder reconstructs objects using a grid heatmap that captures geometric structures. The authors achieve state-of-the-art performance on datasets such as ShapeNetCoreV2 and ClothesNet, emphasizing the grid heatmap's effectiveness in providing stable geometric descriptions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The unsupervised nature of the method allows for application on larger datasets without the need for 3D annotations.
2. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with extensive experiments demonstrating state-of-the-art results.
3. The proposed grid heatmap introduces a novel approach to 3D keypoint detection, particularly for deformable objects.

Weaknesses:
1. The visualized results only feature uniform point clouds, raising concerns about the method's ability to handle partial point clouds or those with severe outliers.
2. The training process does not converge when using a SPRIN module as a backbone, necessitating exploration of alternative backbones.
3. The rationale behind the grid heatmap's representation of the skeleton is unclear, and the paper lacks discussion on handling occluded point clouds.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the method's applicability to partial and noisy point clouds by providing empirical evidence or theoretical justification for its performance under these conditions. Additionally, we suggest exploring the use of alternative backbones, such as Vector Neurons, to enhance training convergence. The authors should clarify the rationale behind the grid heatmap's design and consider incorporating a graph-based feature aggregation approach. Furthermore, we advise enhancing the quality of figures 1 and 2 and moving Fig 6 to the main text for clarity. Lastly, addressing the questions regarding the semantic consistency of keypoints across deformations and providing comparisons with supervised baselines would strengthen the paper.
