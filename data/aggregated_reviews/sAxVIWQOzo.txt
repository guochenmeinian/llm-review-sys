### Key Points
This paper presents the Game-Traversal-Benchmark (GTB), a benchmark designed to evaluate the planning and reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through diverse 2D grid-based traverse game maps. The GTB assesses LLMs based on three criteria: the ability to guide an agent to objectives, the number of steps taken by the agent, and the number of generation errors made by the LLM. The authors evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on the GTB to highlight its challenges and potential for advancing LLM planning capabilities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The intersection of LLMs and reinforcement learning is timely, and the proposed benchmark is of significant interest to the deep-learning community.
- The GTB benchmark's design allows for straightforward integration into LLMs via textual representation of 2D-grid maps.
- The benchmark presents considerable challenges for current LLMs, indicating ample opportunity for future advancements.
- The authors demonstrate a solid understanding of related works and the trajectory of LLM research.

Weaknesses:
- There are critical questions regarding the benchmark's premise and specific settings that require clarification.
- The evaluation revealed that only 3 out of 10 LLMs outperformed a random baseline, raising concerns about the appropriateness of the 2D traverse games for assessing LLM planning abilities.
- The paper contains several elementary writing errors, which detract from its overall clarity and professionalism.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the reward structure, particularly regarding R_min in equation (2) and the definition of "generation errors." Additionally, we suggest addressing the treatment of path length when the agent makes redundant moves, as this could misrepresent planning efficiency. It would be beneficial to discuss the limitations of the benchmark, including the static nature of the 2D game maps and the restricted action space. We also encourage the inclusion of ablation studies to compare baseline performances across various settings. Finally, we urge the authors to enhance documentation and provide supplementary materials to support reproducibility.
