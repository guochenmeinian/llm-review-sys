### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the asymptotic distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for multinomial logistic regression in high-dimensional settings, where both the sample size and the number of parameters grow at the same rate. It extends previous results for binary classification to multiclass scenarios, establishing asymptotic normality and chi-square results for null covariates. The authors provide robust numerical evidence to support their theoretical findings and propose a proper statistic for significance testing.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is clearly and carefully written, with well-stated validity conditions and robust numerical support for the theoretical analysis.  
- It addresses a timely and fundamental problem in high-dimensional statistics, improving upon prior work in characterizing asymptotic behaviors.  
- The simulations align well with the asymptotic theory, demonstrating the practical applicability of the results.  

Weaknesses:  
- The existence of the MLE is assumed but not fully characterized, which is acknowledged by the authors.  
- The hypothesis $H_0$ appears stronger than $H_0'$, raising concerns about the potential for features to have zero population coefficients under certain conditions.  
- The theoretical framework relies heavily on the work of Sur and Cand√®s, which may raise questions about the novelty of the contributions.  
- The paper does not characterize the distribution for non-null features, leaving a gap in the study of parameter inference for high-dimensional multinomial logistic regression.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the characterization of the MLE's existence to strengthen the theoretical foundation of their work. Additionally, the authors should consider whether $H_0$ can be suitably weakened to enhance the robustness of their findings. It would be beneficial to apply the proposed methodology to real-world benchmark datasets to evaluate classification errors and compare performance against existing methods. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors explicitly highlight the unique theoretical challenges posed by multinomial logistic regression to address concerns regarding the novelty of their contributions. Lastly, presenting Theorem 2.2 and the estimation of $\Omega_{jj}$ in algorithmic form could enhance clarity and usability.
