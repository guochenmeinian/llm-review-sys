Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a property testing formulation for verifying calibration, focusing on the lower distance to calibration metric. The authors propose algorithms that solve the $\epsilon$-calibration testing problem in $O(n \log^2 n)$ time and a tolerant version in $O((\epsilon_1 - \epsilon_2)^{-2} n \log n)$ time. The first algorithm utilizes a structured linear program (LP) reformulated as a min-cost flow on a simple graph, while the second employs a rounding framework for combinatorial optimization. The empirical results validate the theoretical claims, demonstrating the algorithms' efficiency compared to commercial solvers.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel approach to calibration as a property testing problem, providing fast algorithms for lower distance to calibration error.
- The techniques employed are straightforward yet effective, particularly the dynamic programming-based algorithm for smooth calibration error.
- The empirical validation of the algorithms against commercial solvers is a significant contribution, showcasing practical applicability.

Weaknesses:
- The paper's format may not align well with NeurIPS, and some theoretical results are only briefly mentioned in the main body.
- The contextualization of the results in larger calibration settings is lacking, particularly in demonstrating practical applications of the proposed framework.
- Some sections are poorly organized, with important definitions and explanations deferred to the appendix, which detracts from clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the contextualization of their results by providing concrete applications of the proposed calibration testing methods in practical settings. Additionally, we suggest including a summary section that consolidates the limitations and weaknesses discussed throughout the paper. Clarifying the role of $\epsilon$ in the smooth calibration program and ensuring that all central definitions are included in the main text would enhance the paper's clarity and accessibility. Furthermore, addressing the organizational issues and providing more detailed explanations for key insights, such as the proof of Lemma 2, would strengthen the overall presentation.
