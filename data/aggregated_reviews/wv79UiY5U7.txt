Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents data curation strategies for image captioning, focusing on modifying difficult samples identified by captioning loss. The authors propose three methods: (1) removal of image-caption pairs, (2) replacement of captions, and (3) generation of new images using text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion. Empirical results indicate that these strategies can enhance the performance of the BLIP captioning model, although the effectiveness of the third strategy is questioned.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The exploration of data curation is a significant and relevant topic that could benefit various tasks, including image captioning.
2. The use of generative models for data curation is a novel approach that is well-motivated.
3. The paper is well-written, with clear presentation and extensive experimental validation.

Weaknesses:
1. The proposed methods, particularly the third strategy, do not show substantial performance improvements over simpler heuristic methods.
2. The reliance on training loss to identify problematic samples is questionable, as high loss may not always indicate poor quality.
3. The paper lacks a comprehensive theoretical analysis and broader coverage of related work in image captioning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their methodology, particularly regarding how replacement captions are selected. Additionally, we suggest that the authors evaluate other data augmentation techniques, such as adding synonyms or altering sentence structures. It would be beneficial to conduct a theoretical analysis to support the effectiveness of the proposed methods and to explore their applicability beyond image captioning. Finally, we encourage the authors to broaden their related work section to include seminal papers in the field and consider alternative applications for their curation strategy.
