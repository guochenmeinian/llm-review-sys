Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for estimating oriented normals from point clouds using a neural representation, specifically a signed distance function (SDF). The authors propose a multi-step optimization approach that incorporates various loss functions to ensure consistency in normal orientation and shape locality. The method shows promising results in comparison to existing techniques, although it has notably slow training times.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on datasets like PCPNet and FamousShape, particularly in the presence of noise.
2. The paper is well-structured, with a comprehensive introduction and related work sections, making it self-contained and accessible.
3. The proposed approach effectively highlights the limitations of previous methods, providing a strong motivation for its development.

Weaknesses:
1. The contribution of the paper is not clearly articulated, making it difficult for readers unfamiliar with the field to understand its novelty. The ablation study lacks clarity, and the main advancements, particularly in multi-scale neighbor consistency, need to be better emphasized.
2. Important comparisons with similar works, such as [A] and [B], are missing, which could enhance the discussion in the related works section.
3. Mathematical definitions and notations in the method section require clarification, as some terms are introduced without proper definitions, hindering comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contribution by explicitly stating the main insights and restructuring Section 3.2 with paragraph titles. Additionally, a more thorough discussion of related works, particularly regarding the missing references [A] and [B], would strengthen the paper. We also suggest revisiting the mathematical definitions and notations to ensure they are clearly defined and easily understandable. Finally, including illustrations for the different losses, similar to those in Figure 2, would enhance the paper's presentation.
