### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the sample complexity of Robust Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs) through interactive data collection, addressing challenges such as distributional robustness and the balance between exploration and exploitation. The authors contribute by: 1) demonstrating that sample-efficient learning is unattainable without additional assumptions due to the curse of support shift; 2) introducing the vanishing minimal value assumption for RMDPs with a total-variation distance robust set, which simplifies the problem; and 3) proposing an algorithm with a provable sample complexity guarantee.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper is clearly written, with well-exposed ideas.  
2. The authors derive a significant lower bound and a tight upper bound on the sample complexity of RMDPs in an online setting, using the vanishing minimal value assumption.  
3. The proof appears correct, and the algorithm effectively balances exploration and exploitation.  
4. The analysis is thorough, and the comparisons with existing works are detailed, enhancing clarity.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The results could be extended to the $s$-rectangular case.  
2. There is no lower bound with the vanishing minimal assumption to ensure the tightness of the upper bound.  
3. The range of $\epsilon$ for the upper bound should be specified, or conditions on K should be provided instead of stating "lower order term in K."  
4. More intuition on the vanishing minimal assumption would be beneficial.  
5. The paper is purely theoretical, lacking empirical results or simulations to provide practical insights.  
6. The feasibility of the interactive data collection design in real-world problems is uncertain.  
7. A more detailed discussion comparing the proposed method with baseline methods is needed, potentially supported by numerical results.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by extending the results to the $s$-rectangular case and providing a lower bound with the vanishing minimal assumption to ensure the upper bound's tightness. Additionally, we suggest specifying the range of $\epsilon$ for the upper bound or providing conditions on K. It would also be beneficial to offer more intuition regarding the vanishing minimal assumption. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include empirical results or simulations to enhance practical understanding and to clarify the feasibility of the interactive data collection design in real-world applications. Lastly, a more detailed comparison with baseline methods, supported by numerical results, would strengthen the paper.
