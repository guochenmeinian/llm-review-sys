### Key Points
We focus on a method for generating contact-rich interactions between two characters with varying body sizes and proportions. The approach predicts joint relation distributions based on a given skeleton and allows learning from limited data. A new dataset is introduced, augmented from single interaction examples using InteractionMesh. The pipeline employs Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution Networks and gated Recurrent Units for motion reconstruction.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
1. The method is novel and technically sound, eliminating the need to capture additional motion data for different skeleton sizes.
2. The paper is well-written and easy to understand.
3. Adequate baselines are provided for motion prediction and activity recognition, though additional baselines could enhance the analysis.

**Weaknesses:**
1. The distinction between ground-truth and generated motions is unclear.
2. Questions arise regarding the integrity of contact points during interactions, particularly when skeleton sizes change.
3. The related work section lacks recent references on deep learning-based two-person interaction generation methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We suggest revising the sentence structure for clarity, enhancing the resolution of figures, and considering alternative terminology for "Supplement Material." Additionally, we recommend including recent references in the related work section, addressing the concerns about model overfitting, and ensuring that contact points remain accurate during interactions. Finally, we highly suggest releasing the code for reproducibility.
