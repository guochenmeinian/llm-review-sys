### Key Points
This paper presents an encoding of Open Information Extraction (OIE) as a data corruption task, employing a T5 model to facilitate the triple generation process of the GEN2OIE model by Kolluru et al. (2022) in a few-shot scenario. The authors propose a paradigm shift to span corruption to address data inefficiency and introduce anchor methods to guide generation order. Empirical validation and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches, particularly in the context of English language processing.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces a technically sound paradigm shift that effectively addresses data inefficiency in low-resource scenarios.  
- Empirical results support the effectiveness of the proposed techniques, particularly the transformation to span corruption.  
- The authors provide clear objectives and insightful analyses of their approach.

Weaknesses:  
- The reliance on the English language limits the generalizability of the results, which should be explicitly stated.  
- Some implementation details regarding the anchor guidance are insufficiently explained, particularly the p-tuning process.  
- The paper lacks comprehensive experimental setups, relying on a single dataset and insufficient clarity in the ablation experiments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the anchor guidance implementation by providing more detailed descriptions, particularly regarding the p-tuning process. Additionally, we suggest including a comparison with GEN2OIE directly for low-resource settings to substantiate claims of improvement. It would also be beneficial to report zero-shot performance and explore the impact of different T5 model sizes on the proposed methods. Finally, the authors should explicitly address the limitations of their work being confined to the English language to enhance the paper's generalizability.
