Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a multi-domain approach for causal discovery, moving beyond the traditional single-domain scenario. The authors propose methods for optimizing S-PAGs and introduce the S-Markov property, which is tailored for multi-domain settings. Additionally, the paper introduces the concept of domain variables and distinguishes between domain and intervention in the context of known and unknown interventional targets. An algorithm for learning Markov equivalence classes (MEC) is also proposed, with plans for open-source implementation. The integration of observational and interventional data across multiple domains is discussed, aiming to enhance causal inference and improve the understanding of relationships in causal modeling.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a novel setting that combines observational and interventional data from multiple domains, which is relevant for real-world applications.
2. It introduces the multi-domain Markov equivalence class and provides methods for causal discovery across these domains.
3. The motivation for the work is valid, particularly in addressing both known and unknown interventional targets.
4. The authors have made efforts to clarify the distinction between interventions and domain changes, as well as to compare their work with existing literature.
5. Numerous examples in Section 2 aid in clarifying the concepts presented.

Weaknesses:
1. The notation is overly complex and inconsistent, making it difficult for readers to follow; clearer definitions in Section 1 are needed.
2. The absence of related works may hinder comprehension, particularly in the introduction and related work sections, which require major revisions.
3. The problem formulation lacks clarity, especially regarding its relationship with existing works on modeling known/unknown interventions.
4. Experimental results should be included in the main content, as they are crucial for validating the paper's claims.
5. Many theorems and rules are proposed without accompanying proofs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of symbols and notation to enhance reader comprehension, particularly by providing clearer definitions in Section 1. Additionally, we suggest including related works to better contextualize the research and revising the introduction and related work sections for clarity. The authors should also consider integrating experimental results into the main body of the paper to substantiate their claims. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the problem formulation, especially its relationship with existing works on modeling known/unknown interventions while considering latent confounders. Finally, we recommend providing proofs for the theorems and rules presented to strengthen the paper's rigor and to organize the technical body in a top-down manner to better convey key ideas, avoiding excessive detail at early stages.
