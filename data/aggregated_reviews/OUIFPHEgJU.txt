### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to memory-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) using QLoRA, which incorporates NF4, a new 4-bit quantization data type, along with techniques such as double quantization and paged optimizers. The authors demonstrate that QLoRA enables the fine-tuning of a 65B parameter model on a single GPU, significantly reducing memory requirements compared to traditional methods. The evaluation is comprehensive, detailing specifications of compared methods, datasets, hyperparameters, and base models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The extensive evaluation across various datasets, including academic and instruction-following datasets, enhances the paper's credibility.
2. The introduction of the NF4 data type for quantization is a significant innovation.
3. QLoRA's ability to fine-tune large models on a single 48GB GPU showcases its efficiency.
4. The open-sourcing of all models and code facilitates community engagement and reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a discussion on the inference efficiency of QLoRA and its impact on serving costs, particularly regarding energy consumption and carbon emissions.
2. There is a need for clarity on the choice of LoRA as the efficient fine-tuning method and its applicability to other methods.
3. The performance gap observed in larger models raises concerns about scalability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the naming convention of double quantization for clarity, as it may confuse readers. Additionally, we encourage the authors to discuss the inference efficiency of QLoRA and its potential impact on serving costs, including estimates of energy savings and carbon emissions. It would also be beneficial to provide more details on the improvements resulting from the paged optimizer and to include ablation studies on learning rates, schedules, and hyperparameters in the appendix. Finally, addressing the scalability of the proposed method for larger models would enhance the paper's contribution.
