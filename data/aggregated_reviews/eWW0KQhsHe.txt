### Key Points
This paper presents a data augmentation method for Korean, named CHEF, which generates augmented samples with diverse morphemes while preserving sentence-level labels. The authors propose a generator-discriminator model architecture for sentence generation and label consistency. Experiments demonstrate that CHEF achieves superior performance on various Korean downstream tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is intuitive from a linguistic perspective and effectively addresses issues pertinent to morphologically rich languages.
- Extensive evaluations across multiple datasets and augmentation settings support the method's effectiveness.
- The paper is easy to follow, and significant improvements are shown in the KLUE benchmark, even with smaller language models.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks comparisons with other relevant data augmentation methods, such as those by Guo (2020) and Karimi et al. (2021).
- Clarity is needed regarding the scope of the morphological blender and label discriminator, particularly whether they operate at the word or sentence level.
- The choice of the mecab-ko analyzer is not adequately justified, especially concerning its handling of irregular morphemes in Korean.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the morphological blender and label discriminator's scope, specifying whether they function at the word or sentence level. Additionally, please clarify the input to the morphological blender regarding lexical and functional morphemes. It would also be beneficial to provide a brief description of CommonGen for better context. Lastly, we suggest addressing the limitations of the mecab-ko analyzer in capturing irregular morphemes and discussing its impact on performance.
