Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Text2NKG, a novel framework for fine-grained n-ary relation extraction aimed at constructing n-ary relational knowledge graphs (NKGs). Unlike traditional binary relational knowledge graphs, NKGs encompass relations involving more than two entities, reflecting real-world scenarios more accurately. The authors propose a span-tuple classification approach combined with hetero-ordered merging techniques, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the HyperRED benchmark. The framework supports multiple NKG schemas, including hyper-relational and event-based structures.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation and contributions of the paper are clear, addressing previous limitations in n-ary relation extraction.
- The method improves extraction effectiveness by 20% and demonstrates significant performance gains over existing methods.
- The authors provide a thorough comparison with various baselines, including state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs).
- The writing is clear and well-structured, facilitating comprehension of the proposed methodology and results.

Weaknesses:
- The provided code lacks readability and documentation, complicating reproducibility.
- The error analysis is weak, focusing primarily on performance without deeper inspection of discrepancies between models.
- There is insufficient clarity regarding the comparison settings with LLMs and the rationale for not considering additional benchmarks.
- The reliance on BERT-based architectures may limit scalability and efficiency in real-time applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the readability and documentation of the code to enhance reproducibility. Additionally, a more detailed error analysis should be included to explain discrepancies between models, particularly between "Text2NKG" and "Text2NKG w/o HM." We suggest clarifying the comparison settings with LLMs and providing justification for the exclusion of other benchmarks. Finally, addressing the computational efficiency and scalability of the framework in real-world applications would strengthen the paper's contributions.
