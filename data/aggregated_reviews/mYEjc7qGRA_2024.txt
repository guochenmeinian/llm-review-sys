Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Language-dominated Noise-resistant Learning Network (LNLN) to tackle data incompleteness in Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA). By prioritizing the language modality, LNLN employs a Dominant Modality Correction (DMC) module and a Dominant Modality-Based Multimodal Learning (DMML) module to enhance robustness against noise. Extensive experiments on datasets such as MOSI, MOSEI, and SIMS demonstrate LNLNâ€™s superior performance, ensuring quality representations and improved evaluation metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Comprehensive Evaluation: The experiments are thorough, covering multiple datasets and varying conditions of data incompleteness, enhancing the validity of findings.
- Clear Motivation and Hypothesis: The rationale for focusing on the language modality is well-articulated, providing a logical progression from problem identification to solution proposal.
- Detailed Methodology: The methodology is sufficiently detailed for replication, with clear explanations of adversarial learning and dynamic weighting strategies.
- Significant Performance Improvement: Empirical results indicate that LNLN consistently outperforms existing methods, showcasing its robustness in real-world scenarios.

Weaknesses:
- Real-World Application Scenarios: The paper lacks discussion on potential real-world applications and limitations of LNLN, which would enhance its practical relevance.
- Contribution Clarity: The contributions summarized in the introduction are not clearly articulated, and the novelty of using language as the primary information carrier is questionable given its frequent use in MSA.
- Algorithmic Innovation: The reliance on transformers lacks specific tailoring to the task's characteristics, and the interaction process in "Adaptive Hyper-modality Learning" appears naive.
- Comparative Analysis: There is insufficient in-depth comparative analysis with the baseline ALMT, which is crucial since LNLN is an improvement upon it.
- Limited Experimental Scope: Ablation studies and experiments are only conducted on the MOSI dataset, raising questions about the generalizability of results.
- Lack of Visualizations: The experimental section does not include visualizations or case studies to substantiate the algorithm's efficacy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the contributions in the introduction and explicitly differentiate LNLN from existing methods. Additionally, the authors should provide a detailed rationale for the choice of transformers in various modules and ensure that these components are tailored to the task's specific characteristics. A thorough comparative analysis with ALMT is essential, and we suggest conducting ablation studies across all datasets to enhance the robustness of the findings. Finally, including visualizations or case studies would help demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm more convincingly.
