### Key Points
This paper presents a new evaluation method called Structured Semantic Alignment (SSA) for assessing the accuracy and robustness of text-to-image generation models. The authors propose that existing metrics fail to adequately evaluate fine-grained semantic concepts, such as object attributes and relationships. SSA projects text and image features into a shared embedding space and employs contrastive learning to measure semantic consistency. Experimental results indicate the effectiveness of SSA in this context.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces a novel and well-motivated approach to evaluate text-to-image generation models.  
- Experimental results support the effectiveness of SSA in measuring semantic consistency.  
- The writing is clear, and the contributions are significant within the field.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks a comprehensive comparison with existing evaluation methods and human evaluations.  
- There is insufficient analysis of experimental results, particularly concerning longer prompts and complexity.  
- The evaluation only considers one compositional T2I baseline, limiting the robustness of comparisons.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on how SSA compares to existing evaluation methods and include human evaluations to validate its effectiveness against human judgment. Additionally, the authors should provide a detailed analysis of how SSA performs with longer prompts and consider including comparisons with various compositional generation approaches. Finally, it would be beneficial to clarify the average length of prompts used in experiments and to address the potential limitations of scene graph generation models in practical applications.
