Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents TALoS, a novel test-time adaptation method for Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) that utilizes information from driving environments. The authors propose a self-supervision strategy that leverages observations and predictions from past and future frames to adapt a pretrained model. Specifically, LiDAR point clouds are used to create binary occupancy labels, while semantic predictions are fused based on confidence levels. A dual optimization scheme is introduced to exploit both historical and future frames. The authors also examine the TALoS method in the context of test-time adaptation (TTA) for semantic segmentation, focusing on its performance relative to baseline models like SSA-SC, SSCNet, and SCPNet. They note that while TALoS enhances performance, the extent of improvement is contingent on the baseline model's effectiveness. Experimental results on the SemanticKITTI dataset demonstrate the method's effectiveness, although the authors acknowledge the need for additional experiments and discussions on temporal fusion in their revision.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The exploration of LiDAR observations and model predictions across frames during inference is a novel and interesting approach. The Line of Sight binary occupancy and confidence-aware prediction fusion are effective.
- The proposed dual optimization scheme effectively utilizes both historical and future frames for test-time adaptation.
- The authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the relationship between baseline model performance and TTA effectiveness.
- The method shows improvements in geometric and semantic segmentation tasks on the SemanticKITTI dataset, supported by extensive experiments, ablation studies, and cross-dataset evaluations.
- The commitment to include additional experiments and discussions enhances the paper's depth.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation is limited to the SemanticKITTI dataset, which is small-scale and does not adequately address dynamic objects. The authors should conduct experiments on larger, more diverse datasets like KITTI-360, nuScenes, and Waymo, and consider using SSCBench for cross-dataset evaluation.
- The performance improvements of TALoS are modest in certain models, particularly SSA-SC and SSCNet, which may hinder the full benefits of TTA.
- The computational overhead is significant due to multiple modules involved in the test-time adaptation. A detailed computational analysis, including the computation-performance tradeoff and frames per second (FPS), is recommended.
- The literature survey is incomplete, missing several important SSC works. A more comprehensive review of existing literature is necessary to provide proper context for the study.
- The current approach is tailored to LiDAR data, which may limit applicability to other sensor modalities. The authors should discuss how their method could be adapted for camera-based SSC methods. Additionally, the experiments conducted may not be extensive enough to confidently generalize the observed trends.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by extending it to larger and more diverse datasets, such as KITTI-360, nuScenes, and Waymo, and consider using SSCBench for cross-dataset validation.
- We suggest conducting a detailed computational analysis to evaluate the computational demands of the method, including the computation-performance tradeoff and FPS achieved.
- We encourage the authors to expand the related work section to include a more comprehensive review of existing SSC literature, ensuring that important references are included.
- We recommend that the authors discuss potential extensions of their method to other sensor modalities, such as camera data, and how their approach could be adapted to handle combined sensor inputs.
- We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the limitations associated with SSA-SC and SSCNet, particularly in specific categories like "motorcyclist" or "person." Including the camera-based results and the additional dataset in the main paper will strengthen their findings. Incorporating the experiments conducted during the rebuttal process will also enhance the overall rigor of the study.
