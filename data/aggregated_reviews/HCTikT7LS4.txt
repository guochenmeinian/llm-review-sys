### Key Points
This paper presents a study on adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) and policy stability through the lens of the Lyapunov spectrum. The authors propose a regularization term aimed at enhancing the robustness of learned policies, which is particularly relevant for safety-critical applications. The work opens avenues for future theoretical, computational, and application-based research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a novel idea from classical literature into the deep RL context is commendable.
- The regularization technique effectively smooths out trajectories from learned policies.
- The approach has significant implications for real-world safety-critical applications.
- The analysis of stability in deep RL is well-articulated.

Weaknesses:
- The correlation between Figures 2 and 3 is unclear and requires further discussion.
- The improvement in reward trajectories is not sufficiently demonstrated.
- The error-proneness of the Lyapunov exponent calculations in Section 2.2 is not addressed.
- The interpretation of "no actions" in the figures needs clarification, especially in environments lacking a "do nothing" action.
- Non-scalar comparisons of algorithms should be included.
- The appendix lacks detailed experimental information.
- The core contribution, particularly the regularization technique, requires more elaboration and analysis.
- There is no concrete algorithm provided for implementation, which may hinder understanding for readers unfamiliar with dynamical systems.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the correlation between Figures 2 and 3 and provide a more detailed discussion on the improvement in reward trajectories. It would be beneficial to address the error-proneness of Lyapunov exponent calculations in Section 2.2 and clarify the use of "no actions" in the figures. Including non-scalar comparisons of algorithms and expanding the appendix with further experimental details would enhance the paper. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a formal algorithm table to facilitate implementation and elaborate on the regularization technique to strengthen the core contribution. Lastly, please ensure that all terms and parameters in Equation (4) are clearly explained.
