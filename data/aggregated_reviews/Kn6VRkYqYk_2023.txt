Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel deformable/non-rigid odometry dataset called "The Drunkard's Dataset," along with a new flow-based odometry algorithm termed "The Drunkard's Odometry" and a metric named Absolute Palindrome Trajectory Error (APTE) for evaluating methods without ground truth trajectories. The dataset includes a large set of exploratory camera trajectories within deformable scenes, providing comprehensive annotations such as RGB images, depth, optical flow, and normal maps. The authors claim that their method outperforms existing methods like EDaM and DROID-SLAM, particularly in complex scenes with significant deformations. They emphasize the utility of the APTE metric for assessing trajectory quality in ground truth-free datasets and propose visualizations to complement quantitative evaluations. The authors also acknowledge the complexities involved in reconstructing 3D scenes due to deformation, particularly in medical contexts such as endoscopies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is large-scale and addresses a significant challenge in medical applications, providing valuable ground truth information.
- The proposed odometry method achieves competitive results on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating superior performance in non-rigid scenarios.
- The introduction of APTE as a self-consistency based metric is a meaningful contribution for evaluating camera motion estimation without ground truth.
- The integration of trajectory visualization with the APTE metric strengthens the evaluation of the method.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for trajectory reconstruction in endoscopies remains unclear, particularly given potential inaccuracies.
- The dataset implementation lacks sufficient detail, particularly regarding deformation methods and specific Blender functions used.
- The complexity of the overview figure may hinder initial understanding of the method, and the presentation of results in tables could be confusing due to color choices and the lack of numeric values for deformation parameters.
- There are contradictory claims regarding the reliability of APTE, which should be addressed in the limitations section.
- The focus on the Drunkard’s dataset limits the generalizability of the findings to broader odometry applications, and the applicability of Drunkard's Odometry to scene flow estimation is not clearly articulated.
- Minor typographical errors and formatting issues were noted, which could detract from the overall presentation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for trajectory reconstruction in endoscopies and explore odometry in video with fast movement to address motion blur. The dataset implementation should include clearer numerical representations in Table 2 and detailed explanations of deformation methods. We suggest improving the clarity of the overview figure by simplifying it and providing intermediate outputs. Additionally, consider using a more intuitive color scheme in tables, such as red and blue for highlighting results, and including numeric values for deformation parameters in Table 2 to enhance clarity. We recommend addressing the contradictory claims about APTE in the limitations section and considering its placement in the introduction to clarify its contribution. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore the integration of a distance term in the APTE metric to mitigate trivial solutions and enhance its robustness. Lastly, including a supplementary video that showcases the original endoscopy footage alongside the synchronized trajectory reconstruction would enhance the qualitative evaluation, and we urge the authors to thoroughly revise the manuscript to eliminate minor typographical errors and formatting inconsistencies.
