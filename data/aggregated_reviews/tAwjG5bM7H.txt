Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a coreset-based algorithm for evaluating students' abilities in computerized adaptive testing (CAT) by selecting questions from a question bank. The authors propose a method that defines a true student's probability and utilizes pseudo labels, aiming to minimize test length while maximizing estimation accuracy. Theoretical and experimental analyses support the effectiveness of the proposed method, which reportedly outperforms existing CAT methods in reducing test length by 10-20%.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is sound and demonstrates effectiveness through experimental results.
- The paper introduces a novel approach to question selection, combining existing literature in AI to address a well-defined problem.
- Results indicate that the method can achieve similar accuracy with fewer questions, enhancing efficiency in CAT.

Weaknesses:
- The mathematical rigor is insufficient in several areas, including the definition of the question bank and the proof of Proposition 1.
- The writing and presentation require significant improvement, with unclear definitions and numerous errors that hinder comprehension.
- The method's novelty is questioned, as it appears similar to existing active learning techniques, and the performance improvement over these methods is minimal.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the mathematical rigor by clearly defining the question bank $Q$ and ensuring that all propositions include necessary conditions, such as $\forall \epsilon>0$. Additionally, the authors should provide a clearer proof for Proposition 1 and explicitly state the upper bounds for the loss function. We suggest enhancing the clarity of the writing by addressing typographical errors and improving the organization of the methodology. Furthermore, the authors should discuss the implications of skewed question parameters in the question bank and explore the applicability of their method beyond CAT scenarios. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the significance of their theoretical analysis and its relationship to existing methods in the field.
