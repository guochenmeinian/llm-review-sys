Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical framework for constructing navigable graphs for high-dimensional nearest neighbor search, establishing upper and lower bounds for the average degree of such graphs. The authors propose a randomized and a deterministic algorithm that achieve an average degree of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n \log n})$, which approaches the lower bound. The work addresses a significant gap in the theoretical analysis of graph-based nearest neighbor search algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The article establishes both upper and lower bounds for navigable graphs, utilizing anti-concentration bounds for binomial random variables.  
- It provides foundational analysis that could influence the design and optimization of state-of-the-art approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) methods.  
- The main ideas are clearly presented and easy to follow, with a well-described related work section.  

Weaknesses:  
- The proposed methods are not generalizable to current graph-based approaches, limiting their practical application.  
- There is no experimental evaluation to assess the practical utility of the proposed algorithms.  
- The motivation for the study lacks clarity, particularly regarding the computational efficiency of existing methods and the specific application scope of the proposed algorithms.  
- Some technical details require clarification, and a conclusion section outlining future directions is missing.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for their work by providing more comprehensive studies on the computational efficiency of existing methods. Additionally, the authors should include an experimental evaluation to demonstrate the practical applicability of their proposed techniques. It would also be beneficial to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the randomized and deterministic algorithms in more detail. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors clarify the choice of average degree as a metric for sparsity and consider including a conclusion section that identifies future research directions.
