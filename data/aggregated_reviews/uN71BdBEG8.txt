Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper adapts the matrix pencil method to estimate parameters in models with prescribed subgraph counts, specifically focusing on edge counts and the stochastic block model (SBM). The authors propose a connection between estimating SBM parameters and classical Prony's method, providing analytical formulas for computing these parameters through eigendecompositions of matrices derived from subgraph densities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The use of the matrix pencil method for parameter estimation is an interesting approach that addresses a significant problem.  
- The study of the inverse map from subgraph densities to a stochastic blocking model is nontrivial and potentially impactful.  
- The proposed method is generally easy to follow and can be generalized to directed, weighted graphs.

Weaknesses:  
- The correctness of key equations, particularly (6), is questionable, as the derivations do not align with expected results.  
- The paper lacks clarity in its presentation, with disconnections between the abstract, introduction, and the actual problem addressed.  
- There are numerous typos and some technical details appear heuristic rather than rigorously proven.  
- Limitations of the method, including model mis-specification and variability in estimates, are not adequately discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by ensuring that the abstract, introduction, and conclusion directly reflect the main contributions of the paper. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide rigorous proofs for the technical details, particularly regarding the identities in equations (13)-(18). It would be beneficial to include a discussion on the limitations of the method, particularly concerning its applicability to exponential random graph models. Furthermore, we advise the authors to address the statistical guarantees related to the random quantity in Eq (34) and to clarify how their method generalizes to capture hypergraphs with multi-edges and signed graphs. Lastly, we recommend moving Eq. 10 to the supplementary material to streamline the main text.
