Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DeepITE, a deep learning framework for Intervention Target Estimation (ITE) in causal systems, utilizing a variational graph autoencoder (VGAE) to learn from both labeled and unlabeled data across various intervention targets and causal graphs. The framework allows for quick identification of intervention targets in new samples without retraining, addressing inefficiencies in current methods. DeepITE is validated against 13 baseline methods, demonstrating superior performance in Recall@k metrics and inference times, particularly for large graphs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Originality: The proposed VGAE framework for ITE is novel and effectively repurposes existing methodologies for this specific problem.
- Empirical Validation: Comprehensive experiments validate DeepITE's performance against various datasets and baseline methods, showcasing its scalability and efficiency.
- Clarity: The paper is well-written and clearly articulates the ITE problem and the proposed solution.

Weaknesses:
- Assumptions: The framework's assumption of a known causal graph should be explicitly stated in the introduction, and a comparative table of assumptions across related works would enhance clarity.
- Claims on Soft Interventions: The assertion that the model can handle soft interventions lacks substantiation and may lead to model misspecification.
- Theoretical Depth: The paper lacks a consistency theory or robust theoretical backing for the proposed method, particularly regarding its generative model.
- Amortization Justification: The claim about the model's ability to amortize across different settings is not sufficiently justified, especially given mixed performance results.
- Conditions for Success: The authors should clarify under what conditions the model is expected to perform well and identify key components contributing to its empirical success.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their assumptions regarding the causal graph by explicitly stating them in the introduction and including a comparative table summarizing key assumptions across related works. Additionally, the authors should substantiate their claim regarding the model's capability to handle soft interventions, considering the complexities involved. A more thorough theoretical analysis is needed to provide consistency theory or additional theoretical backing for the proposed method. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors justify their claims about the model's amortization capabilities with empirical assessments and clarify the conditions under which the model is expected to excel, identifying the components that contribute significantly to its success.
