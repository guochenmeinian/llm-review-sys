### Key Points
This paper presents a dataset of natural-language annotations for program semantics, specifically focusing on preconditions and postconditions, and introduces an annotation tool. The authors aim to support the development of programming assistants that can better understand code semantics. However, the motivation for the dataset's creation and its practical applications remain unclear, particularly regarding its scalability to real-world applications with external libraries.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper contributes a novel bi-modal dataset that bridges informal and formal annotations, addressing issues with existing open-source comment data.
- The proposed annotation scheme effectively targets the limitations of current datasets, particularly in terms of semantic detail and execution challenges.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset is limited in scale, covering only 20 programs from a larger source dataset, which restricts its overall usefulness.
- There is a lack of validation for annotation quality and insufficient exploration of the dataset's characteristics, such as distribution patterns and potential artifacts.
- The motivation for the dataset's design and its downstream impacts are not clearly articulated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the dataset's motivation and potential applications, particularly in relation to real-world programming scenarios. It would be beneficial to include a validation of annotation quality and provide a more detailed analysis of the dataset's characteristics, including statistics on annotated triples and program distributions. Additionally, we suggest revising the narrative in Section 2 for conciseness and clarity, and considering the use of a pie chart in Figure 3 for better visual representation.
