Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of a specific bandit problem where the objective is to minimize the L_p norm of the variance vector for mean estimators across multiple groups. The authors propose a variance-UCB algorithm that maintains an upper confidence bound for the variance of each arm and selects the arm that maximizes a derived quantity. The algorithm achieves a regret of O(T^{-2}) for all finite p, which is optimal, and recovers a \Theta(T^{-1.5}) optimal regret for p = infinity. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The problem setting is practically relevant, and the authors introduce a novel UCB-type algorithm to address it, achieving a tight regret bound.
- The paper is well-written and presents a clean and intuitive algorithm with solid theoretical proofs and empirical results supporting the findings.

Weaknesses:  
- The motivation for the target L_p norm is insufficiently explained, lacking scenarios where minimizing this specific quantity is meaningful.
- The analysis of the algorithm is straightforward, and the contribution may not meet the standards for a NeurIPS publication.
- The manuscript does not establish a tight regret dependence on the number of arms G, which diminishes the interest in the current two-point lower bound.
- There are issues in the upper bound analysis, particularly regarding the need for a two-sided upper bound on |n - n^*|, which requires further clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for the target L_p norm by providing scenarios where minimizing this quantity is significant, and consider extending the results to values of p < 1. Additionally, the authors should enhance the analysis to establish a tight regret dependence on the number of arms G, as this is crucial for the paper's impact. Clarifying the upper bound analysis, particularly in relation to Lemma 4, is essential. Finally, we suggest including comparisons with benchmark algorithms in the literature to strengthen the experimental section and address the lack of limitations in the paper.
