### Key Points
This paper presents a method for debiasing synthetic data generated by deep generative models (DGMs), aiming to eliminate bias in the estimation of population averages and improve the inferential utility of such data. The authors propose a generator-agnostic approach that aligns the population mean of synthetic data with the sample average of observed data. Their methodology is validated through extensive experiments, showing significant bias reductions while maintaining data utility. The paper also discusses the implications of their findings for fairness in machine learning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is technically sound, featuring in-depth theoretical analysis supported by practical examples and detailed investigations in the Appendix.
2. It addresses the critical issue of bias in synthetic data, integrating fairness constraints directly into the data generation process, which is a novel approach.
3. The writing is clear and well-organized, with effective figures and tables that support the narrative.
4. The results have significant implications for improving fairness in machine learning, making the proposed method straightforward and adaptable.

Weaknesses:
1. The evaluation of potential limitations or edge cases where the method might underperform is insufficient.
2. There is a lack of comparison with related works, making it difficult to assess the novelty of the proposed method.
3. The significance of the findings is hard to gauge without contrasting the method with alternative approaches.
4. The scope of the evaluation is limited to low-dimensional settings and simple estimators, which may not generalize to more complex scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation of potential limitations and edge cases where their method may not perform optimally. Additionally, a more detailed review of related works and comparisons with alternative methods would help contextualize the novelty and significance of their contributions. It would also be beneficial to explore the performance of the proposed method in high-dimensional settings and with more complex estimators. Finally, discussing the trade-offs between debiasing effectiveness and computational efficiency, as well as clarifying the definition of "a very large sample," would enhance the paper's clarity and applicability.
