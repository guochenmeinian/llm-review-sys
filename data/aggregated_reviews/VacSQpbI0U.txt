Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new estimator called Rand-Proj-Spatial for the distributed mean estimation (DME) problem, which improves upon existing techniques by leveraging correlations among client vectors. The authors utilize the Subsampled Randomized Hadamard Transform for dimensionality reduction before applying a rand-$k$ compression method. The proposed method is shown to achieve lower mean squared error (MSE) compared to previous rand-$k$-based techniques, particularly in scenarios with high correlation among client vectors. Additionally, the authors propose an optimization problem for mean estimation using decoding matrices in a distributed setting, aiming to minimize the expected squared error between the estimated mean and the true mean while ensuring unbiasedness. The importance of discussing the choice of the optimization objective, particularly the advantages of minimizing the sum of squared norms for exploiting correlation in mean estimation, is highlighted.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel estimator that effectively combines existing techniques to enhance communication efficiency in DME.
- The proposed optimization framework utilizes cross-client correlation for mean estimation.
- The theoretical analysis and empirical verification of the results support the claims of improved performance, demonstrating the method's applicability in distributed optimization and federated learning contexts.
- The authors are responsive to feedback and willing to clarify and expand on key points.

Weaknesses:
- The decoding time at the server is not adequately discussed, which may pose a significant bottleneck for practical implementation.
- The evaluation lacks comparisons with strong DME baselines and other relevant techniques, limiting the context for the proposed method's performance.
- The paper does not sufficiently explore the computational complexity of the proposed estimator or its trade-offs between communication cost and estimation accuracy.
- There is insufficient acknowledgment of the practical limitations regarding shared randomness in implementations.
- The title does not adequately reflect the contribution of the work, potentially leading to misunderstandings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on decoding time, including a detailed analysis of its impact on practicality. Additionally, we suggest that the authors include comparisons with other state-of-the-art DME techniques to better position their work within the existing literature. A more thorough evaluation of the computational complexity of the Rand-Proj-Spatial estimator and its trade-offs between communication cost and estimation accuracy would also enhance the paper's contributions. We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the optimization objective by including a section in the appendix that details why their choice is preferable to alternatives, including those requiring individual decoding. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors elaborate on the relationship between quantization and sparsification, emphasizing their joint design for better system performance. It is also important to clearly state the limitations associated with the assumption of perfect shared randomness. Lastly, we recommend adopting a more descriptive title, such as "Correlated Sparsification for Distributed Mean Estimation Using Random Projections," to better convey the paper's contributions.
