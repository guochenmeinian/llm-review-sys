### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of strategy-proofness in voting under the assumption that voters have beliefs about others' preferences rather than full knowledge. The authors focus on the Mallows model and other distributions, concluding that the Plurality rule is strategy-proof in this context. The paper also investigates a probabilistic form of strategy-proofness termed Ordinally Bayesian Incentive Compatible (OBIC), demonstrating that under certain correlated belief models, Plurality is OBIC while other scoring rules are not. The results indicate that the Plurality rule stands out in this framework, although the practical significance of these findings is questioned.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper makes progress in a well-established area of social choice theory, providing a positive result regarding the strategy-proofness of the Plurality rule.
- The writing is clear, with well-stated theorems and a strong combination of high-level explanations and technical definitions.
- The results contribute novel insights into the relatively underexplored domain of correlated beliefs.

Weaknesses:
- The practical relevance of the results is limited, as the strategy-proofness of Plurality appears built into the model assumptions.
- The negative results for other scoring rules diminish the overall impact, particularly when considering scenarios with more than three candidates.
- The proof sketches are more complex than expected, and full proofs are relegated to appendices, which may hinder accessibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the practical implications of their findings, particularly regarding the use of the Plurality rule in real-world elections. Additionally, clarifying the relevance of their work to the ML community would strengthen the paper's positioning. We suggest including the Plurality result in Table 2 for completeness and revising the abstract to better articulate the strategy-proofness of the Plurality rule. Lastly, addressing the complexity of proof sketches and providing more context on the limitations of their models would enhance the paper's clarity and impact.
