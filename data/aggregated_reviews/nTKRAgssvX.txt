### Key Points
This paper presents a simple approach for Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) reasoning, introducing SiMFy, which utilizes a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to model structural dependencies and incorporates historical frequency during inference. The authors argue that existing complex models suffer from low training efficiency and inadequate generalization ability. SiMFy demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with faster convergence, reduced training time, and improved generalization. The empirical results suggest that simpler models can effectively replace more complex architectures.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
2. The proposed method is simple yet efficient, leading to better training efficiency and generalization performance.
3. Empirical results are promising, showing faster convergence and comparable performance to state-of-the-art models.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks academic rigor in discussing the Russia-Ukraine conflict, requiring proper citation of academic references.
2. Insufficient motivation and theoretical validation exist to convincingly demonstrate the superiority of SiMFy over existing methods.
3. The choice of datasets is questionable, as it omits the GDELT dataset, which is commonly used in strong baselines.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the academic rigor by providing appropriate citations for the discussion related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Additionally, the authors should enhance the motivation and theoretical validation of SiMFy to better illustrate its advantages. Including results in the filtered setting metrics for a fair comparison with existing literature is essential. Finally, conducting experiments on larger datasets, such as GDELT, would strengthen the findings and address concerns regarding the generalizability of the results.
