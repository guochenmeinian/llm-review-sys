Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for learning feedback controllers for multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) dynamical systems using a neural network-based proportional-integral (PI) control structure. The proposed controller consists of two neural networks: one for the set-point error ("P-part") and another for its integral ("I-part"). A special structure ensures strict convexity of the neural networks, which guarantees stability and zero steady-state error a priori, independent of training. The training focuses on optimizing transient behavior, with numerical examples provided for vehicle platooning and power networks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Developing neural network control architectures that inherently satisfy key control properties, such as stability and steady-state optimality, is highly relevant. The combination of a PI-like structure with strictly convex neural networks is novel.
- The use of passivity properties for system-wide analysis is an interesting approach that is relevant to both the control and NeurIPS communities.
- The design allows for a stable system with baseline performance without communication, which can be further improved when communication is available.

Weaknesses:
- The introduction contains imprecise statements about the state of the art and technical aspects, requiring careful revision and proper references.
- The related work section lacks structure and fails to clearly delineate the paper's contribution compared to existing literature, particularly regarding MIMO PI-control.
- The specification of the controller structure is vague, particularly regarding whether it is static or dynamic, which is critical for understanding its capabilities.
- The justification for calling the proposed structure a PI controller is questionable, as the "proportional" term may not be proportional to the error in a general nonlinear context.
- The experimental results are not fully conclusive, lacking comparisons with classical controller structures and not adequately addressing the assumptions and theoretical guarantees.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by ensuring all statements are precise and well-supported by references. A structured discussion of related work should be included to clarify the paper's contribution, particularly in the context of MIMO PI-control. The authors should clearly specify the controller structure, indicating whether it is static or dynamic, and justify the use of the term "PI controller" in relation to the proposed architecture. Additionally, the experimental section should include comparisons with classical controllers, such as linear PI and model-based controllers, to better assess the proposed method's performance. Finally, a thorough discussion of the assumptions and theoretical guarantees should be integrated into the main paper to enhance clarity and rigor.
