Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach called Weighted Reservoir Sampling (WRS) to stabilize linear passive-aggressive online learning algorithms, which are sensitive to outliers. The authors propose that the number of passive steps can serve as an indicator of model quality, allowing for the selection of models with lower generalization error. WRS enhances the stability of Passive-Aggressive Classifier (PAC) and First-Order Sparse Online Learning (FSOL) algorithms across various datasets without requiring additional data passes. The method maintains a reservoir of high-quality weight vectors, thereby reducing the overfitting risks associated with outliers and culminating in an ensemble of these sampled models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method effectively utilizes the characteristics of the passive-aggressive algorithm, demonstrating clear empirical advantages over baseline methods.
- The introduction of WRS is a novel contribution that stabilizes PA algorithms.
- The paper is methodologically rigorous, with thorough theoretical analysis and empirical validation across multiple datasets.
- Clarity in presentation, with detailed explanations and well-structured content, enhances accessibility for readers.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical analysis relies on the i.i.d. assumption, which contradicts the paper's motivation of addressing outlier sensitivity.
- The methodology, particularly the WRS approach, is not clearly articulated, leading to confusion about its implementation and significance.
- The empirical comparisons are limited and do not adequately address alternative averaging strategies that are widely applicable.
- Limited applicability of WRS to other online learning algorithms beyond PAC and FSOL.
- The assumption of stable data distribution may not hold in real-world scenarios, where concept drift could affect WRS's effectiveness.
- The computational overhead of maintaining a reservoir of weight vectors raises questions about efficiency, which requires more detailed analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology, particularly regarding the specific role of WRS in Algorithm 1. It would be beneficial to explicitly define the terms used throughout the paper and ensure consistent notation. Additionally, we suggest incorporating comparisons with other established averaging techniques, such as moving averages or exponential averages, to strengthen the empirical analysis. We also recommend exploring WRS's applicability to a broader range of online learning algorithms beyond PAC and FSOL. A deeper investigation into the implications of concept drift on WRS's performance, along with a more detailed analysis comparing computational efficiency with baseline methods, would enhance the paper's contributions. Finally, clarifying the theoretical results, particularly regarding the assumptions and interpretations of Theorems 1 and 2, would further strengthen the paper.
