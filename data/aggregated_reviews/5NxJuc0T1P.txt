Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a two-stage method for statistical downscaling that integrates a coarse de-biasing step using optimal transport and a conditional up-sampling step via a diffusion model. The authors clarify that their work focuses on recovering high-resolution snapshots from low-resolution data at the same time period, rather than forecasting. They emphasize the importance of understanding the stationary nature of the distributions involved and the challenges posed by the chaotic dynamics of weather systems, which complicate the establishment of paired data mappings. The authors demonstrate the method's effectiveness on fluid mechanics datasets, showing that it outperforms several baselines, including CycleGAN and ViT-based super-resolution. The proposed framework addresses the critical issue of learning from unpaired data in climate modeling, which is essential for enhancing high-resolution forecasts from low-fidelity data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and clearly articulates the proposed method, which is divided into two logical components.
- The originality of using optimal transport for debiasing low-frequency bias is noteworthy, and the integration with a state-of-the-art diffusion model is innovative.
- The authors provide a clear distinction between their approach and traditional forecasting methods, focusing on debiasing and up-sampling.
- Empirical results indicate superior performance compared to baseline models, supported by comprehensive ablation studies and training details.
- The effective utilization of optimal transport (OT) to address the complexities of mapping distributions highlights its advantages in minimizing deviation from the original data.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the debiasing step is questioned, particularly regarding its effectiveness in correcting biases in low-resolution data, as empirical results suggest significant deviations from low-resolution data.
- The reliance on the assumption of stationary distributions may limit the applicability of the method to scenarios with significant non-stationarity.
- The authors do not fully address the implications of chaotic dynamics on the effectiveness of their approach, particularly regarding the potential loss of correspondence in trajectories over time.
- The metrics used for evaluation are not standard in statistical downscaling, and comparisons with existing methods like ClimAlign are lacking.
- Clarity issues in writing and formatting affect the overall readability, and some technical details require further elaboration.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the validity of the debiasing step, particularly addressing whether it corrects biases or introduces additional errors. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the relationship of Section 3.2 to existing works such as SNIPS and DDRM to enhance the paper's context. It would be beneficial to provide more commonly used metrics like Continuous Rank Probability Score and to compare the method against established approaches in statistical downscaling. We also recommend improving the discussion on the implications of chaotic dynamics in weather systems, particularly how this affects the assumptions of stationary distributions. Providing clarity on the training costs and inference runtime, as well as addressing the clarity issues in writing, will strengthen the manuscript. Lastly, we encourage the authors to apply their method to real-world climate datasets to validate its practical applicability.
