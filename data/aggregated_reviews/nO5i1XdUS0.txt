Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a solution to the challenge of statistical heterogeneity in federated learning through the introduction of Domain Bias Eliminator (DBE). The authors propose a framework that includes Personalized Representation Bias Memory (PRBM) and Mean Regularization (MR) to mitigate representation bias and enhance model performance. The effectiveness of DBE is supported by theoretical analysis and extensive empirical results, demonstrating its superiority over ten state-of-the-art methods in both generalization and personalization capabilities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and clearly conveys the core ideas.
2. The proposed DBE approach effectively addresses the non-iidness issue in federated learning, with strong theoretical and empirical backing.
3. The introduction of PRBM and MR is validated through comprehensive experiments, showcasing good compatibility with existing models.
4. The exploration of DBE's complementary nature with other personalized federated learning methods enhances its relevance.

Weaknesses:
1. The explanation of the memory module's implementation lacks clarity, making it difficult to understand its functioning.
2. The practical implications of the generalization risk analysis are limited and require further clarification.
3. The experimental evaluation lacks diversity in tasks, and including evaluations on tasks such as graph learning would strengthen the results.
4. The introduction of MR increases computational burden, and some writing sections are unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the memory module's implementation to facilitate understanding. Additionally, further elaboration on the practical implications of the generalization risk analysis would enhance its relevance. To strengthen the experimental evaluation, we suggest including diverse tasks, such as graph learning. Finally, the authors should consider addressing the increased computational burden associated with MR and clarify any unclear sections in the writing.
