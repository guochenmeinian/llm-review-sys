Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical analysis of kernel-based machine learning methods, focusing on the impact of target-kernel alignment on mitigating the saturation effect observed in kernel ridge regression (KRR). The authors introduce the truncated kernel-based method (TKM) and analyze its learning rate, demonstrating that TKM can continuously improve performance even at high alignment levels, unlike standard kernel-based estimators. The paper establishes upper bounds for both standard and truncated estimators and provides numerical validations to support its theoretical claims.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a general theoretical result on kernel performance across various loss functions, moving beyond the square loss commonly addressed in prior literature.
- It is well-written, with solid theorems and a rigorous theoretical analysis that includes numerical simulations to validate the claims.
- The findings regarding TKM's ability to overcome the saturation effect are significant and may have broad applications.

Weaknesses:
- The methodological contribution of TKM is somewhat incremental, as it builds on previous work by Amini et al. (2021) and primarily extends the analysis to a broader class of loss functions.
- The paper does not address the computational complexity of TKM in detail, which is a notable omission.
- Some symbols and notations are inconsistent throughout the paper, which may confuse readers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the computational complexity of TKM, as this is lacking in both this paper and the referenced work. Additionally, we suggest providing results for different decay rates in the approximation bias term of Theorem 4.2, as the current analysis relies on Assumption 3.4. Lastly, we encourage the authors to ensure consistent use of symbols and notations throughout the paper to enhance clarity.
