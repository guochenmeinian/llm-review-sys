Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on strategic classification where agents can manipulate their features to achieve favorable predictions, with varying degrees of manipulation strength that are unknown to the learner. The authors explore both online and PAC models, providing upper and lower bounds on mistake and sample complexity across four settings based on the information revealed to the learner. The paper assumes realizability, meaning a correct classifier exists that remains valid under manipulation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, providing clear intuitions for technical theorems.
- It addresses a relevant and challenging area in strategic classification, with comprehensive results across various settings.
- The exploration of personalized manipulation and the framework for feasible manipulation regions are notable contributions.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for simpler cases is unclear, particularly regarding the realism of observing original features before hypothesis deployment.
- The presentation can be misleading, as the focus on personalized manipulation is overshadowed by conventional settings.
- A more extensive literature review is needed to clarify the novelty of the work, as prior studies on strategic classification are only briefly mentioned.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for the easier cases, particularly in terms of their realistic applicability. Additionally, we suggest expanding the literature review to discuss prior works in more detail and highlight the differences with the present study. Furthermore, addressing the tie-breaking procedure more explicitly and clarifying the definition of personalized manipulation would enhance the paper's comprehensibility. Lastly, exploring extensions to infinite hypothesis classes and agnostic settings would significantly enrich the contribution of the paper.
