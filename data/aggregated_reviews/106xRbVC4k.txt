### Key Points
This paper empirically evaluates the uniform information density (UID) hypothesis, originally proposed by Genzel & Charniak (2002), using modern neural language models (NLMs) like GPT. The authors find evidence that contradicts the original UID claim, suggesting that NLMs' lossless context access may influence this outcome. The study examines entropy rates across diverse datasets and languages, providing a detailed analysis that could inform future research in natural language generation and language model evaluation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Important findings for NLG/LM evaluation and dataset analysis.
- Comprehensive analysis with various data and model sizes, potentially stimulating further research.
- Well-contextualized within existing literature, with thorough explanations of similarities and differences with related work.

Weaknesses:
- Analyses of findings lack depth, with insufficient exploration of how corpora relate to GPT model properties.
- The interpretation of entropy values and surprisal is unclear, and the paper does not adequately demonstrate the implications of its findings.
- The main conclusions are qualitative, lacking quantitative metrics to substantiate claims against the UID hypothesis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the depth of their analyses, particularly regarding the relationship between corpus properties and GPT model behavior. A more detailed exploration of the surprising entropy trends observed, especially for larger models, should be included. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the interpretation of entropy and surprisal, ensuring that these concepts are accessible to readers unfamiliar with the topic. Finally, incorporating quantitative metrics to support the main conclusions would strengthen the paper's claims regarding the UID hypothesis.
