Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method to compute exact conformal prediction intervals with statistical guarantees, enhancing previous work by offering exact guarantees, a broader family of loss functions, and applicability to linearly constrained problems. The authors propose a path-based approach to understand how parameters evolve with varying targets, utilizing an ODE that can be solved with standard solvers when the functions are piecewise continuously differentiable. The research focuses on the conformalization of generalized estimation, aiming for comprehensive applicability and in-depth technical insights. The authors emphasize that the main body is self-contained, adequately covering motivation, related work, theoretical findings, and algorithmic steps, while appendices serve for experimental details and theoretical verification. Empirical studies demonstrate improvements in coverage, dataset size, and computational speed.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study addresses an important problem in conformal inference, aiming to accelerate computations for full conformal prediction.
- The proposed method shows significant improvements in computational efficiency compared to traditional grid-search approaches.
- The contribution is notable as it expands the families of loss functions applicable to conformal prediction.
- The paper provides a comprehensive exploration of conformal prediction, with a self-contained main body that covers essential theoretical and algorithmic aspects.
- The authors have made substantial revisions to enhance clarity, including removing less critical content and revising vague sentences.
- The detailed appendices lower barriers to understanding, potentially engaging a broader audience.

Weaknesses:
- The paper suffers from poor writing quality, being overly dense and difficult to understand, which limits its accessibility.
- The presentation is complicated by the use of small font sizes and text-wrapping techniques to meet page limits, detracting from clarity.
- The authors do not adequately discuss the limitations of their work, particularly regarding the assumptions made and the choice of predictors in experiments.
- The paper's length and density make it challenging to parse, which may hinder comprehension for some readers.
- Certain technical details, such as memory/runtime costs, are buried in the appendix rather than being highlighted in the main text.
- The presentation of complex results may overwhelm readers, suggesting a need for a more intuitive introduction to foundational concepts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and accessibility of the paper by enhancing the writing quality and reducing mathematical density. Consider shortening the paper or submitting it to a venue that accommodates longer articles to facilitate better comprehension. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a warm-up section on the unconstrained case and justify the need for general constraints and piecewise differentiable objectives more thoroughly. Addressing the limitations of the work and including a discussion on the applicability of assumptions would also strengthen the manuscript. Furthermore, we recommend moving intuitive explanations from the appendix to the main body, particularly regarding simpler cases that would interest most readers. We suggest editing Figure 1 to clarify its one-dimensional focus and emphasizing memory/runtime cost challenges within the main text rather than relegating them to the appendix. Finally, we encourage the authors to summarize their rebuttal comments to facilitate easier reading for reviewers and future readers.
