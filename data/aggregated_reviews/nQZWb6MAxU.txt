### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the fair k-center problem, focusing on designing efficient streaming and parallel algorithms. The authors propose a new algorithm that achieves an approximation factor of \(3+\epsilon\) in the sequential setting while being efficient in streaming and parallel contexts, particularly for low-dimensional spaces with few color combinations. The algorithms leverage coreset theory and prior work on fair clustering, demonstrating practical effectiveness through experiments on standard datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The coreset approach is theoretically interesting and effective in practice.
- The paper significantly improves approximation factors for streaming and MapReduce settings.
- The experiments are well-executed, with new fast implementations provided.
- The writing quality of the paper is commendable.

Weaknesses:
- The algorithm's results rely on standard methods and scale exponentially with the number of colors and dimensions.
- There is a lack of clarity regarding the level of fairness satisfied by the methods, leading to confusion.
- Some proofs appear redundant, contributing to an imbalanced organization of the paper.
- The relationship between experimental results and initial motivations is not clearly articulated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the fairness constraints satisfied by different methods, possibly by including more details in the experiments section. Additionally, consider relocating some algorithmic explanations to the Appendix for better organization. Providing a more thorough analysis of the experimental results would enhance the paper's value. Lastly, addressing minor typographical errors, such as "LP-besed" to "LP-based," would improve overall presentation.
