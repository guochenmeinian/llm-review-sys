### Key Points
This paper presents the equivalence between representational similarity analysis (RSA), centered kernel alignment (CKA), and canonical correlation analysis (CCA). The authors demonstrate that CKA and RSA can quantify similarity between neural networks, with CCA serving as the foundational method for analyzing multivariate data. The central claim, Proposition 1, asserts that the centered cosine similarity (CCS) between distance matrices is identical to that between gram matrices, supported by clear arguments referencing Lemma 1 from Kornblith et al. The paper also highlights the importance of a mean-centering step in RSA for achieving translational invariance and independence testing.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The writing is clear and the mathematical proofs are well-articulated.
- The documentation of equivalences between different similarity metrics is highly relevant and beneficial for both practitioners and theorists.

Weaknesses:
- The main claim, while clear, is not particularly surprising and appears incremental relative to the significance of Lemma 1.
- The manuscript lacks practical applications, which could enhance interest among practitioners.
- The treatment of neural responses as noise-free is a limitation, as this does not reflect real-world scenarios in neuroscience.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the manuscript by discussing the implications of their results in noisy systems, including necessary accommodations and relevant literature. Additionally, we suggest moving sections 3.4 and 4 to the appendix to enhance conciseness. The authors should clarify the description in Section 2.3 regarding canonical correlations and correct minor typographical errors throughout the paper. Lastly, we advise maintaining consistent usage of first-person plural ("we") throughout the manuscript.
