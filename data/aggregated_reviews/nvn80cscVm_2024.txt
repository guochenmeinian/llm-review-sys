Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel evaluation metric termed "rank difference," which quantifies the reduction in the rank of hidden representations in language models (LLMs). The authors propose that this metric reflects the model's ability to compress information, contrasting it with traditional metrics like cross-entropy loss. The rank difference is defined as the difference between the effective ranks of the covariance matrices of representations before and after training. The authors demonstrate a correlation between rank difference and model size, suggesting its potential in assessing model capabilities and cross-modal alignment.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of the rank difference metric offers a fresh perspective on evaluating LLMs by focusing on internal representations rather than outputs.
- The paper is grounded in information theory and shows a correlation between rank difference, model size, and traditional metrics like accuracy.
- The experiments are comprehensive, covering various model sizes and modalities, and the writing is clear and organized.

Weaknesses:
- The practical usability of rank difference is limited, as it may not align with real-world metrics like accuracy or BLEU, which are commonly used in downstream tasks.
- The paper does not adequately address how rank difference evolves during training, missing insights into its behavior over time.
- There is a lack of clarity regarding the interpretation of rank differences across models of varying sizes, and the paper does not sufficiently compare rank difference with established metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the advantages of rank difference compared to traditional metrics, particularly in the context of models from different series. Additionally, conducting experiments to observe how rank difference changes during training would provide valuable insights into its applicability. We suggest including a broader range of model families in the evaluation to enhance the validation of the metric. Finally, addressing the computational efficiency of calculating rank difference for large-scale models and exploring potential optimizations would strengthen the paper.
