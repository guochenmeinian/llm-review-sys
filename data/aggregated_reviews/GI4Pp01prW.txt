### Key Points
This paper presents a machine learning approach to classify $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano varieties, specifically using a feedforward neural network trained on a balanced dataset of 10 million eight-dimensional $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial Fano toric varieties. The classifier achieves a high accuracy of 95%, leading to the development of a new algorithm for detecting $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano varieties that is 15 times faster than traditional methods. The authors also visualize a dataset of 100 million examples, providing insights into classification patterns.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and addresses an interesting problem in algebraic geometry.  
- It provides a detailed experimental section and introduces a new theoretical result.  
- The use of machine learning demonstrates potential for guiding mathematical research and offers a valuable dataset for future studies.  

Weaknesses:  
- The impact of the classifier on the field remains unclear.  
- The statistical analysis is unsystematic, lacking precise characterization of the dataset.  
- The paper may not be accessible to those without a strong mathematical background, limiting the significance of some results.  
- The claim that a simpler criterion exists for $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano classification is not well-supported, given the model's limitations in generalization.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the statistical analysis by precisely characterizing the ensemble being sampled in Section 3. Additionally, consider revising the presentation to make the mathematical concepts more accessible to a broader audience, possibly by including introductory materials in an appendix. We suggest providing a clearer justification for the choice of neural network architecture and addressing the limitations of the model's generalization capabilities more thoroughly. Finally, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the significance of the classification of $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano varieties and the potential applications of detecting terminal singularities beyond the current context.
