### Key Points
This paper presents a method called RECAP for generating radiology reports by utilizing both current and historical patient data to model disease progression. The authors construct a disease progression graph and implement a dynamic reasoning mechanism to enhance report generation. The proposed approach is evaluated on the MIMIC-CXR and MIMIC-ABN datasets, showing promising results in comparison to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of longitudinal data to capture disease progression is a significant advancement in medical report generation.
- Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
- The structural modeling of spatial and temporal aspects is innovative and intuitive.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed approach does not outperform existing models, as evidenced by lower B-4 scores compared to the ViT-transformer.
- The evaluation is limited to the MIMIC dataset, raising concerns about generalizability to other datasets.
- The model's complexity may hinder understanding and reproducibility.
- The use of historical reports in generating current reports raises fairness issues in experimental settings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including the IU dataset and assessing performance on both new and returning patients. Additionally, the authors should clarify the use of information from ground-truth reports at test-time and ensure that historical reports are incorporated into baseline training datasets. It is also essential to reference and discuss relevant existing work, such as "DeltaNet: Conditional medical report generation for COVID-19 diagnosis, Coling 2022," and to evaluate the intermediate results of disease progression in experiments. Finally, simplifying the model could enhance clarity and accessibility.
