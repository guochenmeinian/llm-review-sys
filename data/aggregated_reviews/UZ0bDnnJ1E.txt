### Key Points
This paper studies the injection of noise into the activations of Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs), motivated by prior findings that such noise enhances the robustness of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to input perturbations. The authors propose this method as a straightforward application of the concept and evaluate it across various tasks and benchmarks, presenting novel insights that align well with the workshop's focus.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is interesting and appears effective in improving robustness to noisy inputs.
- The authors systematically characterize the conditions under which DEQs exhibit greater robustness than feedforward networks with equivalent parameter counts.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical arguments comparing DEQs and feedforward models lack compelling support. While the derivation of network sensitivity is straightforward, the assertion that DEQs are more robust only in comparison to deeper feedforward models does not necessarily follow from the analysis, appearing more as an empirical observation. The authors should consider rephrasing their statements in the introduction and abstract to reflect this nuance.
- The reliance on Gaussian noise for testing robustness is limited. It raises the question of whether it is surprising that a model trained with noise demonstrates increased robustness to the same noise type. Additional commentary from the authors on this aspect would be beneficial.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical framework by providing a more nuanced discussion of the implications of their findings regarding DEQs and feedforward models. Additionally, we suggest that the authors expand their robustness testing beyond Gaussian noise and include a broader range of perturbations, along with a discussion addressing the limitations of their current approach.
