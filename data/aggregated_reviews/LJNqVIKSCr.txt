Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to synthesis planning by proposing a double-ended synthesis planning algorithm grounded in bidirectional search, addressing constraints in chemical synthesis. The authors demonstrate that their method improves the solve rate and reduces the number of node expansions. The algorithm, named DESP, is specifically designed for retrosynthetic analysis, utilizing a heuristic function derived from a goal-conditioned cost network learned offline from valid chemical reactions. The empirical evaluation shows significant performance improvements over existing algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles an important problem in AI and introduces a more efficient search algorithm for retrosynthetic analysis.
- The writing is clear and well-organized, making it accessible even to those less familiar with the chemistry domain.
- The experimental evaluation is robust, effectively comparing the proposed method against prior work.

Weaknesses:
- The proof of soundness and completeness for Algorithm 1 is insufficiently detailed, particularly regarding its properties.
- The broader impact of the contribution on the community appears limited in scope.
- The complexity introduced by bidirectional search may raise concerns about the tradeoff between complexity and performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the proof of soundness and completeness for Algorithm 1, providing more detailed explanations of its properties. Additionally, clarifying the comparison between DESP and Retro* in the main text would enhance understanding. It would be beneficial to include a numerical example to illustrate how node values are computed and updated during the search. Furthermore, we suggest explicitly stating which baseline implementations of various algorithms were used and detailing the hyperparameters for all search algorithms to improve clarity.
