Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for reconstructing reposable dynamic 3D objects from RGB videos using Gaussian Splatting, without requiring any template as input. The authors propose a method that combines a reposable 4D reconstruction based on a skeletal LBS model with 3D Gaussian splatting, introducing a strategy for estimating the skeletal model from superpoint clustering. The results indicate superior image quality and fast rendering capabilities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Implementation details are provided for reproducibility.
2. Claims are validated on common datasets, demonstrating the method's effectiveness.
3. The quality of results is visibly superior to prior work.
4. The skeleton construction is novel, technically sound, and produces reposable models across various scenes.
5. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
1. The skeletons are over-segmented and unnatural, potentially unsuitable for human animators.
2. Limitations and broader impacts are only discussed in the Appendix, suggesting a lack of balanced consideration of downsides.
3. The authors claim to report Statistical Significance without adequate explanation.
4. The dataset used (ZJU-Mocap) may not allow for useful comparisons with other methods.
5. Limited reposability due to the motion space being confined to the input video.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of limitations and broader impacts by including them in the main text rather than the Appendix. Additionally, addressing the over-segmentation of skeletons to enhance their usability for animation would be beneficial. We suggest providing more visual results and analysis for failure cases, particularly in complex motion scenarios. Clarifying the statistical significance claims and ensuring consistent evaluation metrics across methods would strengthen the paper. Finally, we encourage the authors to consider using a higher quality captured dataset for more robust comparisons.
