Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents BeatDiff, a lightweight denoising diffusion generative model for multi-lead ECG signal morphology, addressing challenges in heartbeat analysis due to noise, missing leads, and limited annotated data. The authors propose the EM-BeatDiff algorithm, which utilizes BeatDiff as a prior within a Bayesian framework for conditional generation tasks, enhancing ECG analysis efficacy. The combined application of BeatDiff and EM-BeatDiff shows superior performance in noise removal, ECG reconstruction from single leads, and unsupervised anomaly detection compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work proposes an interesting framework for ECG morphology tasks.
- It evaluates different tasks and datasets effectively.
- The application of diffusion models to ECG tasks is a commendable effort.

Weaknesses:
- The reimplementation of baseline models on the PhysioNet Challenge dataset complicates fair comparisons.
- Two common baselines focused on missing lead reconstruction are not included.
- The preprocessing of ECGs to single beats reduces novelty and applicability.
- The proposed method's inference time is significantly slower than the baseline WGAN, raising efficiency concerns.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison by including the two common baselines for missing lead reconstruction. Additionally, clarifying the rationale behind preprocessing ECGs to single beats would enhance the paper's novelty. The authors should also address the efficiency issue by optimizing the inference time of their model. A comprehensive comparison of performance across all tasks using consistent models is necessary to strengthen the evaluation. Lastly, we suggest conducting an ablation study on the window size and exploring the effects of other conditional options like age and gender.
