### Key Points
This paper presents FairSAD, a novel framework aimed at improving fairness in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) while maintaining comparable prediction performance. The authors propose a two-pronged approach involving sensitive attribute disentanglement and sensitive attribute masking to mitigate algorithmic bias influenced by sensitive attributes like race and gender. FairSAD innovatively separates sensitive information, reducing its impact on decision-making, and demonstrates marked improvements over existing methods through extensive testing on five real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and organized, effectively employing visualizations to present experimental results, enhancing comprehensibility.
- FairSAD introduces an innovative approach through Sensitive Attribute Disentanglement, improving fairness without sacrificing utility.
- Extensive evaluations on multiple datasets underscore the framework's effectiveness and practical applicability.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a detailed explanation of how FairSAD addresses non-sensitive attributes associated with sensitive ones, which may not fully mitigate their influence.
- The flowchart's elements (blue blocks, green squares, and red squares) are inadequately explained, hindering reader understanding.
- The methodology overlooks graph reconstruction, potentially affecting the accuracy of node embeddings and the representation of graph structures.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of how FairSAD manages non-sensitive attributes that may carry sensitive information. Clarifying the identification and handling of these attributes is essential. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed description of the flowchart elements to enhance clarity. Finally, addressing the aspect of graph reconstruction in the methodology could significantly improve the representation accuracy of node embeddings and the overall graph structure.
