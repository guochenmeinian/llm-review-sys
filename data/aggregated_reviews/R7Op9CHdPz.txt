### Key Points
This paper presents CopVQA, a model aimed at enhancing out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in Visual Question Answering (VQA) by emphasizing causal reasoning through a two-layer cognitive pathway framework. The authors propose that this approach improves multimodal predictions and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the PathVQA dataset. The model operates by utilizing distinct experts for interpreting and answering stages, thereby prioritizing answer predictions based on causal reasoning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The cognitive pathways concept is innovative and contributes to the understanding of causal reasoning in VQA.
- The paper achieves SOTA results on the PathVQA dataset and demonstrates strong performance on medical data.
- The qualitative analysis and case studies effectively illustrate the advantages of the proposed method.
- The paper is well-organized and presents a compelling argument for its contributions.

Weaknesses:
- The implementation details are insufficiently specified, particularly regarding model parameters, training time, and hardware requirements.
- There is a significant performance gap compared to state-of-the-art pre-trained methods, raising questions about the model's scaling and generalization capabilities.
- Some aspects of the model, such as the complexity of the reasoning module and the potential for data contamination in test sets, remain unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the model's implementation by providing detailed experimental settings, including training time and hardware specifications. Additionally, addressing the performance gap with state-of-the-art methods and discussing the sensitivity of the model to hyper-parameters would strengthen the paper. We also encourage the authors to provide statistics on bias reduction in the dataset and consider incorporating instructions to enhance generalization, as suggested in the literature. Finally, clarifying the types of mixture of experts (MoE) models involved in CopVQA would enhance understanding.
