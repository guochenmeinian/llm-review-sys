Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of block drafts generated by independent prediction heads in blockwise parallel language models, identifying issues such as consecutive repetitions, varying confidence levels, and an efficiency gap with oracle top-k blocks. The authors propose two algorithms—local rescoring using small neural language models and global rescoring via n-gram models—to enhance block efficiency. Experimental results indicate that these algorithms can significantly improve block efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper identifies a critical weakness in existing blockwise parallel decoding algorithms, proposing two innovative rescoring algorithms to address this issue.  
2. It provides a thorough analysis of block drafts, revealing interesting correlations that contribute to understanding block efficiency.  
3. The proposed algorithms demonstrate notable improvements in block efficiency across various tasks, with gains of up to 21.30%.  
4. The paper is well-structured, making it easy to follow, supported by helpful illustrations.

Weaknesses:  
1. The experiments are limited to a 1.5B parameter model, raising concerns about the generalizability of the findings to larger models.  
2. The evaluation lacks comparisons with other inference latency reduction methods, such as quantization or model pruning.  
3. The contribution of the global rescoring algorithm with n-gram models is deemed insufficient for a NeurIPS paper, and the local rescoring approach closely resembles speculative decoding.  
4. There is limited discussion on the computational costs associated with the rescoring methods, and the variability in efficiency gains across tasks warrants further analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including results from larger, open LLMs and additional datasets to enhance generalizability. A more comprehensive comparison with other inference reduction methods should be conducted. We suggest providing a deeper analysis of the variability in block efficiency improvements across different tasks. Additionally, clarifying how the observations in Sections 6.2 and 6.3 contribute to the algorithm design would strengthen the paper. Lastly, addressing the potential impact of using different models in the rescoring phase on final performance is essential.
