Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a ControlNet-based conditioning method for layout-to-image generation using pre-trained diffusion models. The authors introduce the HiCo-7K dataset, which is fine-grained from the GRIT-20M dataset, and demonstrate that their method can effectively generate images that match complex layouts. The empirical results indicate that the model is backbone-agnostic, and the qualitative results are particularly strong for layouts with multiple objects.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method validates its backbone-agnostic nature by being applicable to various pre-trained diffusion models.
- The qualitative results are impressive, especially for layouts containing numerous objects.
- The introduction of the HiCo-7K dataset is a significant contribution, providing a new benchmark for evaluation.

Weaknesses:
- The HiCo-7K dataset is not sufficiently elaborated upon; details regarding the filtering process and criteria for manual cleaning are missing.
- The paper lacks comparisons with cutting-edge methods, such as GLIGEN and InstDiff[A], which should be included as both can be applied to COCO.
- The fuse layer's explanation is inadequate, particularly regarding how overlapping object features are merged.
- The method's efficiency is questioned due to its linear time complexity with respect to the number of bounding boxes, and it only supports axis-aligned bounding boxes, limiting its applicability in more complex scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the elaboration on the HiCo-7K dataset by including details on the filtering process and manual cleaning criteria. Additionally, we suggest incorporating comparisons with GLIGEN and InstDiff[A] in the experiments to strengthen the evaluation. The authors should also provide a more detailed explanation of the fuse layer, particularly how it handles overlapping object features. Lastly, exploring the support for non-axis-aligned bounding boxes and optimizing the method for efficiency would enhance its applicability in more complex tasks.
