Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for auditing and classifying human values embedded in RLHF datasets. The authors propose a method involving a taxonomy of values, a manual qualitative annotation process, and a classifier trained to analyze larger datasets. The analysis reveals insights into the dominant human values within the dataset, highlighting instances of toxic or problematic content.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
* The topic is timely and important, approached creatively.
* The structured methodology—taxonomy development, manual labeling, and subsequent analysis—is well-conceived.
* The results provide valuable insights and call for further research.
* The labeled Anthropic RLHF dataset can benefit other researchers.

Weaknesses:
* The paper suffers from poor writing and presentation, with numerous typos and formatting inconsistencies that undermine trust in the quality of the taxonomy.
* The ethical paradigm aspect of the taxonomy is problematic and lacks justification.
* The framework is tested on a single dataset, necessitating more case studies for validation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the overall writing quality and presentation of the paper, addressing typos and formatting inconsistencies. Specifically, clarify how inter-annotator agreement was calculated and provide details on the literature review process for the taxonomy. Discuss whether RLHF instances could be assigned multiple values and how this was handled. Additionally, we suggest removing the "ethical paradigm" component from the taxonomy due to its inconsistent granularity and misleading associations. Consider creating a table with codebook definitions for clarity and expanding the discussion on the implications of findings related to ethical motivations in technology development. Finally, we encourage the authors to include more case studies to validate their framework.
