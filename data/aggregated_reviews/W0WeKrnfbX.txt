### Key Points
This paper presents ASeM, an unsupervised framework for Aspect Category Detection (ACD) that enhances aspect comprehension and reduces reliance on initial seed word quality. Key contributions include the Seedword Enhancement Component (SEC) for improving seed word quality, retrieval-based data augmentation to manage training data noise, and multi-task learning for ACD, Aspect Term Extraction (ATE), and Aspect Term Polarity (ATP). Comprehensive experiments demonstrate ASeM's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The SEC effectively expands seed word sets, improving model performance even with varying initial seed quality.  
- ASeM outperforms several state-of-the-art unsupervised ACD methods, establishing its efficacy.  
- The use of multi-task learning enhances performance across ACD, ATE, and ATP tasks through shared representation learning.  

Weaknesses:  
- The similarity between the Restaurant and CitySearch datasets raises concerns about demonstrating effectiveness across different domains.  
- The paper lacks details on computational resources and time complexity, hindering assessment of scalability and reproducibility.  
- The performance of ACD is heavily influenced by the quality of pseudo-label generation, which can be compromised by noisy data or ambiguous sentences.  
- The contributions may be limited as the methods employed (data augmentation and multi-task learning) are well-studied and not particularly novel.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the domain similarity of the datasets to strengthen their claims. Additionally, providing specific computational resources and time complexity details would enhance reproducibility. To address the concerns regarding pseudo-label quality, the authors should explore methods to mitigate the impact of noisy data. Finally, we suggest including qualitative analyses to illustrate the types of cases better addressed by the new framework, and considering the potential inclusion of an LLM baseline for comparison.
