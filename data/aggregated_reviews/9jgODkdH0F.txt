Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a systematic investigation of implicit regularization in matrix completion, focusing on how the connectivity of observed data influences the implicit bias. The authors formulate matrix completion as an optimization problem and characterize the dynamics of gradient flow associated with this problem. They identify a hierarchy of intrinsic invariant manifolds in the loss landscape, demonstrating that in connected cases, the model learns the lowest-ranked solution, while in disconnected cases, it tends to yield suboptimal solutions. The findings are supported by both theoretical results and empirical evidence.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The results appear correct, with careful checks revealing no serious issues in key lemmas/theorems.
- The paper is well-written, with clear definitions and insightful examples that enhance understanding.
- Empirical results convincingly illustrate the influence of data connectivity on implicit regularization and training dynamics.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for studying data connectivity needs further justification; the significance of this aspect is unclear.
- The theoretical results are complex, which may hinder comprehension for readers lacking a strong mathematical background.
- Some experimental details are lacking, such as the algorithm used and specifics about the initialization method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the importance of data connectivity in their study. Clarifying under which conditions of matrix size and observed entries multiple connected components arise would strengthen the motivation. Additionally, we suggest providing more details in Section 4 regarding the experimental setup, including the algorithm and learning rate used. It would also enhance readability if the term "connectivity" were defined earlier in the introduction. Lastly, we encourage the authors to offer a more intuitive explanation or proof sketch for their theoretical results to aid understanding.
