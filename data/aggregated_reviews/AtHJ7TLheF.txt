### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical analysis of graph neural network (GNN) expressivity on multi-relational and temporal graphs, extending the R-GCN to R-GNN and R²-GNN architectures. The authors demonstrate that neither R²-GNN nor the class of functions $\mathcal{FOC}_2$ is a subset of the other, but a graph transformation $F$ allows R²-GNN to capture $\mathcal{FOC}_2$ on bounded graphs. The paper also explores the expressiveness of these models in temporal graph settings, establishing a hierarchy of expressivity. Additionally, the authors propose the R²-GNN, which aims to capture logic features in graphs by extending the ACR-GNN methodology to include unary and binary predicates, as well as temporal information. Empirical results validate the theoretical findings across synthetic and real-world datasets, although the novelty of the methodology is questioned as it appears to be an incremental modification rather than a significant advancement.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a robust theoretical framework linking GNNs with first-order logic, enhancing understanding of multi-relational graphs.
- Empirical results support theoretical claims, demonstrating the practical implications of the proposed transformations.
- The writing is generally clear, making complex ideas accessible.
- The inclusion of both synthetic and real-world datasets in the experiments demonstrates the practical performance of the model.

Weaknesses:
- The results are primarily focused on R-GNNs, lacking discussion of alternative architectures that could incorporate edge information.
- The presentation is dense, with insufficient explanations for key definitions and concepts, particularly regarding temporal graphs and the transformation $F$.
- The paper lacks novelty, as the methodology closely resembles ACR-GNN with only minor modifications.
- The definition of a multi-relational graph is deemed redundant and confusing, and the choice of R-GNN as the base model lacks justification.
- The focus on node classification limits the scope of the work, and the empirical significance of the results is unclear due to the lack of comparisons with state-of-the-art models.
- The experiments are limited to small datasets, raising questions about scalability and practical applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of alternative architectures capable of handling multi-relational graphs, such as GATs, to provide a broader context for their findings. Additionally, we suggest including a related work section to contextualize the contributions within existing literature. The authors should clarify the definitions of key concepts, particularly the transformation $F$ and its implications for expressiveness. We also recommend that the authors enhance the novelty of their work by providing a more substantial theoretical contribution that distinguishes R²-GNN from ACR-GNN. Justifying the choice of R-GNN as the base model would enhance the paper's clarity. Expanding the empirical analysis to larger datasets and including other tasks beyond node classification, such as link prediction, would strengthen the claims regarding scalability and practical utility. Lastly, analyzing the learnable FOC₂ rules in the datasets could provide better insights into the model's performance and implications.
