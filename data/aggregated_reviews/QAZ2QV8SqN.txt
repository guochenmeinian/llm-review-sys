### Key Points
This paper presents KG-GPT, a multi-purpose framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for knowledge graph (KG) tasks. The framework consists of three steps: sentence segmentation, graph retrieval, and inference. Sentence segmentation divides a sentence into sub-sentences aligned with individual triples, graph retrieval identifies potential relations, and inference derives logical conclusions. The authors evaluate KG-GPT on KG-based fact verification and KGQA benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex reasoning tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed framework shows competitive performance, providing insights into using LLMs for KG reasoning.
- The paper offers transparency regarding training details, enhancing reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- The introduction to the sentence segmentation step lacks clarity, which is crucial for understanding the framework.
- Claims regarding KG-GPT's comprehension of graph structures are not sufficiently supported by experimental evidence, necessitating additional comparative experiments and case studies.
- The paper's assumptions about user input may not align with real-world scenarios, and the choice of datasets for evaluation is atypical.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the sentence segmentation step to enhance understanding. Additionally, the authors should provide more detailed explanations of how each component contributes to overall performance and include comparative experiments to substantiate claims about graph comprehension. It would also be beneficial to address the assumption that all entities are provided in user queries, as this may not reflect practical applications. Finally, consider using more widely adopted datasets for evaluation, such as FEVER, to strengthen the study's credibility.
