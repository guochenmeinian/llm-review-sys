### Key Points
This paper presents the Multi-Event Inference (MEI) dataset, comprising 35K human-written inferences aimed at addressing the challenges of complex reasoning in multi-event sentences. The authors propose COMET-M, a model trained on the MEI dataset, which demonstrates effectiveness in generating event-specific inferences. The paper evaluates baseline models and shows that COMET-M outperforms them, contributing to the understanding of commonsense reasoning in complex sentences.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset addresses a significant gap in multi-event sentence annotations, enhancing commonsense reasoning.
- The paper is well-written and presents a clear description of the dataset and its applications.
- COMET-M shows improved performance over baseline models, indicating the utility of event-centric annotations.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for the study lacks clarity, particularly regarding the formal definition of events and their relationships.
- The dataset analysis is insufficient, lacking details on coverage, diversity, and statistical characteristics.
- Baseline model comparisons are not adequately justified, raising concerns about fairness in evaluation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation by providing a formal formulation and concrete examples of events. Additionally, a more comprehensive analysis of the dataset's coverage, diversity, and failure cases in the COMET-M model should be included. The authors should also elaborate on the baseline models, considering a randomly initialized model trained on the MEI dataset to ensure fair comparisons. Finally, clarifying the input-output format in Section 4 and enhancing the readability of Figure 4 would strengthen the presentation.
