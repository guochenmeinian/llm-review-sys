Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative integration of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) methodologies, introducing the Spiking Experts Mixture Mechanism (SEMM). The authors propose two novel structures, the Experts Mixture Spiking Attention (EMSA) and the Experts Mixture Spiking Perceptron (EMSP), which enhance the capabilities of Spiking Transformers. Experimental results demonstrate that SEMM achieves stable performance improvements on neuromorphic and static datasets with minimal computational overhead.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of SEMM, along with its derivatives EMSA and EMSP, is a novel contribution, particularly in dynamic conditional computation.
2. SEMM significantly improves performance and can be adapted to various spiking self-attention and MLP modules, benefiting the broader SNN research community.
3. The experiments are comprehensive, particularly the analysis of spiking routing functions shown in Fig. 6.

Weaknesses:
1. Several unclear notations exist, such as the meaning of $N$ in Fig. 1(b) and Line 132, and the definitions of $p$ and $q$ in Equations 24 and 26.
2. Section 4.3 resembles a sensitivity experiment rather than a true ablation study, which could mislead readers.
3. The authors claim SEMM's advantage for asynchronous hardware without empirical evidence, raising concerns about its practical applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by defining all notations explicitly, particularly $N$, $p$, and $q$. Additionally, please revise Section 4.3 to accurately reflect an ablation study. To strengthen the claims regarding SEMM's advantages, we suggest conducting experiments on real asynchronous hardware and providing a detailed discussion on the feasibility of adapting EMSA and EMSP modules to such platforms. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include a thorough discussion of the limitations of their work in Section 5, as well as to provide more empirical evidence demonstrating SEMM's effectiveness across diverse datasets.
