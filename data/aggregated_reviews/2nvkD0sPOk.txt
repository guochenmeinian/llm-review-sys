Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for learning 3D particle dynamics from sparse 2D observations through inverse rendering, utilizing known physical priors rather than a fully unconstrained model. The authors propose a framework that integrates graph network kernels to model particle interaction forces within the Discrete Element Analysis (DEA) framework, trained using a differentiable renderer without 3D supervision. The method is evaluated across various scenes and materials, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline comparisons.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper effectively combines graph networks with classical particle-based simulation, enabling the recovery of 3D dynamics from images.  
- The method is technically sound, well-explained, and easy to follow, with extensive evaluations showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.  
- The authors plan to make the source code and dataset publicly available.  

Weaknesses:  
- Several aspects remain unclear, particularly regarding scene initialization and initial velocities, which the authors should clarify in their rebuttal.  
- The evaluations are limited to synthetic data, and the learned particle interactions lack explainability.  
- There are grammatical errors and layout issues throughout the paper that require attention.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding scene initialization and initial velocities, specifically addressing the questions about the definitions in Appendix B and the sensitivity of the method to inaccuracies in initial velocity. Additionally, the authors should provide details on the length of sequences used in experiments and the training duration. A thorough proofreading is necessary to correct grammatical errors and improve the overall presentation, particularly in the layout of tables and figures. Finally, the authors should consider discussing the implications of the model treating torn objects as single entities and explore potential solutions for this issue.
