### Key Points
This paper presents the Experience Notebook (ExpNote), a framework designed to enhance large language models (LLMs) by utilizing external and dynamic memories. The authors propose a set of action prompts for reading and writing to this memory, allowing the model to generalize task-specific experiences during training and retrieve relevant memories during testing. The experiments demonstrate that ExpNote outperforms several strong baselines, including Chain-of-Thought, Reflexion, and TeachMe, across four tasks. However, the paper lacks sufficient methodological details for replication and does not adequately address the choice of datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research topic is engaging and relevant, likely to attract community interest.
- The proposed method shows effectiveness across multiple benchmarks.
- Sufficient ablation studies are included to support the method's effectiveness.
- The code is made available for further exploration.

Weaknesses:
- The writing lacks clarity, making it difficult to follow the methodology without additional context.
- Key details about the generation of key-value pairs for experiences and the selection of relevant memories are insufficiently described.
- The choice of datasets is questionable, as some are not well-known for LLM evaluations, and the limited size of test sets raises concerns about randomness in results.
- The framework's evaluation is limited to a single LLM, which diminishes the robustness of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing by providing detailed descriptions of how task-specific experiences are generated and how relevant memories are selected. Additionally, we suggest that the authors justify their choice of datasets more thoroughly and consider testing the ExpNote framework with multiple LLMs to enhance the robustness of their claims. Furthermore, we encourage the inclusion of missing references and a more comprehensive discussion of the experimental setup to contextualize the results, particularly given the small train/test sizes.
