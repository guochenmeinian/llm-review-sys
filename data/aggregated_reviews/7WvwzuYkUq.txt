Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ProgOT, a new entropic optimal transport solver that serves as an alternative to the Sinkhorn algorithm. The authors claim that ProgOT is less sensitive to the choice of the entropy-regularized parameter, maintains comparable runtime when computing couplings between point-clouds, and provides consistent and stable optimal transport map estimators. The authors support their claims with both theoretical and empirical results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed ProgOT is a novel entropic optimal transport solver based on McCann-type interpolation.
- The theoretical results are sound and supported by rigorous proofs.
- The paper is well-written and organized, with a useful background section for readers unfamiliar with optimal transport.

Weaknesses:
- The assumption that the inverse map has at least three continuous derivatives is quite strong, as the optimal transport map is unknown in practice.
- The comparison of efficiency between the Sinkhorn algorithm and linear programs lacks explicit computational complexity details.
- The initialization of the entropy-regularized parameter requires a clearer explanation of its rationale.
- There are minor issues, including undefined notations and grammatical mistakes.
- The paper lacks a discussion on the limitations of the proposed method and future directions, such as the potential for generalizing ProgOT to entropic unbalanced optimal transport.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the assumptions, particularly regarding assumption (A.2), and consider reducing its strength. Additionally, the authors should explicitly state the computational complexity of both the Sinkhorn algorithm and ProgOT when discussing efficiency. It would be beneficial to provide a brief rationale for the initialization of the entropy-regularized parameter $\varepsilon_0$. We also suggest addressing the minor issues related to undefined notations and grammatical errors. Furthermore, the authors should include a discussion of the limitations of their method and explore future directions, such as the generalization of ProgOT for entropic unbalanced optimal transport.
