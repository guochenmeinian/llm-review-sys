Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents RetroPLEX, a novel method for inorganic retrosynthesis planning that utilizes attention layers to implicitly extract precursor information from reference materials. The approach consists of two components: a masked precursor completion retriever and a neural reaction energy (NRE) retriever, which incorporates thermodynamic relationships to enhance prediction accuracy. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of RetroPLEX through extensive experiments, highlighting its potential for discovering new synthesis recipes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The method's originality lies in its implicit extraction of precursor information, diverging from traditional explicit approaches.
2. The incorporation of Gibbs free energy considerations through the NRE retriever significantly improves prediction results.
3. The writing is clear, and the experiments are well-documented, providing thorough discussions of results.

Weaknesses:
1. There is insufficient discussion on the differences between inorganic and organic retrosynthesis planning.
2. The complexity of the model, involving two retrievers, raises concerns about computational efficiency and scalability.
3. The manuscript lacks detailed elaboration on the training process of the proposed approach, and clarity is needed in several areas, particularly regarding the NRE retriever's training.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the differences between inorganic and organic retrosynthesis planning to provide clearer context. Additionally, we suggest including a detailed analysis of the computational requirements for training and using RetroPLEX, addressing potential scalability issues. The authors should also provide pseudocode for the training process and clarify how they handle duplicate chemical formulas during data preprocessing. Lastly, it would be beneficial to explain why random selection of reference materials performs comparably to trained retrievers and to provide qualitative examples demonstrating the importance of each retriever in the synthesis process.
