Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the overfitting behavior of Gaussian kernel ridge regression (KRR) under varying bandwidth and dimensionality. The authors propose two main contributions: (1) in fixed dimensions, the ridgeless solution of Gaussian KRR is inconsistent with any varying bandwidth; (2) in high dimensions, with input dimension \(d=2^{2^l}\) and sample size \(m=2^{2^{2^l}}\), the overfitting of Gaussian KRR is benign. The results are framed within the Gaussian universality Ansatz and rely on (non-rigorous) risk predictions concerning the kernel eigenstructure introduced in prior work. Additionally, the authors analyze how the eigenvalues of the Gaussian kernel for the sphere depend on the bandwidth \(\tau_m\), which varies with sample size \(m\). They characterize the test risk of the interpolating solution of Gaussian KRR in relation to the bandwidth, elucidating its overfitting behavior under the Gaussian design ansatz. The paper also explores the behavior of test risk with increasing dimensions, providing upper and lower bounds for the interpolating solution of KRR, and demonstrates that benign overfitting can be achieved even with sub-polynomially increasing dimensions, improving upon existing results for polynomially increasing dimensions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The contributions are novel and provide significant insights into the overfitting behavior of Gaussian KRR.  
- The paper includes a detailed calculation of the eigenvalue structure of the Gaussian kernel, which could be valuable for future studies.  
- The analysis of test risk in relation to dimension scaling is a notable advancement in the field.  
- The demonstration of benign overfitting with sub-polynomially increasing dimensions is an important improvement over previous results.  
- The presentation is clear, with a well-structured literature review and adequate clarifications.

Weaknesses:  
- The assumptions made, particularly regarding the eigenframework under the Gaussian Universality Ansatz, are non-rigorous and fail to address known issues of catastrophic overfitting in fixed dimensions.  
- The paper lacks experimental validation, raising doubts about the correctness of claims regarding Gaussian kernels.  
- The reliance on earlier works diminishes the originality of the contributions, and the paper does not provide robust guidelines for optimal tuning of parameters.  
- The reliance on the Gaussian design ansatz for certain contributions may limit the generalizability of the findings.  
- The complexity of the technical contributions may pose challenges for readers unfamiliar with the underlying concepts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the rigor of their assumptions, particularly regarding the eigenframework and its applicability to Gaussian kernels. Providing experimental validations for their claims would strengthen the paper significantly. Additionally, we suggest that the authors elaborate on the practical implications of their findings, particularly in terms of tuning parameters across different data distributions. Clarifying the theoretical basis for the observed catastrophic overfitting and providing more comprehensive guidelines for choosing the bandwidth parameter would also enhance the paper's contribution. Furthermore, we recommend improving the accessibility of their findings by providing clearer explanations of the Gaussian design ansatz and its implications, as well as including more intuitive examples or illustrations to help readers better grasp the significance of the technical contributions.
