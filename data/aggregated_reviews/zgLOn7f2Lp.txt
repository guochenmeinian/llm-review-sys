### Key Points
This paper presents a Hodge decomposition graph classification algorithm within a Gaussian process (GP) framework that captures signals on vertices, edges, and higher-order graph structures by analyzing their projections onto the eigenbasis of the graph Laplacian and Helmholtzian. The authors propose converting non-Euclidean graph signals into Euclidean domain signals and applying a standard GP classification algorithm. The introduction of graph wavelet transforms for vertex and edge signals, along with features generated from Hodge decomposition, serves as input for downstream tasks. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the WT-GP-Hodge algorithm and demonstrate its superiority over existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The algorithm processes vertex and edge signals directly, enhancing algorithmic flexibility and practicality compared to WT-GP, which requires transforming the graph into a line graph.
2. The integration of Hodge decomposition and graph wavelet transforms prior to standard GP is both simple and interesting.
3. The paper is well-written, with clear presentation of results.

Weaknesses:
1. While the method addresses vertex and edge signals, it only compares against an algorithm that cannot process edge features. Empirical evidence should be provided to show that WT-GP can outperform an algorithm that cannot process vertex features.
2. The authors assert that WT-GP can incorporate high-order graph features, referencing methodology in Appendix B that substitutes Laplacian/Helmholtzian with the k-th Hodge Laplacian. There is skepticism regarding the kernel in (12) potentially losing high-order information, necessitating experimental results to support this claim.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve their empirical comparisons by including experiments that demonstrate WT-GP's performance against algorithms incapable of processing vertex features. Additionally, we suggest providing experimental results to substantiate the claim regarding the retention of high-order information in the kernel described in (12).
