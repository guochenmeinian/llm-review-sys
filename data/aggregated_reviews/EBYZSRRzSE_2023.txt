Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Video Timeline Modeling, a task aimed at aligning news-related videos to a timeline of events. The authors curate a benchmark dataset, YouTube-News-Timeline, and propose evaluation metrics along with three deep learning approaches—V-Transformer, Tri-Transformer, and Tri-Transformer + cross-modal distillation—to address the problem. The authors clarify that their problem setting does not rely on a predefined textual timeline, reflecting realistic scenarios in breaking news where such timelines are often unavailable. They emphasize the significance of their contributions, including a large dataset and a sound baseline method, while also discussing the retrieval methods based on keyword filters or embedding-guided retrieval. The dataset's curation process is mentioned, although specific details regarding the selection of news topics, video relevance, statistical characteristics, and the rationale behind these choices are requested for clarity. The authors acknowledge the need for a more thorough discussion on the societal impacts of their model, particularly concerning the accuracy of timelines obtained through web crawling.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a novel and practical problem in video timeline modeling relevant to the news industry.
- The YouTube-News-Timeline dataset is a valuable resource for future research.
- The proposed deep learning approaches are well-motivated and designed to capture dependencies among videos.
- The authors provide a clear rationale for their problem setting and retrieval methods.
- Acknowledgment of the need for transparency in dataset curation is commendable.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset's curation process lacks clarity regarding the selection of news topics, video relevance, and statistical characteristics.
- The proposed baseline method, while adequate, could benefit from exploring advanced multimodal models.
- The paper does not adequately discuss the sensitivity of the method to time spans and potential biases in the dataset.
- Insufficient discussion on the societal impacts of potential inaccuracies in timeline alignment.
- Limited dataset size, with only 24 nodes, which may affect the robustness of findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the dataset curation process by providing detailed information on how news topics were selected, the criteria for video relevance, the time intervals for each topic, and the statistical characteristics of the dataset. Additionally, consider exploring advanced multimodal models, such as BLIP, for establishing a more inspiring baseline. It would also be beneficial to discuss the sensitivity of the models to smaller time intervals and address potential biases in the dataset more comprehensively. Furthermore, we suggest expanding the discussion on societal impacts to address potential inaccuracies in timeline alignment and their implications. Lastly, we encourage the authors to emphasize the limitation of the dataset size in the paper, possibly in the caption for Figure 3 or in the "outlook" section for future work.
