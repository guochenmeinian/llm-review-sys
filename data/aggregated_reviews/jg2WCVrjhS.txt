### Key Points
This paper presents GEMFormer (Global Explicit Memory Transformer), a novel method for the multi-hop question answering (MHQA) task that enhances transformer models by incorporating a global memory sequence derived from important tokens in the document. The method operates in two stages: first, it estimates token uncertainty using the RoBERTa language model to populate global memory with low-entropy tokens; second, it utilizes this memory-augmented input to generate answers. The authors demonstrate improvements over the RoBERTa baseline across three datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The memory construction method is novel, simple, and effective.
- The methodology is clearly presented and easy to follow.
- GEMFormer is evaluated on various datasets, providing extensive experimental support for its claims.

Weaknesses:
- The heuristic uncertainty threshold for memory population requires dataset-specific tuning, limiting generalization.
- Improvements over the baseline are marginal, ranging from 1-3 F1 points.
- Some sections, particularly the discussion, lack clarity due to the introduction of new concepts without prior context.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the structure of the Results and Discussion section to enhance clarity, ensuring that methods are discussed before their results are presented. Additionally, we suggest providing more background on defining token importance as language model uncertainty in the related work section. Clarifying the significance of low-entropy tokens in generating answers and comparing GEMFormer against more relevant baselines would strengthen the paper. Lastly, we advise refining the writing style, particularly by breaking up long sentences and improving punctuation for better readability.
