### Key Points
This paper presents a framework named Fairness-aware Adaptive Sampling for meTa-learning (FAST) aimed at addressing group proportion imbalance in meta-learning for user modeling. The authors identify that group proportion imbalance is a critical factor contributing to unfairness and provide theoretical proof that FAST can eliminate this unfairness. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms many baseline methods across three datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The focus on fairness in meta-learning and the identification of group proportion imbalance as a key determinant are significant contributions.
- The proposed framework is intuitive and easy to adopt, with theoretical analysis supporting its effectiveness and convergence.
- The manuscript is well-written, with clear motivations and illustrations that enhance understanding.

Weaknesses:
- While the improvement in fairness is notable, the utility performance of FAST is often inferior to existing methods, raising concerns about potential accuracy sacrifices.
- The paper lacks discussion regarding the size of user group 'B' and its impact on running time and performance when considering finer user groupings.
- There is insufficient exploration of hyperparameter tuning and the absence of ablation studies.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors verify their FAST method with additional datasets, such as Last.fm, and consider incorporating datasets from “Algorithmic fairness datasets: the story so far.” Additionally, we suggest discussing the similarities between meta-learning and feedback loops in fairness, addressing the strong assumptions of homoscedasticity in Theorem 1, and exploring the use of weighted and resampling techniques to align group distributions. Finally, including performance analysis under varying degrees of distributional differences and conducting ablation studies would strengthen the paper.
