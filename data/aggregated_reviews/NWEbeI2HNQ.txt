### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method called SCARF for predicting tandem mass spectra from molecular graphs. The approach involves a two-step process: predicting atomic subsets and subsequently predicting peak intensities based on these subsets. SCARF utilizes a prefix tree to efficiently generate subformulae, addressing the combinatorial challenges of existing methods. Experimental results indicate that SCARF outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of accuracy, physical sensibility, and speed across two datasets, NIST20 and NPLIB1.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces an innovative method that predicts high-resolution spectra without combinatorial fragmentation.
- The use of prefix trees for molecular formula prediction is a significant advancement.
- The application of random Fourier features for molecular formula embedding shows improved performance over traditional encoding methods.
- The evaluation is thorough, with fair comparisons to relevant baselines and detailed descriptions of datasets and metrics.
- The manuscript is well-written, with clear explanations and available source code.

Weaknesses:
- The paper does not discuss the relationship between SCARF and its successor method, ICEBERG, which could enhance understanding of their respective strengths and weaknesses.
- The method lacks insights into the fragmentation process, limiting its applications beyond molecule identification.
- Concerns arise regarding the decoupling of identification rates from database retrieval rates, which is critical for spectrum prediction.
- The retrieval task is limited to a small set of isomers, which may not reflect real-world scenarios.
- The assumptions made about fragmentation pathways and ideal measurement conditions may not hold in practical applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the relationship between SCARF and ICEBERG, highlighting their respective advantages and potential synergies. Additionally, the authors should clarify the limitations of SCARF in providing insights into fragmentation processes and consider expanding the retrieval task to include a broader range of isomers. It would also be beneficial to address the assumptions regarding fragmentation pathways and measurement conditions, potentially exploring more general models that can accommodate complex scenarios. Finally, we suggest providing more context about the datasets used, including the classes of molecules present and their molecular weights, to enhance the reader's understanding.
