Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on federated frequency estimation (FFE) utilizing the Federated CountSketch algorithm. The authors argue that when the tail of the underlying frequencies is light, it leads to reduced estimation error and smaller sketch width, thereby lowering client communication costs. The paper introduces a two-phase approach for learning problem-dependent quantities and extends the algorithm to a multi-round HybridSketch method, enhancing scalability. The analysis includes trade-offs between accuracy and privacy, with empirical evaluations demonstrating performance improvements on real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses foundational challenges in federated analytics, providing improved results that are relevant for practitioners.  
- The algorithms are clear and implementable, with straightforward methods for achieving differential privacy through noise addition.  
- The systematic investigation of FFE problems and theoretical analyses contribute to the literature, particularly in scenarios with varying client numbers and differential privacy considerations.  

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty of the contribution is limited; initial results rely heavily on prior work, and the second set of results, while more complex, still adapts existing proofs.  
- The paper lacks a clear definition of the heterogeneity model assumed and does not sufficiently test on real data.  
- The two-phase method's reliance on the Zipf law raises questions about its practical applicability, and the exact mechanism for adding noise in the differential privacy analysis is not specified.  
- The theoretical analysis does not convincingly illustrate the benefits of instance dependence, and the implications of varying frequency distributions across rounds are not adequately discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the heterogeneity model and provide empirical tests on real datasets to validate their assumptions. Additionally, it would be beneficial to clarify the two-phase method's application to the instance optimal method and specify the noise addition mechanism for differential privacy. Including a limitations section that discusses potential challenges, particularly regarding the verification of lighter tails before running the sketching algorithm, would enhance the paper's comprehensiveness. Furthermore, we suggest providing examples of real-world frequency distributions that demonstrate the advantages of the Hybrid Sketch approach to strengthen the paper's practical relevance.
