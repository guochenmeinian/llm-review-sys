Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Sequence-to-Structure approach for document-level targeted sentiment analysis (TSA), focusing on extracting multi-level opinion targets and predicting their sentiments. The authors introduce a multi-grain graphical model using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to capture semantic relations and hierarchical affiliations among entities. Experimental results demonstrate the approach's effectiveness across six benchmark datasets, highlighting improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Addresses the underexplored area of document-level TSA.
- The multi-grain graphical model effectively captures long-distance dependencies among entities.
- Substantial performance improvements are shown across multiple datasets.
- The paper is well-written and comprehensible.

Weaknesses:
- The core techniques, particularly the use of GCNs, lack groundbreaking innovation and are seen as incremental adaptations.
- Limited representation of longer documents raises concerns about generalizability to typical document-level TSA scenarios.
- Uncertainty exists regarding performance on noisy or informal texts and the practical applicability of the fine-grained output.
- The experimental design lacks diversity in baseline models and datasets, potentially undermining the validity of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their approach by including a wider variety of document types and lengths in their experiments. Additionally, conducting user studies or extrinsic evaluations would provide insights into the practical usefulness of the fine-grained outputs. The authors should also clarify the advantages of their method over traditional sequence-to-sequence approaches and address the concerns regarding the hierarchical structure's feasibility in documents lacking clear affiliations among targets. Finally, a comprehensive ablation study would strengthen the experimental analysis and validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
