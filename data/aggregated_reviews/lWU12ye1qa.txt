### Key Points
This paper presents a novel data multiplexing approach that extends DataMUX, originally designed for language models, to vision transformer models. The authors propose using convolution followed by concatenation instead of matrix multiplication, leveraging spatial correlations in images to enhance model throughput. The experiments and ablation studies are well-structured, and the results are clearly articulated, demonstrating some performance improvements.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is innovative and addresses an important topic in computer vision.
- The experiments are carefully designed, and the presentation is clear and easy to follow.
- The approach shows potential for improving inference speed with minimal accuracy loss.

Weaknesses:
- The trade-off between performance gain and accuracy is not substantial, with significant accuracy drops observed in some cases.
- There is a lack of ablation studies regarding the use of CLIP and label smoothing losses, and the rationale for not exploring DALL-E and CNN patchifiers with ConcatPlexer is unclear.
- The text contains inconsistencies, such as mixed tenses and improper table references.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and consistency of the text by addressing the mixed tenses and correcting the table references. Additionally, we suggest conducting ablation studies on CLIP and label smoothing losses, as well as exploring the potential of DALL-E and CNN patchifiers in conjunction with ConcatPlexer. It would also be beneficial to investigate the use of multiple convolutional layers with non-linearities in the multiplexing step to enhance the proposed method's effectiveness. Finally, clarifying the performance issues with the CNN tokenizer would strengthen the experimental section.
