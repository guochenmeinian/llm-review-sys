### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of the metric backbone of weighted graphs, defined as the union of all-pairs shortest paths, and its relationship to community structure in weighted Stochastic Block Models (wSBM). The authors demonstrate that the metric backbone retains the edge probabilities of blocks and that spectral clustering applied to it can recover the community structure. The work includes theoretical proofs and empirical validations, highlighting the robustness of community structures despite the removal of non-metric backbone edges.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a formal analysis and proof regarding the robustness of community structures in the metric backbone, addressing a significant knowledge gap.
- Empirical comparisons validate theoretical findings, establishing the metric backbone as an efficient sparsifier in community-present networks.
- The writing is clear, and the presentation of proof ideas is well-structured.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental setup appears overcomplicated, lacking justification for the chosen methods, particularly in Sections 4 and 5.
- Some theoretical assumptions, such as those in Theorem 2, may be unrealistic, and the results' applicability to other sparsification methods is uncertain.
- The paper does not adequately discuss limitations or future work, which would enhance its comprehensiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental setup in Section 4 by referencing standard methodologies for converting weighted networks to distance networks. Additionally, we suggest providing motivation for the complex constructions in Section 5, particularly regarding the necessity of the chosen approach over simpler alternatives. The authors should also clarify the implications of their theoretical results and address the limitations and potential future work in the main text rather than in a checklist. Finally, we encourage rewording unclear sentences and ensuring that all assumptions are explicitly stated and justified.
