Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an approach to enhance graph neural networks (GNNs) by introducing a consistency loss function that aims to improve the representation of graphs across different layers. The authors demonstrate through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments that this consistency loss significantly boosts graph classification performance across various GNN backbones and datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work explores the relationship between kernel methods and GNNs, proposing a novel consistency criterion with a strong theoretical foundation.
- It provides a new perspective on graph classification performance by analyzing similarity relationships across layers.
- Empirical evaluations across diverse GNN models support the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- The effectiveness of the consistency loss in enhancing performance for graph clustering tasks remains uncertain.
- The algorithm appears unsuitable for large-scale datasets, and additional computational costs are acknowledged.
- The experiments primarily involve datasets with only two classes, limiting the generalizability of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by:
- Conducting artificial experiments with graph datasets of increasing structural complexity and label alphabets to establish a clearer link between task complexity and performance improvement.
- Providing a complexity analysis, including specific running times and memory usage, to facilitate further evaluation of the method's efficiency.
- Reporting run time information to gauge the tradeoff between added complexity and performance enhancement.
- Including a critical difference diagram to summarize the results of Tables 1 and 2, enhancing clarity in the presentation of results.
- Expanding the experimental evaluation to include datasets with more classes to better validate the method's effectiveness across a broader range of scenarios.
