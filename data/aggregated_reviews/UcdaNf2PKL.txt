Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for video restoration that addresses time-varying unknown degradations (TUD) using a single model. The authors propose an all-in-one video restoration network comprising two modules: the prompt-guided alignment (PGA) module, which mitigates pixel shifts, and the prompt-conditioned enhancement (PCE) module, which manages multiple unknown degradations. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments on various degradation types.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The study tackles the practical and challenging problem of TUD in video restoration, which is relevant in real-world scenarios.
2. The proposed method can handle multiple unknown degradations simultaneously, unlike traditional methods that focus on specific degradations.
3. The paper provides a comprehensive discussion of existing video restoration and all-in-one image restoration methods, highlighting the differences from the proposed approach.

Weaknesses:
1. The proposed method's performance on variable degradation intervals is uncertain, as the test sets used fixed intervals.
2. Experiments are limited to combined degradations; performance on single degradation types with variable levels is not assessed.
3. The data generation pipeline is simplistic and fails to maintain content dependencies, which could be improved by simulating degradation severity over time.
4. The efficiency comparison in Table 1 contains inaccuracies regarding the number of parameters for PromptIR and AIRNet.
5. The paper lacks a thorough exploration of the problem, particularly in considering weather-induced degradations and adaptive keyframe selection methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the data generation pipeline to better simulate the severity of degradations over time, preserving temporal dependencies. Additionally, the authors should evaluate the proposed method on realistic degraded videos, such as VideoLQ or NoisyCity4, to assess its performance in more complex settings. Including a baseline that considers existing all-in-one video restoration methods would strengthen the paper. Furthermore, the authors should address the inaccuracies in the efficiency comparison and discuss related works that guide this area more comprehensively.
