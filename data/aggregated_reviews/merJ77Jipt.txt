Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DiffPO, a causal diffusion model designed to predict individual potential outcomes (POs) rather than average treatment effects (CATE). The authors argue that predicting POs is more complex and propose adapting a conditional denoising diffusion model, enhanced with an orthogonal diffusion loss to address confounding. The method shows superior performance across various datasets and is capable of uncertainty quantification, making it particularly relevant for high-stakes applications like medicine.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The originality of the paper is notable, as it effectively motivates the need for a distinct focus on potential outcome prediction.
- The experimental evaluation is extensive, demonstrating strong performance against baseline methods across diverse datasets.
- The clarity of the writing aids in understanding the motivation, methodology, and results.

Weaknesses:
- The preliminaries on diffusion models are overly compressed, and the authors should consider expanding this section in the camera-ready version.
- There is a lack of clarity regarding the motivation for focusing on potential outcomes, as most interest typically lies in causal effects.
- The empirical examination could be enhanced by including additional datasets, such as IHDP and Jobs, to strengthen the experimental results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind focusing on potential outcomes, perhaps by discussing its relevance in more detail. Additionally, we suggest expanding the section on diffusion models to provide necessary background information. It would also be beneficial to include more comprehensive performance metrics in the results tables to clarify the extent of improvement over baseline methods. Finally, addressing the sensitivity of the proposed estimator to hyperparameters and model architecture would provide valuable insights into its robustness.
