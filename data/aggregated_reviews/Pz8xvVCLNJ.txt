Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the adversarial robustness of No Reference Video Quality Assessment (NR-VQA) models, introducing a new loss function called Score-Reversed Boundary Loss. This loss function aims to push the estimated quality score of adversarial videos far from their Mean Opinion Score (MOS) towards a specific boundary. The authors propose a patch-based random search method for both white-box and black-box attacks, while ensuring the imperceptibility of adversarial videos through an L2-norm constraint.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- It establishes the first work on evaluating the adversarial robustness of NR-VQA models with reasonable motivations.
- Both white-box and black-box attack methods are designed.
- Rich experiments are conducted on mainstream VQA datasets to evaluate the adversarial robustness of multiple NR-VQA models.
- Insightful analysis of the adversarial robustness of specific design choices of NR-VQA models is provided.
- The paper investigates the robustness of state-of-the-art NR-VQA models against adversarial attacks, and the Score-Reversed Boundary Loss offers useful guidance for decreasing SROCC and PLCC.

Weaknesses:
- The definitions of f_{e} and f_{d} are confusing; it would be clearer to define a NR-VQA model as f, with f(I) and f(I_{adv}) representing the estimated quality of the original and perturbed video, respectively.
- The disturbed score is treated as a target score, but the lack of a dataset with ground-truth MOS complicates boundary setting for arbitrary videos.
- The rationale for using an L2-norm constraint for invisibility is not explained, and the potential use of other L-norm constraints is not addressed.
- The claim that strict L2 norms uphold Just Noticeable Difference (JND) constraints lacks verification through human studies, and the hyperparameter T=1 for black-box attacks may lead to temporal flickering.
- The comparison with existing methods should be constrained, and the patch selection strategy in Algorithm 2 requires clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definitions for f_{e} and f_{d} by simplifying the notation. Additionally, the authors should provide a clear methodology for setting boundaries in the absence of ground-truth MOS data. It would be beneficial to justify the choice of L2-norm constraint and explore the potential use of other L-norm constraints. We also suggest conducting human studies to verify the JND claims and addressing the temporal flickering issue associated with the hyperparameter T=1. Finally, the authors should clarify the patch selection strategy in Algorithm 2 and ensure a more thorough comparison with existing methods.
