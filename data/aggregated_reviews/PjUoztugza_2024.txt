### Key Points
This paper presents a method that utilizes small bias expert models and anti-bias expert models to introduce debiasing signals during the decoding process, effectively reducing biases related to gender, race, and religion. Compared to prior bias mitigation techniques that demand extensive data and computational resources, this approach is more resource-efficient and interpretable.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The work innovatively trains biased and anti-biased experts using Stereotype and Anti-stereotype datasets, generating a debiasing signal that modifies word distributions during inference to mitigate stereotypical bias.  
2. By employing smaller base models, it achieves bias mitigation with fewer computing resources.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The applicability of the proposed method to target models that are black-box APIs, where token probability distributions are inaccessible, raises concerns about its effectiveness in reducing bias.  
2. The handling of out-of-distribution cases not represented in the training dataset is unclear.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on how the proposed method can be adapted for black-box APIs to ensure its practical applicability. Additionally, the authors should address the strategy for managing out-of-distribution cases to enhance the robustness of their approach.
