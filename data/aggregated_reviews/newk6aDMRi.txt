### Key Points
This paper presents automated methods for preparing educational materials for L2 learners of Kannada and Marathi, utilizing the AutoLex system. The authors employ NLP-preprocessed corpora to generate materials covering vocabulary, morphology, grammar, and examples. The study includes teacher interviews and evaluations of the system's utility for language instructors. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The work addresses a practical yet often overlooked application of NLP in education.  
- It targets low-resource languages, Kannada and Marathi, which lack extensive NLP resources.  
- The approach is straightforward and includes specific examples, enhancing its educational value.  
- The thorough human evaluation provides insights into the system's effectiveness.  

Weaknesses:  
- The system is still in development, with high error rates and unclear applicability for different learner levels.  
- The approach largely follows existing work by Chaudhary et al., 2022, lacking novelty.  
- Mixed results from evaluations raise concerns about the relevance and correctness of the extracted materials.  
- There is insufficient contextualization regarding the support for teachers and students.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the manuscript by adding a short paragraph describing AutoLex and its functionalities. Additionally, the authors should provide more details on the model trained in A2 and include accuracy/correctness in the evaluation survey. Clarifying the curriculum and defining learner levels would enhance the applicability of the materials. Finally, addressing the remuneration of evaluators and the inclusion of incorrect items in the perception survey would strengthen the study's rigor.
