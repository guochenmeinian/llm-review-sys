### Key Points
This paper presents EVA-MVC, an algorithm aimed at enhancing multi-view clustering (MVC) through equitable allocation of view weights. It addresses the "Redundant Supplementarity" problem, where similar views can dominate the clustering process, thus diminishing representational capability. EVA-MVC organizes views into View Communities (VCs) and serves as a preprocessing step compatible with various MVC techniques, demonstrating improved performance across datasets in metrics such as ACC and NMI.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The EVA module is theoretically grounded, providing a solid foundation for the approach.  
- EVA-MVC can be seamlessly integrated with arbitrary MVC methods, enhancing their performance.  
- Comprehensive evaluations across diverse datasets show significant improvements in effectiveness over baseline MVC methods.  

Weaknesses:  
- The exposition of 'Redundant Supplementarity' lacks clarity, and the paper does not adequately discuss its practical implications.  
- The introduction fails to systematically analyze existing methods of view weight allocation in MVC literature.  
- The experimental section does not include recent methods emphasizing view-weight allocation and redundancy reduction.  
- Claims regarding efficiency and scalability are unsupported by experimental results, particularly given the small datasets used.  
- The clarity of technical explanations, especially regarding equitable alignment and the optimization objective, could be improved.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the exposition on 'Redundant Supplementarity' and provide real-world examples to illustrate its significance. Additionally, the introduction should include a systematic discussion of view weight allocation methods in the literature. To strengthen the experimental section, we suggest incorporating recent methods for comparison, adding an analysis of view weight distribution, and conducting ablation studies to verify the necessity of fair weight allocation. Furthermore, empirical support for claims regarding efficiency and scalability should be provided, including time costs as the number of objects and views increases. Lastly, we encourage the authors to open-source the code for reproducibility.
