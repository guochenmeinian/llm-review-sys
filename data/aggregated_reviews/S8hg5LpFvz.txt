Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to surface reconstruction from unorganized point clouds using a p-Poisson equation and a curl-free constraint, without relying on surface normals. The authors propose a variable splitting strategy to optimize the signed distance function (SDF) while ensuring the gradient solution is conservative. The experimental results indicate that the method achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art techniques that utilize additional data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The methodology is innovative, addressing challenging problems in surface reconstruction.
- The use of auxiliary variables and the p-Poisson equation is well-motivated and reduces computational complexity.
- The experiments demonstrate robust reconstruction capabilities, particularly on noisy data.

Weaknesses:
- The geometric intuition behind the weight in the p-Poisson equation is unclear.
- The results in Tables 1 and 2 do not meet expectations across different datasets and metrics.
- There is insufficient theoretical justification for choosing the p-Poisson equation over other PDEs, such as the Eikonal equation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the geometric intuition behind the weight in the p-Poisson equation. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include a comparison of the learned vector field with the vector field derived from the oriented point cloud in PoissonRecon. We suggest providing quantitative evaluations of surface quality, including normal consistency, and details on training and inference times. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the necessity of the curl-free constraint and consider including a toy example to illustrate its practical implications. Lastly, addressing the artifacts observed in the results and ensuring consistency in terminology throughout the paper would enhance the overall quality.
