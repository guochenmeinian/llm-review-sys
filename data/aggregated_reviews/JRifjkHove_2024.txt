### Key Points
This paper presents "IncogniText," a novel text anonymization technique aimed at preventing adversaries from inferring authors' private attributes while preserving text practicality. The authors propose a method utilizing large language models (LLMs) to transform original texts into anonymized versions, effectively misleading potential attackers. Experimental evaluations indicate significant reductions in private attribute leakage compared to existing methods, and the paper outlines the integration of IncogniText's capabilities into LoRA parameters for small device models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. **Innovation:** IncogniText employs LLMs for conditional text anonymization, enhancing privacy while maintaining semantic integrity.
2. **Practicality:** The method's integration into device models allows for efficient text anonymization on endpoint devices.
3. **Thorough Experimental Evaluation:** The paper demonstrates IncogniText's effectiveness across multiple datasets, proving its applicability in real-world scenarios.

Weaknesses:
1. **Insufficient Discussion on Utility Loss:** The paper lacks detailed discussions on utility losses post-anonymization, such as readability and information richness.
2. **Unproven Generalization Capability:** The focus on specific private attributes and datasets necessitates further research to confirm the method's effectiveness across diverse text types.
3. **Inadequate Security Considerations:** There is insufficient discussion on defenses against potential reverse engineering or model inversion attacks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. **Deepen Analysis of Utility Loss:** We recommend that the authors provide a detailed analysis of potential utility losses in aspects like language fluency and information integrity post-anonymization, utilizing qualitative assessments and quantitative methods.
2. **Enhance Generalization Research:** The authors should test various text types and private attributes to verify the method's generalization capabilities, employing diversified datasets and real-world scenarios.
3. **Strengthen Security Assessments:** We suggest proposing and implementing specific security tests, such as simulating attacks to evaluate the resistance of anonymized texts to reverse engineering, and exploring more complex obfuscation techniques to enhance security.
