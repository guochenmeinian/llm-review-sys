Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents FreqBlender, a novel method for generating pseudo-fake faces by blending frequency knowledge to enhance DeepFake detection. The authors propose a Frequency Parsing Network (FPNet) that decomposes frequency components into semantic, structural, and noise information, addressing the limitations of traditional spatial blending methods that overlook frequency characteristics. The method demonstrates improved detection performance across multiple DeepFake datasets, validating its effectiveness. The authors aim to validate their method against existing techniques, particularly in cross-manipulation scenarios, and provide comparisons in various tables. They argue that their method demonstrates superior performance compared to others trained on the DF track of FF++ and addresses the efficacy of diffusion-based models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper tackles the critical issue of generalizing DeepFake detection by innovatively blending frequency knowledge, which is a novel approach compared to conventional spatial methods.
2. It effectively identifies the shortcomings of existing techniques, emphasizing the importance of frequency characteristics in forgery detection.
3. The method is well-evaluated across various datasets, showcasing robustness and practical applicability.
4. The authors provide a clear explanation of their method's novelty and its integration of frequency information with spatial blending.
5. They present comprehensive comparisons with existing methods, showing notable performance improvements in cross-manipulation scenarios.

Weaknesses:
1. The proposed method does not achieve state-of-the-art performance in some comparisons, particularly in Table 1.
2. The initial comparison in Table 2 lacks sufficient context and does not include a broader range of methods, limiting the robustness of the conclusions.
3. There is a lack of comprehensive comparison with other methods on the FF++ dataset, limiting the evaluation scope.
4. The rebuttal does not convincingly address the need for evaluating more commonly used diffusion-based methods, raising concerns about the fairness of the comparisons.
5. The approach may be constrained to standard face-swapping techniques and may not generalize well to other forgery types, such as those generated by diffusion models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the granularity of frequency range analysis to uncover detailed forgery artifacts, potentially enhancing model performance. Additionally, developing algorithms to increase the explainability of the model's decisions would foster user trust and usability. The authors should also extend their method to accommodate various forgery operations beyond face-swapping, ensuring broader applicability. We suggest that the authors improve the discussion in Table 2 by including a wider range of methods for comparison to strengthen their claims about the effectiveness of FreqBlender. Furthermore, evaluating more commonly used diffusion-based methods, such as Stable 1.5, Stable 2.1, and DALL-E 2, would provide a more comprehensive assessment of their method's performance. Lastly, including an efficiency analysis of FPNet's training overhead and clarifying how their method performs when forgery traces predominantly occur in the RGB domain, particularly in scenarios involving generated cartoon faces, would provide valuable insights into its practical implementation.
