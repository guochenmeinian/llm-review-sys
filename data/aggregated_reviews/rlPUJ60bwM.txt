Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method called KOPI, based on the knockoff framework, which controls the false discovery proportion (FDP) rather than the false discovery rate (FDR). The key idea is that certain summaries of the knockoff statistics are distributed similarly to functions of independent Rademacher random variables under the null hypothesis. This allows for FDP estimation via Monte Carlo methods, facilitating threshold setting for desired FDP levels. The method is extended to aggregate multiple knockoff draws and is shown to effectively control the FDP while maintaining good power on simulated datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
* The approach is clever and relatively straightforward.
* It does not rely on distributional assumptions beyond generating knockoffs with the exchangeability property.
* The paper effectively introduces the knockoff framework and situates its developments within that context.
* The method demonstrates good power and has attractive theoretical guarantees.

Weaknesses:
* Several potential tweaks to the method remain unexplored, making some choices appear arbitrary. For instance, the use of the harmonic mean for aggregation lacks comparison with alternatives like the arithmetic or geometric mean. Additionally, only a specific template is considered despite the generality of the theoretical results.
* The contribution's significance compared to related work is unclear, particularly regarding the use of JER for FDP control, which may have been previously proposed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the exploration of alternative aggregation methods and provide comparisons to enhance the robustness of their choices. Additionally, we suggest including a short paragraph comparing this work to related literature, particularly addressing the significance of Proposition 1 in relation to prior findings. Finally, we encourage the authors to conduct more experiments on diverse real datasets to further validate the effectiveness of KOPI and consider analyzing the false nondiscovery proportion (FNP) to complement their findings.
