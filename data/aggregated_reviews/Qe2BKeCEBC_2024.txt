### Key Points
This paper presents a hybrid Mamba network (HMNet) aimed at enhancing few-shot segmentation (FSS) by addressing the support forgetting and intra-class gap issues through the design of Support Recapped Mamba (SRM) and Query Intercepted Mamba (QIM). The authors claim that HMNet effectively utilizes support information to improve segmentation performance, supported by extensive experiments on PASCAL-5^i and COCO-20^i.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of HMNet marks a novel application of Mamba to FSS, addressing significant issues in the field.
2. The proposed mechanisms enhance the fusion of support-query features, leading to improved performance.
3. Experimental results demonstrate the method's effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Weaknesses:
1. The rationale for using Mamba in FSS is unconvincing, as the proposed method primarily focuses on fusing support FG into query features without sufficient justification of its superiority over existing lightweight methods.
2. Experimental analysis is inadequate; comparisons with other feature-fusing methods are missing, and the performance evaluation lacks a consistent baseline.
3. The potential risk of query patch forgetting due to the SRM strategy has not been addressed, and there is insufficient clarity on how the proposed method resolves the identified issues.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for using Mamba in FSS by providing a comparative analysis with other lightweight feature-fusing methods. Additionally, we suggest including comprehensive experimental comparisons with attention-based methods across different patch settings to substantiate claims of efficiency and effectiveness. Furthermore, clarifying how the proposed mechanisms address the support forgetting and intra-class gap issues in detail would enhance the paper's contribution. Lastly, we advise addressing the potential risk of query patch forgetting associated with the SRM strategy.
