Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to dual-target drug design by leveraging diffusion models trained on single-target protein-ligand complex pairs. The authors introduce a curated dataset based on synergistic drug combinations and propose two methods, COMPDIFF and DUALDIFF, which utilize SE(3)-equivariant composed message passing. These methods aim to align and generate dual-target ligands effectively, showcasing the potential for overcoming drug resistance in cancer therapy. Additionally, the authors assert that their approach extends existing methodologies to accommodate both discrete and continuous variables, introducing the concept of "compositional generation" to AI in drug design. The theoretical foundation is based on Langevin dynamics, with a significant emphasis on the challenges posed by geometric deep learning and SE(3)-equivariance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The formulation of dual-target drug design as a generative task using diffusion models is innovative and addresses a significant challenge in cancer therapy.
2. The curated dataset of potential target pairs based on synergistic drug combinations is a valuable resource for the research community.
3. The use of SE(3)-equivariant composed message passing to align two pockets in 3D space is a strong point, leveraging advanced geometric deep learning techniques.
4. Extensive experimental validation against various baselines demonstrates the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed methods.
5. The authors provide a solid theoretical analysis and a novel approach to compositional generation in AI for drug design, with the algorithm's ability to sample from complex distributions well-articulated.

Weaknesses:  
1. The method description lacks clarity in several aspects, including the formal definition of the dual-target drug design problem and the specifics of pocket alignment.
2. The experimental results are insufficiently detailed, making it challenging to assess the effectiveness of the proposed methods compared to baseline approaches.
3. The novelty of the proposed generative models needs enhancement, as the contributions beyond SE(3)-equivariant modeling are not sufficiently compelling.
4. The final version of the manuscript lacks incorporation of discussions and references that were previously addressed, which may affect the overall evaluation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method description by providing a formal definition of the dual-target drug design problem and elaborating on the specifics of pocket alignment. Additionally, the authors should include detailed quantitative and qualitative experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of their methods compared to baseline approaches. To enhance the novelty of their contributions, we suggest that the authors emphasize the significance of their curated dataset and explore connections to existing neural model reprogramming works in the related literature. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors incorporate the additional discussions and references as previously discussed to ensure that all claims made in the rebuttal are carefully integrated into the camera-ready version, thereby enhancing the quality of the work.
