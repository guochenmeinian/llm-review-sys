Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for training spatio-temporal Gaussian processes that incorporate physics constraints, such as governing equations at collocation points and curl/divergence-free constraints. The authors propose a formulation for state-space Gaussian processes to capture the behavior of PDE-based systems, utilizing techniques to speed up GP inference, including decomposed kernels and variational methods. The approach aims to reduce computational complexity from cubic to linear while demonstrating its efficacy through various test cases.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The combination of known techniques into a novel framework is valuable, particularly in achieving linear complexity.
- The paper provides good motivation for physics-informed Gaussian processes and demonstrates their advantages over traditional methods.
- The extensive test cases convincingly illustrate the proposed method's effectiveness in both synthetic and real-world applications.

Weaknesses:
- The problem statement lacks clarity and specificity regarding the goals of hybrid modeling and the expected improvements in predictive accuracy and computational efficiency.
- The presentation is challenging to follow, with unclear definitions and notation that hinder comprehension.
- The discussion on virtual observations and uncertainty quantification is insufficient, particularly regarding the choice of collocation points and the implications of the Gaussian process assumption.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the problem statement by clearly articulating the specific goals of their hybrid modeling approach, including the desired improvements in predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the discussion on virtual observations, particularly how to balance collocation points with actual data in the context of uncertainty quantification. Clarifying the notation and definitions throughout the paper will also aid in comprehension. Finally, we encourage the authors to include comparisons beyond RMSE, such as the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), to strengthen the numerical studies.
