Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a text-enhanced VI-ReID framework driven by Foundation Models (TVI-FM) to address the performance gap between visual and infrared modalities. The authors propose an Incremental Fine-tuning Strategy (IFS) and Modality Ensemble Retrieving (MER) to enrich infrared representations with automatically generated textual descriptions, thereby reducing annotation costs and improving cross-modality retrieval performance. Extensive experiments validate the proposed approach across three expanded datasets, demonstrating significant retrieval improvements.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors explore a viable solution to enhance VI-ReID performance using readily available foundation models.
2. The proposed methods are methodologically sound, well-structured, and supported by comprehensive experiments.
3. The paper effectively reduces the cost of manual labeling and addresses the issue of missing infrared modality information.
4. Detailed analysis of intra- and inter-class distributions provides valuable insights into data characteristics.

Weaknesses:
1. The main content lacks a description of the data generation process, which should replace the baseline description.
2. Key elements in the appendix should be integrated into the main text for better readability.
3. The introduction is verbose and repetitive, requiring simplification to refine key ideas.
4. Numerous grammatical errors and inconsistent tenses detract from the paper's professionalism.
5. The methodology lacks clarity, particularly in Section 3.2, making it difficult to follow the authors' logic.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology, particularly in Section 3.2, by clearly establishing connections between textual descriptions and the proposed architecture. Additionally, the authors should simplify the introduction to avoid repetition and enhance readability. It is crucial to include a detailed description of the data generation process and integrate relevant appendix content into the main text. We also suggest correcting grammatical errors and ensuring consistent tense usage throughout the paper. Finally, the authors should discuss the limitations of their method and the implications of relying on the accuracy of generated text descriptions.
