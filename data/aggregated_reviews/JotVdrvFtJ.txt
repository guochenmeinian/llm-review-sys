### Key Points
This paper investigates the use of GPT models to modify prompts for text-to-image generation, demonstrating that GPT-modified prompts can reduce the number of edits by approximately 20%. The authors conduct a human study comparing GPT-generated edits with human edits and analyze the types of edits made by both. The findings indicate that while GPT models primarily insert modifiers, human users tend to replace words and phrases, resulting in significantly different images. The study also highlights that GPT-generated images often resemble intermediate user edits rather than final outputs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with clear motivation and solid experiments supported by concrete examples.
- It provides a detailed empirical investigation into the benefits and drawbacks of incorporating GPT models into the text-to-image pipeline.
- The experiments are well-defined, allowing for preliminary conclusions about the usefulness of GPT models in improving text-to-image generation.

Weaknesses:
- Some qualitative examples lack clarity without detailed analysis, particularly regarding the clustering of edit prompts.
- The dataset of prompt edits lacks evaluation or verification, making it difficult to assess the coherence of the clusters.
- The human evaluation methodology is vague, particularly in task framing and model selection, which could affect the clarity of results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of qualitative examples and provide detailed analysis on the clustering of edit prompts. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include evaluation or verification of the edit clusters to ensure they are coherent and relevant. We suggest refining the human evaluation methodology by explicitly framing the task as an image selection task and considering the use of models with better performance metrics. Furthermore, the authors should specify the parameters used in the GPT models and the Stable Diffusion model to enhance reproducibility. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the classification of edits when using SequenceMatcher to avoid ambiguity in categorization.
