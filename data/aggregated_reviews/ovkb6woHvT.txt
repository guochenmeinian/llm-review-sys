### Key Points
This paper presents the GeneraL-purpose EveNt benchmark (GLEN), a new event detection dataset that combines a large-scale Wikidata-based event ontology with a comprehensive corpus of event annotations derived from PropBank. The authors propose a multi-stage event detection method tailored for large event ontologies and evaluate it against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior performance. The paper highlights the need for updated event extraction methodologies, given the outdated nature of existing systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The creation of the GLEN dataset, which is nearly twice the size of the previous largest event extraction dataset, MAVEN, and includes 3465 fine-grained event types.
- Development of effective trigger identification and event type ranking methods.
- Strong analytical section and informative experiments that enhance understanding of the dataset.
- The system will be released as a Docker container, promoting reproducibility.
- Overall, the paper is well-written and effectively illustrated.

Weaknesses:
- The unusual structure of the paper, with the Related Work section placed late, may confuse casual readers.
- The evaluation model is referred to simply as "Ours," which could lead to confusion in future references.
- The GLEN dataset lacks explicit quality assessment metrics, such as a histogram of data type distribution.
- Event roles are neglected in the GLEN dataset and ontology, which may limit its practical applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper's structure by placing the Related Work section earlier to enhance readability for casual readers. Additionally, clarifying the evaluation model's name would prevent future confusion. We suggest including more rows in Table 3 to address scenarios involving multiple triggers in the same region. Furthermore, providing explicit quality assessment metrics for the GLEN dataset, such as a histogram of data type distribution, would strengthen the paper. Lastly, we encourage the authors to consider incorporating event roles into the GLEN dataset to broaden its applicability.
