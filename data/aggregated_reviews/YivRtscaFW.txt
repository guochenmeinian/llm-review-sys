### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach called Universal Self-Adaptive Prompting (USP) aimed at enhancing zero-shot learning in large language models (LLMs) by automatically designing prompts. The USP method utilizes a small amount of unlabeled data and an inference-only LLM, demonstrating significant performance improvements across over 40 tasks compared to standard zero-shot and few-shot baselines. The authors argue that USP generates high-quality pseudo-demonstrations from LLM predictions, which are crucial for improving performance in zero-shot scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a critical issue in zero-shot prompting for LLMs without labeled data.
- The USP method is intuitive, simple, and achieves substantial gains in performance.
- Comprehensive empirical evaluation across diverse NLP tasks showcases the method's generalizability.
- The technical quality is strong, with rigorous experimental design and analysis.

Weaknesses:
- The approach relies on unlabeled data, which may not always be available.
- Limited explanation of the methodology and unclear implementation details could hinder understanding.
- The experiments are conducted solely on proprietary models (PALM and PALM2), raising concerns about reproducibility and transferability to open-source models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the Universal Self-Adaptive Prompting (USP) methodology by providing a detailed explanation of its implementation, including the computational resources required. Additionally, a more thorough comparative analysis with existing state-of-the-art methods would enhance the paper's value. We suggest including a table summarizing differences and similarities among methods, as well as discussing the advantages and limitations of each. Furthermore, elaborating on the datasets used, including their size and preprocessing steps, would be beneficial. Finally, we encourage the authors to conduct additional ablation studies to validate their design choices and explore the scalability of the USP method across various tasks and domains.
