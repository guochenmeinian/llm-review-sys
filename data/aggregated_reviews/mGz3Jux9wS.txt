Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Dynamic Rebalancing Contrastive Learning with Dual Reconstruction (DRCL) to address long-tailed object detection challenges. The authors propose a framework that integrates dynamic rebalancing and dual reconstruction strategies, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the LVIS v1.0 dataset. Experimental results indicate significant improvements in detection accuracy, particularly for rare categories, demonstrating the method's effectiveness across various detectors and backbones.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and clearly structured, enhancing readability and understanding of the methodology and contributions.
- The motivation for addressing long-tailed object detection is strong, with a well-targeted design that reflects a deep understanding of the problem.
- Experimental results robustly validate the proposed method's effectiveness, showing versatility across different detection frameworks.

Weaknesses:
- Some section titles lack clarity and descriptiveness, potentially confusing readers.
- The proposed method is not entirely self-supervised, as it requires prior knowledge of instance counts per image, which should be explicitly stated.
- Evaluations are limited, with unfair comparisons in presented tables and a lack of qualitative analysis and failure case discussions.
- The novelty of the method is somewhat limited, primarily combining existing techniques without demonstrating significant efficiency improvements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of section titles to enhance navigability. Additionally, it is crucial to clarify the self-supervised nature of the proposed method and ensure that the evaluations are fair by comparing computational costs and training times with baseline methods. We suggest including a qualitative analysis and failure case discussions to provide a deeper understanding of the model's performance. Furthermore, the authors should evaluate the method on more datasets and provide a more comprehensive discussion of the relationships between the various losses involved in the framework. Lastly, addressing the novelty concerns by highlighting unique aspects of their approach would strengthen the paper.
