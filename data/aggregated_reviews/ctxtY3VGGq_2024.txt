Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a generalization of the classical online paging problem, focusing on the online weighted paging problem with unknown weights. The authors propose an algorithm that achieves a performance bound of \( E[ALG] \leq O(\log k) \cdot OPT + \tilde{O}(\sqrt{nT}) \), where \( k \) is the cache size, \( n \) is the number of pages, and \( T \) is the number of requests. The algorithm combines a fractional solution and a rounding framework, utilizing concepts from online learning, particularly the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) method. The study aims to minimize total fetching costs while addressing the challenge of unknown page weights.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The problem is well-motivated, with potential implications for the machine learning community.
2. The interface designed to bridge the fractional solution and rounding is innovative, effectively learning page weights.
3. The paper is well-structured, providing clear algorithmic frameworks that enhance reader comprehension.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a lower bound, and the regret bound may not be tight.
2. Some sections, particularly Section 5, are unclear and may not be accessible to all readers.
3. The computational complexity of the algorithm is not discussed, raising concerns about its efficiency.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 5 by providing a high-level overview and introducing concepts like anti-cache before presenting pseudocode. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion on the computational complexity of the algorithm, as this is crucial for understanding its practical applicability. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to conduct experiments to compare their algorithm with benchmarks where weights are known, as this would provide valuable insights into its performance. Lastly, we advise emphasizing the connection to learning-augmented algorithms in the related work section to strengthen the theoretical foundation of the paper.
