### Key Points
This paper presents SpecTr, a new speculative decoding framework aimed at enhancing the efficiency of Transformer and LLM decoding. SpecTr employs a smaller, faster model to generate draft samples, which are then scored by a larger, more accurate model in parallel. The authors frame the speculative decoding process through optimal transport theory and demonstrate potential acceleration by generating multiple drafts in parallel along the batch axis. They provide an approximate solution for efficiently solving the optimal transport problem at scale, achieving significant latency improvements over baseline methods and previous speculative decoding approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers theoretical justifications for its proposed methods and is the first to incorporate parallelization along the batch axis into the speculative sampling framework, enhancing efficiency.
- It introduces a novel algorithm that effectively computes the transport plan, backed by sound theoretical analysis.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation of the proposed method is insufficient, lacking a thorough analysis of end-to-end latency and text generation performance. Specifically:
  * The paper does not assess the impact on text generation quality, focusing solely on latency metrics.
  * The number of decoded tokens per serial call does not accurately reflect actual latency improvements, as it may not account for factors like framework overheads and hardware utilization.
  * It remains unclear if the proposed method incurs additional run-time overhead compared to prior methods, which could diminish the reported improvements.
  * The latency overhead of running smaller models concurrently is not adequately discussed, particularly concerning the effects of hyperparameters.
- The experiments are limited to LM1B, and a broader set of experiments would strengthen the findings.
- Some algorithmic details and definitions are unclear, affecting readability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by providing comprehensive end-to-end inference latency and text generation quality metrics to substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Additionally, including a concluding paragraph would enhance the professionalism of the paper. Clarifying the unclear aspects of Algorithm 1 and expanding the experimental scope beyond LM1B would also be beneficial. Finally, addressing minor issues such as typographical errors and improving the clarity of figures would enhance the overall presentation.
