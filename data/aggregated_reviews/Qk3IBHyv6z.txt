Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on multi-agent imitation learning (MAIL), focusing on the relationship between the value gap and the regret gap objectives. The authors propose that traditional methods minimizing the value gap are inadequate for strategic agents who may deviate from recommendations. They introduce the regret gap concept, showing that under certain completeness assumptions, regret equivalence implies value equivalence, but not vice versa. The authors provide two algorithms, MALICE and BLADES, to minimize the regret gap under different assumptions regarding coverage and expert access.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a significant real-world problem in multi-agent coordination, particularly in applications like routing drivers.
2. It offers a comprehensive literature review and presents a logical flow, clearly contrasting value and regret gap approaches.
3. The algorithms are theoretically sound, providing bounds for regret gap optimization with detailed proofs.

Weaknesses:
1. The presentation could be improved; the use of "[proof]" in blue after many theorems appears sloppy.
2. The proposed algorithms may lack novelty, as they seem to be straightforward applications of existing methods.
3. Some assumptions, such as the realizability of the expert, are not clearly stated and may be overly restrictive.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation by refining the formatting of theorems and proofs to enhance clarity. Additionally, we suggest providing a more extensive summary of assumptions in the appendix to clarify their implications. It would be beneficial to discuss the challenges encountered when applying existing algorithms and to include empirical evaluations or experimental plans to assess the proposed algorithms' practical efficiency. Finally, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the practical applications of their methodology to make the work more accessible to a broader audience.
