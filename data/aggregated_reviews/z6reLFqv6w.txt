Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for detecting emergent quantities from time series data, particularly in complex systems like the brain. The authors propose a learning scheme that combines "minimum mutual information" with SMILE, a differentiable estimator for mutual information, to optimize the loss function efficiently. The approach is applied to two datasets: a synthetic example of random bit strings and real-world macaque brain activity data, successfully identifying emergent features in both cases.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The combination of existing methods into a differentiable architecture is original and promising.  
- The analysis is sound, with statistically significant results and clear definitions of individual quantities.  
- The paper is well-written, with a clear motivation and detailed methodology, making it accessible.  

Weaknesses:  
- The architecture and training procedure are not fully explained, particularly in Fig. 1, and there is no code available for reproduction.  
- The emergent feature identified in the macaque example lacks clarity, and the evidence presented in Fig. 4 is insufficient.  
- Limited benchmarking on diverse datasets, with only one synthetic and one real-world dataset, raises concerns about the method's generalizability.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the architecture and training procedure by providing detailed pseudo-code or sharing the code for reproduction. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify how Fig. 4 demonstrates the discovery of an emergent feature and explicitly state the prediction-only objective in Fig. 2. To strengthen the paper, we encourage the authors to conduct more extensive evaluations on a wider range of datasets, including standard examples with emergent behavior, such as Ising models, and to compare their method against existing baselines for discovering causally emergent representations.
