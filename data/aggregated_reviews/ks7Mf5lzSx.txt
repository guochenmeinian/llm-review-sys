Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for predicting the top-k riskiest locations for future urban events, such as traffic accidents and crimes, by framing it as a location ranking problem. The authors propose a model called SpatialRank, which optimizes a spatial version of the NDCG metric while incorporating spatiotemporal dependencies through adaptive graph convolutional layers. The model features a hybrid loss function that balances global and local ranking quality and employs an importance-sampling algorithm for spatial filtering. Experimental results demonstrate that SpatialRank outperforms several baseline methods across three real-world datasets. Additionally, the authors aim to improve predictive performance in crime and accident data analysis and plan to move the overall framework from supplementary material to the main manuscript for enhanced clarity. They provide statistical evidence, including average performance with standard deviation and results from a student t-test, to demonstrate that their improvements over baseline methods are statistically significant.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem addressed is significant for urban applications, and the use of NDCG optimization for location ranking is a novel approach.
- The proposed method shows improved performance compared to existing event prediction models and traditional NDCG optimization methods.
- The authors have committed to enhancing the clarity of the manuscript by relocating the overall framework to the main text.
- Statistical validation of improvements over baseline methods is provided, reinforcing the significance of their findings.
- The paper includes a reproducible description of methods and sufficient supplementary material for verification.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for urban event ranking is inadequately articulated, lacking examples to emphasize its importance over direct event prediction.
- The technical contributions are limited, with insufficient differentiation from existing methods and a lack of clarity on the dynamic adjacency matrix's training and purpose.
- The presentation of the paper requires significant improvement prior to publication, including unclear descriptions, grammar errors, and a lack of a framework figure to illustrate the model architecture.
- The improvements claimed by the authors are described as incremental, necessitating robust testing to substantiate their significance.
- Experimental results lack statistical significance tests and detailed ablation studies to validate the contributions of various components.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation section by providing clearer examples of the significance of ranking locations for future events. Additionally, the authors should clarify the differences between their model and existing methods, particularly regarding the dynamic adjacency matrix's training process and its intended function. To enhance the presentation, we suggest correcting grammar issues, providing a summary of symbols, and including a framework figure to illustrate the overall architecture. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors provide further justification for the significance of their method's improvements, possibly through more extensive testing or comparative analysis with additional baseline methods. Finally, conducting statistical significance tests and comprehensive ablation studies would strengthen the experimental validation of the proposed method.
