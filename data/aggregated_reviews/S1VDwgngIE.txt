### Key Points
This paper investigates online political discourse through a multidimensional ideological framework, analyzing over 8 million comments from Reddit between 2020 and 2022. The authors propose a model that dissects users' ideological dimensions into economic (left-right) and social (libertarian-authoritarian) axes, correlating these with demographic attributes. The study reveals significant homophily in social interactions along the social axis and demographic characteristics, while heterophily is observed along the economic axis. Additionally, the research highlights higher toxicity in heterophilic interactions, indicating a more conflictual discourse.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper presents a novel model for analyzing comments by disentangling users' ideological dimensions.  
- It utilizes a large dataset, enabling a comprehensive exploration of the political landscape on Reddit.  
- The findings provide valuable insights into the dynamics of homophily and heterophily in political discussions, addressing contradictions in existing literature.  

Weaknesses:  
- The focus on Reddit and US users may limit the generalizability of the findings to other social media platforms.  
- The reliance on self-declared political affiliations raises concerns about the accuracy of the data.  
- The sampling bias regarding the representativeness of Reddit users is significant, as it may not reflect the general population or even social media users.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the representativeness of the Reddit dataset and its implications for the findings. Additionally, the authors should address how the reliance on self-declared political affiliations might impact the conclusions drawn. Incorporating a discussion on how the findings relate to theories of deliberative discourse could enhance the manuscript's contribution, particularly regarding the dynamics of exposure to differing viewpoints on platforms like Reddit. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to explore the potential representation of conflictual interactions through controversiality or scores, and to discuss how the methodologies could be applied to other social media platforms.
