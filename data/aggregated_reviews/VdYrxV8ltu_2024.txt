### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the challenge of data scarcity in healthcare, specifically focusing on brain age prediction from 3D structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI). The authors propose the addition of an auxiliary objective to enhance model generalization in low-data settings while examining its impact on model specification. Utilizing a fully convolutional network (SFCN) and the UK Biobank dataset, the paper demonstrates that while auxiliary objectives improve generalization, they concurrently lead to reduced model specification. This work contributes to the discourse on balancing generalization and model specificity in healthcare AI.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper makes a significant contribution to generalization in low-data environments, demonstrating that auxiliary objectives can enhance model performance when training data is limited.
- It features a robust experimental design, employing the UK Biobank dataset with varied training sizes and validation methods, providing a thorough evaluation of model performance.
- The focus on brain age prediction from 3D sMRI data addresses a clinically relevant issue, potentially improving diagnostic tools in healthcare.

Weaknesses:
- A major weakness is the reduction in model specification due to the introduction of auxiliary objectives, leading to increased variability across random initializations and training folds, which could hinder clinical applicability.
- The statistical testing methodology raises concerns, particularly regarding the lack of discussion on the normality assumption for the paired t-test, which is crucial for the validity of p-values.
- The novelty of the approach is limited, as auxiliary tasks have been previously explored in other medical imaging contexts, reducing the methodological uniqueness of the contribution.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction to better articulate the problem statement and main claims of the paper. Additionally, we suggest providing further empirical evidence or theoretical justification for the variability in model specification caused by auxiliary tasks, and exploring more complex regularization techniques to mitigate this issue. The authors should also consider comparing their method against other auxiliary learning frameworks in medical imaging and discuss the generalizability of their approach to other neuroimaging tasks or medical imaging modalities. Lastly, we encourage the authors to check the normality assumption prior to using the paired t-test and consider employing a non-parametric test if necessary to ensure the reliability of their statistical significance claims.
