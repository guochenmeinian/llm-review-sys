Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework that utilizes a large language model (LLM) for human mobility tasks, including user identification, next location prediction, and arrival time prediction. The authors introduce a Point-wise Embedding Layer (PPEL) and a Visiting Intention Memory Network (VIMN) to process check-in data, along with a behavior prompt pool to enhance embeddings. The framework is evaluated on four real-world datasets, demonstrating superior performance over baseline methods across most metrics. Additionally, the authors propose a novel approach to next location prediction using reprogramming techniques, which allows their model to effectively handle variable-length sequences, unlike the baseline model Graph-Flashback that requires fixed-length inputs. The model's ability to understand the semantic information in check-in data leads to more accurate predictions and shows robustness across multiple datasets, with improved efficiency in memory and training time compared to conventional deep learning models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and organized, effectively illustrating the study's motivation and thoroughly reviewing related work.
2. The framework's novel approach of fine-tuning the LLM with semantic data is a significant contribution to human mobility tasks.
3. The innovative application of reprogramming techniques to LLMs for predicting human activity sequences is a noteworthy advancement.
4. The model demonstrates robustness and stability across various datasets, indicating its adaptability to different types of human activity data.
5. Experimental studies are comprehensive, with a well-presented hyperparameter analysis, showing superior performance while requiring less memory and computational time than other baseline models.

Weaknesses:
1. The robustness of the modules, particularly the human travel preference prompt (HTPP), is questionable, and the overall technical contribution appears limited.
2. There is no discussion regarding the choice of scoring function, which raises concerns about its impact on the results.
3. The novelty of PPEL and HTPP is lacking, and the paper treats each domain separately during top-k prompt selection, which may overlook meaningful semantic combinations.
4. The marginal performance gains relative to model size raise concerns about the justification for the larger model.
5. The comparison with baseline models like Graph-Flashback and DeepMove is questioned due to differing experimental settings and input requirements.
6. The paper lacks contextualization of performance metrics, making it difficult to evaluate claims of superiority.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the robustness of the HTPP module by providing clearer justifications for the choice of parameters, such as the domain count and the significance of the scoring function. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on the motivation behind the selected domains and prompt words, including any theoretical support. It would be beneficial to explore the combination of prompts across domains to capture more meaningful semantic information. Furthermore, we suggest addressing the clarity of Figure 1 and ensuring that all important details are included in the main body rather than relegated to appendices. The authors should also improve the clarity of their comparisons with baseline models by providing more contextual information regarding experimental settings. Addressing the concerns about marginal performance gains relative to model size more explicitly would strengthen their argument. Including all experimental content from the rebuttal in the final version would enhance credibility. Finally, we suggest that the authors unify the presentation of figures and ensure consistency in the order of elements to improve clarity.
