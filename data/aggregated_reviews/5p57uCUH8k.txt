Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CLODE, a method that employs Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODE) to address low-light image enhancement by reformulating the higher-order curve estimation problem. The authors demonstrate that CLODE outperforms existing unsupervised learning methods through comprehensive experiments across several benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-structured and easy to follow.
2. It is the first attempt to formulate the higher-order curve estimation problem as a NODE problem, which enhances user controllability during inference.
3. Comprehensive experiments indicate that the proposed method outperforms baseline methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the work is limited, with the technical contribution being incremental beyond the NODE formulation.
2. The details regarding user controllability are insufficient, including the number of volunteers and their exposure to ground truth images.
3. The relationship between the output image and the noise-free image is unclear, as iterations still yield noisy outputs.
4. The experimental setup lacks diversity, relying on a single dataset, which may not adequately showcase the proposed method's advantages.
5. Concerns arise regarding the manual selection of model iterations and the fairness of comparisons with previous methods, particularly regarding the use of multiple loss functions.
6. The effectiveness of the noise removal module is questioned due to noticeable noise residue in results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the user controllability design by providing detailed information about the experimental setup and participant involvement. Additionally, the authors should clarify the mechanism behind CLODE's performance, particularly regarding the noise removal module and its effectiveness. We also suggest including stronger supervised baselines for comparison and reporting perceptual metrics to enhance the evaluation of the proposed method. Finally, addressing the concerns about color casts and the manual iteration selection process will strengthen the paper's contributions.
