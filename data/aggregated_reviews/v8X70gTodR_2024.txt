Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the generalizability and stability of steering vectors (SVs) for controlling the behavior of large language models (LLMs). The authors demonstrate that steerability is highly variable across inputs and affected by spurious concepts, leading to poor generalization. They introduce a new metric, the steerability score, to measure steering effectiveness, revealing that steering is often unreliable, particularly in multiple-choice scenarios. The study employs various datasets and methodologies, including Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA), to evaluate SVs' performance both in-distribution and out-of-distribution.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses an important gap in the literature regarding the reliability and generalization of steering vectors, providing a comprehensive analysis that has not been thoroughly explored before.
2. The research is methodically sound, employing rigorous experimental design and a variety of datasets, which enhances the robustness of the findings.
3. The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it accessible to readers.

Weaknesses:
1. The focus on multiple-choice questions limits the applicability of findings to more practical open-ended scenarios, which are not analyzed.
2. There is a lack of empirical validation for several hypotheses, particularly regarding unsteerable behaviors, which could benefit from additional experimentation.
3. The abstract does not adequately capture the significance of the findings, particularly the notion that SVs are largely a "property of the dataset."

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by expanding the analysis beyond multiple-choice questions to include open-ended tasks, thereby enhancing the practical relevance of the findings. Additionally, we suggest providing empirical results to support the hypotheses regarding unsteerable behaviors, such as validating whether these behaviors are linearly represented. Furthermore, revising the abstract to better showcase the key findings and implications of the study would strengthen the paper's presentation. Lastly, consider conducting further experiments to explore the robustness of the introduced steerability metric and its generalization beyond binary settings.
