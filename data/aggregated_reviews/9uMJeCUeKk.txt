### Key Points
This paper presents a novel adversarial attack framework termed Ask, Attend, Attack (AAA) aimed at image-to-text models, specifically within a decision-based black-box attack context. The authors propose a three-stage process: (i) Ask, where attackers generate target texts that meet semantic criteria; (ii) Attend, which identifies critical image regions without accessing the encoder; and (iii) Attack, utilizing an evolutionary algorithm to target these regions effectively. The effectiveness of the AAA method is demonstrated through experiments on transformer-based and CNN+RNN-based models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors propose a novel decision-based black-box targeted attack approach.
2. The idea of reducing the search space is intriguing and well-executed.
3. The paper provides a clear description of the AAA framework stages, addressing semantic mismatch issues effectively.
4. Experimental results are promising, supported by an ablation study that highlights the contributions of individual components.

Weaknesses:
1. The technical contribution is limited, with many concepts borrowed from existing works, particularly the reliance on models like CLIP.
2. The writing quality requires improvement; for example, the title should be "An Effective Decision-Based Black-Box Targeted Attack for Image-to-Text Models," and there are unclear technical details.
3. The motivation for the attack scenario lacks clarity, and the practicality of the proposed solution raises concerns regarding the number of interactions required with the victim model.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and motivation behind the attack scenario, particularly the justification for the chosen example of political slogans and hate speech. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the writing quality throughout the paper, including revising the title and addressing any typographical errors. The authors should also provide a clearer explanation of the selection of the visual model as a surrogate and its implications on feature map consistency across different architectures. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore the generalization of the AAA framework to the more common l_{inf} attack domain and to clarify the choice of parameter values in their experiments.
