Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CoupleNet, a network designed to integrate protein sequence and structure information for enhanced protein representations. The authors propose constructing two distinct graphs to model sequential features and structural geometries, utilizing graph convolutions on nodes and edges simultaneously. They assert that CoupleNet addresses challenges in modeling local environments and capturing long-range dependencies, which are critical for tasks like Gene Ontology (GO) term prediction. The experimental results indicate that CoupleNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, such as GearNet, in various protein-related tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating informative embeddings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- CoupleNet effectively incorporates multiple levels of protein features, including residue identities and geometric representations, leading to rich and informative representations.
- The paper shows empirical improvements in GO term prediction and substantial enhancements over existing methods, validating the model's performance across a range of protein-related tasks.
- The authors provide detailed experimental results, including performance metrics across various protein classes and lengths, which enhance the understanding of their model's capabilities.
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with thorough discussions of related work.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the approach is limited, as it does not significantly differ from existing methods like GearNet, which also integrates sequence and structure information, and builds on prior work by Ingraham et al. and trRosetta.
- There is a lack of detailed analysis explaining why CoupleNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, making it difficult to understand the model's advantages.
- Some technical details, such as the complete message passing mechanism, remain unclear and vague, leading to concerns about the robustness of the claims made.
- The absence of code release limits reproducibility and transparency in the research.
- Ambiguous statements regarding information loss in the methodology and writing clarity issues, including typos, detract from the overall readability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by clearly articulating the limitations of existing sequence-structure approaches and how CoupleNet addresses these issues. Additionally, the authors should provide a more thorough analysis of the model's architecture and design choices to clarify the reasons behind its superior performance. Including specific examples of proteins where hierarchical dependencies are crucial for model performance would enhance the motivation of the paper. Furthermore, we suggest including a discussion on "complete message passing" and referencing recent works addressing over-smoothing to deepen the paper's analysis. Including results related to large protein sequence lengths in the main document and clarifying ambiguous statements regarding information loss in their methodology would also be beneficial. Lastly, addressing writing clarity and fixing typos throughout the manuscript is essential for improving overall readability, and we strongly encourage the authors to release the code to facilitate reproducibility and transparency in the research.
