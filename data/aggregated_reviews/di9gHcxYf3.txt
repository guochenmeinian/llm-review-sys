### Key Points
This paper presents the Bidirectional Multi-Task Cascaded Multimodal Fusion (BiMCF) approach for damage analysis using multimodal social media data. The authors identify three related tasks: informativeness, event classification, and severity, and propose a methodology that integrates visual and textual information in a cascaded structure. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method against state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting its ability to capture task-specific interdependencies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The bidirectional multimodal fusion effectively captures task-specific interdependencies and facilitates information sharing across subtasks.
- The approach is rigorously evaluated on the CrisisMMD benchmark, outperforming existing methods across multiple metrics.
- Clear visualizations illustrate how forward and backward propagation enhance feature selection and fusion.
- The adaptability of BiMCF to various backbone models (e.g., BERT, ViT, RoBERTa) showcases its flexibility.

Weaknesses:
- The source code is not provided, hindering reproducibility.
- The study relies solely on one dataset, limiting the generalizability of the findings.
- Some figures, particularly Figure 1 and Figure 2, lack clarity and rigor in representation.
- The introduction and abstract do not clearly articulate the motivation behind the work.
- Grammatical and spelling errors are present throughout the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and rigor of figures, particularly by ensuring consistent color coding in Figure 2 and addressing misalignments. Additionally, we suggest providing a detailed description of the dataset, including labels for each subtask. To enhance reproducibility, the authors should consider sharing the source code and conducting experiments on multiple datasets. Furthermore, we advise the authors to include necessary hyperparameters and analyze the impact of different subtask weights on model effectiveness. Lastly, we encourage the authors to revise the introduction and abstract to better convey the motivation for their research and to correct grammatical errors throughout the paper.
