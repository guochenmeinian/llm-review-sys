Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a model named Cell-Type Dynamical Systems (CTDS) designed to capture the electrical activity of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons in rat frontal orienting fields (FOF) and anterior dorsal striatum (ADS) during an auditory decision-making task. The authors propose that the CTDS model, which maintains sign constraints in its transition and emission matrices, outperforms standard latent dynamical systems (LDS) in predicting neural activity and behavioral choices. The model's efficacy is further demonstrated through in silico experiments with optogenetic stimulation, showcasing its potential for identifying cell types.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The experiments are well-designed and comprehensive, with results presented clearly.
- The CTDS model shows higher accuracy in predicting neural activity compared to standard LDS models, providing deeper insights into the functional roles of E and I neurons.
- The model effectively incorporates distinct excitatory and inhibitory latents, making it more biologically realistic.

Weaknesses:
- Interpretation of Figure 2D is unclear, particularly regarding the y-axis for eigenvalues.
- The absence of ADS, E latents in Figure 2E raises questions about the model's completeness.
- The model's performance is not consistently superior to simple LDS in several settings, such as Figures 2C and 3C.
- The nomenclature "cell-type dynamical systems" may oversell the model's capabilities, as it primarily addresses sign constraints rather than a broader range of cell-type properties.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Figure 2D by explicitly labeling the y-axis for eigenvalues. Additionally, the authors should consider including ADS, E latents in Figure 2E to provide a more comprehensive view of the model's performance. To enhance the evaluation, we suggest comparing the CTDS model against more complex nonlinear models and additional powerful baselines. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to discuss the limitations of their approach in capturing various functional properties of cell types, including morphology and intrinsic dynamics, and to clarify how these could be incorporated in future work. Lastly, we recommend revising the manuscript to ensure consistent notation in Equations 1 and 3 and using uniform hues for excitatory and inhibitory data in the figures.
