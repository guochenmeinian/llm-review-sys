Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a model named KEDGN designed to address the challenges of irregularly sampled medical time series data by leveraging textual medical knowledge and dynamic variable graphs. The authors demonstrate that KEDGN outperforms baseline models across various datasets, supported by comprehensive experiments that reveal learned correlations between variables.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation is solid, with sufficient evidence provided to demonstrate dynamic correlation patterns in time series data.
2. The paper is well-written, featuring clear figures and equations.
3. The proposed model shows strong performance across different experimental settings, with thorough analysis validating the effectiveness of each module.
4. Visualizations of variable correlations learned by the model align well with the paper's motivation.

Weaknesses:
1. The concept of learning dynamic graphs for variable relationships is common in the literature; the authors should cite related works and argue the novelty and effectiveness of their proposed modules.
2. Missing references and baselines for irregularly sampled time series classification should be addressed to enhance the experimental sections.
3. The parameter settings for baselines are not fair, as they do not account for dataset differences; a grid search for baseline parameters is necessary.
4. The choice of GCRNN is not well justified, and an ablation study of graph convolution and temporal modeling should be conducted.
5. Some claims about model performance appear to stem from design rather than learning, and the ablation study does not effectively identify the most impactful modules.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by citing relevant works on dynamic graphs and irregularly sampled time series classification. Additionally, please ensure a fair comparison of baseline parameter settings through grid search. Clarifying the justification for using GCRNN and conducting an ablation study on its components would strengthen the paper. Furthermore, we suggest providing a clearer explanation of the model's equations and their intuitions, especially for formulations (6), (7), (9), and the role of the activation function in equation (7). Lastly, a detailed discussion of the model's limitations and its applicability to other domains should be included.
