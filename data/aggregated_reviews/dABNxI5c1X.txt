### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for empathic resonance based on personalized narratives, comparing empathy similarity through three story components: main event, emotional reaction, and moral. The authors introduce a new dataset, "EmpathaticStories," containing 1500 stories with empathic similarity annotations, and propose two tasks: empathic similarity prediction and empathy reasoning. The main models employed include SBERT, BART (with fine-tuning), and GPT-3, ChatGPT (with few-shot learning). A user study evaluates the models for story retrieval, highlighting the framework's interdisciplinary approach that integrates social psychology.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The dataset is a valuable resource for future empathic analysis research.  
- The user study provides personalized evaluation of the model's ability to retrieve relatable stories.  
- The paper introduces novel concepts and methodologies, enhancing understanding of empathy in narratives.  

Weaknesses:  
- Summarizing stories before annotation may lead to loss of critical information.  
- Low agreement among annotators raises concerns about the aggregation and resolution of discrepancies.  
- The analysis for the empathy reasoning task lacks human evaluation and detailed analysis beyond automated metrics.  
- Structural issues exist, with some sections appearing as standalone studies, which confuses the core message.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the contributions by including a dedicated paragraph in the introduction. Additionally, addressing the aggregation of annotations and the resolution of disagreements among annotators is crucial. To enhance the narrative, consider integrating section 6 into earlier sections and moving section 7 to a more logical position within the paper. Finally, we suggest providing a more in-depth discussion of the model's results and their significance, particularly in relation to real-world applications of empathic similarity detection.
