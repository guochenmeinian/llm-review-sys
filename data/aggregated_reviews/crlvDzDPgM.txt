Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel subgraph-based approach for predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) through a framework called Customized Subgraph Selection and Encoding for Drug-Drug Interaction prediction (CSSE-DDI). The authors leverage neural architecture search (NAS) to refine subgraph selection and encoding processes, introducing a relaxation mechanism for efficient exploration of the subgraph space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CSSE-DDI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with results that are interpretable and relevant to pharmacokinetics and metabolism.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The problem and method are well-motivated and supported by extensive experimental results, demonstrating solid performance.
2. The customization of subgraph selection and encoding is a strong innovation that distinguishes this work from existing approaches.
3. The manuscript is well-structured and clearly written, enhancing comprehension.
4. CSSE-DDI shows superior performance on recognized benchmarks, indicating practical effectiveness and interpretability in drug interactions.

Weaknesses:
1. The supernet training phase lacks an illustrative diagram to clarify the process for readers.
2. The motivation for focusing specifically on DDI prediction is not clearly articulated.
3. The effectiveness of the implicit encoding sampling method in terms of time efficiency and accuracy is insufficiently evidenced.
4. There is no comparison of time overhead between the NAS method and baseline methods, which is crucial for evaluating performance.
5. The paper does not adequately compare with the latest baselines, limiting the demonstration of performance advantages.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the supernet training phase by including an illustrative diagram. Additionally, the authors should provide a clearer rationale for the specific focus on DDI prediction. To strengthen the paper, we suggest including a comparison of time overhead between their NAS method and baseline methods, as well as more comprehensive baseline comparisons, including a greater variety of experimental settings and datasets. Furthermore, the authors should provide evidence for the effectiveness of their implicit encoding sampling method in terms of time efficiency and accuracy.
