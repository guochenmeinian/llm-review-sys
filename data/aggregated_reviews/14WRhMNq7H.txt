### Key Points
This paper presents MolCA, a framework designed to enhance language models' understanding of 2D molecular structures by translating 2D graph representations into 1D soft prompts for text processing. The authors employ a graph encoder and a cross-modal projector, specifically using Q-Former, to facilitate cross-modal alignment. The empirical results demonstrate MolCA's effectiveness in tasks such as molecule captioning and molecule-text retrieval, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is clearly written and logically structured, making it easy to follow.  
- The proposed framework is novel, showing great potential for improving LLMs' capabilities in molecular modeling.  
- Comprehensive experiments are conducted on both large and lightweight language models, enhancing the contribution of the work.  
- The integration of a uni-modal adapter for efficient adaptation to downstream tasks is a notable feature.  

Weaknesses:  
- The authors do not disclose the computational cost associated with training the Galactica models using MolCA, which limits understanding of the trade-offs involved.  
- Experimental results are primarily reported for MolT5 in 1D modeling and MolCA + Galac in 1D+2D modeling, complicating direct comparisons.  
- There is a lack of in-depth analysis regarding the Q-former's ability to attend to the graph structure in relation to textual input.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the transparency of the computational costs involved in training the Galactica models with MolCA's pipeline. Additionally, providing results for MolT5 + MolCA and Galac with 1D SMILES only would facilitate better comparisons. To enhance the Q-former's effectiveness, we suggest exploring additional tasks beyond molecular captioning to better align the representations of 2D molecular structures with text representation space. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include the additional experiments and clarifications mentioned during the rebuttal in the final version of the paper.
