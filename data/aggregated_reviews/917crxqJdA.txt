Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a methodology for distribution-free confidence intervals for various statistical dispersion measures, particularly relevant for evaluating fairness in machine learning algorithms. The authors extend existing literature by providing theoretical foundations for bounding functions on the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and introducing a numerical optimization technique that yields tighter bounds than previous methods. Empirical validation demonstrates the effectiveness of these tighter bounds in practical applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant gap in the literature regarding bounding functions of observed loss beyond traditional measures, particularly in fairness evaluations.
- The proposed numerical optimization algorithm shows promise, and the empirical evaluation provides valuable insights.
- The methodology has broad applicability across machine learning systems and data distributions, enhancing its potential impact.

Weaknesses:
- The significance of the contribution is somewhat unclear, as the technical results may not be particularly novel, and the bounds achieved are comparable to existing methods.
- The paper's structure lacks focus, with excessive technical content relegated to the appendix, making it dense and challenging to follow.
- The writing quality needs improvement, particularly in Section 4, which lacks clarity and coherence.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and focus of the paper by narrowing the scope to a select few measures and providing intuitive explanations of how the novel results apply. The remaining measures could be included in the appendix. Additionally, a more extensive discussion on the numerical optimization method would enhance clarity. We suggest that the authors explicitly state the desired properties of their algorithm earlier in the manuscript and consider including pseudocode to clarify the steps involved in computing the bounds. Simplifying notation and reducing technical minutiae will also help make the paper more accessible to a broader audience. Finally, addressing the connection to existing literature on confidence bands for CDFs, such as the Berk-Jones statistic, would strengthen the paper's foundation.
