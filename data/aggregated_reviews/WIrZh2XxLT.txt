Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an approach to multi-task reinforcement learning (RL) called Contrastive Modules with Temporal Attention (CMTA), aimed at mitigating negative transfer between tasks. The method incorporates two main components: contrastive learning to ensure distinct outputs from shared modules and temporal attention to dynamically combine these outputs. Evaluations on the Meta-World benchmark demonstrate that CMTA outperforms various baselines, including single-task RL.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for using modular learning with temporal attention to address negative transfer is clearly articulated.
- The paper is well-written, with relevant references and a coherent narrative.
- The proposed method outperforms single-task RL in Meta-World, showcasing its effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- Experimental results do not convincingly support claims of improved generalization.
- Some prior works also utilize varying modules over time, which raises questions about novelty.
- Certain experimental results lack clarity, particularly regarding the performance of baselines and the impact of different settings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of experimental results, particularly addressing discrepancies in performance across different benchmarks. Additionally, we suggest including a section summarizing the relationship between skill-based RL and the concept of negative transfer within tasks. The authors should also consider providing more detailed ablation studies on the impact of the number of experts and the history length in the temporal attention mechanism. Lastly, visualizations of attention weights for different tasks would enhance understanding of the proposed method.
