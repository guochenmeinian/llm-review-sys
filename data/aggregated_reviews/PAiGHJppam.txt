Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical analysis of simple convex bilevel problems, demonstrating the challenges in obtaining absolute optimal solutions with first-order zero-respecting algorithms. The authors propose a novel framework based on functionally constrained reformulation, leading to near-optimal algorithms for both smooth and non-smooth settings. The work also establishes iteration complexity lower bounds for these algorithms, achieving results close to the theoretical limits.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper effectively illustrates the difficulties in achieving absolute optimal solutions for simple convex bilevel problems.
2. It provides lower bounds for first-order methods, specifically $\Omega(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ and $\Omega(1/\epsilon^{2})$ for smooth and non-smooth cases, respectively.
3. The proposed algorithms align with these lower bounds, excluding logarithmic factors.

Weaknesses:
1. Several lemmas are quoted from existing literature, with some discrepancies noted, such as Lemmas 5.4 and 5.5, which lack proofs.
2. The focus is solely on unconstrained cases, neglecting the constrained scenarios addressed in other studies.
3. The numerical experiments do not account for the time taken to find initial values $u$ and $l$, leading to potentially unfair comparisons.
4. The accuracy level of $10^{-2}$ in the experiments is insufficient; a target of less than $10^{-6}$ is recommended for better performance insights.
5. The algorithm's requirement for a predetermined $T$ is a limitation not present in similar studies.
6. The novelty is questioned, as the core ideas appear to extend from previous works, with many technical proofs being similar to those in [2] and [3].

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and originality of the lemmas by providing proofs for those not identical to original works. Additionally, consider expanding the scope to include constrained cases, as this is a significant aspect of bilevel optimization. In the numerical experiments, it is crucial to include the time for finding initial values $u$ and $l$ to ensure fair comparisons. We suggest adjusting the desired accuracy in experiments to below $10^{-6}$ to better evaluate algorithm performance. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to eliminate the requirement for a predetermined $T$ in their algorithm and to clarify the novelty of their contributions relative to existing literature.
