Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a self-supervised learning approach for medical image segmentation that utilizes keypoint identification to enhance long-range spatial dependencies. The authors propose a keypoint-augmented fusion (KAF) layer integrated into the UNet architecture, where keypoints are identified using SIFT and processed through a Vision Transformer for self-attention. The resulting features are employed for contrastive training, enabling both global representation learning and local similarity learning. The method is evaluated on two cardiac image datasets, demonstrating improved segmentation performance compared to existing pre-training approaches. Additionally, the authors focus on integrating transformer-based architectures and self-supervised learning techniques, conducting further experiments that validate their methods and show improved performance and generalization to multi-organ non-MRI datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The incorporation of keypoints for similarity learning is novel and contributes significantly to the self-supervised medical image segmentation literature.
- The paper is well-written, with a detailed experimental setup and effective use of cross-validation for performance metrics.
- The proposed method outperforms several pre-training approaches on benchmark datasets, particularly in scenarios with limited annotations.
- The authors acknowledge and plan to incorporate important related literature, enhancing the manuscript's depth.
- Additional experiments have been conducted, showing improved segmentation performance and generalization capabilities.
- The authors express a willingness to engage with other researchers for potential collaborations on method comparisons.

Weaknesses:
- The literature review lacks references to several relevant works on self-supervised medical image segmentation, which could enhance the context and impact of the contributions.
- The initial literature review was perceived as incomplete, potentially limiting the paper's impact.
- The reported performance of the GLCL baseline is significantly lower than that in the original paper, necessitating clarification.
- There is a lack of direct comparison with traditional 3D keypoint segmentation methods, which may affect the comprehensiveness of the study.
- The computational requirements of the proposed architectural changes are not discussed, and there is limited dataset variety in the evaluations.
- The method's reliance on 2D keypoint matching raises questions about its applicability to 3D anatomical structures.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by including key works such as those by Taher et al., Yan et al., and Zheng et al., among others, to provide a more comprehensive context for their contributions. Additionally, the authors should clarify the discrepancies in GLCL performance reported in Table 1 and discuss the potential computational implications of their architectural modifications. Expanding the evaluation to include diverse datasets, particularly those involving pathological segmentation, would strengthen the results. We also suggest that the authors reach out to the authors of the keypoint segmentation methods for potential re-implementation and comparison, which could further enhance their findings. Finally, addressing the limitations related to 3D keypoint matching and providing more details on the training setup, including thresholds and hyperparameters, would enhance reproducibility.
