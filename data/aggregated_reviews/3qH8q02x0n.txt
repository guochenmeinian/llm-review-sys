Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents IndicVoices-R (IV-R), a large-scale multilingual TTS dataset comprising 1,704 hours of high-fidelity speech-text data from 10,964 speakers across 22 Indian languages. The authors enhance an existing ASR dataset, IndicVoices, using various denoising and speech enhancement techniques, and provide metrics such as C50, SNR, and N-MOS to evaluate the dataset's quality. The work demonstrates improved zero-shot speaker generalization when fine-tuning an English pre-trained model on a combined dataset of IndicTTS and IV-R.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- IV-R is the largest TTS dataset for Indian languages, encompassing all 22 scheduled languages.
- The authors applied advanced techniques for denoising and speech enhancement, improving dataset quality.
- The introduction of the IV-R Benchmark facilitates evaluation of TTS models across different speaker generalization settings.

Weaknesses:
- The empirical comparison with existing datasets is limited, primarily reporting aggregated results without per-language analysis.
- The novelty of the proposed TTS methods is questioned, as they appear to be existing techniques fine-tuned on new data.
- The reliance on subjective metrics like N-MOS may not fully capture TTS performance aspects such as prosody and naturalness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical comparison by presenting results per language to better illustrate the dataset's capabilities. Additionally, including experiments on the VoiceCraft using original IndicVoices data could provide insights into the restoration pipeline's effects on TTS model performance. The authors should also consider addressing the exclusion of 8kHz recordings and explore advancements in enhancement techniques that could utilize such data. Lastly, we suggest enhancing the clarity of the paper and improving documentation to ensure comprehensive understanding and accessibility.
