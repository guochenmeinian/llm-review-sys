Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of proportional fairness in non-centroid clustering, focusing on two fairness criteria: the core and fully justified representation (FJR). The authors claim to be the first to explore these concepts in a non-centroid context, analyzing various loss functions, including arbitrary, average, and maximum loss. They demonstrate that for arbitrary loss, no finite approximation of the core exists, while for average and maximum loss, they provide algorithms achieving \(O(n/k)\)-core and 2-core, respectively. Additionally, they propose a GreedyCapture algorithm that achieves constant approximations for FJR and an auditing algorithm for estimating FJR approximations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
2. It extends the study of proportional fairness to non-centroid clustering, which is both reasonable and interesting.
3. The algorithms proposed achieve good approximation factors for FJR, with practical evaluations showing the GreedyCapture algorithm performs well against traditional clustering methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The proposed algorithms are slight adaptations of existing centroid clustering algorithms, lacking significant novelty.
2. The practical background for non-centroid clustering under proportional fairness is unclear, and comparisons with \(k\)-means++ and k-medoids are deemed unfair since these methods do not satisfy proportional fairness.
3. The running time of the algorithms is not compared in experiments, and the datasets used are relatively small.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their algorithms by exploring unique approaches that leverage characteristics specific to the non-centroid setting. Additionally, clarifying the practical implications of non-centroid clustering under proportional fairness would enhance the paper's relevance. It would also be beneficial to compare the running times of the proposed algorithms in experiments and to test on larger datasets to demonstrate scalability. Finally, we suggest restating the theorems in the appendix for better readability and addressing the technical novelties of the proposed methods more explicitly.
