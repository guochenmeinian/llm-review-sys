Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical analysis of query complexity in black-box adversarial optimization, focusing on Nash Equilibrium (NE) as the solution concept. The authors prove a no-free-lunch theorem indicating that all algorithms achieve the same average performance across problem instances with a unique NE in two-player zero-sum games. They derive lower bounds for query complexity in general black-box adversarial optimization and two-player zero-sum bimatrix games, emphasizing the implications of solution concept selection.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper demonstrates a high level of theoretical rigor in proving an NFL theorem for general black-box adversarial optimization, particularly regarding NE.  
2. The theoretical results are comprehensive, covering various adversarial optimization scenarios and providing insights into the limitations of black-box algorithms.

Weaknesses:  
1. The paper assumes a unique PSNE, which may not hold in machine learning contexts, such as when $X$ represents over-parameterized neural networks.  
2. Notations and definitions are unclear in some areas, making the text difficult to read. For instance, the construction of $b_1$ and $b_2$ is not adequately explained.  
3. The analysis is limited to finite problems, which may restrict the applicability of the results.  
4. There is a lack of empirical validation or practical demonstrations of the proposed concepts, which could enhance the credibility of the theoretical findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of notations and definitions throughout the paper to enhance readability. Specifically, they should provide clearer explanations for terms like "extension" and "restriction" earlier in the text. Additionally, we suggest that the authors consider discussing the implications of their theoretical results in broader contexts beyond two-player zero-sum games, potentially incorporating empirical validation to support their findings. Finally, addressing the unique PSNE assumption and exploring its implications in machine learning scenarios would strengthen the paper's relevance.
