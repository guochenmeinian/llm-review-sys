### Key Points
This paper presents a new method to accelerate the computation of the word mover's distance (WMD) using the L1 embedding method and tree-based Wasserstein approximation. The authors propose that their method achieves a significant speedup in inference while maintaining comparable performance to the vanilla Wasserstein distance, as demonstrated through kNN classification results on four datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for improving WMD computation is clear and relevant to many NLP applications.
- The method is supported by detailed mathematical derivations and analysis.
- Experimental results indicate significant improvements in inference speed across multiple datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The datasets used for evaluation are small, with the largest containing only 8k documents, raising concerns about scalability to larger datasets.
- WMD may not accurately reflect document similarity due to its disregard for word order and syntactic structure, potentially limiting the utility of improved computation efficiency.
- The paper lacks comparisons with other strong TWD baselines and does not address the potential superiority of sentence embedding-based searches over optimal transport-based methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including larger datasets to assess scalability. Additionally, incorporating comparisons with other TWD variants and non-WMD baselines would strengthen the paper's impact. Clarifying the applicability of FAISS-based tree Wasserstein acceleration to unbalanced optimal transport document distances and exploring the transferability of weights across datasets would also enhance the study. Finally, addressing the potential limitations of WMD in capturing document similarity could provide a more balanced perspective on the method's applicability.
