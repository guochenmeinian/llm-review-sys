### Key Points
This paper presents a method that integrates planning into visual storytelling through the use of question-answer pairs, termed blueprints. The authors utilize a frozen image encoder to process visual inputs, which are then combined with blueprints to generate coherent narratives using a pre-trained BART model. The proposed approach includes both top-down and iterative planning methods. Experimental results indicate that the method outperforms some existing studies, and human evaluations support the effectiveness of the generated blueprints.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a plan-based approach for visual storytelling is novel and well-articulated.
- The results from both automatic and human evaluations are strong and well-discussed.
- The paper is clearly written and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The impact of the generated blueprints appears marginal, as indicated by the small performance gap between models with and without blueprints.
- The manuscript lacks comparisons with significant prior studies, which could strengthen the findings.
- Concerns about potential data leakage in blueprint generation due to the reliance on stories for generating QA pairs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the robustness of the generated blueprints by implementing techniques to reduce noise. Additionally, the authors should include comparisons with pioneering studies [1,2] to enhance the credibility of their results. It is crucial to address the potential data leakage issue by clarifying the blueprint generation process and ensuring that it does not simply replicate the stories. Furthermore, we suggest providing more detailed analysis on the quality of question generation and answer extraction, as well as including the RoVIST-VG metric in the results section. Lastly, a discussion on how the proposed architecture can handle temporal misalignment in visual inputs would be beneficial.
