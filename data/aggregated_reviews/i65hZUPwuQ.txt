### Key Points
This paper presents a position on the harms of anthropomorphism in dialogue systems, examining linguistic and psychological factors that contribute to this phenomenon. The authors provide an organized collection of features, consequences, and recommendations for addressing anthropomorphism, emphasizing the cognitive factors that promote it and the negative consequences that may arise. The paper aims to unify existing research and guide future actions to mitigate anthropomorphic harms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and effectively organizes diverse research findings into a coherent narrative.
- It highlights insightful points, such as the multifaceted nature of anthropomorphism and the role of linguistic factors.
- The recommendations for AI researchers to avoid anthropomorphic language and reframe narratives are valuable contributions.

Weaknesses:
- The discussion on anthropomorphism is not entirely novel, as the harms have been previously addressed.
- Some recommendations may be perceived as unrealistic, such as avoiding first-person pronouns.
- The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the contributors to anthropomorphism to strengthen its recommendations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of definitions regarding "designers," "developers," and "practitioners" to better target their recommendations. Additionally, we suggest that the authors expand the section on "Responses to Direct Questions" to include a broader range of question types. It would also be beneficial to contextualize the recommendation to "forego embedding humanlike personality traits" by discussing potential exceptions where such traits may be advantageous, such as in systems designed for loneliness or education. Finally, addressing the concerns about the realism of their recommendations could enhance the paper's persuasiveness.
