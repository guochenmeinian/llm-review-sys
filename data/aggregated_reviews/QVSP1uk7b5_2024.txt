Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for 3D mesh generation from text, enhancing the DMTet framework by splatting multiple tetrahedra to improve gradient propagation. The authors propose using TeT Splatting instead of 3D Gaussians, addressing limitations in mesh extraction speed and quality. Qualitative results indicate competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods, although quantitative evaluations are limited.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is interesting and effectively addresses gradient propagation issues by splatting multiple tetrahedra.
- Qualitative evaluations demonstrate good performance and mesh quality, particularly in text-to-3D generation.
- The approach provides a solution to known limitations in 3D generative methods, facilitating real-time rendering and precise mesh extraction.

Weaknesses:
- Explanations in the experiments section are insufficient, particularly regarding the generation process and the number of tetrahedra used.
- The lack of quantitative comparisons and reliance on qualitative results may not convincingly demonstrate the method's advantages.
- The absence of videos for 3D consistency assessment limits the evaluation of output quality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanations in the experiments section to clarify the generation process and the number of tetrahedra used. Additionally, incorporating quantitative evaluations alongside qualitative results would strengthen the claims regarding the proposed method's performance. Providing videos of generated results would enhance the assessment of 3D consistency. Lastly, addressing the initialization of the tetrahedral grid and refining the presentation of qualitative results could further improve clarity and impact.
