Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for estimating full-body human poses from egocentric head-mounted display (HMD) data, utilizing head tracking signals and sparse hand pose signals from video. The algorithm, DSPoser, operates in two stages: temporal completion, which employs an encoder-decoder to generate Gaussian distributions of hand pose states, and spatial completion, which derives full-body poses from hand trajectories and head tracking signals. The authors clarify their evaluation method, which follows the BoDiffusion protocol with a sliding step of 20, contrasting it with AvatarPoser and AvatarJLM's 1-step sliding window. The method is evaluated on the Ego-Exo4D and AMASS datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Additional experiments are provided to ensure fair comparisons under real-time inference conditions, showcasing the efficacy of their method across various metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The quantitative results are excellent, particularly for doubly sparse data, as evidenced by Tables 1 and 2.
- The paper is clearly written and well-organized, making it easy to follow.
- Limitations are thoroughly explained.
- The ablation study on aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties is intriguing.
- The authors effectively clarify their methodology and provide a comprehensive evaluation of their approach against established baselines.
- The introduction of a multi-stage framework to handle sparse video data is a significant contribution.
- Additional experiments enhance the robustness of their findings.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the "newly introduced task" is somewhat limited, as both motion imputation and pose completion are well-explored areas.
- The contribution of the proposed hand trajectory imputation method (Uncertainty-aware MAE) is unclear, as it only demonstrates superiority over linear interpolation for the doubly sparse task.
- The evaluations in Tables 1 and 2 could be better structured for fair comparisons, and runtime performance analysis is missing.
- The paper lacks qualitative comparisons and video visualizations of results, which are crucial for assessing the method's effectiveness.
- The multiple sampling approach, while effective, is seen as a common technique in signal processing and may not be viewed as a novel contribution.
- There is a need for a more thorough comparison with existing methods and a clearer description of the sliding window setup.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty aspect by clearly articulating the unique contributions of their work compared to existing methods. Additionally, we suggest providing a more structured evaluation in Tables 1 and 2, grouping methods by input data type for fair comparisons. Including runtime performance metrics and qualitative comparisons, such as video visualizations, would strengthen the paper. Furthermore, clarifying the use of diffusion models and addressing the sliding window size for real-time applications would enhance the overall robustness of the evaluation. Lastly, consider emphasizing the specific application of the multiple sampling approach within the context of your framework to address its perception as a common technique.
