### Key Points
This paper presents a culturally-aware commonsense inference model, GD-COMET, which is trained on geo-diverse data from the CANDLE dataset and further fine-tuned on the ATOMIC dataset. The authors demonstrate that GD-COMET generates culturally aligned inference statements and enhances performance on a visual commonsense reasoning task by integrating GD-COMET outputs into a VLC-BERT model. The evaluation includes both human assessments and extrinsic tasks, showing improvements over existing models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses the significant issue of cultural specificity in commonsense knowledge, proposing a straightforward solution by pretraining on geo-diverse statements.  
- The clarity of the problem statement and method description is commendable.  
- The evaluation is comprehensive, utilizing human assessments and multimodal tasks, which strengthens the findings.  

Weaknesses:  
- The analysis of how pretraining on CANDLE contributes to geo-diverse inference is insufficient.  
- The intrinsic evaluation lacks baseline comparisons, making it difficult to assess GD-COMET's improvements.  
- The extrinsic evaluation raises concerns about the consistency of signals used across different models.  
- There is no explanation for performance discrepancies across cultures in evaluations.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the impact of pretraining on CANDLE, providing insights into how it enhances cultural awareness. Additionally, the authors should include baseline comparisons in the intrinsic evaluation to substantiate claims of improvement. Clarifying whether the same signals were used for all models in the extrinsic evaluation is essential. Furthermore, evaluating GD-COMET on more datasets would strengthen the findings. Lastly, we suggest providing examples of inference statements and elaborating on the scoring of "culture relevance" in Section 4 for better clarity.
