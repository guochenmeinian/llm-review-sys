Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a learning-based method for event-to-point cloud registration, introducing the Event-Points-to-Tensor (EP2T) network that encodes event data into grid-shaped feature tensors. The authors propose a framework for constructing E2P datasets using existing SLAM datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on MVSEC-E2P and VECtor-E2P datasets. The method demonstrates effectiveness in various tasks, including optical flow estimation and image reconstruction, while addressing the novel problem of utilizing event camera data for 2D-3D registration.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a novel problem and adapts existing registration pipelines to the specifics of event data.
- The proposed EP2T network effectively extracts spatiotemporal features, utilizing operations like Local Aggregation (LA) and Spatio-temporal Separated Attention (STA).
- The presentation is clear and well-structured, with convincing experimental results demonstrating superior performance over previous methods.

Weaknesses:
- Clarity can be improved, particularly in the method section, where details about feature construction and the E2Pnet architecture are lacking.
- The efficiency analysis regarding runtime and memory usage compared to other state-of-the-art methods is missing.
- The paper does not adequately discuss the limitations or failure cases of the proposed approach, especially in complex environments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method section by providing detailed descriptions of how features Ft, Fs, and Fst are constructed, including the architecture and input specifics. Additionally, please clarify the event sampling strategy and the rationale behind the choice of N = 8192. We suggest including a thorough efficiency analysis comparing runtime and memory usage with other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, discussing the limitations of the approach and its performance in more complex environments would enhance the paper's robustness. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide additional targeted experiments to validate the proposed intuitive advantages of the EP2T network.
