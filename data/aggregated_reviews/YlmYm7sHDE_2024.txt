Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a lossy compression framework utilizing logarithmic loss, specifically designed to manage scenarios where the reconstruction distribution diverges from the source distribution. The authors propose the Minimum Entropy Coupling with Bottleneck (MEC-B) framework and introduce two decomposition strategies: fixing either the encoder (MEC) or the decoder (EBIM). The submission formulates the entropy-bounded information maximization problem and provides a greedy algorithm with performance guarantees. Theoretical results are supported by empirical evaluations in a Markov game setting with communication bottlenecks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well-structured and presents a novel framework with strong theoretical contributions, particularly the greedy algorithm for the EBIM problem. The empirical evaluation demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness compared to a quantization baseline.

Weaknesses:  
A significant weakness is the lack of evaluation on tasks with clear real-world applications, as the Markov Coding Game setting appears removed from practical impact. Additionally, the full MEC-B problem remains unsolved, and the approach is limited to discrete alphabet settings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of statements regarding normalization in the context of transferring probability mass, ensuring that the implications of normalization are explicitly stated. The authors should also discuss the necessity of the output distribution constraint more concretely in the text. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors elaborate on how their EBIM algorithm could contribute to robust watermarking approaches and provide more empirical evidence for high-impact applications, particularly in lossy compression scenarios.
