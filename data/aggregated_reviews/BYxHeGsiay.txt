### Key Points
This paper empirically evaluates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in generating electronic designs from high-level textual descriptions. The authors propose two benchmarks: PINS 100, which assesses the generation of electronic component specifications, and MICRO 25, which evaluates the design of microcontroller circuits. The performance of models such as GPT-4 and Claude-V1 is analyzed, achieving pass@1 scores of up to 94%. The paper includes six case studies demonstrating real-world applications of LLMs in electronic design and presents a novel approach within the NLP domain, supported by strong empirical results. Reviewers generally found the work to support its major claims, although some minor points required additional support. Concerns were raised regarding the evaluation methods and the paper's differentiation from existing work in code design for electronic circuits.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of novel benchmarks (PINS 100 and MICRO 25) provides standardized evaluation metrics for LLMs in electronic design.
- Empirical results show strong performance by models like GPT-4, indicating potential in this application area.
- The framework and evaluation metrics are well-defined and thorough, contributing valuable insights to the NLP community.
- The inclusion of six case studies validates the paper's claims and demonstrates practical applications.
- The authors are committed to releasing code, benchmarks, and experimental results, enhancing reproducibility.
- A comprehensive analysis acknowledges both the advantages and limitations of LLMs in this context.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation lacks depth, with superficial insights into failure or success cases, particularly in experiments 1 and 2.
- The high performance of models raises concerns about the benchmarks' challenge level and representativeness.
- The paper does not adequately distinguish its contributions from existing literature on code generation for electronic circuits.
- Human intervention is frequently required, complicating reproducibility and raising questions about the end-to-end automation potential.
- Concerns regarding the evaluation's depth and clarity were noted, with some reviewers finding it superficial.
- The potential for end-to-end automation and scalability appears limited, and comparisons with other approaches were lacking.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation depth by providing more detailed insights into failure cases and the relationship between outputs in experiments. Clarifying the sequential nature of tasks in experiment 2 and the relation between device descriptions in Figure 4 and Appendix B4 would enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest separating issues related to formal output syntax from overall accuracy calculations.

To improve clarity, consider reducing the number of images and providing more textual explanations of specifications, particularly for readers without a background in electronics. Merging figures that illustrate the generation task could also enhance comprehension. Furthermore, please ensure that all references to appendix sections are specific and consistent, and correct typographical errors throughout the paper.

We also recommend that the authors improve the differentiation of their work from existing literature on code design for electronic circuits by including relevant papers to better situate their research. Additionally, providing a more comprehensive analysis of the evaluation metrics and clarifying the role of human expertise in the evaluation process would strengthen the paper. Addressing the concerns regarding the appropriateness of the pass@k metric and exploring the necessity of LLMs for the task would further enhance the work. Lastly, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the implications of their results for NLP tasks and language model capabilities.
