### Key Points
This paper presents a critical survey of sentiment analysis (SA) literature, highlighting conceptual and measurement issues within the field. The authors demonstrate conflicts in definitions of sentiment across NLP and social science, revealing that many studies lack clear frameworks and definitions. They identify biases in existing SA models and summarize key weaknesses, such as subjective interpretation and lack of nuance. The authors propose four recommendations and ten questions to guide practitioners in developing theoretically grounded and robust SA artifacts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is confidently written and effectively highlights significant issues in the conceptualization and execution of sentiment analysis.
- It provides valuable guidance for practitioners, particularly regarding the impact of use cases and cultural variations in sentiment interpretation.
- The structure and readability of the paper facilitate evaluation and critique.

Weaknesses:
- The definition of "framework" is overly broad and lacks clarity, particularly in distinguishing between sentiment definitions and sentiment frameworks.
- Differences between technical frameworks for sentiment analysis are not well distinguished, leading to potential confusion.
- The limitations section is superficial and does not adequately engage with the areas the work fails to encompass.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definition of "framework" by distinguishing between sentiment definitions and the measurement modeling framework. Additionally, the authors should expand on why adopting a sentiment framework in new domains "may not suffice," providing concrete examples. We suggest enhancing the limitations section to engage more deeply with the study's shortcomings and preconceptions. Furthermore, including a discussion on language coverage and related concepts, as well as a visual aid to clarify the relationships between terminologies, would strengthen the paper. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide a sample-filled example of the ethics sheet to illustrate its practical implementation.
