Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a constraint-based algorithm for context-specific causal discovery that accommodates endogenous context variables. The authors propose a modified version of the PC algorithm, which performs conditional independence tests (CIT) on either pooled or context-specific data, depending on the scenario. The theoretical results are backed by extensive empirical studies, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses the important issue of endogenous context variables in causal discovery.
- Theoretical guarantees for the proposed method are provided.
- Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of the approach.

Weaknesses:
- The paper suffers from clarity issues, with numerous definitions and notations introduced without adequate explanation.
- The assumption that context variables are known and observed may not hold in real-world applications, where context variables could be latent.
- The organization of the paper complicates comprehension, as many graphical definitions lack examples or figures.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of definitions and notations throughout the paper, ensuring that terms are defined before use. Consider summarizing extensive definitions in an appendix for easier reference. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a running graphical example to illustrate the concepts discussed. It would also be beneficial to elaborate on the statistical procedure for context-specific independence testing and clarify the implications of the assumption of causal sufficiency, particularly regarding hidden variables. Finally, ensure that all notation is consistent and clearly defined in the main text to facilitate reader understanding.
