### Key Points
This paper presents PRESTO, a large multilingual dataset of over 550k annotated conversations between humans and virtual assistants, encompassing six languages and various linguistic phenomena such as disfluencies, code-switching, and user revisions. The dataset is designed to reflect real-world interactions and includes structured context information. Preliminary experiments with fine-tuned multilingual T5 models demonstrate that these models can effectively handle the dataset's complexities when trained on sufficient examples.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The dataset addresses linguistic phenomena often overlooked in existing resources, enhancing its relevance for research.  
- The design is informed by practical experiences in developing language understanding systems, providing valuable insights for the research community.  
- The paper is well-written, and the experiments yield meaningful insights into the challenges of natural language understanding.

Weaknesses:  
- The baseline model used for experiments is considered weak, as it relies solely on fine-tuning the mT5 model without comparisons to other state-of-the-art models.  
- Some aspects of the dataset's construction and evaluation methods lack clarity, potentially affecting reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion in Section 4.3 regarding the influence of disfluencies. Additionally, it would be beneficial to clarify the contributions of the "Post-processing" step to acceptability and accuracy improvements, as well as to address ambiguities in utterances that may not be captured in the dataset. Furthermore, we suggest including comparisons with other state-of-the-art models to strengthen the experimental results and enhance the overall robustness of the findings.
