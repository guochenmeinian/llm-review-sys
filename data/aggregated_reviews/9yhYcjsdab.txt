Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the completeness of the $l$-WL test for Euclidean point sets, demonstrating an algorithm that certifies two Euclidean point sets of dimension $d$ are isometric using the $(d-1)$-WL test with only three iterations, extending to the $d$-WL test requiring just one iteration. The authors explore how pair-wise distances determine the identity of all points, particularly showing that storing single-source all-pair distances of two points and the norm of the remaining points suffices to reconstruct the entire point set. The results indicate that the WL-test can effectively distinguish the isometry of Euclidean point sets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem is well-motivated, and most of the paper is clearly written.
- The results effectively characterize the parameters involved in the isometry test of Euclidean point sets: data dimension $d$, WL-test dimension $l$, and the number of rounds needed ($r=3$ for $l=d-1$, $r=1$ for $l=d$). This is an interesting result.

Weaknesses:
- The overall presentation could be improved, particularly on pages 4 and 5, where illustrations would enhance understanding.
- The algorithms should be highlighted in a box, either in description or pseudocode, to clarify each step.
- The necessity of converging to the WL test is questioned, as knowing the distance profiles alone seems sufficient for the isometry test, suggesting a simpler algorithm could be more efficient in terms of time and space.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation by adding illustrations to clarify complex concepts, particularly on pages 4 and 5. Additionally, consider highlighting the algorithms in a box format for better clarity. The authors should address the necessity of the WL test in the context of distance profiles and explore the potential of a simpler algorithm for calculating the profile tuple $(A, M_1, M_2, ...)$ to enhance efficiency. Furthermore, we suggest revising Table 1 to reflect that using $l>d$ WL test may not be of interest, possibly replacing the dots with a slash and using different colors to distinguish previous work, this work, and open problems. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the connection between their results and the design of neural network architectures to better articulate the practical implications of their findings.
