Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Block Transformer architecture, which utilizes hierarchical global-to-local modeling to alleviate the computational burdens associated with self-attention in autoregressive transformers. The architecture comprises three components: an Embedder for block aggregation, a Block Decoder for global context modeling, and a Token Decoder for local token interactions. The authors demonstrate that this approach yields a 10-20x improvement in inference speed while maintaining similar perplexity to traditional transformers. The paper includes thorough ablation studies and architectural analyses.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-organized, with extensive and comprehensive experiments.
2. The Block Transformer represents a bold innovation by trading inference efficiency for model parameters.
3. It achieves significant improvements in inference efficiency compared to standard transformers.
4. The architecture analysis and ablation studies effectively validate the design of the Block Transformer.

Weaknesses:
1. The Block Transformer requires a significantly larger model size to compensate for performance loss, raising concerns about training partitioning and inference infrastructure.
2. The inference efficiency comparison is questionable, particularly regarding the Decode throughput in Table 2, where Block Transformer shows higher throughput despite similar model sizes.
3. The long-sequence modeling capability remains untested, leaving doubts about the architecture's ability to retrieve global context information.
4. The discussion on scaling properties is insufficient, as the results in Figure 2 do not convincingly demonstrate a "scaling law" for Block Transformer.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation of long-sequence modeling capabilities by conducting experiments on standard benchmarks like Needle-in-a-Haystack, LongBench, and ZeroScrolls. Additionally, we suggest providing a clearer explanation of the scaling properties and including a "scaling law" analysis. It would be beneficial to clarify the inference experiment settings, particularly regarding the use of FlashAttention and FlashDecoding techniques. Lastly, we encourage the authors to address the discrepancies in throughput comparisons and provide further evaluations on larger model sizes to substantiate their claims.
