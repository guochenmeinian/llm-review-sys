Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel technique, Quantized Efficient Encoding (QUEEN), aimed at achieving streamable free-viewpoint videos (FVV) through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS). QUEEN learns the residuals of Gaussian attributes between frames by decoding latent embeddings, employing a quantized decoder to reduce the size of these embeddings while maintaining rendering performance. The authors introduce a differentiable L0 sparsity penalty to address the sensitivity of position residuals to compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QUEEN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in training time, model size, and rendering performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The framework QUEEN is innovative, combining 3D Gaussian Splatting with quantized optimization, leading to significant improvements in compression and rendering quality.
- Comprehensive performance analysis validates the design choices, showing QUEEN achieves an optimal trade-off between quality, storage, and speed.
- The methodology is robust, with extensive experiments supporting the effectiveness of the proposed components.

Weaknesses:  
- Section 3.2 lacks clarity and detail on the quantization process, particularly the implementation that achieves over a 10x size reduction. An ablation study comparing quantization methods would enhance understanding.
- The ablation results in Table 2 are confusing and lack analysis, particularly regarding the contradictory performance metrics across datasets. Further explanation is needed to clarify these observations.
- The paper does not demonstrate the streaming capability of QUEEN, nor does it explore 360-degree rendering scenarios, limiting its applicability to dynamic objects.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve Section 3.2 by providing more details on the residual quantization process and including an ablation study comparing different quantization methods. Additionally, a clearer explanation of the ablation study results is necessary to elucidate the key design choices in QUEENâ€™s framework. We suggest that the authors address the lack of clarity regarding the experimental settings, particularly the number of bits used for attribute residual quantization and the precision of sparse position residuals. Finally, incorporating a user study to evaluate perceived video quality would strengthen the paper's conclusions and provide a more comprehensive assessment of QUEEN's performance.
