### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of visual programming in visual question answering (VQA), focusing on ViperGPT. The authors explore the performance gain from question decomposition and propose an iterative prompting-based approach as an alternative to neuro-symbolic methods. The study employs several visual language benchmarks, revealing that prompt-based methods can achieve results comparable to neural-symbolic approaches like ViperGPT.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper provides valuable insights into visual programming and question decomposition in VQA tasks.  
- Experimental results support the main claims, and the ablation studies are thorough and interesting.  
- The work provokes further thought in the NLP community regarding the influence of models like BLIP-2 on ViperGPT's performance.

Weaknesses:  
- The manuscript's organization is confusing, obscuring the research purpose and core findings.  
- The benchmarks used may not adequately assess complex reasoning tasks, limiting the paper's insights.  
- There is a lack of analysis on task-dependent performance gains and error analysis for ViperGPT, which could enhance the study's depth.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the manuscript's organization to better highlight the significance of question decomposition. Additionally, we urge the authors to provide more detailed information about the benchmarks and their complexities to strengthen the paper's conclusions. Conducting an error analysis of ViperGPT would also be beneficial, investigating the nature of errors and their sources.
