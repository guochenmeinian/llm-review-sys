Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents methods for optimizing treatment allocation in sequential settings (Markovian, time-varying Markovian, non-Markovian) to enhance the estimation of average treatment effects (ATE). The authors propose behavior policies aimed at minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) of ATE estimators while addressing challenges such as SUTVA violations and the complexities of dynamic treatment assignment. The study includes theoretical foundations and empirical validation using real-world data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles the significant issue of SUTVA violations in online experiments, which can lead to biased estimates.
- It ambitiously addresses the design of optimal behavior policies in complex settings (NMDP, TMDP, MDP).
- The clarity of writing and thorough related work section enhance the paper's quality.
- The theoretical results are well-supported by empirical findings.

Weaknesses:
- The restriction of treatment assignment policies to class $\Pi^{b}$ in Section 4 limits the dynamic aspects of the problem.
- The importance of the burn-in period for consistent ATE estimation is not sufficiently emphasized.
- Several relevant papers in the experimental design literature are not adequately discussed.
- The definitions and relationships between $n$ and $T$ could be clearer, particularly in Section 2.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the restriction of treatment assignment policies to class $\Pi^{b}$, as this may oversimplify the problem. Additionally, it would be beneficial to emphasize the necessity of the burn-in period for ATE estimation and to include references supporting this claim. We suggest incorporating a discussion on constructing confidence intervals for the ATE estimators, as this is crucial for understanding the reliability of the estimates. Finally, clarifying the relationship between $n$ and $T$ in Section 2 would enhance reader comprehension.
