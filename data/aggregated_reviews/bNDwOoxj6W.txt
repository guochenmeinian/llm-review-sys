Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper examines the computational complexity of Generic and Numerical Identifiability problems in causal analysis, proposing an algorithm that improves the state-of-the-art double exponential time to a single-exponential time for Generic Identifiability. The authors provide a comprehensive literature review and establish that these problems can be decided in PSPACE. Additionally, the paper explores parameter identification in linear structural causal models, presenting a polynomial-space algorithm that runs in exponential time and discusses the hardness of the problem.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper presents new findings on the complexity of various causal identifiability problems and offers a theoretically sound approach to parameter identification.
2. The results are relevant for the NeurIPS community and demonstrate significant originality by linking the problems to the Theory of the Reals.
3. The organization and clarity of the paper are commendable, making complex concepts more accessible.

Weaknesses:  
1. The importance and technical novelty of the results are not clearly articulated, and the main part consists primarily of theorem proofs that lack clarity.
2. The restriction to recursive models is not well-motivated, leaving several questions unanswered regarding their commonality and applicability.
3. The paper lacks experimental results to validate the proposed algorithm's correctness and improvements in running time, and some notations require further explanation for better readability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the importance and novelty of their results, particularly in the introduction and abstract. It would be beneficial to move some proofs to the appendix and include more intuitive explanations in the main text. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments to compare the proposed algorithm with previous algorithms and addressing the clarity of definitions and notations throughout the paper. Finally, consider elaborating on the implications of the results for non-experts to enhance accessibility.
