Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an LLM-based planner called "Describe, Explain, Plan and Select" (DEPS) for sequential decision-making tasks in open-world environments like Minecraft. The method consists of multiple stages, including LLM describe, LLM explain, planning, and goal selection, and is evaluated across hundreds of tasks. The authors claim that DEPS can robustly accomplish over 70 tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in both open-ended and non-open-ended domains. Additionally, DEPS is designed for generating feasible plans for long-horizon tasks using a low-level controller based on a transformer architecture. The authors expand the language goal set from 10 to over 100 goals and employ a Goal-Sensitive Backbone (GSB) for improved state representations. DEPS engages in interactive planning, allowing it to re-plan when initial plans fail, as illustrated through detailed examples. The authors report discrepancies in reproducing VPT results, attributing performance differences to environmental settings and action space limitations, and commit to including additional results and clarifications in the final version.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Clear motivation for the proposed method, addressing unique challenges in open-world environments.
- Excellent presentation with coherent flow and informative figures.
- Thorough evaluation, comparing DEPS against five baseline methods and showcasing extensive benchmarks across various planning methods and environments.
- DEPS demonstrates strong performance in generating plans for complex tasks and effectively utilizes interactive re-planning.
- The architecture is intuitive, and the work is reproducible, with code provided.

Weaknesses:
- Limited novelty, as the proposed method introduces only three additional modules (Explainer, Descriptor, Selector) without sufficient justification for their significance.
- The necessity of the Explainer is questionable, as it merely summarizes errors based on well-structured information.
- The Descriptor's functionality appears to be rule-based rather than innovative, raising concerns about performance improvements.
- The Selector's effectiveness is not convincingly demonstrated, particularly in the experimental setup.
- Potential unfair evaluation due to differences in LLM token consumption across methods.
- High variance in DEPS performance on challenging tasks, necessitating further statistical analysis.
- The number of seeds used in experiments (30) may not be sufficient to draw robust conclusions.
- Discrepancies in VPT performance due to environmental differences may affect the validity of comparisons.
- Inappropriate terminology, such as "zero-shot" and "one-shot," which should be revised for accuracy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the significance of the Explainer, Descriptor, and Selector modules, providing clearer insights into their contributions. Additionally, clarify the experimental setup for the Selector to ensure it is representative. Address the potential unfair evaluation by standardizing LLM token consumption across methods. Further statistical analysis should be conducted to validate DEPS's performance on challenging tasks. We also suggest revising the terminology used to describe the system's capabilities for accuracy. Moreover, we recommend improving the appendix by providing self-contained information on the training mechanism rather than solely referring to prior work. Please include DEPS success rates alongside VPT scores in the comparison table and add failure examples where DEPS fails to recover. Furthermore, consider adding results with open-sourced models and open-sourcing the code and controller models to facilitate further research. Lastly, we encourage the inclusion of ablation results of DEPS without the Explainer in the appendix for a more comprehensive understanding of the system's performance.
