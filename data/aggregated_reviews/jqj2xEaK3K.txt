### Key Points
This paper presents a novel constrained Bayesian optimization (CBO) framework, COBAR, which efficiently identifies the interior optimum of a black-box objective function under multiple constraints. The authors introduce a region of interest (ROI) identification framework that refines the search space using Gaussian Process (GP) models, integrating active learning for level-set estimation. The paper includes rigorous theoretical analysis, providing high-probability simple regret bounds, and a thorough experimental comparison of COBAR against three baselines across six CBO tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a solid theoretical foundation with comprehensive proofs of theorems.
- The experimental analysis is thorough, covering a range of tasks and dimensions, and includes additional illustrations that enhance understanding.

Weaknesses:
- Key details regarding the use of max LCB and regular LCB in different feasible regions are insufficiently explained.
- There is inconsistency between shorthand task names in plots and their detailed descriptions, which may confuse readers.
- Typos and formatting issues, particularly in the reference section and figure titles, detract from the paper's professionalism.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by explaining the rationale behind using max LCB and regular LCB in different scenarios. Additionally, ensure consistency between the shorthand task names in the plots and their descriptions in the text. Correct any typos, such as the plot title "36D" to "32D," and address formatting issues in the reference section. Furthermore, provide insights into the performance of the algorithm when the GP is a poor fit and clarify the implications of the chosen kernel. Address the exploration of the undecided set and the potential risks of overly narrowing the search space in high-dimensional problems. Lastly, clarify the repetitive labels in Figure 3 and provide explanations for the observed behaviors in Figures 7 and 9.
