### Key Points
This paper presents a method for solving analogy questions by utilizing paths between concepts and relation embeddings derived from large language models. The authors propose a binary classifier to predict a confidence score for a relation embedding, RelBERT, which serves as a threshold for predicting links between concepts. They incorporate word similarities alongside structured knowledge graphs, such as ConceptNet, to identify paths between concepts. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method excels in addressing challenging analogy questions where the confidence score for answers using RelBERT is low.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The novelty of employing chains of relation embeddings to tackle analogy questions.
- Comprehensive experiments that encompass analogy question benchmarks and various baselines.
- The innovative integration of relation embeddings and relational paths, which contrasts with existing work that typically overlooks intermediate concepts.
- Insightful analysis of results, particularly in Table 1.

Weaknesses:
- The initial step of adding relational links based on static word embeddings is questionable, as it may yield synonyms rather than relevant relations.
- The method's performance on easy analogy questions is subpar, raising concerns about its efficacy in simpler cases.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the abstract by defining key concepts such as "informative relation embeddings" and "hard analogy questions." Additionally, the introduction should better motivate the proposed approach and clarify the classification of analogy questions as hard or easy. To enhance analysis, show the answers for RelBERT and the proposed method for easy/hard questions in Table 6. Clearly state the settings for the hybrid models in Table 2 and explain the notations in Table 3's caption for quick reference. The missing link prediction section from line 209 needs clarification regarding the connection between concepts. Lastly, consider evaluating the benchmarks against at least one more competing method and referencing relevant literature on multi-hop relations.
