### Key Points
This paper presents domain-informed negative sampling strategies (DINS) for training dynamic graph embedding (DGE) models, specifically targeting the challenges of meme stock-related social networks on platforms like Reddit. The authors propose various negative sampling techniques, including temporal sampling, random sender/receiver, and negative loops, which are integrated into the DINS strategy to enhance the predictive performance of models such as TGNs, DyGFormer, and GraphMixer. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that DINS improves model performance in predicting future interactions within these networks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces innovative negative sampling methods that leverage domain-specific insights, addressing gaps in existing DGE approaches.
- The DINS strategy effectively combines multiple sampling techniques, enhancing the assessment of DGE models for complex social network interactions.
- Experimental results validate the proposed methods, showing significant improvements in predictive performance over existing baselines.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity on the replication of experiments, including the number of repetitions and statistical significance of results, raising concerns about the stability of findings.
- There is insufficient explanation of the unique characteristics of meme stock-related social networks that justify the effectiveness of the DINS strategy.
- The computational demands of the proposed strategies may limit scalability, and the ablation study does not adequately quantify the importance of individual sampling methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the replication of experiments by specifying how many times the experiments were repeated and providing standard deviations or confidence intervals for the reported AUC scores. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on the domain-specific features of meme stock-related social networks that make the DINS strategy particularly effective, including concrete examples of how these dynamics differ from other networks. It would also be beneficial to compare DINS with other state-of-the-art negative sampling methods and to address how the strategy manages rare events or outliers. Lastly, we suggest providing detailed information on the computational resources required for the proposed methods and conducting additional experiments to assess the generalization of DINS across different datasets.
