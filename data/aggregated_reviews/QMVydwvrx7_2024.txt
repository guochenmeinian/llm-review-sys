Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SSDiff, a spatial-spectral integrated diffusion model aimed at enhancing satellite imagery resolution by fusing high-resolution panchromatic images with low-resolution multispectral images. The authors propose a unique architecture that separates spatial and spectral components through different network branches, employing a denoising diffusion model. Key innovations include an Alternating Projection Fusion Module (APFM) for spatial-spectral fusion and a Frequency Modulation Inter-branch Module (FMIM) to optimize frequency distribution. The authors also introduce a LoRA-like branch-alternating fine-tuning method to improve performance. Experimental results across various datasets indicate that SSDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal distortion.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors propose an innovative spatial-spectral integrated diffusion model for pansharpening, applying diffusion models effectively in this context.
2. The paper is grounded in a solid theoretical foundation, utilizing concepts from linear algebra and subspace decomposition.
3. The proposed methods demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on two datasets, supported by a comprehensive ablation study.
4. The organization and clarity of the paper enhance its readability.

Weaknesses:
1. The efficiency of the DDPM-based method used in SSDiff is not adequately discussed, limiting understanding of its practical advantages and deployment feasibility.
2. The experimental evaluation is primarily focused on the Pansharpening task; additional experiments on other datasets would strengthen the findings.
3. Some figures, such as Figure 4, lack clarity, particularly regarding the modulation of low and high-frequency components.
4. The expression in certain sections could be improved for grammatical and logical clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the efficiency of the DDPM-based method to provide a clearer understanding of its practical implications. Additionally, conducting experiments on other datasets would enhance the robustness of the findings. We suggest clarifying Figure 4 to better illustrate the modulation processes of low and high-frequency components. Furthermore, addressing the grammatical and logical issues in the text would improve overall clarity. Lastly, providing specific comparative results regarding the efficiency limitations of diffusion models would be beneficial for evaluating the proposed method's performance.
