### Key Points
This paper presents a method for improving commonsense question answering (QA) by generating and selecting high-quality QA pairs through a dynamics-driven framework. The authors propose filtering out noisy examples from synthetic data derived from commonsense knowledge graphs, which significantly enhances model performance across five benchmarks. The methods are clearly articulated, and the results demonstrate substantial gains compared to existing filtering techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed method is novel and shows impressive results, indicating an effective approach to enhancing the quality of synthesized commonsense QA data.  
- The experimental evaluation across multiple datasets supports the claims made regarding performance improvements.

Weaknesses:  
- Important technical details, such as the motivations for certain equations and the relationship between training dynamics and QA dynamics, are inadequately explained.  
- The paper lacks a discussion on the implications of the results and does not report the additional time or space overhead associated with the QA Dynamics method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the technical details, particularly regarding the motivations for Equation 2 and Equation 3, and the relationship between training dynamics and QA dynamics. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion on the implications of the results and addressing the potential overhead of the QA Dynamics method. Furthermore, please provide a table of statistics detailing the filtering process for mislabeled, false-negative, and mixed strategies. Lastly, ensure that all relevant references are included, particularly those related to baseline models and training dynamics.
