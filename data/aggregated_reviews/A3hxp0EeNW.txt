Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ConStruct, a graph generative framework that incorporates hard constraints on graph topological properties, particularly focusing on edge-deletion invariant properties. The authors model the forward process using an edge-absorbing noise model and predict the reverse edge insertion process with a GNN projector. The framework aims to enhance the validity of generated graphs, demonstrated through experiments on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets, achieving significant improvements in graph validity. Additionally, the authors provide a rebuttal that effectively addresses the reviewers' concerns, enhancing the overall quality of the submission and reflecting their responsiveness to feedback.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is the first graph-constrained discrete generative framework, addressing a challenging and meaningful problem.
- The authors provide a theoretical guarantee for the generation quality of ConStruct.
- The incremental constraint satisfaction algorithm improves sampling efficiency.
- The experimental results are comprehensive, showcasing applicability to real-world pathology graphs.
- The authors successfully addressed the reviewers' concerns, indicating a responsive and iterative approach to improving the paper.
- The appreciation for feedback reflects a positive engagement with the review process.

Weaknesses:
- ConStruct is limited to edge-deletion invariant properties, restricting its applicability to more complex graph properties.
- The projector module complicates likelihood estimation, making it difficult to assess the likelihood of generated graph instances.
- The autoregressive nature of ConStruct may lead to higher sampling complexity compared to diffusion-based methods.
- The authors do not adequately compare their method against existing models like EDGE and Graph-ARM, nor do they cite the latest versions of these works.
- The review does not specify any particular strengths or weaknesses of the paper's content itself, focusing instead on the authors' response.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the limitations of their method, particularly regarding its restriction to edge-deletion invariant constraints and the implications for real-world applicability. Additionally, we suggest conducting a complexity analysis to assess the efficiency of ConStruct compared to diffusion-based methods. The authors should also provide a clearer comparison with related works such as PRODIGY and SPECTRE, emphasizing the differences in their approaches and constraints. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors explicitly detail how each concern was addressed in the rebuttal to provide clearer insights into the revisions made. Finally, clarifying the definition of $\Delta^b$ and addressing the potential discrepancies between training and sampling processes would enhance the manuscript's clarity and rigor.
