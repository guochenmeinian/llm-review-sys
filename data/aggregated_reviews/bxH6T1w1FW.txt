Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel attention mechanism called Soft Superpixel Neighborhood Attention (SNA), which integrates superpixel segmentations directly into the attention module. The authors prove that SNA is the optimal denoiser under Gaussian noise, and experiments demonstrate that it outperforms existing local attention modules in image denoising tasks. The paper also discusses the theoretical implications of using superpixel probabilities instead of binary interactions, suggesting a flexible interpolation between standard and superpixel attention.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The idea of using superpixels in the attention module is elegant and novel, potentially enhancing performance in larger resolution problems.  
- The paper is well-written, with clear explanations and supplementary materials for less critical content.  
- Experimental results indicate improved performance over state-of-the-art methods.  

Weaknesses:  
- The performance improvement is relatively modest, and the application focus on denoising may limit broader impact.  
- There is insufficient discussion on the computational complexity of the SNA algorithm, making it unclear how it scales compared to existing methods.  
- The paper lacks comparisons to other relevant attention approaches, particularly self-attention, and contains an incorrect citation regarding neighborhood attention.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the computational complexity of the SNA algorithm, providing metrics such as time and space complexity to clarify its scalability. Additionally, we suggest exploring the application of the attention module beyond denoising, such as in deblurring or object detection, to enhance the paper's relevance. Lastly, we advise correcting the citation for neighborhood attention and considering a broader comparison with other attention mechanisms to strengthen the paper's contributions.
