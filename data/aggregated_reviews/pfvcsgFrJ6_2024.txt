Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework called Determinism-aware Greedy Equivalent Search (DGES) for causal discovery that incorporates deterministic relationships. DGES enhances efficiency and scalability through a three-phase process: detecting minimal deterministic clusters (MinDCs), modifying the Greedy Equivalent Search (GES) to create an initial causal graph, and performing an exact search to refine the graph. The authors propose that while there is only one deterministic cluster (DC), multiple MinDCs can exist within it. They establish partial identifiability conditions for DGES and validate its efficacy through extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets, acknowledging the lack of ground truth in their real-world dataset. The authors aim to improve the clarity of their results by highlighting deterministic versus probabilistic edges in their graphs and emphasize the importance of maintaining all variables in the causal graph for comprehensive analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively demonstrates that exact score-based methods can handle deterministic relationships under mild assumptions.
- DGES is introduced as a framework that improves efficiency and scalability in dealing with deterministic relations.
- The authors provide a clear explanation of the relationship between DCs and MinDCs, enhancing understanding of their methodology.
- They acknowledge and plan to address the lack of clarity in their figures and the absence of ground truth in their dataset.
- Extensive experiments validate the theoretical findings and efficacy of DGES, and the authors show thoughtful engagement with reviewer feedback.

Weaknesses:
- The algorithm guarantees only partial identifiability of the CPDAG, making it less informative than a partially oriented DAG.
- The contribution appears limited as it compromises general identifiability for improved computational efficiency and scalability.
- The assumption of causal sufficiency is rarely satisfied in practice.
- The evaluation relies on a single real-world dataset, which is considered weak.
- The representation of results in Figure 4 is criticized for being busy and unclear, lacking proper highlighting of MinDCs.
- The authors' claims about the performance of DGES may come across as overly positive without sufficient acknowledgment of limitations in determining causal orientations.
- There are several typos and grammatical issues that detract from the overall clarity of the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for using DGES by clearly articulating the limitations of existing methods, particularly GES, in handling deterministic dependencies. Additionally, we suggest providing a more balanced discussion of DGES's performance, explicitly acknowledging the limitations in determining causal orientations. We also recommend improving the clarity of Figure 4 by marking edges that are deterministic versus probabilistic and highlighting the MinDC variables. Furthermore, we advise addressing the vague terminology such as "mild conditions" in Theorem 2 and clarifying the runtime comparisons in Figure 3. Finally, we urge the authors to conduct another editing pass to correct the identified typos and grammatical issues throughout the paper.
