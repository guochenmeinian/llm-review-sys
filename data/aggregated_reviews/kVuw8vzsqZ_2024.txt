### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the effectiveness of machine-learned predictions in queuing systems, specifically focusing on the M/G/1 queue with Poisson arrivals and i.i.d. service times, aiming to minimize average response time. The authors propose the algorithm 'SkipPredict', which utilizes a two-stage prediction approach involving a cheap 1-bit prediction followed by an expensive service time prediction for long jobs. The paper contrasts this with another algorithm, 'DelayPredict', and compares both to baselines such as FCFS and SRPPT. The findings indicate that the performance of these algorithms is contingent on the relationship between threshold, system load, and prediction costs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a two-stage prediction setup is novel in learning-augmented algorithms and may significantly impact the field.
- The model's consideration of prediction generation as a cost is intriguing and could be applicable to other scheduling problems.
- Empirical results demonstrate that the two-stage prediction setup can reduce overall costs compared to baselines in certain scenarios.

Weaknesses:
- The results lack surprising elements, as the benefits of the two-stage algorithm depend heavily on cost relationships, with a need for clearer summarization of findings.
- The main components of SkipPredict have been previously analyzed, leading to a perception of limited novelty in techniques or analyses.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their presentation, particularly in defining the problem before describing the algorithm. Additionally, we suggest including more explicit statements summarizing the findings to enhance the impact of the results. It would also be beneficial to address the lack of references to prior work on costly predictions in learning-augmented settings. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include a remark on the characteristics of the real-world datasets used, as this could provide valuable context for their findings.
