### Key Points
This paper presents a Multimodal Ordinal Affective Computing (MOAC) framework that incorporates ordinal information of affective concepts to enhance feature representations for multimodal affective computing tasks. The authors propose label-level and feature-level ordinal learning methods, alongside a neutral embedding, to improve the model's predictions. The framework demonstrates effectiveness across multiple tasks, including Multimodal Sentiment Analysis, Humor Detection, and Sarcasm Detection.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The MOAC framework innovatively integrates neutral embedding and two types of ordinal learning, enhancing the understanding of affective concepts.
2. The methodology and experiments are detailed, with a logical presentation that aids clarity.
3. The framework shows strong generalizability across different multimodal tasks.

Weaknesses:
1. The two-stage training approach is cumbersome, involving many manually tuned hyperparameters, complicating the training process.
2. The random selection of neutral samples raises concerns regarding the reliability of the neutral embedding.
3. The writing lacks clarity and contains subjective expressions that hinder readability.
4. The overall performance improvement is limited and lacks significance testing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing, particularly in explaining the motivation behind their approach, possibly by including a real-world example. Additionally, we suggest introducing more related works on ordinal learning in multimodal affective computing to provide context for their contributions. The authors should clarify the definitions of coarse and fine granularity in their learning methods and elaborate on the batch selection strategy for neutral samples. Finally, we encourage the authors to consider leveraging more advanced PLMs and to provide experimental results comparing performance with and without the humor-related information used in their tasks.
