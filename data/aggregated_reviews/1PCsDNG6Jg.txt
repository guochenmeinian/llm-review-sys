### Key Points
This paper presents a study of the computational relationship between replicable learning algorithms, a recent notion of algorithmic stability, and classical concepts such as SQ-learning and differential privacy. The authors provide both negative results, demonstrating separations between these notions, and positive results, detailing efficient transformations. Notably, they show that certain concept classes can be learned replicably in polynomial time without efficient online learners, and they present a method to transform pure private learners into replicable learners efficiently. Additionally, the authors clarify the differences between two concepts by expressing them as "efficient in some parameters" and providing a detailed explanation of their distinctions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper addresses a critical open problem in understanding the computational cost of replicability in machine learning, making initial progress on connections with pure privacy, SQ, and online learning. The authors clarify relationships among various stability concepts, and their results are well-motivated and clearly presented. The lifting result for replicable learners is particularly noteworthy, suggesting potential gaps between SQ algorithms and replicable learners. Furthermore, the clarification of the differences between the two concepts is logical and well-articulated, and the suggestion to express both concepts as "efficient in some parameters" is reasonable.

Weaknesses:  
The authors misunderstand prior separation results, leading to inaccuracies in their presentation of computational separations, particularly regarding the efficiency of transformations between different learning paradigms. Additionally, while the paper makes some contributions, many techniques employed are standard, and the novelty of the proofs is questionable. The results often rely on known methods, which diminishes the perceived originality of the work. Depicting the concepts in a simple diagram is challenging, and the proposed addition of different arrows regarding the infinite case may risk overcomplicating the diagram.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the accuracy of their claims regarding computational separations, particularly in Figure 1.1, by clarifying the efficiency of transformations from approximate differential privacy to replicability. It would be beneficial to provide specific examples that illustrate the implications of these transformations in practical scenarios. Additionally, we suggest that the authors elaborate on the new ideas that contribute to their results, particularly in relation to the replicable quantile estimation and influence estimation techniques, to better highlight the novelty of their contributions. Finally, we recommend that the authors refine the diagram representing the differences between the concepts to balance clarity and complexity, possibly by simplifying the representation of the infinite case to avoid overcomplication.
