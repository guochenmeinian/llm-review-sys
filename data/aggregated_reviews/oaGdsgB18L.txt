Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents TFLEX, a framework designed for reasoning over temporal knowledge graphs (TKG). It processes complex queries involving entities or timestamps and constraints, converting them into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for embedding in a computation space. The authors define operations within the graph, including projection, intersection, complement, and temporal logic operations (e.g., After, Before, Between). The framework's effectiveness is evaluated using three modified standard datasets, focusing on predefined complex queries. In response to reviewer feedback, the authors acknowledge concerns regarding readability and commit to incorporating additional background and rationale into the main text and appendix, elaborating on the semantics of addition, the motivation behind operator design, and the underlying knowledge of the equations to improve comprehension.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses the under-explored area of complex query embedding in temporal knowledge graphs, providing a clear problem definition and initial solutions.
- It introduces a novel approach to multi-hop logical reasoning using fuzzy logic and temporal operations, supported by extensive experiments and ablation studies.
- The availability of three new datasets enhances the potential for further research in this domain.
- The authors demonstrate a willingness to address reviewer concerns, particularly regarding readability and context, which is a positive step toward enhancing the paper's clarity.

Weaknesses:
- The related works section lacks sufficient references to existing TKGC literature, missing key studies that could provide context.
- Technical definitions and operators are presented without adequate explanation, leading to ambiguity in their semantics.
- The evaluation lacks a comparison with existing TKGC methods, making it difficult to assess TFLEX's performance in capturing temporal information.
- The specific requests for substantial changes or comparisons with related work have not been fully clarified or addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related works section by including more comprehensive references to existing TKGC studies, such as [1] and [2]. Additionally, the authors should provide clearer explanations of the operators and their semantics, particularly regarding the definitions introduced in equations (3), (7), and the distance function. It would be beneficial to discuss the rationale behind the choice of the 40 query types used in experiments and to include a comparison with state-of-the-art TKGC methods. We encourage the authors to clarify whether they will add more references or substantially change the paper to discuss and compare with more related work, including adding experiments. Lastly, we suggest that the authors streamline the presentation of mathematical notation to enhance readability and consider including a detailed diagram of the model to aid understanding.
