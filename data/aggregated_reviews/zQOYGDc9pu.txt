Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel randomization scheme for A/B testing at the cluster level, focusing on optimizing the covariance matrix of the treatment vector to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) of the Horvitz-Thompson estimator. The authors derive an upper bound for the MSE and propose a projected gradient descent (PGD) algorithm to ensure the validity of the optimized covariance matrix. Simulations conducted on a real-time social network validate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to existing approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is generally easy to follow and presents a well-formulated problem with detailed analysis.
2. The proposed method is novel, addressing both bias and variance in experimental design, which is uncommon in the literature.
3. The simulations are well-executed, demonstrating the robustness of the design under various model mis-specifications.

Weaknesses:
1. The introduction lacks sufficient background, with unclear definitions and explanations leading to confusion.
2. The experiments are not comprehensive, missing essential details about the dataset and only implementing the method on one dataset, which undermines the credibility of the results.
3. The paper makes strong assumptions about the knowledge of treatment effects and pre-specified clusters, which may not be practical for most experimenters.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the background introduction by providing clearer definitions and connections between concepts. It would be beneficial to summarize all definitions in a single table for clarity. In section 2.1, please specify the community detection algorithms with references. The experimental section should include more comprehensive details about the dataset, such as edges, nodes, and degrees, and consider testing on multiple datasets to enhance the validity of the findings. Additionally, we suggest discussing the real-world applications of the method and the implications of the assumptions made in the derivation. Lastly, addressing the clarity of the Grothendieck mapping and increasing the Monte Carlo simulations to 10,000 runs would strengthen the paper's contributions.
