### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive measurement study on the security configurations and vulnerabilities in phishing websites and associated kits, analyzing over 900,000 phishing websites and collecting a large dataset of phishing URLs. The findings reveal that phishing websites often exhibit weak security configurations, particularly in HTTP headers, and highlight exploitable vulnerabilities within phishing kits. The authors aim to provide insights that could help defenders disrupt phishing operations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors have compiled a substantial dataset, enhancing the study's significance.
- The paper is well-structured and presents interesting findings regarding security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in phishing websites.
- The exploration of backdoors in phishing kits adds depth to the analysis.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for the study lacks sufficient justification, particularly regarding how identified vulnerabilities can be exploited for disruption.
- There is a disconnect between the analysis of phishing websites and kits, with insufficient exploration of the implications of findings for phishing detection and mitigation.
- The paper does not adequately address ethical concerns related to the potential exploitation of vulnerabilities in active phishing environments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for their motivation, particularly by providing clearer explanations of how vulnerabilities can be exploited for disruption. Additionally, the authors should explore the relationship between phishing websites and kits more thoroughly, potentially including case studies that demonstrate the practical implications of their findings. We suggest enhancing the discussion on ethical considerations, particularly regarding the legal and ethical issues that may arise from implementing their recommendations. Finally, the authors should clarify their data collection methodology to address concerns about the reliability and authenticity of the dataset.
