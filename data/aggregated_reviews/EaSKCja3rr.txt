### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative approach to enhance mobile "how-to" queries through automatic search results verification and reranking, aiming to improve user experience. The authors propose a three-stage solution: extracting step-by-step instructions from web pages, verifying these instructions by simulating their execution on Android devices, and reranking search results based on the success of these executions. A comprehensive evaluation demonstrates significant improvements in the quality and reliability of top-ranked results, suggesting a new direction for optimizing search engine ranking for technical support.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed approach is novel.
2. The three-stage system design is well-structured, with detailed steps provided.
3. A comprehensive evaluation across various domains is conducted.
4. The research questions are well-formulated.

Weaknesses:
1. Some claims and hypotheses lack support, such as the definition of "decent accuracy" and the absence of references for the use of GPT-4 in instruction extraction.
2. Uncertainty exists regarding which features contribute most to overall performance.
3. The presentation requires significant improvement, including correcting "state-of-art" to "state-of-the-art," ensuring proper spacing before citation brackets, and unifying the term "multimodal" or "multi-modal."
4. The generative LLMs may produce hallucinated content, leading to noise and false positives.
5. The study's focus on the Android platform limits applicability to other platforms.
6. Domain-specific performance metrics may restrict generalization of findings.
7. The integration between the UI context and the Action Prediction Model needs refinement for better execution performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the support for their claims and hypotheses by providing clear definitions and relevant references. Additionally, the authors should clarify which features contribute most to performance. To enhance the presentation, we suggest correcting typographical errors, ensuring consistent terminology, and addressing formatting issues. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore the applicability of their approach to other platforms and refine the integration between the UI context and the Action Prediction Model to enhance execution performance.
