Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an empirical study comparing various dimensionality reduction (DR) methods for brain activity data, specifically using MRI data from the Human Connectome Project. The authors redefine "dimensionality reduction" to encompass methods of presenting brain activity, such as selecting brain segmentation and measuring activity, which diverges from the conventional ML/AI definition that includes algorithms like t-SNE and UMAP. The authors employ topological data analysis (TDA) techniques, including persistent homology and topological bootstrap, to evaluate the quality of DR, utilizing significant computational resources for this evaluation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is technically correct and contributes to the active field of neuroimaging research.
- It introduces novel metrics for evaluating graph structures and applies recent TDA tools effectively.

Weaknesses:
- The definition of "dimensionality reduction" is inconsistent with standard ML/AI terminology, leading to potential confusion.
- The paper lacks contributions relevant to the ML/AI community, focusing instead on insights about brain features rather than DR algorithms.
- Several neuroscience terms are not well-explained, and some figures lack clear captions.
- The presentation is ambiguous, with unclear mathematical notations and a lack of baseline experiments for validation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by defining terms consistently and avoiding jargon that may confuse readers unfamiliar with neuroscience. It would be beneficial to restructure the manuscript for better flow and coherence, ensuring that mathematical notations are consistent and well-explained. We suggest including baseline experiments to validate the results and comparing the proposed methods with standard DR techniques like t-SNE and UMAP. Additionally, addressing the questions raised regarding the motivation for using specific TDA techniques and the implications of the results would strengthen the paper's contribution.
