Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a significant advancement in the scalability of differentially private query releases through a matrix mechanism, specifically the 'ResidualPlanner.' The authors propose a novel method for representing workload queries as Kronecker products of small block matrices, allowing for efficient closed-form computations during the reconstruction step. This results in improved runtime and efficiency compared to previous matrix mechanisms, particularly in handling high-dimensional datasets. The mechanism is adaptable to various objectives, including max variance, which is a notable extension beyond prior works that primarily focused on sum of variance objectives.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper demonstrates a substantial improvement in the efficiency of the matrix mechanism, with a novel design for query representation that enhances computational performance.
- ResidualPlanner effectively scales to handle a larger number of linear queries across high-dimensional datasets, outperforming the High-Dimensional Matrix Mechanism (HDMM).
- The authors provide a clear outline of their approach, detailing the select, measure, and reconstruct steps, and illustrate reduced variability in runtime.

Weaknesses:
- Certain sections are overly technical, which may hinder readability; for instance, the absence of intuitive explanations for concepts like the Kronecker product detracts from clarity.
- The comparison with prior matrix mechanisms lacks clarity regarding the trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, particularly concerning higher-order marginals.
- The rationale behind the necessity of general loss functions and their applications remains insufficiently discussed, and the optimality claims are limited to linear Gaussian mechanisms without broader guarantees.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of technical sections by providing more intuitive explanations and context for complex concepts, such as the Kronecker product. Additionally, we suggest elaborating on the significance of general loss functions and their relevance to synthetic data applications. The authors should also clarify the trade-offs involved in accuracy versus efficiency, particularly regarding higher-order marginals, and consider providing a more comprehensive discussion on the optimality of their mechanism in relation to other differential privacy frameworks.
