Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents MapBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the robustness of high-definition (HD) map construction methods against various sensor corruptions in autonomous driving. The authors assess 31 state-of-the-art HD map constructors under 29 types of camera and LiDAR sensor corruptions, revealing significant performance degradation under adverse conditions. They identify effective strategies for enhancing robustness, including multi-modal fusion, advanced data augmentation, and architectural techniques. The work provides valuable insights for developing more reliable HD map construction methods, crucial for advancing autonomous driving technology.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an important issue of sensor corruptions in HD map construction, revealing critical safety concerns for autonomous vehicles.
- Extensive experiments on 31 state-of-the-art models provide a multi-dimensional perspective on model capabilities, highlighting vulnerabilities and strengths.
- The benchmark includes a wide range of corruption types organized into a comprehensive taxonomy, enhancing its utility for evaluating robustness.
- The authors propose straightforward yet effective strategies for improving robustness, offering practical solutions for real-world applications.

Weaknesses:
- The implementation details of different sensor corruptions in the data are not discussed in depth.
- There is a lack of experimental evidence demonstrating that the sensor corruption cases accurately reflect real-world practices.
- Limited guidance for future research directions aimed at enhancing robustness is provided.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on how different sensor corruptions are implemented in the sensor data. Additionally, it would be beneficial to provide empirical evidence supporting the representativeness of the 29 types of corruptions used in the study. We suggest engaging with stakeholders to understand the societal implications more comprehensively and justifying the selection and validity of the corruptions to ensure they contribute uniquely to the field. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore the robustness of offline map construction methods and evaluate different LiDAR backbones to yield more comprehensive results.
