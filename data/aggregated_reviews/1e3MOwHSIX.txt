Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents MAGNET, a gradient-based tokenization method aimed at addressing over-segmentation in multilingual text data, particularly for non-Latin scripts. MAGNET employs language-script-specific predictors to learn segment boundaries between byte tokens, thereby enhancing tokenization efficiency. The authors conducted extensive experiments across nine languages with distinct scripts, demonstrating that MAGNET not only mitigates over-segmentation but also improves inference speed while maintaining performance in downstream tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well organized and easy to follow, with sufficient descriptions provided.
- Extensive experimental results across nine languages with three different scripts validate the approach.
- The method successfully reduces inference time, contributing to overall efficiency.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments do not include languages like Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, which are significant for addressing out-of-vocabulary issues.
- Despite addressing over-segmentation, performance remains comparable to byte-level or baseline models.
- Basic token prediction tasks or text generation tasks are not evaluated, and improvements in inference time compared to DTP are minimal.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve their evaluation by including experiments on languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean to enhance the applicability of their method. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explore the potential of inline language identification to refine segmentation further and ensure equitable performance across languages. Finally, incorporating basic token prediction tasks or text generation tasks in their evaluation could provide a more comprehensive assessment of MAGNET's effectiveness.
