Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents D3R (Dynamic Decomposition with Diffusion Reconstruction), a novel anomaly detection network designed for unstable multivariate time series data. D3R effectively addresses drift by employing dynamic decomposition and noise diffusion for data reconstruction. Experimental results indicate that D3R achieves a 12% average improvement over existing methods, demonstrating its potential applicability in various long-period multivariate time series analysis tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a unique approach to anomaly detection, specifically targeting unstable multivariate time series data through dynamic decomposition and noise diffusion.
2. It effectively addresses the challenge of drift in non-stationary environments, aiming to reduce false alarms and enhance detection accuracy.
3. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets provide strong empirical support for the proposed method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. The time complexity and computational cost of D3R are not discussed, which is crucial given the large-scale nature of real-world datasets.
2. The use of a moving average as the ground truth for trend detection may still be susceptible to local window issues.
3. Comparative experiments did not apply optimal hyperparameters to baseline models, potentially skewing fairness in performance comparisons.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on time complexity and computational cost, including specific GPU-hour requirements for experiments. Additionally, clarifying the rationale behind using a moving average for trend detection and addressing potential local window issues would strengthen the paper. It would also be beneficial to apply optimal hyperparameters to comparison models or standardize hyperparameters across all models for a fairer evaluation. Finally, providing further insights into the practical implications of dynamically adjusting the information bottleneck during inference would enhance the clarity of the proposed method's contributions.
