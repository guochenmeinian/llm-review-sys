### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative framework that extends traditional single-turn web search to a multi-turn clarification system, aimed at enhancing user document retrieval efficiency. The authors define a comprehensive process for multi-turn clarification, which includes candidate generation, optimal selection, and document retrieval. They propose a rule-based method, MulClari-Rule, and leverage the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5-Turbo to improve clarification generation and selection. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in document retrieval and clarification quality using Qulac and MIMICS datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The transition from single-turn to multi-turn web search represents a significant advancement in search technology.
2. The framework effectively reduces the number of clarification turns, streamlining the search process.
3. The MulClari-Rule method showcases practical effectiveness.
4. The LLM-based approach demonstrates adaptability and modern application.
5. The proposed methods outperform existing single-turn clarification methods in document retrieval.
6. High-quality clarification panes are produced, enhancing user interaction.

Weaknesses:
1. The distinction between "conversational search" and "Web search" is unclear, leading to potential confusion regarding the paper's contributions.
2. The paper lacks clarity on how and when to terminate the clarification process.
3. The reliance on LLM performance raises questions about the method's robustness across different models.
4. The evaluation methods do not include efficiency and human-centric metrics.
5. The mathematical formulation in Section 3.2 is inadequately defined, causing ambiguity in notation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by systematically listing and discussing the differences between "conversational search" and "Web search" to enhance reader understanding. Additionally, we suggest providing guidelines for when to terminate the clarification process to improve usability. The authors should clarify how the proposed method performs across various LLMs and include efficiency and human-centric metrics in their evaluation. Furthermore, we advise refining the mathematical formulation in Section 3.2 by defining all variables and terms explicitly. Lastly, we recommend enhancing the clarity of table captions and ensuring consistent tense usage throughout the paper.
