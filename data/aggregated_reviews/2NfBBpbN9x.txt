Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for converting general time sequences into images using invertible transforms, enabling the application of advanced diffusion vision models for processing both short- and long-range time-series data. The authors demonstrate improvements across multiple tasks, including unconditional generation, interpolation, and extrapolation, and introduce a novel benchmark for ultra-long time series.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The concept of transforming time sequences into images is innovative and effectively explored.  
2. Extensive experiments validate the proposed model across various datasets and tasks, supported by thorough analysis and discussion.  
3. The paper is well-organized and clearly written.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The time-series to image (ts2img) transformation methods and diffusion backbone are derived from existing works, which diminishes the paper's novelty.  
2. Different ts2img methods for short- and long-range generation complicate the assessment of their impact relative to the diffusion model, raising questions about the model's claimed versatility.  
3. The proposed method has significantly more parameters than close competitors, which should be more explicitly discussed.  
4. The computational resource requirements are vaguely detailed, lacking specific comparisons in terms of GPU usage and performance scaling.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the novelty of their ts2img methods and diffusion backbone by emphasizing their contributions. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed comparison of computational resources, including GPU types and FLOPs, to enhance confidence in the reported improvements. Clarifying the advantages of image architectures versus time-series architectures and conducting experiments with parameter-matched models would also strengthen the paper. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore automatic selection of the transform type based on time-series length to enhance usability.
