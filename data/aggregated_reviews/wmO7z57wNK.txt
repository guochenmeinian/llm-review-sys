Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents LLMCBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large language model (LLM) compression techniques. It addresses the high computational and storage demands of LLMs by proposing six evaluation tracks focusing on accuracy, efficiency, generalization ability, training consumption, hardware acceleration, and trustworthiness. The authors analyze a wide range of LLM compression methods across multiple models and datasets, providing valuable insights and experimental results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is innovative, considering various LLM compression methods, unlike existing benchmarks that focus solely on performance.
2. It evaluates a broad spectrum of compression techniques, offering a thorough analysis across different models and datasets.
3. The organization and clarity of the paper, supported by numerous charts, facilitate reader comprehension.

Weaknesses:
1. The design of the sixth track is overly simplistic, and the performance metrics on TruthfulQA and advGLUE may not accurately reflect model trustworthiness.
2. Some experimental setups lack detailed descriptions, such as the number of shots used and specific configurations for each compression method.
3. The focus is primarily on open-source models, excluding closed-source models like those in the GPT series.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors include results on ANLI for a more comprehensive trustworthiness evaluation.
2. The authors should provide more detailed information on experimental setups, including hyperparameters and the calculation method for inference speed.
3. In Figure 1, it would be beneficial to include overall metrics for each method to enhance clarity.
4. We suggest adding experiments on mathematical tasks to better define "inference ability" in Track 1.
5. The authors should clarify the specific types of compression methods they plan to include in future iterations of the benchmark.
6. We recommend addressing the differences between LLMCBench and other benchmarks like BiBench to highlight its unique contributions.
