### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the switching subgradient method for solving weakly-convex constrained optimization problems. The authors derive the oracle complexity for finding a nearly stationary point in both convex and weakly-convex constrained cases, supported by numerical experiments that validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms in classical machine learning tasks. The method notably matches the complexity of double-loop algorithms while requiring only a single loop implementation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and introduces the first single-loop first-order method for weakly-convex constrained problems, making it more convenient to implement than double-loop algorithms.  
- The theoretical complexity result is clearly stated and competitive, with sound proofs.  
- The rigorous convergence analysis establishes a complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^4}$ for weakly-convex constraints, which is a significant result.  

Weaknesses:  
- There are no obvious weaknesses, but detailed comments are provided in the questions section.  
- The numerical experiments compare a single-loop method with double-loop methods but report the evolution of objective functions over iterations, which is deemed unfair; the evolution over time should be reported instead.  
- The literature review includes an overemphasis on marginally relevant references, which does not directly contribute to the paper's key message.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the convergence of the SSG algorithm when a feasible initial point is not available, specifically addressing what kind of point it converges to. Additionally, the authors should clarify whether the inclusion of equality constraints $g(x)=0$ is permissible under Assumption 4.1. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors extend their analysis to cases where Assumption 4.1 C is removed, such as when $\mathcal{X}$ is unbounded. Lastly, we encourage the authors to refine their literature review to focus more on directly relevant references to enhance the paper's core message.
