### Key Points
This paper examines the relationship between linguistic complexity and the detection of negative emotions, specifically investigating whether texts conveying negative emotions are more complex than those expressing positive ones. The authors analyze the GoEmotions dataset, revealing that negative emotions generally produce more complex text and that transformer-based models struggle with syntactically complex texts. The study's contributions include empirical evidence supporting existing theories and a comprehensive experimental design that utilizes various metrics to assess language complexity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research questions are novel and well-motivated by prior studies.
- The complexity analysis employs a wide range of metrics, enhancing the robustness of the findings.
- The paper is well-written and presents its findings clearly.

Weaknesses:
- The correlation analysis is preliminary, relying on average scores without comprehensive significance testing.
- The emotion detection evaluation lacks depth, with only basic metrics reported.
- Limited generalizability due to reliance on a single dataset, GoEmotions.
- Some parts of the paper are confusing, particularly regarding the motivation for factor analysis and the categorization of features.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the correlation analysis by conducting comprehensive significance tests to support their conclusions. Additionally, the emotion detection evaluation should include more advanced metrics and state-of-the-art models. Clarifying the distinction between emotions experienced by authors and those identified by annotators in the GoEmotions dataset is essential. We also suggest exploring the inclusion of other datasets for emotion detection, such as HurricaneEmo, and providing more detailed analyses of the factors contributing to the complexity of negative language. Lastly, enhancing the clarity of figures and tables, such as converting Table 1 into a stacked bar graph and improving the formatting of Table 2, would benefit the presentation.
