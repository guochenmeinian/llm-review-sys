### Key Points
This paper presents TAGNet, a new model for knowledge graph completion that addresses the limitations of previous path-based GNN methods, specifically the issues of "empty messages" and "redundant messages." The authors propose a truncated version of the Bellman-Ford algorithm to capture paths within a specified range of distances. Empirical results demonstrate that TAGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in transductive settings and competitive results in inductive settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors effectively identify and address shortcomings in GNN-based methods, demonstrating the benefits of their approach through empirical evidence.
- The method shows empirical advantages over past work, with solid theoretical backing.
- The paper is well-presented and clearly articulates the proposed improvements.

Weaknesses:
- The relationship and performance differences between TAGNet and A*Net are not well-explained, leading to confusion regarding their comparative results.
- The writing could be improved for clarity, particularly in defining notation and operators, which may hinder understanding for readers with varying backgrounds.
- The paper lacks a thorough analysis of time complexity and running time, which are crucial for evaluating the model's efficiency.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the performance differences between TAGNet and A*Net, providing clearer insights into their comparative results. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the clarity of the writing by defining all notation and operators within the paper to make it more accessible. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include a detailed analysis of time complexity and running time, as well as comparisons with other efficient KGE models like Nodepiece.
