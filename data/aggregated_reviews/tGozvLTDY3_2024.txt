Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a dynamic RGB-D SLAM system utilizing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) and DROID-SLAM. It employs semantic segmentation masks and depth warping residuals to create motion masks for removing dynamic elements from scenes. The authors propose several strategies, including motion mask generation and hybrid camera tracking, to enhance pose estimation accuracy. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both dynamic and static environments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written, technically sound, and easy to follow.
2. The integration of depth warping residuals with semantic priors for motion mask generation is effective.
3. The method is well-engineered, yielding promising results on dynamic sequences.
4. It is the first dynamic SLAM approach based on 3D Gaussian Splatting.

Weaknesses:
1. The technical novelty is somewhat limited, primarily adding components to existing SLAM methods for dynamic scenarios.
2. The hybrid coarse-to-fine camera tracking appears to rely heavily on DROID-SLAM for the coarse stage, with minimal innovation in the fine stage.
3. The evaluation lacks comparisons with traditional SLAM systems, which could provide a more robust baseline.
4. There is insufficient discussion on the utility of components like the depth warp mask and the criteria for point deletion in the mapping stage.
5. The writing quality and clarity need improvement, with many variables and concepts inadequately defined.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing by defining all variables and concepts properly to avoid ambiguities. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with traditional SLAM systems such as ReFusion and ORB-SLAM3 to strengthen the evaluation. The authors should elaborate on the motion mask generation strategy and provide theoretical analysis for its effectiveness. Furthermore, we encourage the inclusion of MonoGS as a baseline for GS-based SLAM comparisons and a more comprehensive literature survey on related work like Crowd-SLAM and DDN-SLAM. Finally, addressing the limitations and assumptions of the method, particularly regarding the accuracy of semantic segmentation and its impact on real-time processing, would enhance the paper's depth.
