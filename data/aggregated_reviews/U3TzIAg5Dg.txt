Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents GraphHash, a novel approach for reducing the size of embedding tables in recommender systems by leveraging user-item interaction graphs through efficient bipartite graph clustering. GraphHash integrates graph information to enhance model robustness and adaptability, particularly in click-through rate (CTR) prediction tasks where traditional hashing methods often lead to performance degradation due to collisions. The authors conduct extensive experiments demonstrating GraphHash's superior performance compared to various baseline hashing methods, marking a significant advancement in recommendation systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper discusses the utilization of hashing techniques to reduce space complexity in graph-based recommendation tasks, supported by a theoretical analysis connecting modularity objectives and message-passing mechanisms.
- Methodology descriptions are detailed and well-justified.
- Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of GraphHash across multiple datasets and tasks.
- The paper is well-organized and clearly written.

Weaknesses:
- The discussion on modularity in related work is limited, focusing instead on general graph clustering.
- The pseudocode for Algorithm 1 lacks adequate explanation.
- The evaluation does not include stronger algorithms or competitive datasets, limiting the comprehensiveness of comparisons.
- There is insufficient discussion regarding the challenges of deploying GraphHash in real-time systems and the impact of sparse user-item interaction data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on modularity in the related work section to provide a clearer context for their approach. An overview at the beginning of the methodology section would help readers connect the modules more effectively. Additionally, the authors should include a more detailed explanation of the pseudocode for Algorithm 1. To enhance the evaluation, we suggest incorporating stronger baseline algorithms and datasets, such as iALS and RecVAE for top-k item prediction, and benchmarks from the CTR papers with code leaderboard for CTR tasks. Furthermore, the authors should address the practical implications of deploying GraphHash in dynamic environments and discuss how the clustering process may affect performance on inactive users and unpopular items. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore the impact of clustering quality on performance and consider extending GraphHash to incorporate contextual features.
