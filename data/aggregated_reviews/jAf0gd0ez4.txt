### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework for interactive text generation, introducing a new task benchmark and an interactive text-editing model. The authors propose a model trained through user simulators, showcasing that interactivity enhances text generation quality. The paper evaluates various models in both interactive and non-interactive settings, demonstrating performance improvements with increased user interactions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a clear formulation for the interactive text generation task and a user simulator, contributing to the understanding of model interactivity.
- It provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed token editing model, which shows comparable performance to seq2seq baselines while being more suited to the task.
- The findings indicate that interactivity benefits various model architectures and user simulators.

Weaknesses:
- The model description lacks clarity, with some confusing points and insufficient details on ensuring accuracy in the imitation learning model.
- The assumption that all edits are equal regardless of timing in the writing process is questionable, as key edits may have varying impacts.
- Important technical details are relegated to the appendix, making the main text difficult to follow.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the model description and explicitly address the robustness of the model against real user input errors. Additionally, we suggest incorporating critical technical details into the main body of the paper rather than the appendix. The authors should also consider discussing the implications of their assumption regarding edit timing and explore the generalization of their framework beyond the current scope. Finally, addressing the missing references related to collaborative writing and interactive systems would strengthen the paper's foundation.
