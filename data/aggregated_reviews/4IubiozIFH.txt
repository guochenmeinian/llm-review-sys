### Key Points
This paper presents the MCK-Dialog dataset, constructed to enhance dialogue generation through multilingual commonsense knowledge, and proposes the MCK-T5 model for integrating various knowledge sources. The authors demonstrate that their method improves dialogue generation, particularly for low-resource languages, by leveraging commonsense knowledge from multiple languages. Experimental results indicate that models utilizing multilingual commonsense knowledge perform comparably to baseline models and that combining this knowledge with persona data yields the best results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized, concise, and easy to understand.
- Extensive experiments validate the proposed method, showing significant improvements over baselines.
- The dataset construction process is sensible, and the proposed task is well-motivated.
- The study is one of the first to explore multilingual commonsense knowledge in dialogue generation.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed approaches are somewhat straightforward, relying on existing methods.
- There is no comparison with a translate-test baseline, which could provide a competitive reference.
- The marginal performance improvements when combining knowledge from multiple languages raise questions about the necessity of this approach.
- The absence of human evaluation may limit the robustness of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including a comparison with a translate-test baseline to strengthen their claims regarding the advantages of their multilingual approach. Additionally, conducting human evaluations would provide valuable insights into the quality of the generated dialogue responses. Clarifying the knowledge selection process and addressing the confounding factors in the experimental results would enhance the study's rigor. Lastly, we suggest refining the terminology used to describe the task, potentially labeling it as "cross-lingual" knowledge-aware dialogue to reflect its reliance on English and the native language.
