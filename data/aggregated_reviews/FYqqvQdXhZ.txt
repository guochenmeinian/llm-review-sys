Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for extracting "intrinsic images" such as depth, normal, segmentation, albedo, and shading maps from an RGB image using a pre-trained StyleGAN generator model. The authors propose optimizing an offset vector in the StyleGAN "w+" style space to output intrinsic images instead of RGB images, utilizing a small dataset of generated images and their corresponding intrinsic images predicted by state-of-the-art (SOTA) models as guidance. The method is shown to perform comparably to SOTA methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach is valuable for exploring the information contained in generative models like StyleGAN, revealing surprising insights about the semantic and 3D scene understanding present in 2D generative models.
- The authors demonstrate the method's generality by applying it across multiple data modalities.
- The paper includes clear examples of cases where the method fails, highlighting its limitations effectively.
- Quantitative and qualitative comparisons with relevant baselines are provided, along with helpful visualizations.

Weaknesses:
- The method's performance is dependent on a small labeled dataset, raising questions about its generalizability across different datasets and the impact of varying the number of labeled image pairs used for training.
- The evaluation lacks a clear ground truth, as SOTA predictions are used instead; the authors should consider using the test set of SOTA methods as ground truth for a more robust comparison.
- There is ambiguity regarding the L1 depth metric results, as the proposed method appears to perform better quantitatively while being qualitatively inferior.
- The paper primarily evaluates the method on the LSUN Bedroom dataset, limiting the assessment of its broader applicability to other datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the labeled dataset details, specifying the number of labeled images used for optimization. Additionally, we suggest exploring the method's performance on various datasets beyond LSUN Bedroom to assess its generalizability. The authors should also consider using the test set of SOTA methods as ground truth for evaluation and clarify the discrepancies in depth metric performance. Finally, revisiting the abstract to clearly outline the problem, motivation, solution, and results would enhance its informativeness.
