Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for disentangling relevant manifold directions in the latent space of manifold learning normalizing flows (MLF). The authors propose the canonical manifold flow (CMF), which enforces orthogonality in the Jacobian matrix through a new cost function that includes a penalty term targeting the off-diagonal entries of the Gram matrix. The effectiveness of CMF is demonstrated through experiments on synthetic, tabular, and image data, showing improved latent representations compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written with a comprehensive theoretical background and illustrative examples.  
- The experimental results are thorough, showcasing the advantages of CMF over other manifold learning methods.  
- The proposed regularization scheme is computationally efficient and contributes to the clarity of the learned representations.  

Weaknesses:  
- The contribution appears marginal, with similarities to existing work, particularly regarding the penalty term proposed in [1].  
- The paper lacks comparisons with several relevant methods, including PCA and ICA, and does not adequately address the computational costs associated with CMF.  
- Presentation issues, including numerous typos and unclear definitions, detract from the overall quality of the manuscript.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with the penalty term from [1], clarifying the differences and justifying the unconstrained diagonal entries. Additionally, including comparisons with [2] and [3] would strengthen the paper's contribution. We suggest that the authors clarify the reasoning behind Definition 4.1 and ensure consistency in notation throughout the manuscript. Addressing the computational cost of CMF relative to other methods is crucial, as is providing more extensive experiments with diverse datasets. Finally, we advise a thorough proofreading to eliminate typos and enhance clarity in the presentation.
