### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the integration of spatial information with Merfish using Graph Neural Networks (GNN), specifically analyzing the performance differences between full-graph and sub-graph representations of the mouse brain dataset. The evaluation indicates that the sub-graph representation achieves superior accuracy, likely due to a more favorable information-to-noise ratio in local environments compared to global ones.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The exploration of performance differences between full-graph and sub-graph methods is intriguing and highlights significant findings.

Weaknesses:  
- The manuscript lacks clarity regarding the training procedure, particularly the NO SSL aspect, and does not provide sufficient details about the training data. There is also a need for a more extensive discussion and comparison of spatial transcriptomics methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity on the training process, especially regarding the NO SSL component, and provide more information about the training data used. Additionally, the authors should consider discussing and comparing more spatial transcriptomics methods to strengthen the study. It would also be beneficial to analyze SSL performance on non-graph-based data representations for cell classification and to explore enhanced graphical representations and refined self-supervised learning techniques.
