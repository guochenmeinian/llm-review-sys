Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents FFNet, a flow-based feature fusion framework designed for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative 3D object detection (VIC3D). FFNet addresses challenges related to temporal asynchrony and communication costs by transmitting feature flow instead of static feature maps. The authors propose a self-supervised training method that enhances feature prediction and mitigates temporal fusion errors. Experimental results on the DAIR-V2X dataset demonstrate FFNet's superior performance compared to existing cooperative methods while significantly reducing transmission costs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The task of vehicle-infrastructure cooperative 3D object detection is crucial and has practical applications.
- The writing is clear and the overall pipeline is well-designed, effectively addressing transmission speed and bandwidth.
- FFNet shows solid performance across various latency scenarios, achieving the best results with reduced transmission data.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation is limited to a single class and dataset, which weakens the claims of effectiveness. Broader testing on additional classes and datasets is necessary.
- The comparison with existing methods like V2VNet and DiscoNet may not be fair, as these were not designed to address communication latency.
- The literature review lacks sufficient references to closely related works, and the abbreviation of models is confusing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by conducting experiments on additional labeled classes, such as bus, truck, or van, and on other datasets to strengthen their claims. Additionally, a comparison of memory footprint with existing methods should be included to address concerns about memory consumption. Clarifying the definitions and distinctions between model abbreviations will enhance understanding. Finally, we suggest incorporating more closely related works in the literature review and considering the inclusion of advanced models like SyncNet for a more comprehensive evaluation.
