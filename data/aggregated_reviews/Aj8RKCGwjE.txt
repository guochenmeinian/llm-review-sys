Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework for modeling partial differential equations (PDEs) using local neural fields, featuring a flexible encoder-decoder architecture that accommodates various data types, including regular grids and point clouds. The authors employ a diffusion-based transformer to enhance stability and extend the model's predictive capabilities. Empirical results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness across multiple 1D and 2D PDE problems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed framework integrates existing techniques, such as local neural fields and cross-attention, in a coherent manner, effectively illustrating their benefits for PDE modeling.
- Empirical performance is robust across several benchmarks, showcasing the model's capability to capture complex dynamical behaviors.
- The paper is well-organized and easy to follow, making the methodology accessible to the audience.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for using a VAE-type encoder-decoder lacks sufficient justification, particularly regarding the constraints imposed by Gaussian distributions on latent feature representation.
- The computational efficiency of the diffusion-based transformer may be a concern, especially in comparison to deterministic single-step predictors, as it requires more neural function evaluations (NFE).
- The framework's performance on larger datasets and chaotic systems remains untested, and the stability of results is not guaranteed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the VAE-type encoder-decoder by detailing its advantages over deterministic auto-encoders and addressing the potential limitations of Gaussian distributions in representing complex dynamics. Additionally, we suggest conducting an ablation study on the latent dynamics modeling component to clarify the benefits of the diffusion-based transformer compared to alternatives like NeuralODEs or neural spectral methods. Finally, the authors should explore the scalability of their approach to larger datasets and more chaotic systems, as well as provide visual results for specific cases like the cylinder and aerofoil.
