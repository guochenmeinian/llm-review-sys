### Key Points
This paper presents a formal model of an authentication protocol based on the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) paradigm, utilizing W3C digital identifiers (DIDs) and verified credentials (VCs). The authors develop an applied pi-calculus model that is verifiable with ProVerif and DeepSec, deriving security goals such as authentication, secrecy, and unlinkability from Allen's SSI principles. The verification process reveals three potential attacks due to omitted optional fields and indicates that while plain VCs ensure unlinkability from the issuer's perspective, they may allow user tracking by verifiers. The authors propose a variant using anonymized VCs with zero-knowledge proofs to enhance unlinkability from the verifier's viewpoint.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors develop a comprehensive model of an authentication protocol aligned with SSI principles, ensuring authentication, secrecy, and unlinkability.
- The verification process uncovers new issues in the message exchange protocols.
- All artifacts, including ProVerif and DeepSec scripts and outputs, are well documented and accessible.

Weaknesses:
- Related work is inadequately discussed, with only one reference cited, making it challenging to position the work within existing literature.
- The paper lacks a dedicated section on related work, which could clarify the paper's contributions relative to existing proposals.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related work by including a dedicated section that addresses existing protocols that formally verify SSI in the Web context. Additionally, we suggest referencing Appendix C.2/3 when introducing security goals in the main text. The authors should also consider expanding Section 4.3 for better clarity and linking Section 5.2 more explicitly to the proved properties. Furthermore, a deeper discussion on the relationship between their work and existing implementations, as well as the steps needed for extending formal verification to practical applications, would enhance the paper's impact.
