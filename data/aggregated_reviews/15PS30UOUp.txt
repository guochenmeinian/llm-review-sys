### Key Points
This paper presents a global, multi-temporal SAR dataset for flood mapping, incorporating both Level-1 GRD and SLC products. The dataset includes manually annotated flood events and a large unlabeled dataset to address the scarcity of flood data. The authors also constructed a benchmark featuring various semantic segmentation models. However, the necessity and performance of the dataset compared to previous datasets are not clearly articulated.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The dataset includes both coregistered GRD and SLC SAR data.
2. It features extensive manual annotations by a team of experts.
3. The paper is well written and provides sufficient documentation on data collection and organization.

Weaknesses:
1. The dataset's superiority over previous datasets is not well clarified.
2. The number of collected flood events is relatively small, and the distribution is heavily concentrated in Europe and coastal areas.
3. The labels for waterbodies could be more detailed, and the potential for sequential prediction is not fully explored.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the dataset's superiority over previous datasets. Additionally, the authors should provide a more balanced comparison of the labeled and unlabeled samples in Table 1. It would be beneficial to include a detailed assessment of the SLC dataset's performance relative to other models in the benchmark. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors consider incorporating S2 data for improved flood mapping and address the challenges associated with using S1 in urban areas. Lastly, a more intuitive dataset name that includes "Floods" could enhance clarity.
