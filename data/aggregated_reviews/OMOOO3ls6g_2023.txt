Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the OpenLane-V2 dataset, the first dataset focused on topology reasoning for traffic scene structure, building on existing datasets like nuScenes and Argoverse2. The authors introduce two new tasks—traffic element recognition and topology reasoning—alongside the conventional 3D lane perception task. A comprehensive approach to data collection and annotation is proposed, addressing challenges such as the high number of centerlines per frame and the need for domain generalization. The OpenLane-V2 Score is introduced to evaluate model performance, and various state-of-the-art models are quantitatively and qualitatively assessed on this dataset. The dataset includes scenes from various locations, with a focus on ensuring high-quality annotations through multiple validation stages.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset integrates lane perception and traffic signals, enhancing scene understanding and decision-making in autonomous driving.
- OpenLane-V2 utilizes well-known datasets, facilitating its adoption by the research community.
- It addresses a critical gap in publicly available datasets for associating traffic elements with centerlines, vital for autonomous driving.
- The dataset is extensive, comprising 2000 scenes, 2.1M instance-level annotations, and 1.9M topology relationships.
- The authors have implemented rigorous validation processes for annotations, ensuring temporal consistency and topological correctness.
- The inclusion of statistics on data distribution enhances transparency.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a detailed description of the validation stages for manual annotation, raising questions about annotation quality.
- The proposed baselines perform poorly on the $\text{TOP}_{ll}$ metric, indicating potential limitations in model performance.
- The annotation range of +/-50 meters may be insufficient for real-time applications.
- The dataset's diversity is limited, primarily focusing on data collected in the USA, which raises concerns about generalization to other countries.
- Traffic elements are annotated in 2D only, missing potentially useful 3D information for model training.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the description of the multiple validation stages of manual annotation to clarify how high-quality annotations are ensured. Additionally, consider extending the annotation range to better accommodate real-time applications. The authors should address the dataset's geographical limitations by providing a clearer breakdown of scene collection locations and their percentages. Furthermore, incorporating 3D information for traffic element annotations could enhance the centerline-traffic element association. Lastly, we suggest improving the performance of the proposed baselines on the $\text{TOP}_{ll}$ metric to better demonstrate the dataset's utility and exploring methods to include more international scenes to improve generalization capabilities.
