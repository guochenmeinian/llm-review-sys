Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical characterization of perceptually aligned gradients (PAG) in classification neural network models, providing rigorous definitions and a framework connecting PAG to model robustness. It empirically and theoretically demonstrates that models exhibiting off-manifold robustness also have perceptually aligned gradients. The authors propose a quantitative assessment of PAG, which was previously evaluated qualitatively, and identify three levels of robustness in relation to PAG. Additionally, the paper analyzes the parameter sigma, chosen based on human visual analysis and evaluated through the LPIPS metric. The authors indicate that while they aim to estimate the score gradients at \(\sigma \to 0\), practical observations reveal that diffusion models do not recover the correct noise-less score gradients. They clarify the distinction between unconditional and conditional diffusion models, explaining their evaluation methods on different datasets and acknowledging the challenge of obtaining gradients from a Bayes optimal classifier.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents a comprehensive literature review, effectively taxonomizing relevant concepts.
- The mathematical definitions and theorems are intuitive and sound, with minimal assumptions about model behavior.
- It addresses a significant topic, providing a theoretical justification for PAG that was lacking in prior literature.
- The empirical evaluation metrics are thoughtfully chosen, particularly the comparison of PAG to score-based models.
- The authors provide a clear rationale for the choice of the sigma parameter and its implications for diffusion models.
- The distinction between unconditional and conditional diffusion models is well-articulated, enhancing the understanding of their evaluation methods.

Weaknesses:
- The claim regarding noise in lines 106-107 is incorrect; noise can include both on- and off-manifold elements.
- Definition 1 lacks a formal definition of \(x\).
- Theorem 1 does not account for adversarially chosen noise; clarification is needed regarding its applicability to adversarial attacks.
- The discussion of the data manifold in line 151 is incomplete.
- The distinction between signal and distractor features is overly simplistic, potentially weakening the mathematical results.
- The paper lacks clarity regarding the relationship between the gradients of a Bayes optimal classifier and the gradients from the score model, which may lead to confusion about the experimental setup.
- The authors' reliance on proxy gradients instead of directly obtaining Bayes optimal classifier gradients may weaken the robustness of their findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the accuracy of their claims regarding noise by clarifying the nature of noise in their definitions. Additionally, please formalize Definition 1 by including a definition of \(x\). It would be beneficial to mention the implications of adversarial noise in Theorem 1 and to clarify the relationship between the data and signal manifolds in line 151. We suggest revising the definitions of signal and distractor features to account for more complex relationships beyond simple pixel masking. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their explanations regarding the relationship between the gradients of a Bayes optimal classifier and the score model gradients. We also suggest that the authors address the limitations of using proxy gradients more explicitly, perhaps by discussing the implications for their results. Lastly, we encourage the authors to ensure that the revisions clearly delineate the evaluation methods for both conditional and unconditional diffusion models in the main text.
