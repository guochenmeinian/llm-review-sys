Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a modular conditional diffusion framework for image reconstruction, integrating a small module with pre-trained image restoration (IR) networks and diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs). The proposed approach aims to enhance efficiency and applicability across various IR tasks, requiring minimal additional training. Experimental results indicate effective performance on benchmarks such as burst JDD-SR, dynamic scene deblurring, and super-resolution.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The method demonstrates strong performance across multiple tasks, supported by both quantitative and qualitative results.
2. The modular design allows for easy extension with task-specific pre-trained models, enhancing applicability.
3. The framework reduces computational load by minimizing the number of trained modules and employs lightweight networks.

Weaknesses:
- The figures lack quality and clarity, necessitating revisions for better professionalism.
- The modular framework offers limited insight into image restoration, with a clean design that lacks depth.
- The analysis of computational costs, including memory usage and inference time, is insufficient.
- The rationale for selecting specific baseline models and their implementation details is unclear.
- The contribution of the accelerated sampling strategy appears trivial, as similar ideas have been previously proposed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the quality of the figures to enhance clarity and professionalism. Additionally, we suggest providing more qualitative results across various tasks to strengthen the framework's applicability. A detailed computational cost analysis, including memory usage and inference time, should be included. The authors should clarify the implementation details of baseline methods and justify the selection of specific modules. Finally, we advise revisiting the accelerated sampling strategy to highlight its novelty and significance in comparison to existing methods.
