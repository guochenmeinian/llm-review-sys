Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the asymptotic generalization error behavior of overparameterized linear models for multiclass classification under a Gaussian covariates bi-level model. The authors fully characterize the regimes of generalization error, resolving a conjecture posed by Subramanian et al. (2022). They introduce a new variant of the Hanson-Wright inequality, which is particularly useful for multiclass problems with sparse labels.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper offers strong analytical results, including the resolution of a previous conjecture and the establishment of new lower bounds for misclassification rates. It is well-written, with detailed proofs and clear explanations, making it a valuable contribution to the field.

Weaknesses:  
The assumptions regarding the distribution of features are overly simplistic, as they assume independence and identical Gaussian distributions, which limit practical applicability. Additionally, the focus on linear models leaves a gap in addressing deep neural networks, and the paper lacks sufficient intuitions about the results and the bi-level ensemble model.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the bi-level ensemble model, particularly regarding the effective dimensions and their impact on prediction. It would be beneficial to elaborate on the different regimes of the theorems, specifically why having \( r \) close to 1 or a small \( p - (q + r) \) would hinder the learner. Furthermore, we suggest extending the discussion on the implications of their results for more realistic setups, as the current scope appears narrow. Lastly, addressing the practical applications of the bi-level model and the effects of model misspecification on generalization guarantees would enhance the paper's relevance.
