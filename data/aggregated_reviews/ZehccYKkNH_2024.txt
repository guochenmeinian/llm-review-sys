Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a fine-grained analysis of stability results for persistent homology with new theoretical guarantees for topological data analysis methods. The authors prove three new theorems regarding the stability of persistence diagrams under Bottleneck and Wasserstein distances, contingent on certain assumptions. The results are novel and relevant for both theoretical and applied purposes, particularly in stochastic topology.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The results are strong, interesting, and provide significant mathematical guarantees that enhance the explainability of persistent homology in data analysis.  
- The paper is well-written, clear, and contains relevant references, making it accessible to the audience.  
- The probabilistic convergence result precisely identifies the conditions under which convergence occurs.

Weaknesses:  
- The reliance on the manifold hypothesis and the absence of noise presents serious limitations, particularly regarding practical applications.  
- The analysis is based on Cech persistence rather than the more commonly used Vietoris-Rips persistence, which may restrict its applicability.  
- The connection to machine learning is not sufficiently elaborated, potentially limiting the paper's relevance to the conference audience.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the connection between their theoretical results and practical applications in machine learning, particularly in Section 4.4. Additionally, we encourage the authors to explore the implications of their results under conditions of noise and non-generic manifolds, as well as to consider including comparisons with alternative methods such as the empirical distribution of pairwise distances. Addressing these aspects could enhance the paper's relevance and applicability.
