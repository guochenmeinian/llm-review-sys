### Key Points
This paper presents a method for assessing the capabilities of LLMs in reasoning about new knowledge through the introduction of KNOWGEN, a knowledge generation technique that formulates new artificial knowledge using an existing ontology. The authors utilize the Encyclopedia of Life to create new entities and evaluate LLMs' performance on question answering tasks involving these entities. The results indicate that current LLMs struggle with reasoning about new knowledge, highlighting the importance of this evaluation method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper proposes an effective dataset construction method for evaluating LLMs on new knowledge.
- The approach is clever, scalable, and connects new entities to existing knowledge, enhancing the relevance of the evaluation.
- Detailed experiments provide insights into LLM performance and error analysis related to entity properties.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation is limited to only four LLMs, which may not provide a comprehensive view of model capabilities.
- There is a lack of complete examples from the dataset, making it difficult to interpret the input/output for the LLMs.
- Insufficient coverage of related work and unclear generalizability of the method for generating new entities and relations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation scope by including more LLMs to ensure a more holistic outcome. Additionally, providing complete examples from the dataset would clarify the nature of the input/output for the LLMs. The authors should also clarify the implications of the KD and KA scores and consider including baseline performance metrics for existing EOL entities to contextualize the results. Finally, addressing the comparability of results across models and expanding the analysis of performance across different modifications would strengthen the findings.
