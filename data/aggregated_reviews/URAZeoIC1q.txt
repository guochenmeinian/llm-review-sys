Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel large margin classifier, HoroSVM, which utilizes horospheres as decision boundaries in hyperbolic space. The authors demonstrate that the resulting optimization problem is convex, allowing for the use of gradient-based methods to find a global optimum. The paper includes empirical comparisons showing HoroSVM's competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios involving noisy labels and hierarchical data structures.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces an innovative approach by defining SVMs on horospheres, which is theoretically sound and well-motivated.
2. The proof of geodesic convexity for the loss function is a significant contribution, supporting the claim of superior optimization properties.
3. The experiments effectively illustrate the robustness of HoroSVM, especially in low-dimensional spaces and with noisy labels.

Weaknesses:
1. The computational speed of the proposed algorithm is not discussed, despite its potential advantages over Hyperboloid SVM due to convexity.
2. The performance of HoroSVM in higher dimensions (D > 2) is unclear, and the authors should address how D is selected in practical applications.
3. Comparisons with kernel SVMs are lacking, which could provide insights into the handling of latent data structures.
4. The experiments primarily utilize synthetic data, raising concerns about their applicability to real-world scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the computational speed of HoroSVM and its advantages over Hyperboloid SVM. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of HoroSVM's performance in higher dimensions and clarify the selection process for D in real-world applications. A comparison with kernel SVMs would also enhance the paper's contributions. Lastly, incorporating cost-sensitive weights to address dataset imbalances could strengthen the findings.
