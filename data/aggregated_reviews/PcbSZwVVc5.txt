Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel dataset, DreamCatcher, developed for wearable ear-worn device-based sleep event detection, addressing the challenges of monitoring sleep in shared environments. The dataset includes synchronized audio and motion data from 24 participants, capturing eight different sleep events. The authors aim to inspire further research in efficient human voice activity detection using ear-worn devices, highlighting the importance of understanding sleep patterns in co-sleeping scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The dataset is well-curated and open access, promoting community research.
2. It includes extensive synchronized audio and motion data, making it the largest sleep dataset to date.
3. The binary classification task focuses on distinguishing audio events from the wearer versus others, a novel aspect in sleep monitoring research.

Weaknesses:
1. The dataset is limited in size and may not support generalizable model development.
2. There are several small errors in the documentation, including typos and unclear dataset organization.
3. The dataset is highly imbalanced, particularly regarding rare sleep events.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the documentation by explicitly stating the dataset fields, handling of missing values, and organization details. Additionally, addressing the dataset imbalance through resampling or data augmentation methods would enhance its utility. We suggest that the authors consider exploring broader research directions enabled by the dataset, such as its potential applications in monitoring heart-related or digestion-related events. Finally, clarifying how the earable technology's comfort and usability may affect sleep events would strengthen the paper's completeness.
