Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a methodology for comparing fairness methods in binary classification, focusing on categorizations of methods, group composition, fairness definitions, and expected model output distributions. The authors propose a benchmarking framework, ABCFair, to address comparability challenges in evaluating fairness methods across different approaches (pre/in/post-processing) and draw insights from a public dual label dataset with biased and unbiased labels.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively outlines the comparability challenges in fairness benchmarking and details the desiderata for an effective framework.
- It compares all three stages of the ML pipeline (pre-processing, in-processing, post-processing), providing generalizable insights.
- The distinction between biased and unbiased labels is crucial for evaluating algorithmic fairness, and the results from the dual label dataset are interesting.

Weaknesses:
- Clarity and formalism are significant issues; the methodology is poorly described, particularly in Section 3.3, and important metrics are not well-defined.
- The results are difficult to interpret, especially Tables 4, 5, and 6, and the paper relies on a single dataset, which is inadequate for a benchmark study.
- Some claims in the motivation lack evidence and are overly bold.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and formalism of the methodology, ensuring that important metrics and quantities are well-defined. The description of results should be clearer, particularly regarding the meaning of Tables 4, 5, and 6, and the definition of $k$ in Section 3.3. Additionally, we suggest expanding the dataset used for experiments to enhance the benchmarking aspect of the paper. The abstract should be more self-contained and clearly outline the contributions. We also encourage the authors to provide better documentation and usage examples for the ABCFair framework, including example notebooks to facilitate user engagement. Finally, consider revising Figure 2 for improved interpretability, possibly by splitting it into smaller plots.
