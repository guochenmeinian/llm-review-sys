Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a two-phase learning framework called HubRouter for global routing in chip design. The first phase generates hubs representing tiles, while the second phase constructs a routing Steiner minimum tree (RSMT) using an actor-critic model. HubRouter aims to address the inconnectivity issues seen in prior methods by transforming the pin-pin problem into hub-pin problems. Experimental results indicate that HubRouter achieves higher correctness and shorter wire length compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. HubRouter's innovative approach of using hubs for global routing effectively mitigates inconnectivity issues by treating the routing design process as image generation.
2. It outperforms SOTA models in terms of correctness and wire length, particularly for large chips.
3. The model demonstrates good scalability with generative models like GAN or VAE while minimizing wire length and overflow.
4. The hub-generation phase also produces routes and masks to reduce noise, with the stripe mask being particularly beneficial for complex cases.

Weaknesses:
1. Overflow issues persist in the generated global routing, despite improvements over PRNet.
2. The paper lacks discussion on the quality of generated routes concerning congestion and the potential inability to create novel routes due to limited routing design knowledge.
3. The independence of the two phases may lead to suboptimal results, as feedback from the second phase does not influence hub generation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the generation of the stripe mask for chips. Additionally, consider defining pixels as hubs that connect only two neighbors on the same row or column to enhance route generation directionality. It would also be beneficial to discuss how ground truth is established and its potential impact on the hub generation process. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors clarify the selection criteria for generative models in different scenarios and elaborate on the significance of the connectivity problem to strengthen the motivation for their approach. Lastly, providing separate timings for the generation and connection phases would enhance the understanding of time overhead in the process.
