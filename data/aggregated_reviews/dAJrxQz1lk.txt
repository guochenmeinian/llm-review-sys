Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents A*Net, a scalable path-based approach for reasoning on extensive knowledge graphs (KGs), inspired by the A* algorithm for shortest-path problems. A*Net incorporates a priority function to select crucial nodes and edges, effectively addressing scalability challenges associated with path-based methods. The authors argue that the alignment with the A* algorithm is justified due to the inaccessibility of the absolute goal in knowledge graph reasoning, necessitating the use of the source node \( u \) and the relative goal \( q \). The empirical results demonstrate significant improvements in time and memory efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art results on the large-scale KG reasoning dataset, ogbl-wikikg2. The authors provide ablation studies that illustrate the significance of the relative goal \( \mathbf{q} \) in the priority function, aligning with the intuition of the A* algorithm.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- A*Net is an efficient GNN for link prediction with good scalability.
- The application of the A* algorithm's principles to path reasoning is intriguing, and the method shows impressive results across various KGs.
- The experimental results indicate substantial efficiency improvements compared to top-performing baselines, such as NBFNet.
- The authors provide a detailed explanation of the alignment between A*Net and the A* algorithm.
- The ablation studies effectively illustrate the importance of the relative goal \( \mathbf{q} \) in enhancing performance.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical contributions of A*Net are incremental compared to NBFNet, and the analogy to the A* algorithm may be overstated.
- The design of the priority function lacks clarity, particularly regarding the introduction of parameter sharing and the reasoning task's relationship to weak supervision.
- The performance of A*Net is slightly inferior to NBFNet in some cases, and the lack of results for tail prediction raises concerns.
- The argument regarding the different inductive biases of \( \mathbf{h}_q(\cdot) \) and \( \mathbf{g}(\cdot) \) lacks clarity, leaving the correspondence between A*Net and the A* algorithm ambiguous.
- The explanation of how \( \mathbf{h}_q(\cdot) \) and \( \mathbf{g}(\cdot) \) model different information is insufficiently detailed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the priority function's design, particularly in explaining how the parameter sharing between the priority function and predictor contributes to the model's performance. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed comparison of A*Net's performance against NBFNet, especially regarding tail prediction. It would also be beneficial to clarify the implications of the priority function's independence from the goal in the context of the A* algorithm. Furthermore, we recommend improving the clarity of the argument regarding the distinct roles of \( \mathbf{h}_q(\cdot) \) and \( \mathbf{g}(\cdot) \) to strengthen the correspondence with the A* algorithm. Lastly, we suggest that the authors provide a more explicit explanation of the different information modeled by these functions to enhance understanding.
