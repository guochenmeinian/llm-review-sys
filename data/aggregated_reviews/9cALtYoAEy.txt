### Key Points
This paper presents a method for enhancing paraphrase generation through the use of quantized prompts, leveraging a vector-quantization strategy to encode prompts and generate paraphrases from a dynamically updated codebook using a k-means algorithm. The authors propose that the number of abstract transforming patterns for paraphrase generation is finite, which underpins their approach. The model, VQPrompt, is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance through both automatic and human evaluations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed quantized-prompt method empirically improves the quality and diversity of paraphrase generation.
2. The motivation for using quantized prompts to encode paraphrase rules is reasonable and well-articulated.
3. The paper reports state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets, showcasing effective use of pre-trained language models like T5 and Flan-T5.
4. The interpretability of learned prompts is emphasized, providing transparency in the paraphrase generation process.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the approach is questioned due to similarities with existing works, particularly regarding the model architecture and k-means algorithm usage.
2. The claim that learned prompts can encode syntax-related information lacks sufficient experimental support.
3. Concerns arise about the generalizability of quantized prompts across different datasets and domains, as this property was not adequately examined.
4. The writing style and presentation could be improved for clarity, particularly regarding notations and the explanation of complex concepts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their writing, particularly in Section 3, by clearly defining notations and ensuring consistency in terminology. Additionally, we suggest providing a more thorough discussion of the differences between this work and related literature to clarify its novelty. The authors should also address the scalability and generalization of the VQPrompt model by evaluating it on a broader range of datasets and discussing potential limitations and negative scenarios. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore the implications of using different pre-trained models and the impact of hyper-parameter tuning on performance. Lastly, a more detailed analysis of codebook maintenance and its computational trade-offs would enhance the paper's depth.
