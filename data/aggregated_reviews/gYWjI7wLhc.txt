Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to risk stratification for time-to-event data in the presence of right-censoring, utilizing a differentiable sorting algorithm to solve the proportional hazard model. The authors introduce Diffsurv, which focuses on top-k risk prediction, and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets. They provide empirical results indicating that Diffsurv outperforms traditional models like the Cox Partial Likelihood (CPL) in terms of C-index within the top-k groups across various datasets. The authors also investigate the role of transitivity in the proportional hazards survival model and acknowledge the importance of understanding the ordering within the top-k individuals.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- The authors extend the differentiable sorting network to accommodate right-censoring, applying it effectively to survival analysis.
- The investigation into the role of transitivity in the proportional hazards survival model is noteworthy.
- The proposed method achieves comparable or improved risk ranking performance in experiments.
- Additional experiments have been conducted to explore varying Top K% and corresponding C-index performance, enhancing the robustness of their findings.
- The authors effectively address concerns regarding the utility of top-k risk prediction in clinical settings, highlighting Diffsurv's advantages over CPL.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental and theoretical advantages of Diffsurv over the CPL model are not sufficiently clear, raising questions about its necessity.
- The method shows limited improvement in real-world datasets compared to CPL, suggesting questionable real-world applicability.
- The writing contains numerous typos and grammatical errors, detracting from clarity.
- The motivation for using a listwise sorting method over pairwise sorting is not adequately articulated.
- The experiments lack a comprehensive evaluation of predictive power and qualitative analysis of the proposed method's benefits.
- There remains uncertainty about Diffsurv's alignment with conventional survival analysis, as it does not produce traditional survival curves.
- The authors have not sufficiently clarified the advantages of Diffsurv compared to CPL in standard survival analysis contexts, particularly regarding proportional hazards models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their writing by addressing the numerous typos and grammatical errors throughout the paper. Additionally, the authors should clearly articulate the motivation for the listwise sorting method and provide a formal definition of the transitive property in survival data. It would be beneficial to include a computational cost analysis comparing Diffsurv and CPL, as well as to expand the experimental benchmarks to include a broader range of state-of-the-art deep learning methods. We also recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding Diffsurv's role within survival analysis by explicitly stating its limitations and potential as a distinct task. Furthermore, the authors should explore ways to derive the survival function from Diffsurv to facilitate evaluation as a complete survival analysis model. Lastly, we suggest refining the notation used in the manuscript to enhance reader comprehension, particularly in relation to the sampling indices.
