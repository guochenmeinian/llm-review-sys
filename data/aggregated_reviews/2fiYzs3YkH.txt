Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ProjDiff, a method for addressing noisy inverse problems using diffusion models by reframing them as a two-variable constrained optimization problem. The authors derive a two-variable ELBO as a proxy for the log-prior and solve the optimization via projection gradient descent. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on image restoration tasks, source separation, and partial generation tasks, demonstrating competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and easy to follow.
- Extensive numerical results are provided, showcasing significant improvements in source separation compared to baselines.
- The approach of reparametrizing noisy measurements as intermediate samples in the diffusion process is innovative.

Weaknesses:
- The prior work section lacks comprehensiveness, and the performance gains over baseline methods, particularly for noisy restoration tasks, are not convincingly demonstrated.
- The assumption of Gaussian noise limits applicability to other noise types, and the method's reliance on known noise levels raises concerns about robustness.
- The theoretical analysis is poorly organized, with proofs not clearly presented, and the abstract does not accurately reflect the method used.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comprehensiveness of the prior work section and provide a clearer justification for performance claims, particularly regarding the choice of baseline methods. It would be beneficial to include comparisons with DDNM+ and $\Pi$GDM, as well as recent state-of-the-art methods like ReSample and DiffPIR. Additionally, we suggest revising the theoretical analysis for better clarity and organization, including explicit proofs for Lemmas and Propositions. The authors should also clarify the implications of their assumptions regarding noise and consider conducting hyperparameter tuning and ablation studies to enhance the robustness of their findings. Lastly, addressing the motivation behind utilizing diffusion models more clearly in the introduction would strengthen the paper's contribution to the literature.
