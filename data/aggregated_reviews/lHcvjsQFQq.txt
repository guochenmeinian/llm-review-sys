Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to behavioral cloning (BC) called DrilDICE, which addresses the vulnerability to covariate shift due to mismatches between the state distributions from the learned policy and the data collection policy. The authors propose a robust BC training objective and utilize a stationary distribution correction ratio estimation (DICE) to derive a feasible solution. The effectiveness of DrilDICE is evaluated through extensive experiments across various covariate shift scenarios, including discrete navigation tasks, Mujoco control tasks, and the Four Rooms environment. The authors clarify their problem setting, emphasizing that they do not assume a stationary data distribution and focus on shifts in the distribution rather than time. Additional experiments demonstrate DrilDICE's data efficiency and robustness against simulated shifts and partial coverage issues.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and organized.
2. The proposed method, DrilDICE, appears promising and consistently demonstrates superior performance across multiple scenarios and datasets, particularly in comparison to DR-BC.
3. A wide range of covariate shift scenarios is explored in the experiments, and the authors effectively address reviewer concerns regarding problem setting and experimental robustness, enhancing the manuscript's clarity and credibility.

Weaknesses:
1. The experimental results do not convincingly demonstrate advantages over baseline methods.
2. The new setting introduced is not well-supported, as all experiments are validated based on simulated shifts, which may diminish excitement about the findings.
3. The performance of DrilDICE is contingent on the choice of $f$-divergence, which may limit its applicability in certain contexts.
4. The method is not specifically designed to tackle partial coverage issues, which could be a limitation in some applications.
5. Some notations, such as $\Delta S$ in Equation 2 and $\mathcal{W}$ in Equation 5, are not clearly defined.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of notations and definitions, particularly for $\Delta S$ and $\mathcal{W}$. Additionally, we suggest providing further details in Section 3.2, including explicit mention of Slater's condition and examples of $f$ and $f'$ to enhance understanding. The authors should also consider expanding the comparison with previous works, especially with reference [18], to highlight the differences in approach and contributions. Furthermore, conducting more evaluations in real-world scenarios, rather than solely relying on simulated covariate shifts, would strengthen the paper's impact. Finally, we recommend improving the discussion on the implications of the choice of $f$-divergence for DrilDICE's performance and exploring strategies to enhance its robustness in scenarios involving partial coverage, which could broaden its applicability.
