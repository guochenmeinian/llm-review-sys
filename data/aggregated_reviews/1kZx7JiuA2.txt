Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Implicit Transfer Operator (ITO) learning, which aims to learn a surrogate for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The ITO method allows for efficient simulation across multiple time scales by using larger time steps, addressing the high computational cost of traditional MD simulations. The authors propose a conditional diffusion model to sample unnormalized densities, specifically targeting the Boltzmann distribution of molecules. The method incorporates SE(3) equivariant architectures, demonstrating potential in molecular dynamics tasks with coarse-grained representations. Additionally, the paper discusses SE(3)-equivariant and E(3)-equivariant architectures, emphasizing the importance of understanding these concepts correctly. The authors acknowledge the need for clearer explanations and plan to emphasize multiple time-scale training in their contributions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method has strong theoretical foundations and effectively integrates SE(3) equivariance, enhancing the modeling of molecular dynamics.
- The approach is innovative, tackling the important task of sampling Boltzmann distributions and showing potential for significant speedup in MD simulations.
- The paper is well-structured, balancing introduction, methodology, and experiments, with illustrative examples that demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
- The authors show willingness to revise and clarify their methodology and results based on reviewer feedback, recognizing the potential for their model to improve molecular dynamics simulations.

Weaknesses:
- The contributions, while interesting, lack depth; the modifications to the existing PaiNN architecture are minimal and not convincingly justified.
- Results show significant errors, particularly in free energy differences and mean first passage times, raising concerns about the practical applicability of the method.
- There is a lack of clarity regarding the implications of SE(3)-equivariance versus E(3)-equivariance.
- The paper lacks sufficient comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and does not provide reproducible code, limiting the evaluation of its effectiveness.
- Some experimental suggestions are seen as less relevant or unclear in their significance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their theoretical framework, particularly regarding the transfer operator theory and the implications of SE(3)-equivariance versus E(3)-equivariance, to enhance understanding. It is essential to clarify the necessity of breaking symmetry in their model and to provide a more detailed explanation of the transition density plot in Figure 4. Additionally, we suggest including more comprehensive comparisons with existing methods to validate the effectiveness of the SE(3) equivariant architecture. To address the high error rates observed, the authors should explore ways to improve quantitative agreement for observables like free energy differences. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide reproducible code and detailed experimental setups to facilitate evaluation. Lastly, a clearer discussion on the limitations of generalizability and the practical implications of their findings, as well as the inclusion of a VAMP-2 score plot and refined figures for clarity in the camera-ready version, would strengthen the manuscript.
