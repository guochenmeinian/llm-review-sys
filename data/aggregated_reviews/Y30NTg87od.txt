### Key Points
This paper presents Implicit Sense-labeled Connective Recognition (ISCR), focusing on identifying sense labels and connectives between adjacent text spans. The authors propose three generation-based models that achieve promising results on PDTB3.0, outperforming a vanilla classifier in ISCR and connective prediction. However, their combined approach does not surpass state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the traditional Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition (IDRR) task.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The generation-based models effectively address ISCR, particularly with uneven label distributions.  
- The paper's motivation to predict both discourse relations and connectives is forward-looking, enhancing discourse modeling.  
- Clear abstract and interesting examples, such as Figure 2, contribute to the paper's clarity.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper primarily applies existing methods to a similar task, lacking novelty.  
- The motivation for using generation models over classification models is unclear, particularly regarding label distribution.  
- Performance on the traditional IDRR task does not exceed previous SOTA, raising concerns about the paper's contributions.  
- Some experimental settings and results, such as those in Table 2 and Figure 4, require further clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their motivation, particularly in relation to the ambiguity of connectives and its connection to ISCR. It would be beneficial to discuss the differences between ISCR and multi-level implicit discourse relation recognition. Additionally, presenting both level 1 and level 2 performances in Table 2, as well as including test frequencies of the top 20 connective X relation combinations in Figure 4, would enhance the analysis. The authors should also clarify the necessity of predicting the PDTB label again in the CCG model shown in Figure 3. Lastly, we suggest improving the writing quality throughout the paper, excluding the abstract.
