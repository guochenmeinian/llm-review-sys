### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of symmetric neural networks (NNs) applied to high-energy physics (HEP) problems using LHC data. The authors propose the use of quantum graph neural networks (GNNs) with appropriate symmetries, specifically Lie equivariance, to enhance inference capabilities. They compare their quantum network (LEQNN) results with a classical counterpart, LorentzNet, but lack context regarding the significance of their performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The application of quantum machine learning to particle physics is innovative, leveraging geometric deep learning principles to respect Lorentz group symmetry.
- The authors provide a public code repository, promoting transparency and reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- The paper does not cite previous works on quantum GNNs, raising questions about its novelty.
- The relationship between the proposed method and the Ising model is unclear.
- Key terms and concepts, such as LEQB in Fig. 2, are not adequately defined.
- The empirical performance comparison lacks context regarding the difficulty of achieving results comparable to LorentzNet and does not address the implications of hardware and shot noise in quantum training.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the contextualization of their results by explaining the significance of achieving performance comparable to LorentzNet and whether this is a challenging feat for classical architectures. Additionally, empirical evidence demonstrating significantly better performance of quantum networks over LorentzNets should be included, particularly addressing issues like barren plateaus.

Clarification is needed regarding the training conditions of the quantum system, specifically whether it assumes a noiseless implementation. The authors should discuss how noise from NISQ devices might affect their results.

We also suggest that the authors provide more details on the architecture of their quantum circuit, including the number of layers used and the measurement process. A clearer illustration of the layers would enhance understanding. Finally, we recommend adding a section that elaborates on the equivariance of their quantum circuit architecture under the Lorentz group, potentially replacing the current section on quantum graph neural networks, which appears tangential.
