Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a decompositional approach to evaluate and enhance a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model using complex input prompts. The authors propose a new metric, the Decompositional-Alignment-Score (DA-Score), which utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to break down difficult captions into disjoint assertions, evaluated by a Visual Question Answering (VQA) model. This metric correlates better with human ratings and facilitates iterative refinement of generated images, improving fidelity on complex prompts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and addresses a significant problem in text-to-image generation.
- The DA-score is well-motivated and shows improved correlation with human ratings.
- The use of an LLM to generate diverse input prompts is novel and effective.
- Quantitative and visual results demonstrate strong performance, particularly with creative input captions.

Weaknesses:
- The related work section could benefit from including early approaches that combine text-to-image with VQA models.
- The evaluation metric's similarity to existing work (e.g., TIFA) should be acknowledged.
- Reliance on user studies for quantitative results may limit the robustness of comparisons; additional metrics like T2TScore could enhance validation.
- The performance of the VQA model is crucial and its reliability needs further assessment.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section by including early approaches to text-to-image and VQA integration. Additionally, it would be beneficial to acknowledge the similarities with TIFA and provide quantitative assessments of the VQA model's performance. Incorporating results from other metrics, such as T2TScore, would strengthen the evaluation. Finally, consider using more recent generative models like stable diffusion 2.1 to assess the alignment method's effectiveness on advanced architectures.
