Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Gaussian variational inference approach for training binary neural networks (BNNs) through a low-rank semidefinite programming (SDP) formulation. The authors propose the Variational Inference Semidefinite Programming Algorithm (VISPA), which aims to enhance accuracy by modeling pairwise correlations among weights. The empirical evaluation demonstrates that VISPA achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with a clear motivation for the problem formulation.
- The novel use of Gaussian variational inference for training BNNs is a significant contribution.
- Extensive empirical evaluations show competitive performance against existing methods.

Weaknesses:
- The connection to variational inference and SDP is superficial; the algorithm lacks clear ties to established techniques in these areas.
- The non-diagonal low-rank representation of the covariance may introduce scalability issues, and the benefits of higher ranks are unclear.
- The method's performance may be sensitive to hyperparameter choices, particularly the covariance rank \( K \), which is not thoroughly explored.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the connections between their method and established variational inference and SDP techniques. Specifically, please elaborate on how the proposed method relates to natural gradient-based optimization and clarify the implications of the low-rank approximation on scalability. Additionally, we suggest providing a more comprehensive exploration of hyperparameter sensitivity, particularly regarding the choice of \( K \), and include a discussion on the generalization capabilities of VISPA to other neural network architectures. Finally, addressing the memory consumption concerns associated with the method, especially in resource-constrained environments, would enhance the paper's practical relevance.
