Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical study of repeated principal-agent contracts where the agent employs no-regret learning algorithms. The authors propose that in binary outcome settings, the optimal dynamic contract is a "free-fall" structure, where the principal offers a contract for a set duration before switching to a zero payment. The results extend to linear contracts with more than two outcomes and highlight that uncertainty regarding the time horizon diminishes the effectiveness of dynamic contracts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The formulation of the problem is novel, bridging contract theory and online learning.
2. The theoretical results are clean, with comprehensive proofs provided.
3. The analysis encompasses both linear and general contract settings, addressing practical issues like unknown time horizons.
4. The findings suggest the potential for "win-win" dynamic contracts, benefiting both parties.

Weaknesses:
1. The model is limited to mean-based learning agents, raising questions about its realism.
2. The optimal contracts for fully general (non-linear) settings are not analyzed.
3. Some results appear instance-dependent rather than broadly applicable.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the realism of their model by considering agents that are not strictly no-regret minimizers, perhaps incorporating a stronger discounting factor in their learning algorithms. Additionally, we suggest exploring natural economic settings where "win-win" dynamic contracts might be implemented in practice. The authors should also clarify the implications of their results for real-world incentive structures, such as employee compensation plans or insurance contracts. Finally, addressing the concerns regarding the generalizability of their findings and the feasibility of certain scenarios in their theorems would strengthen the paper.
