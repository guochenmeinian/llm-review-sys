Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for clustered conformal prediction aimed at addressing the limitations of standard and class-wise conformal prediction in multiclass classification scenarios, particularly when data is scarce for certain classes. The authors propose clustering similar classes based on their non-conformity scores to enhance class-conditional coverage. The method is validated through extensive experiments on various datasets, demonstrating its practical relevance and effectiveness in balancing marginal and class-wise coverage.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and structured, making the discussion intuitive and easy to follow.
- The proposed method effectively balances marginal and class-wise coverage, particularly in low-data scenarios.
- Empirical results indicate that the method performs comparably or better than baseline approaches across studied metrics.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a detailed discussion on specific coverage for underrepresented classes, which is crucial for validating its original motivation.
- The CovGap metric may obscure the distinction between overcoverage and undercoverage, necessitating a clearer presentation of class-wise coverage results.
- The clustering approach's dependency on the number of clusters and the use of non-conformity scores raises concerns about the interpretability and meaningfulness of the clusters formed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the title to specify the low-data scenario, as it currently suggests a broader application. Additionally, the authors should provide a sensitivity analysis on the clustering procedure to assess how variations in the number of clusters affect results. It would be beneficial to explicitly show class-wise coverage metrics alongside CovGap to clarify the performance of the proposed method. Furthermore, addressing the potential for artificially inducing clusters when similar score distributions do not exist could strengthen the paper's argument. Lastly, we suggest enhancing the discussion around the implications of Proposition 3 and the role of $\epsilon$ in achieving coverage guarantees.
