### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into how explicit and implicit ethnic markers influence Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to detect hate speech. The study focuses on five ethnicities: British, Indian, Singaporean, Jamaican, and African-American, revealing that implicit dialect markers lead to more classification changes than explicit ones. The authors emphasize the robustness of larger models while highlighting the brittleness of LLMs in managing dialect variations, which is vital for fair content moderation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research addresses a critical issue of bias in LLM-based hate speech detection, relevant for content moderation.
- It introduces the novel concept of examining both explicit and implicit ethnic markers and their effects on model behavior.
- The methodology is clearly articulated, detailing the dataset specifications and sources.

Weaknesses:
- Some figures require revision for clarity, such as removing the speaker identity column from Figure 1 and reconsidering the necessity of Table 2.
- Figure 2 could benefit from clearer labeling of the direction of flips, and Figure 3's readability is compromised due to small font size and similar bottom row entries.
- The analysis could have included other models known for bias reduction, and a scaling analysis of model capabilities concerning ethnic bias would be valuable.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their figures, specifically by removing unnecessary elements and enhancing labels for better understanding. Additionally, consider moving some heatmaps from Figure 3 to the appendix to focus on key findings. Including an example of the Jaccard similarity on sample texts would strengthen the claims made in lines 125-126. Finally, exploring other models and conducting a scaling analysis on model capabilities regarding ethnic bias would enrich the study.
