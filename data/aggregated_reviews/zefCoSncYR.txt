### Key Points
This paper presents Str-GCL, a graph contrastive learning framework that integrates structural commonsense through first-order symbolic logic rules. The authors propose a representation alignment mechanism to enhance the learning process, addressing limitations in existing GCL methods. Experimental results indicate that Str-GCL outperforms traditional GCL approaches in node classification and clustering tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-motivated, addressing the misclassification problem in current GCL methods.
2. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate the robustness and versatility of Str-GCL.
3. The proposed method effectively incorporates structural commonsense, providing a novel perspective in graph representation learning.

Weaknesses:
1. The lack of a global analysis on nodes before and after applying the plugin raises concerns about performance impacts on nodes not categorized as frequently misclassified.
2. The sole focus on GCN as the graph encoder limits the exploration of Str-GCL's effectiveness with more advanced GNN models.
3. Clarity issues in defining "structural commonsense" and the mathematical symbols used in the paper hinder reader understanding.
4. The connection between first-order logic and the proposed method is not clearly articulated, raising questions about its relevance.
5. The potential for information leakage in the evaluation process is concerning, as it may involve using ground truth from the test set.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definition of "structural commonsense" by providing a dedicated section or including it in the abstract or introduction. Additionally, a global analysis of node performance post-plugin application should be conducted to assess impacts on all nodes. The authors should explore the effects of Str-GCL with more advanced GNN models and clarify the role of first-order logic in their framework. A symbol reference table should be included to define mathematical symbols used throughout the paper. Finally, the authors need to address the potential issue of information leakage in their evaluation methodology.
