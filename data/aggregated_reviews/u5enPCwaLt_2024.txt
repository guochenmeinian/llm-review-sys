Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for partially identifying policy effects using a known causal graph and observational data. The authors derive general bounds for probabilistic and conditional policies, extending existing results on discrete atomic policies. They also adapt the double machine learning framework for estimating these bounds and provide simulations demonstrating the convergence rate of the estimators, applied to an obesity study.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper derives tighter analytical bounds for general probabilistic and conditional policies, which are a significant improvement over existing results.  
- It develops an estimation framework applicable in higher-dimensional spaces and continuously-valued data, demonstrating favorable statistical properties such as fast convergence and robustness to model misspecification.  
- The contribution of expanding partial identification methods to new action/covariate spaces is valuable, and the paper is well-executed with clear algorithmic strategies and statistical guarantees.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks clarity in explaining the main challenge or novelty of the proposed bounds compared to treatment effect bounds.  
- There is insufficient discussion on identifiable cases before addressing partial identification, and the assumptions required for deriving the natural bound are not clearly stated.  
- The estimation strategies presented are standard and require justification of their novelty.  
- The paper is overloaded with notation, making it difficult to follow, and lacks sufficient intuition and concrete examples, particularly in the partial identification section.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the main challenge and novelty of the proposed bounds compared to treatment effect bounds. Additionally, the authors should discuss identifiable cases and the assumptions required for deriving the natural bound to clarify its practical applicability. It would be beneficial to explain the novelty of the estimation strategies in relation to existing literature. To enhance readability, we suggest providing more concrete examples and figures in the partial identification section. Lastly, developing a baseline in the numerics to demonstrate the new estimation framework's performance against existing approaches would be advantageous.
