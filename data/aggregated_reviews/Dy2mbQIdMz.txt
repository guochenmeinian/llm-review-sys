### Key Points
This paper presents two novel zero-shot methods, DetectLLM-LRR and DetectLLM-NPR, for detecting machine-generated text using log rank information. The authors demonstrate that these methods improve upon existing baselines in terms of accuracy and efficiency, addressing issues like plagiarism and misinformation. The paper also discusses the efficiency-performance trade-off, providing practical insights for real-world applications. Comprehensive experiments across three datasets and seven language models validate the proposed methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles the critical problem of distinguishing between machine-generated and human-generated text.
- It introduces two innovative approaches, supported by extensive experimental evaluations across various datasets and decoding schemes.
- DetectLLM-NPR is noted for requiring fewer perturbations while maintaining comparable performance levels.

Weaknesses:
- The code for the methods is not shared, limiting reproducibility.
- The experiments are primarily conducted in English, raising concerns about the methods' applicability to other languages.
- There is a lack of robustness testing, particularly regarding the performance of the methods on rephrased text.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of limitations by explicitly stating that the work is primarily focused on English text. Additionally, it would be beneficial to explore the detection of specific types of machine-generated text, such as those in healthcare or law, which may present unique challenges. Lastly, please incorporate rebuttal content into the main text to enhance the paper's comprehensiveness.
