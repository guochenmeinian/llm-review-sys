### Key Points
This paper presents a study on finite-sum coupled compositional optimization (FCCO) and tri-level finite-sum coupled compositional optimization (TCCO) problems, focusing on non-smooth weakly-convex functions. The authors propose two algorithms, SONX and SONT, and establish their complexity in finding an Îµ-stationary point of the Moreau envelope. The applicability of these methods is demonstrated through numerical results on two-way partial AUC maximization tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The extension of algorithms from Lipschitz functions to weakly convex functions is beneficial and nontrivial.  
- The convergence analysis of a single-loop stochastic algorithm for non-smooth weakly-convex FCCO is a notable contribution.  
- The algorithms are easy to implement and can be parallelized, achieving optimal rates for this class of functions.  
- The paper provides a detailed mathematical analysis and extensive experiments, validating the theoretical findings.

Weaknesses:  
- The motivation for considering non-smooth weakly-convex FCCO and TCCO is insufficient, lacking additional applications beyond two-way partial AUC maximization.  
- Definitions in the nonconvex setting need to be rigorously provided, particularly regarding "subgradient" and "subdifferential."  
- The experimental results do not fully support the theoretical claims, as comparisons with other algorithms for the same problem setting are missing.  
- The novelty of the convergence analysis is questioned, as other multistage algorithms may have achieved similar rates.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for their work by providing additional applications beyond two-way partial AUC maximization. Additionally, we suggest that the authors rigorously define the terms related to nonconvex settings, such as "subgradient" and "subdifferential." It would also be beneficial to include numerical comparisons with other known algorithms for the same non-smooth weakly-convex FCCO problem to better illustrate the importance of the obtained complexity. Finally, clarifying the novelty of their convergence analysis in relation to existing works would strengthen the paper.
