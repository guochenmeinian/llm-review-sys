Aggregated Review:
**Key Points:**
The paper proposes a framework for view selection in NeRF optimization, focusing on quantifying uncertainty during training using Fisher information to create an uncertainty channel for view-selection policy. It demonstrates improved performance over ActiveNeRF.

**Strengths and Weaknesses:**
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-motivated, and the proposed solution is reasonable.
2. The method achieves good performance in active view selection.

Weaknesses:
1. There is a lack of novelty, as it shares similar motivations and designs with FisherNeRF, particularly in using Fisher information for uncertainty quantification.
2. The paper requires proofreading to correct minor typos and formatting issues, such as the acknowledgment section and specific references (e.g., Mip-NeRF dataset).
3. The claim of efficiency in uncertainty estimation lacks experimental support.
4. The significance of Active View Selection may be diminished with the introduction of 3D Gaussians, and the robustness of the method on various datasets remains unaddressed.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
We suggest improving the writing and formatting for clarity, removing the acknowledgment section, and providing experimental evidence to support claims of efficiency. Additionally, a qualitative comparison with CF-NeRF would enhance the paper, and the authors should clarify the implications of their method in relation to 3D Gaussians and its robustness on diverse datasets like Tanks & Temples or aerial photography.
