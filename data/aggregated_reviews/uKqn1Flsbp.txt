Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the novel task of Personalized Instance-based Navigation (PIN), where an agent navigates to locate specific personal objects in photorealistic environments. The authors introduce the Personalized Instance-based Navigation Embodied Dataset (PInNED), which includes 338 object instances to enhance navigation challenges. The evaluation metrics and results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, showcasing the unique challenges posed by personalized object navigation. Additionally, the authors clarify that the reference images used for identifying target objects are generated by rendering 3D models in isolation, which may lead to confusion regarding the integration of these objects into the environment. Their approach emphasizes the agent's ability to distinguish personal instances from distractors of the same category, setting it apart from traditional image-based navigation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of the PIN task significantly advances the field of embodied AI by focusing on personalized object navigation.
2. The PInNED dataset provides a valuable resource for training and evaluating agents, enhancing the realism and complexity of navigation tasks.
3. The paper effectively outlines the experimental setup and presents a thorough comparative analysis of existing navigation methods.
4. The authors provide detailed explanations regarding the process of generating reference images and injecting 3D models into the environment.
5. The distinction between their method and traditional image-based navigation is clearly articulated, highlighting the unique challenges posed by distractors.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks detailed information on the experimental methodology and the limitations of the dataset, which could provide a more comprehensive analysis.
2. The rationale behind the placement of personalized objects in the navigation environment requires further clarification to ensure realism.
3. There is insufficient discussion on the ethical implications, particularly regarding privacy and potential biases in the dataset.
4. There is ambiguity regarding the influence of reference images on navigation results, raising concerns about the true personalization of the task.
5. The lack of clarity on the integration of 3D models versus images may hinder understanding for readers unfamiliar with the methodology.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental setup and methodology by providing more detailed explanations, especially regarding the dataset's limitations and the rationale for object placements. Additionally, the authors should expand their discussion on ethical considerations, including privacy and bias, to address potential societal impacts. We suggest including a dedicated section on limitations that outlines the scope of the PIN task and the dataset's diversity. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the relationship between reference images and navigation outcomes, addressing how personalization is maintained despite the reliance on specific images. Providing detailed code for 3D model injection in the GitHub repository would enhance reproducibility and understanding of the method. Lastly, we suggest comparing their dataset with others, such as ProcTHOR, to highlight strengths and gaps in object interaction capabilities, and implementing state-of-the-art ImageGoal baselines to enhance the evaluation results and provide deeper insights into the performance of navigation agents.
