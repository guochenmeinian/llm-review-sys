Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents AIPS, an innovative approach for proving IMO-level inequalities through a combination of a symbolic deductive engine and a value network trained via curriculum learning. AIPS autonomously generates a large-scale dataset of complex cyclic symmetric inequalities and demonstrates superior performance, solving 10 out of 20 Olympiad-level problems. The authors emphasize the significance of focusing on inequality proving, a relatively underexplored area in automated theorem proving, achieving a noteworthy 50% accuracy on challenging problems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- AIPS's ability to autonomously generate and prove Olympiad-level inequalities marks a significant advancement in automated reasoning, facilitating the generation of extensive training data.
- The curriculum learning strategy employed for the value network enhances performance progressively, mimicking human-like problem-solving strategies.
- Comprehensive evaluation against various baselines, including LLMs and neural theorem provers, showcases AIPS's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The system's focus is limited to algebraic inequalities, raising questions about its generalizability to other mathematical domains such as geometry or number theory.
- Dependence on SymPy for symbolic manipulation may create bottlenecks for more complex inequalities requiring specialized transformation rules.
- Lack of detailed analysis on computational resource requirements and failure cases limits understanding of AIPS's operational efficiency and potential improvements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the structural balance of the paper by condensing the lengthy introduction and expanding the methodology section, particularly regarding dataset generation and value network specifics. Additionally, a detailed analysis of AIPS's limitations, including failure cases and computational costs, should be included to provide insights for future iterations. Clarifying the value network fine-tuning process in the main text and expanding the evaluation benchmark beyond 20 problems would enhance the paper's depth and applicability.
