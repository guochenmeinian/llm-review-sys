### Key Points
This paper presents a new framework, DenseFlow, designed to assist in identifying and tracing money laundering activities on Ethereum by finding dense subgraphs and applying the maximum flow concept. The authors summarize four traits of money laundering activities and propose three suspiciousness metrics, conducting multiple experiments that validate the effectiveness of their method. However, the generality of the traits is questioned, and the construction of the graph $G$ lacks clarity, particularly regarding how to identify hackers and calculate topological and temporal suspiciousness accurately.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant problem in the Web community and summarizes the challenges effectively.
- The proposed approach is sound, with well-justified research questions and evaluation settings.
- The improvement over existing methods is substantial, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The construction of graph $G$ is unclear, particularly in identifying hackers and calculating suspiciousness metrics.
- The objective function's design is somewhat subjective and requires further experimental validation.
- The employed methods, including the greedy algorithm and maximum flow, lack innovativeness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the graph construction process, particularly how to identify hackers and calculate suspiciousness metrics accurately. Additionally, we suggest providing a more formal problem statement and discussing the practical applications of the results, including potential real-time interventions. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore the use of deep learning methods to optimize the objective function, potentially utilizing graph networks for implementation. Lastly, a more detailed discussion of the Lin [22] paper's role and accuracy in the analysis would enhance the paper's depth.
