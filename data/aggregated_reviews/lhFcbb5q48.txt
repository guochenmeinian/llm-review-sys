### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for quantifying and decomposing predictive uncertainty in LLM-based recommendation systems. The authors propose an entropy-based method to assess uncertainty and introduce an uncertainty decomposition framework to analyze its sources. They demonstrate that lower uncertainty correlates with higher recommendation performance and suggest uncertainty-aware prompting techniques to optimize recommendations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for the research problem is sound and significant, addressing the practical need for understanding uncertainty in LLM recommendations.
- The proposed techniques, including uncertainty decomposition and prompting strategies, are intuitive and reasonable.
- The formula derivation is well-organized and the extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Weaknesses:
- The approximation based on top-1 probabilities lacks theoretical guarantees and conflicts with the autoregressive nature of LLMs.
- The paper does not illustrate potential applications of the uncertainty decomposition, such as computing prompt and recommendation uncertainty in practice.
- There is a lack of discussion regarding key hyper-parameters affecting LLM generation, such as temperature and top_p.
- The novelty is limited compared to foundational works in uncertainty quantification, and the sampling strategy lacks rigorous theoretical justification.
- The computational cost of measuring uncertainty and the generalizability of the method to larger models are not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical justification for the approximation in equation 5 and clarify how the uncertainty decomposition can be applied in practice. Additionally, please provide a detailed discussion of the key hyper-parameters affecting LLM generation and their values. We suggest exploring more significant variations in prompts and examining the impact of user profiles on uncertainty. Furthermore, a thorough analysis of the computational complexity of the sampling algorithm and its scalability should be included. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the relationships between terms like "volatility," "uncertainty," and "entropy" to enhance the paper's clarity and quality.
