### Key Points
This paper presents a study on fair allocation of indivisible items to agents with fractionally subadditive (XOS) valuations, focusing on both deterministic and randomized allocation algorithms. The authors achieve a 3/13-MMS approximation for deterministic allocation, improving the previous best-known result. For randomized allocation, they establish a 1/4-MMS ex-ante and 1/8-MMS ex-post guarantee, demonstrating that any randomized allocation cannot exceed a 3/4 ex-ante ratio. This work is significant as it provides the first results for randomized allocation under the maximin-share (MMS) criteria and XOS functions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and clearly presents complex algorithmic ideas, making it accessible despite the technical nature of the material.
- It contributes valuable results to the fair division field, particularly with improved approximation guarantees for XOS valuations.

Weaknesses:
- The connection between the studied problem and the machine-learning community is not clearly established, suggesting a more suitable fit for conferences like EC/WINE/AAAI/IJCAI.
- Some technical lemmas lack detailed proofs, which could enhance understanding, although space constraints are acknowledged.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the connection between their work and the machine-learning community to broaden its appeal. Additionally, providing detailed proofs for at least one technical lemma would enhance the paper's rigor. It would also be beneficial to include a discussion on the obstacles to further improving approximation guarantees and clarify the efficiency of the algorithms in the introduction. Finally, addressing the typos and confusing phrases noted in the reviews will improve the overall presentation.
