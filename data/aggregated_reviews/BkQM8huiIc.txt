Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a game-theoretic and Bayesian theory-of-mind model to analyze social conflict in mice, utilizing behavioral and neural data from over 100 subjects. The authors propose that mice's actions align with a model where they maintain primary and secondary beliefs about their opponents. The experiments aim to elucidate the principles underlying social conflict through a normative framework.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses an intriguing topic, combining behavioral and neural data to explore social interactions in mice.  
- The model is well-justified and demonstrates the effectiveness of the Bayesian approach in understanding decision-making in social contexts.  
- The empirical validation through extensive model comparisons and ablation studies is commendable.

Weaknesses:  
- Ethical considerations regarding the euthanasia of over 100 mice are inadequately addressed, raising concerns about compliance with ethical standards.  
- The classification of attacking as winning lacks robust justification, potentially undermining the study's assumptions.  
- The presentation is often cryptic, with insufficient contextualization of findings, particularly in the introduction and discussion sections.  
- The empirical evaluation using negative log likelihood is questioned; a focus on predictive accuracy would enhance interpretability.  
- The paper does not adequately differentiate its contributions from existing literature, particularly regarding the Bayesian belief update framework.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the ethical discussion surrounding the euthanasia of the mice, ensuring compliance with ethical standards. Additionally, clarify the rationale behind classifying attacking as winning and discuss the implications of moving mice to different environments. 

We suggest expanding the introduction to better contextualize the contributions of the paper and moving some methodological details to the appendix to enhance clarity. Furthermore, consider evaluating model performance based on predictive accuracy rather than negative log likelihood for better interpretability. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide a comprehensive table of all hypothesis tests conducted, including p-values and q-values, to address potential selective inference issues.
