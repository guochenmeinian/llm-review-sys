Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection method called Logic-Guided Transformer Reasoner (LoTR). LoTR modifies the self-attention mechanism to infer plausible interactions among entities, guided by affordances and proxemics expressed in first-order logic. This approach enhances learning and improves performance, particularly in zero-shot generalization, as demonstrated by evaluations on the V-COCO and HICO-DET datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel perspective in the HOI domain, providing an abundance of experimental evidence that demonstrates impressive results.
- The logic-guided learning method in section 3.3 is interesting and could assist in developing other computer vision tasks.
- The proposed enhancements to the self-attention mechanism and the introduction of a differentiable logic-based reasoner are original contributions likely to interest researchers.

Weaknesses:
- The application of the method appears limited; its potential for other visual tasks remains unclear.
- The clarity of notation and explanations in the paper is insufficient, particularly regarding the meanings of variables and the derivation of certain equations.
- The experimental section lacks a comprehensive analysis of the proposed method's performance across different HOI detectors and conditions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of notation and provide detailed explanations for variables and equations, particularly in Equations 2, 5, 7, and 11. Additionally, we suggest including results that demonstrate the integration of the proposed reasoner into existing methods to showcase its broader applicability. A more in-depth analysis in Section 4.2 regarding the method's performance on unseen objects and verbs would enhance understanding. Finally, addressing the fairness of comparisons in experimental results and providing implementation details for baseline methods would strengthen the paper.
