### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for generating crystal structures, focusing on polymorphs and utilizing matrix representations alongside generative models from vision tasks. The framework employs specially designed similarity metrics and loss functions, tested through modification of existing structures and generation from scratch, particularly within the Ta–W–B system. The authors also explore diffusion and flow matching approaches using UNet models trained on the AFLOW database, aiming to generate crystalline materials with specific properties.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work develops domain-specific representations, metrics, and loss functions, enabling the application of generative models to crystals.
- The authors successfully identified previously undiscovered stable structures through conditional generation.
- The integration of DFT for validation of inference results adds credibility to the findings.

Weaknesses:
- The generation is conditioned on elements and space groups but lacks consideration of materials properties, limiting its usefulness in materials discovery.
- The matrix representation does not incorporate physical constraints, such as symmetry dictated by space groups.
- The manuscript suffers from poor presentation, with unclear mathematical notations and insufficient explanations of methodologies.
- There is a lack of comparison with existing methodologies, and the results show weak performance in both ML and chemistry aspects.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and rigor of the manuscript by unifying mathematical notations and providing clearer explanations of the methodologies used. Specifically, the authors should address how elemental properties are integrated into the matrix representation and clarify the role of time conditioning in materials discovery. Additionally, we suggest that the authors compare their generative models against other significant databases like the Materials Project to assess the robustness of their approach. Finally, the authors should ensure that the generated structures comply with physical constraints, such as space group symmetries, to enhance the validity of their results.
