Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a pipeline aimed at enhancing feature extraction from pre-trained diffusion models for tasks like semantic segmentation, addressing the issue of "content shift," where feature maps diverge semantically from the input image. The authors utilize three prior methods for image transformation to extract features and attention maps, which are then amalgamated through a learned weighted combination. Additionally, the authors investigate the causes of content shift and propose the *GenerAtion Techniques Enhanced* (GATE) diffusion feature approach. They analyze how diffusion models reconstruct clean representations from noisy inputs, leading to potential drift from the original image. The paper introduces a quantitative metric for evaluating generation techniques based on contour differences between features. The proposed pipeline is evaluated on the SPair-71k dataset for semantic correspondence and on the Bedroom-28, Horse-21, ADE20K, and CityScapes datasets for semantic segmentation, demonstrating improvements over baseline methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The focus on enhancing features from diffusion models for downstream applications is novel and relatively unexplored.
- The paper provides a thorough analysis of the content shift phenomenon in diffusion features, establishing a clear connection between reconstruction processes and content drift.
- The proposed GATE method is experimentally validated, demonstrating effectiveness in improving feature quality across various tasks.
- The evaluation indicates favorable results, with the proposed pipeline outperforming vanilla feature extraction and other techniques.
- The introduction of both qualitative and quantitative evaluation metrics enhances the robustness of the proposed techniques.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks depth, omitting critical details in the main text and relying heavily on the appendix.
- The technical contribution is limited, primarily integrating existing methods to improve diffusion features.
- The evaluation is insufficient, missing key details and lacking a proper ablation study.
- The reliance on selected generation techniques may limit the generalizability of the GATE method, as the effectiveness is contingent on the chosen approaches.
- The experimental evaluation is conducted on a limited number of tasks, which may not fully capture the potential of GATE across diverse applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the manuscript by including essential details regarding methods, datasets, and experiments in the main text rather than the appendix. For instance, specify the dataset used for semantic correspondence in Table 1, explain the metrics, and provide implementation details. 

Additionally, clarify the noise levels used for feature extraction, including how they were selected and their impact on performance. We suggest exploring a systematic approach to quantifying content shift, rather than relying on speculative discussions. 

The authors should also consider how the proposed method generalizes to diverse image types and provide experimental results for classification tasks, as this would offer a straightforward evaluation of feature quality. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of GATE by exploring a wider range of generation techniques beyond those currently selected. Expanding the experimental evaluation to include more tasks could provide a more comprehensive understanding of GATE's effectiveness. Finally, enhance the explanation of how clean features are derived from noisy features and elaborate on the limitations discussed in the conclusion.
