Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture called Almost-Linear (AL)-RNN for reconstructing nonlinear dynamical systems from time-series data. The key innovation of AL-RNN is its ability to train parsimonious piecewise linear (PWL) representations by combining linear units with a limited number of rectified linear units (ReLUs). The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of AL-RNNs on benchmark datasets (Lorenz and RÃ¶ssler systems) and real-world data (ECG and fMRI), showing that they can discover minimal PWL representations that accurately capture system dynamics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Novelty: The AL-RNN architecture is a significant advancement in dynamical systems reconstruction, addressing limitations of existing methods.
- Interpretability: The minimal use of ReLU units enhances the model's interpretability and facilitates mathematical analysis.
- Empirical Effectiveness: The paper effectively demonstrates AL-RNNs' capabilities on both benchmark and real-world datasets.

Weaknesses:
- Limited usefulness of symbolic dynamics: The extracted symbolic transition dynamics can be misleading, especially when the underlying dynamics are deterministic.
- Lack of guidance on model size: There is no discussion on determining the minimum number of ReLU units (P) or linear units (M), which could enhance practical utility.
- Insufficient detail on training and hyperparameter selection: The lack of specifics may hinder reproducibility.
- Theorem 1 appears incorrect: A counterexample suggests that the symbolic state can remain constant without all states being fixed points.
- Writing quality needs improvement: Certain sections, such as the theory and symbolic dynamics, seem unnecessary and could be streamlined or moved to the appendix.
- Undefined terms and excessive acronyms hinder clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the symbolic dynamics approach to avoid misleading representations, particularly for deterministic systems. Additionally, we suggest providing guidance on determining the optimal number of ReLU units (P) and linear units (M) to enhance practical application. It is crucial to include more details on the training process and hyperparameter selection to facilitate reproducibility. The authors should also clarify the definitions of undefined terms and reduce the excessive use of acronyms to improve readability. Lastly, we encourage the authors to revisit Theorem 1 and the writing in Section 3.2 for clarity and conciseness.
