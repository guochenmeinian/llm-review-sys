Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents StableFDG, a novel approach for federated domain generalization (DG) that incorporates a style-based learning strategy and an attention-based feature highlighter. The style-based learning enables clients to explore diverse styles beyond their local domains, while the attention mechanism emphasizes common features among samples of the same class. The authors conduct extensive experiments on various datasets, demonstrating the method's effectiveness compared to existing approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The style-based learning strategy is novel and intuitive.
- The paper is well-written, organized, and easy to follow.
- The evaluation is thorough, covering popular benchmarks and yielding superior results on multiple datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The detail of oversampling is not fully covered.
- The adaptation of mixing styles and exploration to federated learning appears straightforward, lacking depth.
- The relationship between style information obtained and its application in the method is not clearly explained.
- The novelty of the approach is questioned, as it seems to build incrementally on existing methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of how oversampling is implemented, particularly in unbalanced datasets. Additionally, we suggest that the authors elaborate on the implications of style information post-Equation 3 and clarify the relationship between their approach and style transfer literature. It would also be beneficial to include relevant content from the supplementary material into the main body of the paper to enhance clarity. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide more detailed ablation studies regarding the application of style-based modules.
