Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an efficient transformer-based local feature matching approach named ETO, which consists of three steps: hypothesis estimation, segmentation, and refinement. ETO achieves coarse matching results at a 1/32 resolution, improving inference time compared to LoFTR's 1/8 resolution. The experimental results indicate that ETO balances accuracy and speed effectively. The authors propose leveraging homography to enhance the transformer pipeline and utilize unidirectional cross-attention in the refinement stage to further reduce computational overhead.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation for the paper is clear and valuable, addressing the challenge of designing efficient transformer-based models for feature matching.
2. The technical design of ETO is novel, particularly in predicting local homography parameters at a coarse resolution and refining them.
3. The experimental results validate the efficiency of the proposed method, demonstrating reduced inference time while maintaining acceptable accuracy.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks important technical details, such as the computation manner of the Transformer before hypothesis estimation and the clarity of variable definitions in Section 3.2.
2. The segmentation step's computation architecture is unclear, and the term "pseudo" ground truth requires clarification.
3. The authors do not adequately compare their method with recent state-of-the-art approaches like RoMa and Efficient LoFTR, limiting the contextual understanding of their contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the technical details, particularly regarding the computation manner of the Transformer and the definitions of variables in Section 3.2. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the segmentation step's architecture and clarify the use of "pseudo" ground truth. We also suggest including a comparative analysis with recent methods such as RoMa and Efficient LoFTR to strengthen the paper's context and relevance. Finally, visualizing intermediate results after the hypothesis estimation and segmentation steps would enhance the understanding of the proposed method's predictions.
