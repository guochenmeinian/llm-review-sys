Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Cocktail, a novel pipeline for multi-modal and spatially-refined control in text-conditional diffusion models. The authors propose three main components: gControlNet, ControlNorm, and a spatial guidance sampling method. gControlNet allows for the simultaneous reception of various control signals without linear size increase, while ControlNorm optimizes information utilization within branched networks. The spatial guidance sampling method modifies attention maps to ensure precise control over the generative process. The proposed method shows improved performance in generating high-quality images aligned with input conditions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The Cocktail pipeline addresses the challenge of ambiguous descriptions in generative models, significantly contributing to the field.
- Each component of the pipeline is well-defined and systematically designed to integrate control signals from different modalities.
- Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Cocktail outperforms existing methods in text-guided image-to-image translation.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion on the computational complexity and efficiency of the Cocktail pipeline.
- There is insufficient analysis of the experimental results, particularly regarding inconsistencies in metric scores.
- Implementation details are sparse, which may hinder reproducibility.
- The authors do not adequately address potential misuse of the model, raising ethical concerns.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the computational complexity and efficiency of the Cocktail pipeline to provide a clearer understanding of its scalability. Additionally, a more comprehensive analysis of the experimental results is necessary, particularly to explain discrepancies in metric scores. We suggest including a detailed examination of the limitations and failure cases of the proposed method to assess its robustness. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to address ethical concerns regarding potential misuse of the model and to provide clearer implementation details to enhance reproducibility.
