Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents three algorithms for communication-efficient Federated Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (FGDRO): FGDRO-CVaR, FGDRO-KL, and FGDRO-KL-Adam. The authors aim to reduce communication costs and sample complexity while providing theoretical and empirical validation of their methods across various tasks. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is supported by both theoretical results and extensive experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses an important and rarely-studied problem in federated learning regarding communication costs.
2. The theoretical convergence analysis for the proposed algorithms is solid.
3. The authors conduct comprehensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of their methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The contributions and novelties of the paper are unclear, appearing to combine existing federated adaptive algorithms with pre-existing methods.
2. There is a lack of comparison among the proposed algorithms, particularly regarding their connections and differences.
3. The experimental setup lacks clarity, especially concerning the number of clients and non-IID data distributions.
4. Communication efficiency is not adequately addressed, as the paper does not provide empirical evidence of communication costs associated with each method.
5. The relevance of the subject matter is not fully articulated, and the background information is insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions and novelty by explicitly delineating how their methods differ from existing approaches. Additionally, the authors should include a comparative analysis of the proposed algorithms to highlight their connections and differences. We suggest providing detailed experimental setups, including the number of clients and non-IID distributions, and including more empirical results on communication efficiency. Furthermore, the authors should elaborate on the relevance of FGDRO and the sources of additional communication costs, as well as consider including analyses of class imbalance and privacy aspects in their experiments.
