Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a meta-learning method, FasMe, for estimating the precision matrix in small sample settings by utilizing common edges from multiple auxiliary datasets as meta-knowledge. The authors assume that the true edges of the new task encompass all estimated common edges. Theoretical guarantees are provided, and experiments demonstrate the method's effectiveness and efficiency, particularly in low-data environments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- It presents a concrete algorithm with theoretical guarantees, which appear novel.
- Experimental results indicate strong performance in accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Weaknesses:
- The assumption in Eq. 8 may not hold in general machine learning tasks, limiting broader applicability.
- Quantitative evaluations are primarily based on synthetic data; more benchmark dataset evaluations would enhance the findings.
- There are some doubts regarding the method and experiments, particularly concerning the applicability beyond biological scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their assumptions, particularly in Eq. 8, to address concerns about applicability in various contexts. Additionally, we suggest including more quantitative evaluations on benchmark datasets to strengthen the experimental analysis. Finally, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the theoretical connections between meta-learning tasks and the estimation of the new precision matrix, as well as clarify the reasoning behind N=0 in Eq. 13.
