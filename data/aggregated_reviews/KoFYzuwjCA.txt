Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents RecXi, a framework that disentangles voice and content for speaker recognition using a three-layer Gaussian inference network. The authors argue that speaker information is static while content information is dynamic, leading to a method that decomposes these elements effectively. They employ self-supervised learning to enhance performance and demonstrate that their model outperforms existing methods across various datasets, including VoxCeleb and SITW.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors effectively tackle the challenging task of disentangling features using self-supervised learning, focusing on the temporal characteristics of speaker and content.
- The proposed method shows superior performance compared to existing models, supported by solid experimental results and a comprehensive comparison with baselines.

Weaknesses:
- The claim that more accurate speaker representation is achieved from layer 1 to layer 3 lacks verification through an ablation study.
- The complexity of the method may hinder intuitive understanding; additional visualized results or example audio in supplementary materials would be beneficial.
- The best-performing model's reliance on both static and dynamic components increases the representation vector's size and may undermine the central claim regarding the separation of speaker and content information.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their method by providing more visualized results or example audio in the supplementary material. Additionally, including a comparison with models that utilize explicit content-aware decomposition would strengthen their claims regarding efficiency and performance. It would also be beneficial to conduct ablation studies to verify the utility of the module "G" and explore the effects of further iterations of disentanglement. Finally, we suggest adding a dedicated "Limitations" section in the body of the paper to enhance transparency regarding the model's constraints.
