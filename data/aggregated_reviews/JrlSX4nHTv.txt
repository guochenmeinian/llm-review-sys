Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new dataset named Penguin aimed at enhancing natural response generation in Chinese MRC. The dataset includes fluent responses alongside traditional <Passage, Question, Answer> tuples, addressing real-world scenarios. The authors propose Prompt-BART, a model fine-tuned with various prefix prompts, which reportedly improves performance. The dataset is large, containing 200k examples, and incorporates both automatic and human evaluations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The new dataset is substantial and useful for MRC research.
- The experimental results, including both automatic and human evaluations, are sound and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

Weaknesses:
- The natural responses may not consistently outperform original answers due to the diversity of responses.
- The dataset lacks novelty as it is derived from existing datasets.
- There is insufficient detail regarding the annotators' qualifications and the initial response generation process.
- The paper does not define question difficulty, making it hard to assess the value of the "natural" responses.
- Metrics for naturalness, such as PPL and coherence, are absent from the evaluation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the initial response generation process and provide more details about the annotators. Additionally, the authors should define question difficulty to enhance the understanding of the dataset's value. Including metrics for naturalness in the evaluation would strengthen the paper's claims. Lastly, we suggest comparing the results with ChatGPT and T5-large to provide a more comprehensive analysis of naturalness.
