### Key Points
This paper presents a model for detecting hallucinations in navigation instructions generated by models in embodied navigation tasks. The authors categorize hallucinations into intrinsic and extrinsic types and propose a weakly-supervised approach using a pre-trained vision-language model fine-tuned with synthetic data. They utilize data augmentation strategies to create synthetic training data and employ a contrastive learning objective to distinguish hallucinations from non-hallucinations. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms LSTM and Transformer baselines, although it struggles with certain types of hallucinations due to limited training data diversity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an important problem in NLP, specifically in the context of grounded instruction following.
- The approach of using synthetic data and contrastive learning is innovative for this application.
- Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model compared to existing baselines.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the pre-training strategy is questionable, as task-adaptive pre-training has been established in prior work.
- The evaluation is limited to a small, manually annotated test set, raising concerns about the robustness and generalizability of the results.
- The method only addresses two types of hallucinations, which may not encompass the complexity of hallucinations encountered in practice.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty discussion by clarifying how their pre-training approach differs from established methods. Additionally, we suggest expanding the evaluation to include parameter-matched baselines to provide a clearer comparison. The authors should also consider incorporating a broader range of hallucination types in both training and testing datasets to enhance the robustness of their findings. Finally, providing more details on the annotation process and inter-annotator agreement would strengthen the credibility of the evaluation data.
