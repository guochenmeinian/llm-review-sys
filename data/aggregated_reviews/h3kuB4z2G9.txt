Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for estimating causal effects using a front-door-like adjustment without requiring a fully-specified causal graph, particularly in the presence of unobserved confounding. The authors propose testable conditional independence statements and a generalized front-door condition to facilitate this estimation. The effectiveness of the method is validated through experiments on random graphs and real-world causal fairness benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method allows for causal effect estimation without the need for complete knowledge of the causal graph, utilizing only limited structural side information.
- The reliance on conditional independence statements that can be tested from observational data enhances the practicality of identifying causal effects.
- The paper provides clear proofs and demonstrates the validity of the proposed approach, contributing valuable insights to the field of causality research.

Weaknesses:
- The algorithm depends on stronger assumptions that are not adequately discussed, raising concerns about its soundness and completeness.
- Specific assumptions, particularly Assumption 3, may be too stringent and difficult to satisfy in practical scenarios, potentially limiting the method's applicability.
- The completeness of the algorithm is questioned, as it may not address all cases of latent confounding effectively.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the stronger assumptions underlying the algorithm, particularly Assumption 3, to enhance clarity and soundness. Additionally, including a brief proof sketch of Theorem 3.2 in the main body of the paper, rather than solely in the appendix, would strengthen the presentation. Furthermore, providing a more detailed description of Algorithm 1 would facilitate better understanding among readers. Lastly, exploring workarounds for Assumption 2 could enhance the robustness and generalizability of the proposed method.
