### Key Points
This paper presents MeMPtec, a metadata-based model for detecting malicious packages in software repositories like NPM and PyPi. The authors propose a novel detection model that categorizes metadata features into easy-to-manipulate (ETM) and difficult-to-manipulate (DTM) groups, demonstrating improved detection effectiveness and resilience to adversarial attacks. Experimental results indicate significant reductions in false positives (up to 97.56%) and false negatives (up to 91.86%) compared to existing methods. The work extends previous research by introducing a new set of features and conducting meticulous feature engineering.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
+ The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
+ The metadata-related features considered are relatively comprehensive.
+ The inclusion of DTM features leads to improved results over state-of-the-art methods.

Weaknesses:
- The improvement over prior work in non-adversarial scenarios is not significant.
- The contribution primarily revolves around proposing more features based on metadata, which diminishes the perceived novelty.
- The dataset details are unclear, including how it was collected and the accuracy of labels.
- There is a lack of discussion on limitations and the absence of public release of artifacts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the dataset description, including how it was collected and ensuring the accuracy of labels for benign and malicious packages. Additionally, we suggest that the authors discuss the limitations of their work more thoroughly. To enhance the presentation, we advise expanding Table 2 to include descriptions and examples of metadata information, clarifying self-defined terms throughout the paper, and ensuring figures are numbered in the order they appear in the text. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide insights into the prevalence of malicious packages and the potential for introducing a novel class for suspicious packages.
