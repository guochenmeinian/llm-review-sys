### Key Points
This paper presents a Knowledge-Selective Framework (KSelF) and a pre-training strategy for the attribute-value extraction (AVE) task, aimed at improving performance on rare and unseen attributes. The authors create a pre-training corpus from E-commerce sites and utilize the KS framework for query expansion. Experiments on the AE-pub and EC-AVE datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of KSelF, achieving state-of-the-art results, particularly for low-frequency attributes. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed pre-training corpus creation strategy effectively enhances the AVE task and demonstrates significant improvements on rare attributes.
- KSelF is well-grounded in existing literature and addresses previous limitations in QA-based AVE models.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments section is perceived as weak due to the noisy nature of the AE-pub dataset, and the absence of the MAVE dataset limits robustness.
- The pre-training method relies on a naive pseudo-labeling approach, lacking novelty, and the benchmark is compared to an outdated dataset, missing opportunities for stronger validation.
- The work is seen as largely derivative, with limited innovation and marginal performance improvements over existing methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experiments section by including the MAVE dataset to enhance robustness. Additionally, consider refining the pre-training method to avoid reliance on naive string matching for pseudo-labeling. The authors should also explore more recent and larger datasets for benchmarking to strengthen their claims. Clarifying the entity retrieval process and its impact on similarity calculations during fine-tuning would provide greater transparency and address potential concerns regarding the accuracy of knowledge selection. Finally, enhancing the novelty of the contributions would significantly benefit the overall impact of the work.
