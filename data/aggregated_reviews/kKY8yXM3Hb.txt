Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a decision aggregation problem involving two experts who provide binary recommendations based on private signals about an unknown binary world state. The authors investigate the role of second-order information—each expert's forecast of the other's recommendation—on the performance of various aggregators using a minimax regret framework. The analysis indicates that, in general information structures, second-order information does not enhance performance, while it proves beneficial under conditionally independent signals. The paper also explores optimal deterministic and random aggregators, revealing that second-order information can improve outcomes for homogeneous experts with non-degenerate signals.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a clean economic model and provides a comprehensive analysis of different scenarios, including general, conditionally independent, homogeneous, and non-degenerate information structures.
- The findings contribute valuable insights to the information aggregation literature, particularly regarding the utility of second-order information.

Weaknesses:
- The assumption that experts will truthfully report second-order information raises concerns, as the expert's utility model is not clearly discussed.
- The focus on a binary action and state framework may limit the applicability of the results to real-world scenarios.
- The paper lacks empirical evaluation of the proposed aggregators, and some theorems could benefit from more intuitive explanations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the expert's behavior model and its validity, particularly regarding the assumption of truthful reporting. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the interchangeability of the terms "agent" and "aggregator" for consistency. To enhance the paper's applicability, consider extending the analysis to scenarios involving more than two experts and richer signal structures. Providing real-world examples to motivate the different classes of information structures would also be beneficial. Lastly, including proof sketches for key theorems could help elucidate the results and their implications.
