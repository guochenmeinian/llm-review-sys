Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Variational Annealing on Graphs for Combinatorial Optimization (VAG-CO), a novel method that combines variational inference, annealing, and graph theory to address combinatorial optimization problems. The authors propose an autoregressive approach to generate solutions, utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) and temperature annealing to enhance efficiency. The paper includes theoretical analysis and numerical demonstrations across various datasets, particularly focusing on the maximum independent set (MIS) and minimum vertex cover (MVC) problems. Additionally, the authors conduct a comparative analysis of VAG-CO against state-of-the-art neural combinatorial optimization methods, specifically assessing its performance relative to Gurobi and algorithms proposed by Karalias et al. and Sun et al. They clarify that their experiments aim to evaluate VAG-CO's effectiveness rather than determine a superior algorithm. The results indicate that VAG-CO outperforms the methods of Karalias et al. and Sun et al. on various datasets, especially in challenging problem instances.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The methodology is innovative and adds value to the existing literature by addressing limitations of the Mean-Field Approximation (MFA).
- VAG-CO shows strong performance across multiple datasets, often ranking as the best method or among the top performers.
- The authors demonstrate a solid understanding of the problem space and provide a well-structured theoretical framework.
- The breadth of numerical experiments is commendable, showcasing the method's performance on benchmark datasets.
- The authors have responded constructively to reviewer feedback, providing additional experimental results that confirm VAG-CO's efficacy.
- The introduction of Subgraph Tokenization and a statistical learning-theory perspective on variational annealing are notable contributions.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments are limited to synthetic data, lacking application to real-world datasets, which would strengthen the claims of wide applicability.
- The evaluation is primarily focused on MIS and MVC, which are well-known problems, suggesting a need for broader testing across diverse combinatorial optimization problems.
- Some reviewers express concerns regarding the empirical benefits of VAG-CO, suggesting that improvements may be marginal and influenced by variance.
- There are inconsistencies in the experimental results, particularly regarding the performance of different methods and the choice of evaluation metrics.
- The presentation of results has been criticized for clarity, particularly regarding the interpretation of metrics and notations used.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental design by including comparisons with Gurobi and other established solvers across a wider variety of real-world datasets. Additionally, conducting experiments on more diverse combinatorial optimization problems, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem and Knapsack Problem, would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method's capabilities. We suggest improving the clarity of the presentation by specifying in each result plot whether lower or higher values indicate better performance. Furthermore, clarifying the notation used for probability distributions and graph nodes would help avoid confusion. It would also be beneficial to include a remark comparing EGN and MFA to enhance understanding of their relative performances. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore the proposed alternative algorithm for node selection in future work, as it shows promise.
