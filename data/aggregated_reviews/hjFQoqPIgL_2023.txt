Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents TARTARUS, a benchmark for developing inverse molecular design models, featuring four datasets and tasks related to realistic problems in chemistry, including the design of organic photovoltaics, organic emitters, protein ligands, and chemical reaction substrates. The benchmark includes detailed evaluation workflows based on physical simulations, providing a timely platform for assessing various molecular generative models. The authors clarify that their submission exceeds the 9-page limit due to the inclusion of co-authors and acknowledgments, which is permissible for non-anonymous submissions. They acknowledge the need for additional baseline methods, particularly in 2D molecular graph generation, and are working to incorporate methods like MoFlow. The authors explain their choice to generate 2D molecular graphs or 1D strings before computing 3D conformations, citing concerns about the reliability of 3D generation methods. They clarify that molecule design is achieved through optimization based on reference molecules from the dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
1. TARTARUS offers four practical datasets that are useful for researchers in inverse molecular design.
2. The writing is clear and well-organized, with comprehensive details on dataset creation and evaluation workflows.
3. The evaluation methods based on physical simulations are robust and aligned with real-world applications.
4. The authors have made significant efforts to address reviewer concerns, including clarifying the rationale behind their methodological choices and expanding their baseline methods.
5. The inclusion of results from MoFlow and diversity calculations enhances the comprehensiveness of the experiments.
6. The codebase is well-developed, providing a standard for researchers.

**Weaknesses:**
1. The paper exceeds the 9-page format requirement and lacks line numbers.
2. The baseline methods primarily utilize string-based and graph search methods, omitting significant 2D molecular graph generation methods.
3. The benchmark does not directly generate 3D molecules, which raises questions about the design process.
4. The experiments lack comprehensiveness, missing several representative molecular design algorithms.
5. The potential negative social impacts of the work are not adequately discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors adhere to the 9-page format requirement and include line numbers in the submission.
2. Authors should consider adding at least 1-2 representative baseline methods from the 2D molecular graph generation category, such as JTVAE, GCPN, or GraphAF, as well as 3D generation methods like G-SchNet or EDM.
3. We encourage the authors to explain why the benchmark does not directly generate 3D molecules from scratch and discuss the limitations of their current approach.
4. Authors are advised to clarify the exact process of molecule design, specifying whether it involves optimizing reference molecules or random generation.
5. We suggest that the authors design a benchmark for individual molecule design tasks to allow for more focused algorithm development and evaluation.
6. Incorporating diversity metrics into the evaluation would provide a more rounded assessment of generative models.
7. We recommend that the authors discuss the implications of molecular properties on photovoltaic materials and standardize terminologies for mean and standard deviation throughout the manuscript.
8. Addressing the potential misuse of molecular generative models in the context of hazardous materials is crucial for ethical considerations.
