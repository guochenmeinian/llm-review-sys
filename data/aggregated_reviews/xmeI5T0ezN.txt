### Key Points
This paper presents a study on online sequential decision-making with unknown delays, proposing three types of online algorithms that address delayed feedback. The authors introduce algorithms for full information feedback, gradient information feedback, and value information of gradients, enhancing traditional OCO methods by incorporating relative strong convexity and various norms. The theoretical contributions are significant, providing regret bounds that are relevant to practical applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a relevant problem in online decision-making, particularly in real-life scenarios like portfolio management.
2. The theoretical contributions are non-trivial and well-articulated, with clear regret bounds for different settings.
3. The draft is generally well-written and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks empirical results and strong baselines, making it difficult to assess the practical usefulness of the proposed methods.
2. Real-world examples and applications are missing, particularly in demonstrating the advantages of relative strong convexity over strong convexity.
3. The computational complexity of the algorithms is not discussed, which is crucial for evaluating their utility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including empirical results to support their theoretical claims, ideally with real-world data sources. It would be beneficial to add at least one or two examples of practical applications where the proposed methods can be effectively utilized. Additionally, the authors should clarify the computational complexity of their algorithms and provide a detailed comparison with existing methods such as Delayed Online Gradient Descent (DOGD). Finally, we suggest summarizing the key technical contributions in the introduction to enhance clarity and context for the reader.
