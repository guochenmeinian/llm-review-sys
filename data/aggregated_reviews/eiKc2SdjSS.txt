Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a decomposed temporal difference (TD) learning framework aimed at enhancing the robustness of value function learning in online reinforcement learning for recommender systems. The authors identify the incorrect approximation issues in existing TD learning and propose a decomposition approach that separately approximates the user state’s long-term utility and the stochastic user environment. Additionally, an extra debias term is introduced to refine the learning of the value function (V). Extensive experiments across three datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work is well-motivated, addressing significant challenges in TD learning.
- The proposed method, including the decomposed modeling and debias term, is both intuitive and novel.
- The paper is well-organized and easy to follow, with substantial experimental validation.

Weaknesses:
- The related work section lacks comprehensive discussions on existing studies addressing the suboptimal TD challenge.
- Important implementation details are missing from the manuscript, which could enhance readability.
- The simulated environment's resemblance to real-world scenarios is inadequately described.
- Several writing issues, including unexplained acronyms and typographical errors, detract from clarity.
- The baseline methods are outdated, limiting the verification of the proposed method's effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section by including more discussions on existing studies that address the suboptimal TD challenge. Additionally, important implementation details should be provided in the manuscript to enhance readability. More information about how the simulated environment resembles real-world conditions is necessary. We also suggest fixing writing issues, such as explaining the acronym “TD” in the Abstract and correcting the typo in Table 1. Furthermore, consider updating the baseline methods to include more recent and competitive approaches, and conduct a more comprehensive hyperparameter analysis beyond just the learning rate. Lastly, ensure that all equations are punctuated correctly and that the formatting of references is consistent throughout the paper.
