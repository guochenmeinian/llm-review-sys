Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the consistency of maximum likelihood estimates in probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA), extending the quotient space topology concept from Redner (1981) to demonstrate that the maximum likelihood (ML) solution is consistent in an appropriate quotient Euclidean space. The authors claim that their results also apply to a broader range of estimators beyond the ML solution and establish strong consistency under compact parameter space conditions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written, providing a thorough introduction to equivalence classes and quotient topological spaces.  
- It offers a detailed description of the quotient space topology and associated metrics, with a clear constructive approach.  
- The authors successfully verify Wald's conditions in the quotient space topology, providing sufficient technical details.  

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty of the contribution is limited, primarily applying Wald's results to probabilistic PCA without significant new insights.  
- The assumption that the latent dimension \( q \) is known could be removed for broader applicability.  
- The focus on rotation invariance may not address the most pressing concerns in PPCA and related methods.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the unique contributions of the paper to better highlight its significance. Additionally, consider removing the assumption that the latent dimension \( q \) is known to enhance the general applicability of the results. It would also be beneficial to include examples to elucidate the results in Theorem 4.2 and provide remarks on interpreting Wald's conditions within the context of the quotient space. Finally, discussing the implications of rotation invariance in relation to computational complexity could broaden the paper's relevance to other related problems.
