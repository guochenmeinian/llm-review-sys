Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Wireless Geometric Algebra Transformer (Wi-GATr) for modeling signal propagation in wireless communication. The authors propose a differentiable prediction model and a diffusion model, addressing both conventional signal prediction and inverse problems like receiver localization and 3D environment reconstruction. Additionally, the paper discusses a method for computing coverage maps that claims independence from the complexity of scene geometry. However, the authors' assertion that shoot-and-bounce (SBR) algorithms have complexity independent of the number of primitives is challenged, as refraction and diffraction significantly increase computational complexity. The authors argue that existing ray tracers struggle with implementing refraction and that no current works demonstrate optimization of transmitter or receiver positions using ray tracers. They also highlight the lack of suitable real-world datasets for their evaluation. Experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, supported by two large-scale datasets, Wi3R and WiPTR.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The approach of modeling wireless propagation as a probability model based on diffusion is novel and offers a unified solution to various signal prediction and inverse problems.
2. The authors provide a clear argument regarding the limitations of existing methods, particularly in handling refraction and diffraction.
3. The paper is logically structured, with a comprehensive introduction and high readability.
4. The feasibility of solving receiver localization, which is not addressed by current ray tracing methods, is demonstrated.
5. The intention to publish high-fidelity simulations for community access is commendable.
6. The integration of geometric algebra ensures E(3) equivariance, effectively addressing the complexities of wireless environments.

Weaknesses:
1. There is a disconnect between the identified challenges in wireless surrogate modeling and the proposed solutions, making them seem abrupt. Insights leading to these solutions should be provided.
2. The innovation appears limited, primarily extending the GATr method without significant advancements beyond tokenizing input data.
3. The experimental evaluation lacks convincing detail, particularly regarding comparisons with existing methods and the robustness of results.
4. The paper does not adequately compare their method with existing simulators like Sionna and Remcom, despite claims of having done so.
5. The authors dismiss suggested datasets without fully addressing their potential relevance.
6. Mobility is mentioned as an important problem but is not explored in depth within the context of their work.
7. The paper contains typographical errors and inconsistencies, such as discrepancies between the abstract and main text regarding localization.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the connection between the challenges faced in wireless surrogate modeling and their proposed solutions. Additionally, the authors should highlight any unique advancements introduced by Wi-GATr beyond tokenization. A more comprehensive experimental evaluation is necessary, including detailed comparisons with existing methods and addressing the lack of explanations for results in figures. We also suggest improving the comparative analysis by explicitly detailing the differences between their method and existing simulators, including Sionna and Remcom, to clarify the advantages of their approach. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide a more thorough discussion on the relevance of the suggested datasets, even if they are not directly applicable, to strengthen their argument about the lack of real-world data. Lastly, we suggest elaborating on the implications of mobility in their modeling approach, as it is a significant aspect of wireless channel modeling, and correcting typographical errors to ensure consistency throughout the paper.
