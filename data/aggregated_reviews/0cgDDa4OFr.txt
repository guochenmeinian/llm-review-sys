Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new algorithm for source estimation, focusing on estimating a model's parameters' probability distributions consistent with observations. The authors propose a sampling-based method that can be applied to high-dimensional simulators, emphasizing the selection of the highest entropy distribution among several consistent with the observations. The method employs a dual objective: a reconstruction term using sliced Wasserstein divergence and a regularization term using reverse KL divergence. The authors validate their approach through extensive experiments on various benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in recovering high-entropy source distributions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is original and addresses a significant gap in the literature regarding high-dimensional simulators.
- The mathematical derivations are sound, and the experiments are comprehensive, showcasing the effectiveness of entropy regularization.
- The clarity of presentation is commendable, with well-articulated explanations and clean figures.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation of the Lotka-Volterra and SIR experiments lacks empirical comparison with NEB, which is claimed to perform poorly but is not demonstrated.
- The computational constraints imposed by the chosen divergences (sliced Wasserstein and reverse KL) may limit the model's applicability, particularly regarding differentiability and samplability.
- The significance of the contribution is questioned, as it appears to primarily introduce a different sample-based loss function without substantial novelty beyond existing literature.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical evaluation by including comparisons with NEB in the Lotka-Volterra and SIR experiments to substantiate claims regarding its performance. Additionally, consider using a sample-based divergence for the second term in the cost function to alleviate computational constraints. Clarifying the evaluation procedure and benchmarking against other similar methods would enhance the paper's rigor. Finally, addressing the theoretical aspects of the sliced Wasserstein distance, including its statistical consistency and error bounds, would strengthen the contribution.
