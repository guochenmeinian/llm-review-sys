### Key Points
This paper presents a framework based on Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) to measure behavioral homophily in social media, specifically on Reddit. The authors identify five behavioral user types and quantify behavioral homophily, demonstrating a positive correlation with topic homophily, though they can diverge. The methodology is clear and reproducible, but certain analytical steps lack motivation. The final dataset comprises only 662 users, raising concerns about generalizability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The application of IRL provides a novel perspective on measuring homophily based on user behavior rather than content.
- The case study on Reddit offers practical insights into user interactions across different communities.
- The paper is well-structured and logically organized.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on a small dataset of 662 users limits the representativeness and generalizability of findings.
- Certain methodological choices, such as the use of cosine similarity and the selection of k = 5 for clustering, lack sufficient justification.
- The practical implications of measuring behavioral homophily are not clearly articulated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for certain analytical steps, particularly regarding the accuracy of the inferred reward function from IRL and the verification of MDP properties. Clarifying the representativeness of the dataset and considering expanding the sample size would enhance the findings' generalizability. We suggest providing more details on the practical implications of behavioral homophily, especially how it could mitigate polarization and foster inclusive networks. Additionally, we encourage the authors to justify their choice of cosine similarity and explore the robustness of results against other similarity measures. Finally, a running time and memory analysis of the method would provide insights into its computational requirements and scalability.
