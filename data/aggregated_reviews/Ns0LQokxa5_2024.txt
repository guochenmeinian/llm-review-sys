Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents GaussianCut, a method for interactive multi-view segmentation of scenes using 3D Gaussian splatting. The approach utilizes user inputs (clicks, scribbles, or text prompts) to generate initial segmentation masks, which are then refined through a graph-cut algorithm applied to a graph of 3D Gaussians. The method optimizes an energy function that connects similar Gaussians and distinguishes between foreground and background, achieving competitive results on multiple benchmarks. The authors have received positive feedback from reviewers, indicating a strong foundation and potential for improvement.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is well-motivated and presents a clear pipeline for segmentation.
- The energy function is logically constructed, and the qualitative results demonstrate improved sharpness compared to baselines.
- The paper is well-written, with clear figures aiding comprehension.
- The paper has garnered positive feedback, indicating a strong foundation and potential for improvement.

Weaknesses:
- The computational cost is not real-time, limiting practical application.
- The novelty of the method is questioned, as it appears to combine existing techniques without sufficiently clarifying its unique contributions.
- There is a lack of detailed comparisons with relevant prior works, particularly regarding performance and runtime.
- The initial version may require revisions to address specific concerns raised by the reviewers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the mapping between user inputs and Gaussians, possibly through illustrations. Additionally, the authors should provide a more thorough comparison with existing methods like LangSplat and Gaussian Grouping, highlighting the advantages of GaussianCut. Including runtime comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods is essential to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the method's training-free aspect and its implications, as well as address the sensitivity of the method to hyperparameters. Lastly, visualizations of energy terms and high-confidence clusters would enhance reader understanding. Incorporating the discussed changes will ensure a more robust final version of the paper.
