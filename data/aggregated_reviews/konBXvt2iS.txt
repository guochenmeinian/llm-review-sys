### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the training dynamics of two-layer ReLU neural networks on linearly separable data. The authors identify four distinct phases of the training process, detailing specific nonlinear behaviors in each phase. They derive explicit formulae for the evolution of network parameters and prove convergence results for the network's output. The contributions include a complete theoretical characterization of the training process, insights into initialization and regularization, and an understanding of the generalization properties of ReLU networks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The originality of the paper lies in its complete theoretical characterization of the training dynamics of two-layer ReLU networks, providing a more comprehensive understanding than previous works focused on local analysis or approximate linear models.  
- The authors successfully identify four distinct training phases and describe the nonlinear behaviors associated with each, supported by rigorous mathematical proofs and explicit formulations.

Weaknesses:  
- The focus on two-layer ReLU networks trained on linearly separable data may limit the generalizability of the findings to more complex networks or datasets.  
- The lack of empirical validation of theoretical results is a significant drawback, as it would enhance the credibility of the findings.  
- The manuscript does not sufficiently detail the computational resources involved, nor does it provide a clear delineation of its limitations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by exploring more complex network architectures and datasets. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide empirical validation of their theoretical results on real-world datasets to strengthen the study's credibility. It would also be beneficial to include more details regarding the computational aspects and resources utilized in the research, as well as a clearer discussion of the limitations.
