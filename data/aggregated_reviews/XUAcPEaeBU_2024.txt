Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel two-stage approach for lensless image reconstruction, addressing the challenge of spatially varying Point Spread Function (PSF). The method incorporates a spatially varying deconvolution technique and utilizes a pretrained diffusion model to enhance photorealism while ensuring data consistency. The authors propose a learnable spatially varying PSF, demonstrating significant improvements in reconstruction quality over existing methods through evaluations on the PhlatCam and DiffuserCam datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and provides a detailed problem statement, innovative reconstruction method, and thorough experimental results.
2. The approach effectively addresses the challenge of reconstructing high-frequency details in lensless imaging, showcasing originality by using a generative approach solely for reconstruction in the null space.
3. The quality of the reconstructed images closely resembles ground truth, with extensive evaluations demonstrating superior performance across multiple metrics.

Weaknesses:
1. The lack of real-world experiments is noted, although mitigated by the use of standard datasets.
2. Insufficient detail regarding the training process and the method of dividing the SV-PSF into a 3Ã—3 grid raises concerns about the spatial dependency of the PSF.
3. The analysis of results is inadequate, particularly regarding the comparison between the estimated and accurately calibrated SV-PSF.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the training process, specifically whether fine-tuning occurs at test time or if the PSF and parameters are fixed. Additionally, we suggest expanding Fig. 4(b) and Fig. A1 to illustrate how PSFs change with different fields of view, and enhancing Fig. 2 and Fig. 4(d) to demonstrate the significance of spatially varying PSFs, potentially including pixel-wise error maps. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide more optical perspective explanations in Section 3.2, referencing off-axis wave propagation models to strengthen the paper's soundness. Lastly, a discussion on the robustness of the two-stage framework and its potential limitations would be beneficial.
