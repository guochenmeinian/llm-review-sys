Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of metric clustering problems aimed at maximizing inter-cluster objectives, specifically the minimum spacing (MS) and minimum spanning tree (MST) distances. The authors demonstrate that the single-linkage algorithm by Kleinberg and Tardos optimizes the MS objective and also satisfies the MST objective. They further show that any algorithm satisfying MST will also satisfy MS. The authors explore a constrained version of the problem, requiring clusters to have a minimum size \( L \), and provide bicriteria approximation algorithms along with corresponding lower bounds.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is technically solid and well-written.
2. The inter-clustering objective is novel and opens new avenues for clustering research.
3. The results are tight, with impressive characterizations and appropriate inapproximability results.

Weaknesses:
1. The practical motivation for the model is weak; the authors should elaborate on potential applications to enhance relevance, especially for NeurIPS standards.
2. The necessity of the lower bound constraint is unclear from a practical perspective.
3. The empirical results do not convincingly demonstrate the performance of the algorithms, and additional experiments could strengthen the case for their use.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on practical applications and motivation for their model, providing concrete use-cases to enhance relevance. Additionally, consider expanding the empirical results in the main paper to better illustrate the performance of the algorithms, potentially moving some proofs to the supplemental material to make space. Lastly, we suggest adding more intuition regarding the approximation achieved by Algorithm 2 to clarify its non-triviality.
