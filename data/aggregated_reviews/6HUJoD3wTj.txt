Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents theoretical separations in the representational abilities of Transformer and Recurrent Architectures across selected synthetic tasks, including index lookup, nearest neighbor, recognizing bounded Dyck languages, and string equality. The authors demonstrate that 1-layer Transformers can achieve poly-logarithmic width for certain tasks while recurrent architectures require linear width, and vice versa for other tasks. The analysis is supported by experiments that illustrate optimization efficiencies of both architecture classes on practical-size sequences.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1) The paper is theoretically solid, with novel proof techniques that may benefit further analysis of modern deep learning architectures.
2) The architectures considered are of practical interest, enhancing understanding of their power and limitations.
3) The authors provide a unified view of the strengths and weaknesses of both models, with clear and accessible writing.

Weaknesses:
1) The experimental section is brief, and the analysis of computational or statistical learning complexity is deferred to future work.
2) The contributions do not significantly address why Transformers have supplanted LSTMs in many applications, as the analysis is limited to synthetic tasks with 1-layer models.
3) The relevance of results for deeper Transformers or other tasks remains unclear, and the choice of tasks lacks sufficient motivation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation of their results by clearly articulating the significance of the chosen tasks and their relevance to real-world applications. Including a table that summarizes the complexity of each model across tasks could enhance clarity. Additionally, we suggest that the authors elaborate on the implications of their findings for multi-layer Transformers and provide intuition regarding the limitations of 1-layer models in representing boolean functions. Lastly, addressing the discrepancies in experimental results for bounded Dyck languages would strengthen the paper's validity.
