Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a semi-supervised pseudo-label-based method for 3D point cloud segmentation using sparse label annotations. The authors propose a novel approach that utilizes all unlabeled points and regularizes high-confidence pseudo labels through entropy. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that their method enhances performance in low-label regimes across multiple datasets and backbone architectures.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors provide a theoretical analysis that offers valuable insights.
- Experimental results are convincing, showcasing improvements across four datasets and four baselines.
- The method is simple yet effective, with extensive experiments supporting its efficacy.

Weaknesses:
- The derivation of the loss function, particularly the cross-entropy between pseudo labels and predictions, is overly detailed and could be simplified. Some parts, while interesting, would be better suited in the appendix.
- The most innovative aspect, the pseudo-label generation, is inadequately highlighted in the main text and is buried in the appendix.
- The writing lacks clarity and rigor, leading to imprecise statements, such as the mischaracterization of entropy regularization's effect on noise in pseudo-labels. Many variables are not introduced, and the overall presentation is subpar.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and rigor of their writing, ensuring that critical concepts are clearly articulated and variables are properly introduced. The authors should also consider swapping the sections on the derivation of Equation (6) and pseudo-label generation between the appendix and the main paper to emphasize the latter's importance. Additionally, detailed proofs of Table 1 should be included in the appendix, and the notion that lower entropy equates to less noise should be removed. Finally, providing visualizations of the entropy map, pseudo-labels, and KD loss map during training would greatly enhance understanding of the proposed method's dynamics.
