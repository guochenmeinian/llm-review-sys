Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the DDSR model for Sequential Recommendation (SR), which captures user interest evolution using fuzzy sets of interaction sequences. DDSR effectively addresses the unpredictability of user behavior and cold start issues, outperforming existing methods in experiments on benchmark datasets. The authors propose leveraging fuzzy sets and discrete diffusion modeling to enhance recommendation accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. DDSR introduces a novel perspective in SR, addressing limitations of traditional methods and enhancing recommendation accuracy.
2. The use of fuzzy sets and diffusion transition processes improves the model's ability to capture user behavior randomness.
3. The theoretical justification for the information diffusion approximation model is sound.
4. Quantitative results demonstrate the model's effectiveness, particularly in cold start scenarios.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks an algorithm to describe the entire model operation, which would enhance understanding.
2. All experimental results are quantitative; a case study or visual experiment is recommended.
3. Insufficient baseline comparison with conventional models, as the included models are outdated.
4. Missing runtime cost comparisons, which are crucial for practical deployment considerations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing and provide a comprehensive algorithmic description of the model. Supplementing quantitative results with a case study or visual experiment would enhance the paper's impact. Additionally, including a comparison of actual running times and performance variations by varying the codebook length \( m \) would provide valuable insights for readers.
