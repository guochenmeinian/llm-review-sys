### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of website adherence to the Acceptable Ads Standard, revealing that approximately 10% of domains in the exception list display non-compliant ads. The authors employ a two-crawl detection methodology to assess compliance across a sample of 10,000 popular websites, identifying significant design flaws in the exception list that allow publishers to bypass restrictions. The findings underscore the need for improvements to enhance user experience and maintain trust in the ad system.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The study addresses a critical issue in online advertising, balancing monetization and user experience.  
- The empirical approach, utilizing a large dataset and robust methodology, provides valuable insights into non-compliance rates.  
- The identification of design flaws and actionable improvements to the exception list are practical contributions to the field.  

Weaknesses:  
- The reliance on specific heuristics and exclusion of mobile ads limits the study's applicability.  
- The analysis does not sufficiently address the precision/recall trade-off in the proposed ruleset.  
- The paper lacks a broader contextualization of findings and a detailed roadmap for implementing proposed improvements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Figures 3 and 5, possibly replacing Figure 3 with a Spearman correlation coefficient to better illustrate ad frequency across ranks. Additionally, the authors should normalize values in Figure 5 by the prevalence of all ads to clarify the significance of findings. A more comprehensive discussion on the precision/recall trade-off is necessary, particularly regarding the potential for increased false positives with the modified ruleset. Furthermore, we suggest expanding the methodology to include various ad-blocking technologies and exploring compliance across different regions, particularly in the context of GDPR. Lastly, a clearer framework for the proposed improvements to the exception list, including potential challenges, would enhance the paper's practical impact.
