Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for metric-scale monocular depth estimation called RSA, which leverages language descriptions of objects in scenes to recover metric-scaled depth maps. The authors propose a simple design using MLP layers trained on text embeddings extracted from single images, demonstrating the method's effectiveness through extensive evaluation across various datasets. The findings suggest that using text prompts as an image representation can yield high-level scene properties, although the practical applicability of this approach in real-world scenarios remains a concern.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The use of language descriptions to convert relative depth predictions into metric scale depth maps is innovative.
- The method shows superior performance compared to baseline methods, supported by extensive evaluation and ablation studies.
- The paper is well-written and presents results clearly.

Weaknesses:
- The practical applicability of depth prediction using text descriptions is questionable, particularly in scenarios like autonomous driving where users may not provide verbal input.
- The robustness of the method is uncertain in challenging images with less context or when object detectors fail.
- The evaluation is limited to a few datasets, raising concerns about the generalizability of the method.
- The model design is simplistic, lacking exploration of alternative architectures or more complex prompt designs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the practical applicability of their method by exploring scenarios where text descriptions may not be readily available. Additionally, conducting more extensive evaluations across a wider range of datasets, including real-world scenarios, would strengthen the evidence for the method's robustness and generalizability. We suggest elaborating on the linear transformation process and the role of text captions to enhance understanding. Furthermore, considering alternative model designs and incorporating more detailed prompt information, such as object coordinates and camera intrinsics, could provide additional context for scale estimation. Lastly, a comparison with direct fusion of detector/CLIP features into the RSA model would be beneficial to validate the effectiveness of the proposed bootstrapping approach.
