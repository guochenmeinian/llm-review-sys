### Key Points
This paper presents a study on in-context learning (ICL) in linear regression with a Gaussian prior that has a non-zero mean. The authors prove that a linear transformer block (LTB) achieves a smaller approximation error than linear self-attention (LSA) in this context. They demonstrate that LTB can implement one-step gradient descent with learnable initialization (GD-$\beta$), and that all global minimizers in the LTB class correspond to the unique global minimizer in the GD-$\beta$ class. The paper also explores the non-convex dynamics of the GD-$\beta$ class, showing convergence to the unique global minimizer, supported by simulations on GPT-2.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Clarity: The paper is presented clearly and is easy to follow.
2. Significance: It characterizes the benefits of the linear MLP in ICL for linear regression, an important topic in ICL theory.
3. Quality: The investigation into the effects of linear MLP from approximation and optimization perspectives is thorough, with solid derivations.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper omits discussion of non-linear transformer blocks, despite recent works addressing them. The authors should consider the implications of these studies on their findings.
2. The convergence of the LTB class to the global minimizer is not discussed, which requires clarification.
3. The analysis remains limited to linear settings, and the authors do not address the potential for finite-sample guarantees.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the implications of non-linear transformer studies on their results. Additionally, the authors should clarify whether the training dynamics of the LTB class can converge to the global minimizer. It would also be beneficial to explore the potential for finite-sample guarantees in their analysis. Lastly, addressing the questions regarding the inclusion of positional encoding and the optimization dynamics of GD-$\beta$ could enhance the paper's depth.
