Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to cross-domain few-shot semantic segmentation (CD-FSS) by introducing a lightweight frequency masker designed to enhance model robustness against domain gaps through filtering different frequency components. The authors propose an amplitude-phase-masker (APM) module and an adaptive channel phase attention (ACPA) module, which aim to reduce inter-channel correlations and improve feature robustness. The method reportedly achieves significant performance improvements, sometimes exceeding 14%, without extensive retraining.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a relevant and challenging problem in few-shot semantic segmentation, particularly in cross-domain scenarios where performance typically suffers due to domain shifts.
2. The lightweight frequency masker introduces minimal additional parameters (0.01%) while achieving significant performance improvements (over 10% on average), representing a strong practical contribution.
3. The authors provide a thorough interpretation of frequency filtering's impact on feature channel correlations, supported by mathematical derivations and extensive experiments on four target datasets.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the approach could be better established through a more detailed comparison with state-of-the-art methods that also address domain shifts in few-shot segmentation, particularly those utilizing frequency operations.
2. The paper lacks discussion on the computational efficiency of the proposed method, which is crucial for practical applications; details on runtime and resource requirements should be included.
3. The potential for overfitting in few-shot finetuning is not addressed, raising questions about how this method might mitigate such issues.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty establishment by providing a more comprehensive comparison with existing methods, particularly those employing frequency domain techniques. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion on the computational efficiency of the proposed method, detailing runtime and resource requirements. To address concerns about overfitting, the authors should clarify how their approach may help reduce this issue in few-shot finetuning scenarios. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis on the choice of frequency components to filter would enhance understanding of the method's robustness.
