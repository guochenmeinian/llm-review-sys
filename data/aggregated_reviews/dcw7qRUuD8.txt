Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of Gaussian Random Fields to incorporate precision-based spatiotemporal structures. The authors propose a two-stage approach for inference and parameter learning, utilizing variational inference (VI) for parameter estimation followed by conjugate gradient (CG) for posterior inference. The model is designed to reflect temporal sparsity and is computationally feasible, producing accurate posteriors with competitive performance compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The model effectively extends existing Gaussian frameworks to account for temporal dependencies, which is crucial for many datasets.  
- The clarity of presentation and mathematical rigor is commendable, making the paper accessible.  
- The method shows low computational complexity and scalability, enhancing its applicability.  

Weaknesses:  
- The experimental evaluation is inadequate, relying on a single simulated dataset and lacking comparisons with real-world data or more complex models.  
- The novelty of the approach is moderate, as it builds on established concepts without significant innovation in the spatiotemporal context.  
- The validation of the dynamical model (F) is insufficient, and only the posterior mean is evaluated, leaving questions about the posterior variance unanswered.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including comparisons with real-world datasets and more complex models, such as AR processes with spatial noise, to demonstrate the method's generalizability. Additionally, the authors should evaluate the learned dynamical model (F) and provide insights into the learned structures, illustrating their accuracy and utility. Addressing the computational efficiency of the variational distribution learning process, particularly in the context of ill-conditioned matrices, would also strengthen the paper. Finally, we suggest discussing relevant works, such as the natural gradient approach and the dual Kalman filter, to contextualize the contributions more effectively.
