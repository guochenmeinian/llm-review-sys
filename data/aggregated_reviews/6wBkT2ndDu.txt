Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of the Pandora's Box problem with correlated values, extending Weitzman's original algorithm for independent values to this correlated case. The authors propose two algorithms that achieve improved approximation ratios of 4.428 and 5.828, respectively, depending on the update model used. The paper also discusses the learnability of the algorithms from samples of the distribution, marking a significant theoretical advancement in optimal stopping theory.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper makes a major contribution to optimal stopping theory by addressing a natural and important problem, providing clean answers and improved approximation ratios.
- The algorithms are simple and extend Weitzman's notion of reservation value, filling a gap in understanding the correlated version of the problem.

Weaknesses:  
- The technical writing requires improvement; some proofs, such as the histogram argument in Theorem 3.2, are difficult to follow without figures. 
- The soundness of the proofs is sometimes questionable, with informal descriptions making it hard to verify their validity. For instance, the handling of the opening cost in Algorithm 2 lacks clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the technical writing, particularly in the proofs, by providing more intermediate steps and visual aids where necessary. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the role of the opening cost $c_b$ in the algorithm and its implications for the proofs. It would also be beneficial to justify the importance of the correlated case and address why the richer update model yields weaker results. Finally, we encourage the authors to incorporate the illuminating example mentioned in the reviews to enhance reader comprehension.
