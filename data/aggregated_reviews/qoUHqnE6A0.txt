### Key Points
This paper presents a study on small transformers trained on greatest common divisor (GCD) and modular multiplication tasks, highlighting that training on datasets with repeated examples leads to improved performance. The authors propose a two-set training scheme, combining a small random subset of repeated examples with a larger dataset, which they find to be the most effective method for achieving high accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The study has a strong scientific basis, effectively isolating the impact of dataset changes.  
- It provides novel insights on training data mixtures for mathematical tasks, with potential applications in other areas.

Weaknesses:  
- The claim that repetition of a small training set achieves better performance may be overstated, as larger datasets have not fully converged. The authors should rephrase claims to emphasize speed improvements.  
- The paper does not consider how model size might influence results; investigating the dependence on model size is recommended.  
- The best performance in Figure 2 occurs at a small repeated set size, suggesting that training without repetitions may yield better results. The authors should sample smaller repeated set sizes and include cases without repetitions.  
- The use of bold font appears random; it should be reserved for key claims.  
- Overall document formatting could be improved, including figure text size and clearer structure using LaTeX commands. Some figures lack essential information for quick comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their claims regarding performance by emphasizing speed rather than outright superiority. Additionally, we suggest researching the influence of model size on training outcomes. It would be beneficial to sample smaller repeated set sizes and include non-repeated cases to explore their impact on performance. The authors should also refine the use of bold text for key claims and enhance the document's formatting for better readability.
