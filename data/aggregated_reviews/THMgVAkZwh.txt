Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents VLKEB, a new benchmark for knowledge editing in large vision-language models (VLMs). It addresses limitations in existing benchmarks by improving data quality and introducing the portability metric. The authors conduct comprehensive experiments on various editing methods across five large vision-language models, providing insights into their strengths and weaknesses.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-organized, with clear figures and a logical flow of ideas.
2. The comparison with existing benchmarks effectively highlights the contributions of VLKEB.
3. The benchmark enhances the field of VLM editing by providing high-quality data and comprehensive evaluation metrics.
4. Detailed documentation of dataset construction and evaluation methods is provided.
5. Extensive experiments evaluate the performance of different editing methods, yielding valuable insights.

Weaknesses:
1. Some methods achieve nearly 100% accuracy, suggesting the benchmark may not be sufficiently challenging.
2. Limited testing of knowledge editing involving multimodal interactions is noted.
3. Minor writing issues and clarity concerns in figures and mathematical symbols are present.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the challenge level of the benchmark to ensure it adequately tests modern methods. Additionally, we suggest revising the introduction to be more concise and addressing the clarity of figures, particularly Figure 3. The authors should also consider expanding the evaluation to include more complex multimodal interactions, such as multi-round QA, and provide a separate analysis for the effects of knowledge editing on both modalities. Finally, a more explicit discussion of ethical considerations and potential societal impacts of LVKEB would enhance the paper.
