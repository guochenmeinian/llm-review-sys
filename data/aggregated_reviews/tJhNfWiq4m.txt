### Key Points
This paper presents a Bayesian approach to outcome-weighted learning (OWL) for estimating optimal individualized treatment regimes (ITRs) with uncertainty quantification. The authors propose transforming the OWL framework into a Bayesian probabilistic model, which facilitates inference and individual-level uncertainty quantification. The motivation is to address limitations in traditional machine learning methods, particularly the lack of uncertainty quantification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The manuscript introduces a novel Bayesian approach to OWL, addressing key limitations in uncertainty quantification.
- The proposed method learns optimal ITRs directly without estimating conditional mean models, marking an innovative contribution to Bayesian machine learning in healthcare.
- The simulation study demonstrates the approach's potential in precision medicine, with implications for improving treatment decisions.

Weaknesses:
- The manuscript lacks an abstract.
- The focus often shifts to specific applications in individualized treatment regimes, introducing domain-specific terminology that may obscure the core contributions related to Bayesian optimization for non-expert readers.
- Figure 1's readability is compromised due to indistinguishable colors and small labels, numbers, and markers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the manuscript by including an abstract to summarize key contributions. Additionally, clarifying the specific aspects of the Bayesian approach that enable individual-level uncertainty quantification would enhance understanding. The authors should also consider providing clearer explanations of domain-specific terms for non-expert readers to maintain focus on the Bayesian learning framework. Finally, improving the readability of Figure 1 by adjusting color contrasts and increasing label sizes would be beneficial.
