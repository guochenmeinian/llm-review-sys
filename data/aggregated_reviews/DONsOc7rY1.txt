Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for architecture in subset selection, introducing HORSE, which leverages an identity property and key-query-based attention mechanisms. The authors validate their method through extensive experiments and theoretical justification, demonstrating its effectiveness in recommendation and anomaly detection tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of the Identity Property is a valuable contribution, and the attention-based mechanism effectively captures complex interactions.
- The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations and a comprehensive experimental evaluation across multiple datasets.
- The writing is informative and easy to understand, making complex concepts accessible.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a detailed evaluation with a broader range of datasets and comparisons to popular methods outside the subset-valued function domain.
- There is insufficient discussion on the impact of random partitioning of the set V and the sensitivity of the method to this partitioning.
- The notation used is unnecessarily complex, which may hinder clarity, and the paper could benefit from a more detailed ablation study and analysis of computational complexity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the notation to enhance understanding and reduce complexity. Additionally, we suggest conducting a more extensive evaluation with a wider variety of datasets and comparing HORSE to state-of-the-art methods beyond the set-function learning domain. A detailed ablation study isolating the contributions of different components, such as the attention mechanism and partitioning scheme, would provide deeper insights into the model's effectiveness. Furthermore, addressing the impact of random partitioning and providing a thorough analysis of computational complexity would strengthen the paper.
