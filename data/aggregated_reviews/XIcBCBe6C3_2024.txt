Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents "TinyTTA: Efficient Test-time Adaptation via Early-exit Ensembles on Edge Devices," which combines test-time adaptation (TTA) of pre-trained models with early-exit strategies for efficient inference on edge devices. The authors introduce a novel weight normalization that does not depend on batch statistics and a framework called TinyTTA for their experiments. The method demonstrates low latency and energy consumption while achieving superior accuracy on various image datasets and small devices.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of test-time adaptation with early exits for small devices is a commendable approach.
- The TinyTTA engine and experimental evaluations are impressive and well-executed.
- The framework addresses the challenges of deploying TTA on resource-constrained devices, showcasing significant improvements in accuracy and memory efficiency.

Weaknesses:
- The paper is primarily engineering-focused, lacking methodological depth, which raises questions about its fit for the NeurIPS conference.
- The concept of self-ensembling and early exits lacks thorough exploration and is not sufficiently distinguished from existing literature.
- The evaluation does not address the memory overhead introduced by early exits, and the paper lacks clarity on certain technical aspects, such as the grouping of layers and the implications of activation memory.
- Implementation details necessary for reproducibility are missing, and the paper does not explore the generalizability of TinyTTA across different platforms or data types.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the depth of discussion regarding the novelty of self-ensembling and early exits by providing a clearer differentiation from existing methods. Additionally, the authors should address the memory overhead associated with early exits and clarify the implementation details necessary for reproducibility. We suggest including a broader range of experiments beyond vision data to assess the generalizability of TinyTTA. Furthermore, enhancing the clarity of figures and providing a more detailed analysis of adaptation time and energy consumption would strengthen the paper. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the motivations behind their design choices and the training process on-device.
