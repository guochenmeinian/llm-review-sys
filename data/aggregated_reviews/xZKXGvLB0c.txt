Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of the differences in predictor merging from causal and anti-causal perspectives, utilizing MAXENT and CMAXENT. The findings indicate that the causal direction converges to logistic regression, while the anti-causal direction leads to Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The authors also analyze how decision boundaries vary under partial bivariate distributions, with implications for Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Out-Of-Variable (OOV) generalization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The investigation into causal and anti-causal predictor merging is thorough and well-articulated.  
- The paper effectively demonstrates that different data-generating processes yield distinct predictors under the CMAXENT objective, establishing necessary and sufficient conditions for these differences.

Weaknesses:  
1. The study relies on a small-scale dataset, limiting the applicability of findings to larger models. The authors should discuss potential limitations in larger-scale or multivariate scenarios.  
2. There is insufficient comparison with existing literature, particularly regarding the pi-Tuning method.  
3. The contributions appear to consolidate previous work rather than present novel insights.  
4. The exploration of non-causal settings is lacking, particularly from a signal processing perspective.  
5. The results are based on a toy example, which does not adequately address the impact of noise and biases in real-world applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical foundation of their work by including experiments with larger datasets and discussing the implications of their findings in more complex settings. Additionally, we suggest expanding the literature review to include relevant studies on the merging of expert models and federated learning, as well as providing comparisons to alternative methods. Including an empirical or simulation example would enhance the paper's impact and allow for better assessment of the proposed methods. Finally, addressing the effects of noise and biases on the results would strengthen the overall analysis.
