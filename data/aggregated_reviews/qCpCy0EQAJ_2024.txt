Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Dynamic Neural Regeneration (DNR), a framework aimed at enhancing the generalization of deep neural networks on small datasets. The method, inspired by neurogenesis, introduces a data-aware dynamic masking scheme that selectively eliminates redundant connections, thereby improving model capacity. The authors demonstrate DNR's strong performance through extensive experiments across multiple datasets, showing it outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents a clear motivation for the proposed method.
- The methodology is innovative, utilizing data-aware dynamic masking effectively.
- Experimental results are comprehensive, demonstrating strong performance against various baselines and robustness to challenges like class imbalance.

Weaknesses:
- The absence of experiments on medical datasets, despite the emphasis on limited data availability in medical domains, is a significant oversight.
- There is a lack of analysis regarding computational costs, particularly for larger datasets.
- The transfer learning experiment lacks clarity, and the rationale for not including transfer learning experiments is not addressed.
- The results on large datasets indicate that DNR may not be effective in high-data regimes, where standard training suffices.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the manuscript by including experiments on medical datasets such as Papila and Harvard-GF3300 to validate the method's applicability in low-data regimes. Additionally, a detailed analysis of computational costs should be presented to assess the practicality of DNR. Clarifying the transfer learning experiment in section 5.4 and providing a rationale for its exclusion would enhance the paper's clarity. Furthermore, including statistical analyses to support claims of DNR's performance compared to state-of-the-art methods is essential. Lastly, revising the schematics in Figure 1 for better clarity and providing implementation guidelines would benefit practitioners.
