Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Semantic-Aware Normalizing Flow (SANFlow) framework for anomaly detection (AD) and anomaly localization (AL) that maps the distributions of normal data to different distributions at each spatial location in an image, enhancing the separation of abnormal data from normal data. The method utilizes a frozen pretrained model for feature extraction, employs a normalizing flow to learn the distribution of these features, and incorporates synthetic negatives during training. The results demonstrate competitive performance on benchmark datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The manuscript is well-written and easy to follow, with a clear description of the SANFlow model and its methodology.
- The approach of modeling different normalizing flow priors at each spatial location is innovative and leverages semantic information effectively.
- The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in both anomaly detection and localization tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The contributions of the proposed method may be considered incremental compared to existing works, particularly regarding the differences between CFlow-AD and SANFlow.
- The rationale for estimating both mean and variance should be elaborated, especially since this is a central aspect of the contribution.
- Implementation details for the multi-scale flow network are lacking, hindering reproducibility, and no code is provided.
- The paper does not sufficiently address the performance evaluation using the PRO metric, which is crucial for small defect detection.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the elaboration on the intuition behind estimating both mean and variance, particularly in relation to the main contributions of the manuscript. Additionally, providing detailed implementation information for the multi-scale flow network and making the code available would enhance reproducibility. We also suggest conducting ablation studies to clarify the margin between normal and abnormal means and expanding the experimental evaluation to include other standard datasets like CIFAR10. Finally, we encourage the authors to consider established data augmentation methods for synthesizing anomalies to assess their impact on detection performance.
