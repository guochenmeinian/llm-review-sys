Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to language-driven scene synthesis, integrating text prompts, human motion, and existing objects to predict furniture placement. The authors propose a guiding points strategy that explicitly predicts a "pseudo" target point cloud, which is then used to guide the diffusion model in generating the final scene. The method demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art techniques and introduces three practical scene-editing applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of text prompts and human motion into scene synthesis is a significant advancement, enhancing real-world applicability.
- The guiding points concept effectively unifies multiple conditions and contributes to the denoising process, marking a departure from previous implicit methods.
- Comprehensive theoretical and experimental analyses, including ablative studies, validate the proposed method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity on the necessity and advantages of using a diffusion model for this task compared to prior methods.
- The dataset is overly simplistic, relying solely on synthetic data, which may not reflect real-world complexities.
- Presentation issues arise from the organization of theoretical components, making it difficult to follow the main contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology, particularly regarding the justification for using a diffusion model. Additionally, conducting experiments on real-world datasets would strengthen the findings. The authors should consider reorganizing the theoretical sections to enhance readability, potentially moving detailed derivations to supplementary materials. Furthermore, providing a clearer explanation of the guiding points and their role in the denoising process would benefit the audience's understanding. Lastly, including text prompt conditions in comparisons with MIME would ensure a fair evaluation of the proposed method.
