Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method called Grounded Decoding (GD) to ground high-level semantic plans generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) into realizable action sequences for robot control. The approach integrates various grounded models, including RL value functions and multi-modal perception models, to enhance the generation of control commands in unstructured environments. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of GD through experiments in both simulated and real-world robotic tasks, showing improvements over existing methods like SayCan.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and clearly presents the methodology, supported by effective visual aids.
- Extensive experimental evaluation across diverse environments enhances the robustness of the findings.
- The inclusion of ablation studies and failure mode analysis provides valuable insights into the method's performance and limitations.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution appears incremental to SayCan, primarily allowing open-vocabulary planning without substantial novel insights.
- Limited experimental evaluation across environments restricts the generalizability of the claims.
- The motivation for using grounded information is insufficiently articulated, and the paper lacks comparisons between different grounding functions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing, particularly addressing awkward expressions in certain sections. Additionally, including a comparison with techniques such as Grounded SAM would provide a more robust evaluation of the proposed approach. Conducting real-world experiments with a broader range of robots and baselines would enhance the reproducibility and applicability of the findings. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors clarify how the grounded model integrates with robot motion planning and consider the implications of environmental constraints in their methodology.
