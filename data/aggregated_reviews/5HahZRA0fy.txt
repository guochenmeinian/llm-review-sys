Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an algorithm (damped Sinkhorn) and theoretical convergence guarantees for computing doubly regularized Wasserstein barycenters. The concept of doubly entropic Wasserstein barycenters introduces an additional level of regularization, allowing the two regularization terms to counterbalance each other, leading to a debiasing effect under appropriate conditions. The authors demonstrate that the damped Sinkhorn algorithm can be implemented using an approximate Sinkhorn oracle, evaluated via Monte Carlo sampling, providing a complete computational pipeline with theoretical guarantees.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a complex and relevant problem in optimal transport and computational geometry, providing rigorous convergence guarantees that enhance the proposed algorithm's value.  
- It effectively connects the algorithmic problem to practical computation, demonstrating implementation through Monte Carlo sampling, which offers a comprehensive view of the problem.  
- The theoretical contributions are significant, and the clarity of presentation aids in understanding the derivations of the proposed algorithms.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper contains minor errors and inconsistencies, such as missing weights in Equation (2) and inconsistent notations in Lemma 1 and Theorem 1.  
- It lacks numerical illustrations of the algorithms, which would demonstrate their effectiveness and provide empirical validation of the theoretical claims.  
- The discussion on the LSI constant derived using Holleyâ€“Stroock perturbation appears impractical, and the convergence of the algorithm for unbounded costs is not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including numerical experiments or illustrations for both synthetic and real-world data to validate the results of the proposed algorithms. Additionally, addressing the minor errors and inconsistencies noted, such as the missing weights and notations, will enhance clarity. We also suggest providing a more detailed explanation of the optimization process in Section 2.2 and including a thorough derivation of Algorithm 1 to aid reader comprehension. Finally, discussing the practical implications of the LSI constant and the convergence behavior for unbounded costs would strengthen the paper's contributions.
