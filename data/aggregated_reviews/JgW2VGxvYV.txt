### Key Points
This paper presents a framework called Step-by-Step Coding (SBSC) designed to enhance large language model (LLM) performance on complex mathematical problems. The authors conduct extensive experiments comparing SBSC with state-of-the-art methods such as Chain-of-Thought (COT), Program-Aided Language Models (PAL), and Tool-Integrated Reasoning Agent (TIR-ToRA) across datasets like AIME, AMC, and MathOdyssey. The results indicate significant performance improvements, with absolute gains of 6-12% over existing methods. Detailed ablation studies are included to assess the impact of various SBSC components. However, the evaluation is limited to text-based integer-answer questions, which may restrict its generalizability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The pipeline is clearly explained with effective examples, illustrating why SBSC may outperform one-shot program generation methods.  
- The approach emphasizes breaking down complex reasoning tasks into smaller subproblems, allowing for focused attention on specific constraints and edge cases.  
- SBSC demonstrates improved error rectification capabilities.  
- The framework has potential for extension to other complex reasoning tasks.

Weaknesses:  
- The rationale behind the choice of 6-7 turns per problem is unclear.  
- The framework is limited to non-image-based problems with integer-based answers only.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their comparisons by including efficiency metrics, such as API cost or token usage. Additionally, please address the following points for clarity:  
- Explain the absence of SBSC's `maj@7` results in Table 1.  
- Provide explicit definitions for AMC3Yrs and AIME3Yrs in Figure 1.  
- Revise Line 20 to read: "elementary GSM8k [9] & high-school level MATH [14]."
