Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a systematic review of the algorithmic recourse (AR) literature, analyzing 127 publications to explore conceptual and practical approaches for providing actionable recommendations to individuals affected by algorithmic systems. The authors address nine research questions related to the framing and study of AR, emphasizing the need for a more practical application of these techniques in real-world scenarios. The review highlights the significance of engaging with human-computer interaction (HCI) and systems-level thinking, while also noting the limitations in the current literature regarding real-world deployments and user studies. Additionally, the authors provide a toolkit aimed at facilitating a systems-oriented approach to AR, arguing that their systematic literature review fulfills the "new and original research" requirement of the NeurIPS Call For Papers (CFP) by offering empirical data collection and analysis rather than merely summarizing existing literature.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it accessible to readers.
- The systematic review methodology is replicable and justified, ensuring quality in the analysis.
- The findings could significantly impact future research in algorithmic recourse and motivate engagement from the NeurIPS community.
- The paper provides a novel perspective on the understanding of algorithmic recourse and highlights significant gaps in the literature.
- It offers a toolkit aimed at facilitating a systems-oriented approach to AR, which can benefit both newcomers and experienced researchers in the field.
- The introductory nature of the draft is valuable for engaging a broader audience, including those unfamiliar with AR.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks sufficient novelty and technical contributions, which may not align with NeurIPS' focus on original research.
- The discussion section primarily reiterates existing calls for systems thinking without clearly linking recommendations to the findings.
- There is a disconnect between the results and the recommendations, and the paper does not adequately define core concepts like recourse.
- The contribution may not be perceived as sufficiently novel by some reviewers, as it does not fully address challenges for research practices.
- The authors acknowledge that raising awareness of AR through a simple poster session may be inadequate for engaging industry and governmental partners.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their main contributions in the introduction and ensure that the recommendations are explicitly tied to the findings presented in the review. Additionally, we suggest that the authors take a stronger stance on defining recourse and its implications for future research. Expanding Section 2.2 to clarify the distinctions between their work and existing literature could enhance the paper's impact. Furthermore, focusing on actionable, domain-specific recommendations based on the analyzed literature could strengthen the overall contribution. We also recommend improving the engagement strategy for algorithmic recourse by considering the organization of tutorials or workshops to attract attention to the shortcomings of AR. Lastly, enhancing the guidance for practitioners on applying systems-oriented analysis in specific domains could facilitate the implementation of recourse solutions. Considering alternative venues for publication that align more closely with the review's nature may also be beneficial.
