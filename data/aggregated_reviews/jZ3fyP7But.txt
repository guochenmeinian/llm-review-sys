### Key Points
This paper presents a study on maximizing total value through bidding on multiple platforms under a budget B and a return-on-spend (ROS) constraint. The authors propose algorithms that exploit the structure of n bidding strategies, reducing the naive search space from n^m to O(mn) and achieving O(m log(mn) logn) queries through binary search and quality checks. The integration of machine learning predictions is shown to enhance performance when predictions are accurate. The paper is relevant and offers solid technical contributions, although it has some clarity issues.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Clear problem formulation and theoretical justification for the proposed algorithms.
- Significant reduction in query complexity and robust theoretical guarantees.
- Practical relevance for advertisers and implications for multi-platform optimization.

Weaknesses:
- Writing lacks clarity in certain sections, such as vague notation and terminology.
- The empirical validation is insufficient, with a need for more complex numerical examples.
- Some assumptions, like the monotonicity and convexity of marginal costs, limit the algorithm's applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of notation in Sec. 1.1 and explicitly define the inequalities related to ROS in Example 1. Additionally, please correct the error in Line 303 regarding the predictions' error eta and ensure that the fourth equality in the proof of Lemma 2 is correctly stated as an inequality. We also suggest enhancing the empirical validation of the algorithms and discussing computational overheads and scalability in more detail. Finally, consider providing insights into the algorithms' performance in real-world scenarios and their handling of extreme prediction errors.
