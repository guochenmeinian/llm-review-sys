### Key Points
This paper presents an adaptive prototypical pseudo-labeling (APP) method for few-shot out-of-domain (OOD) intent detection, focusing on scenarios with limited labeled in-domain (IND) data and a large amount of unlabeled mixed data. The authors propose a prototypical OOD detection framework (ProtoOOD) and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through extensive experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The practical setting of few labeled IND data and abundant unlabeled mixed data is well-addressed.
- The motivation for the proposed framework is clear, and it is described as simple and intuitive.
- Experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method to some extent.
- The paper is well-written, enhancing readability.

Weaknesses:
- The methodology lacks novelty, as similar techniques are prevalent in representation learning.
- Comparisons with the latest models, such as ChatGPT, are insufficient, and some results in the tables are mistakenly bolded.
- The robustness of coefficients in the loss functions is not discussed, which could impact generalization.
- Clarity regarding dataset division is lacking, affecting reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of the methodology by providing clearer distinctions from existing techniques in representation learning. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with the latest models like ChatGPT in the results. The authors should discuss the robustness of coefficients before $L_{ind}$ and $L_{ood}$ in their experiments and clarify the dataset division to enhance reproducibility. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to address the limitations of their OOD detection setting by exploring the generation of new intents in a natural language format. Lastly, we recommend conducting ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of $L_{ins}$ and $L_{proto}$.
