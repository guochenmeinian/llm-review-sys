Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of two-player zero-sum episodic Markov Games under Joint Differential Privacy (JDP) and Local Differential Privacy (LDP). The authors propose the DP-Nash-VI algorithm, which achieves both upper and lower bounds for the problems. Additionally, the work addresses multi-agent self-play reinforcement learning with differential privacy constraints, marking the first exploration of trajectory-wise privacy in this context.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The investigation into two-player zero-sum episodic Markov Games is both interesting and significant for future research on differential privacy in multi-agent reinforcement learning.  
2. The proposed algorithm exhibits a statistically tight regret bound, supported by comprehensive differential privacy analysis for both JDP and LDP.  
3. The authors provide solid proofs of upper and lower bounds, contributing to the theoretical framework of the field.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The paper lacks experimental results to validate the theoretical findings, which is crucial for assessing the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.  
2. The overall technical contribution appears limited; the authors should clarify their primary contributions and consider whether existing algorithms augmented with the Laplacian mechanism could address the problem setting.  
3. The motivation for focusing on two-player zero-sum games is questioned, as the relevance to broader multi-agent scenarios may be underexplored.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including experimental results to validate their theoretical claims. Additionally, we suggest that the authors emphasize their primary technical contributions more clearly and explore the feasibility of using existing algorithms with the Laplacian mechanism. Finally, addressing the motivation for the specific focus on two-player zero-sum games and discussing potential generalizations to multi-agent RL would enhance the paper's relevance.
