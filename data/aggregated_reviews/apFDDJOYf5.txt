Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a generalizable framework for estimating both the NeRF model of the scene and the camera pose from video sequences simultaneously. The authors propose a method that first utilizes a pretrained model to predict optical flow for each video frame, subsequently lifting the optical flow to scene flow for camera pose estimation via SVD. The NeRF model is then fine-tuned for improved results. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in its specific setting and enables direct training on unposed video data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method provides a novel solution for reconstructing 3D neural fields from images without requiring posed videos.
- The quality of the rendered RGB images is commendable after fine-tuning.
- The writing is clear and the methodology is innovative, addressing an important problem in the field.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity in explaining the ablation study, particularly regarding Table 3, which has incomplete captions and undefined abbreviations.
- The motivation for using single-view generalizable NeRF for relative pose estimation is unclear, and the authors should address the scale ambiguity problem in monocular depth estimation.
- There is insufficient quantitative comparison with similar methods like BARF and Nope-NeRF, and the experiments do not adequately cover various scenarios, such as the inside-out case.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the ablation study by providing complete captions and defining all abbreviations in Table 3. Additionally, the authors should clarify the motivation behind the use of single-view generalizable NeRF and address the scale ambiguity issue more thoroughly. We suggest including more quantitative comparisons with methods like BARF and Nope-NeRF, as well as expanding the experimental results to include a wider variety of scenarios. Furthermore, the authors should provide additional details regarding the training process and consider incorporating more baseline methods for a comprehensive evaluation.
