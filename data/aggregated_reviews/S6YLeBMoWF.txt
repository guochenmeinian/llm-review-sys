Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ATAC-diff, a novel diffusion model for generating and analyzing scATAC-seq data. The authors propose a latent diffusion model conditioned on auxiliary models to encode latent variables, integrating a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as the latent prior to capture genetic information. A mutual information regularization is introduced to maintain the connection between observed and latent variables. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ATAC-diff outperforms state-of-the-art models in various tasks, including clustering, generation, denoising, and imputation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a uniform model applicable to multiple scATAC-seq analysis tasks.
- The methodology is clearly articulated, particularly regarding the auxiliary module, GMM integration, and mutual information regularization.
- The theoretical analysis is comprehensive, enhancing understanding of the method.
- The experiments cover a wide range of scATAC-seq analyses, yielding comprehensive results that highlight the model's advantages.

Weaknesses:
- Baseline performance discrepancies on benchmark datasets raise concerns about the reliability of results, as some reported performances do not align with previous publications.
- The inclusion of additional benchmark datasets, such as Buenrostro2018, is necessary for cross-validation.
- Key top baselines, including scBasset, are missing from the experiments, limiting comparative analysis.
- The presentation of ATAC-seq data lacks clarity, particularly regarding the processed nature of the cell x peak representation.
- Evaluation metrics for clustering and generation tasks are unclear, with questions surrounding ground truth determination and the reliability of UMAP visualizations.
- Proposed components, such as GMM and the mutual information regularizer, lack validation through ablation studies.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation regarding the processed nature of the ATAC-seq data. Additionally, please address the discrepancies in baseline performance and provide explanations for the observed differences. It is crucial to include more benchmark datasets for better cross-validation of model performance, such as Buenrostro2018, and to add comparisons with top baselines like scBasset. Furthermore, we suggest conducting ablation studies to evaluate the necessity of the GMM and mutual information regularizer components. Lastly, clarifying the evaluation metrics and ground truth determination for clustering and generation tasks will enhance the robustness of the findings.
