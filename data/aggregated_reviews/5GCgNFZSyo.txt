Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for local Bayesian Optimization (BO) that replaces the traditional gradient descent step with the minimization of an upper confidence bound (UCB) of the Gaussian Process (GP) estimate. The authors establish a connection between their method and gradient descent, demonstrating that their approach can achieve competitive convergence rates. They also introduce a "lookahead" variant of the algorithm and provide empirical evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and reinforcement learning tasks, showing improvements over existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, clearly presenting the connection between UCB minimization and gradient descent.
- The proposed algorithm shows promising empirical results, indicating non-negligible performance improvements on selected tasks.
- The theoretical analysis is robust, contributing significantly to the understanding of local Bayesian optimization.

Weaknesses:
- Theorem 1 lacks a proof sketch, making it difficult to understand the derivation of results.
- The paper does not empirically compare the proposed method with popular baselines such as TuRBO and ARS.
- The related work section cites outdated references, missing recent advancements in additive models for high-dimensional Bayesian optimization.
- The definition of "local" in the context of the algorithm is not formally established, leading to potential confusion regarding the locality of updates.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Theorem 1 by including a proof sketch to elucidate the derivation of results. Additionally, we suggest conducting empirical comparisons with TuRBO and ARS to strengthen the paper's claims about performance improvements. Updating the related work section with more recent literature on additive models would enhance its relevance. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide a formal definition of "local" and consider conducting an ablation study to assess the impact of local versus global exploration strategies. Lastly, a more thorough discussion of the limitations of the proposed method and its empirical evaluation would provide a clearer understanding of its applicability.
