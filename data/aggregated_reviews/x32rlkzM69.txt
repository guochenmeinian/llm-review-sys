### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of typological databases, specifically WALS and Grambank, highlighting their limitations in coverage and flexibility for representing linguistic properties. The authors argue that inconsistencies arise from the categorical nature of these databases and advocate for a continuous view of typological features. They provide empirical evidence of errors categorized into factual inaccuracies, linguistic variations, and data discretization. Additionally, the authors explore the use of Wikipedia for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to predict typological features, although results indicate limited success.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a relevant topic regarding the impact of typological databases on NLP and LLMs.
- It articulates the inconsistencies and errors in typological databases effectively, supported by empirical evidence.
- The structure and clarity of the writing are commendable.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks originality, as the discussed issues have been previously explored in existing literature.
- Proposed metrics for matches and mismatches are trivial and tested on a limited dataset.
- The experimental section is vague, lacking in-depth discussion of results and potential implications for NLP tasks.
- Limited exploration of solutions to the identified issues and a narrow scope in terms of languages studied diminish the paper's contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the originality of their work by providing novel insights or innovative approaches to the limitations discussed. Expanding the experimental section with a more detailed comparative analysis of discrepancies between databases would enhance the paper's depth. Additionally, we suggest exploring alternative language models, such as generative models with prompt engineering, to strengthen the experimental findings. A broader analysis of linguistic variations across more languages and contexts would also provide a more nuanced understanding. Finally, addressing the identified limitations and proposing concrete strategies to mitigate inconsistencies in typological databases would significantly improve the paper's impact.
