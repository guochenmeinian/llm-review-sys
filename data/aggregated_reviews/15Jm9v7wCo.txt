Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on maximizing Nash Social Welfare (NSW) in a centralized multi-agent multi-armed bandit setting. The authors propose an algorithm that achieves $\tilde{O}(T^{\frac{N-1}{N}})$ regret for stochastic scenarios and demonstrate that no algorithm can achieve sublinear regret in adversarial settings. They also explore full-information feedback, achieving $\sqrt{T}$ regret, and discuss scenarios where logarithmic regret is possible. The paper contrasts the NSW with previous measures, noting its lack of Lipschitz continuity, which complicates the application of established analytical techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The model is clearly articulated, and the algorithms are easy to understand. The authors effectively consider various information structures and models, providing a comprehensive depiction of the problem. The construction of lower bounds is particularly well-executed.

Weaknesses:  
1. The paper argues for the superiority of $NSW$ over $NSW_{prod}$ but does not address the potential of using a simple average, which may be more intuitive. The authors should provide realistic applications for NSW.
2. The use of $NSW(u^Tp_t)$ instead of $\sum_i p_{t,i}NSW(u_{t,i})$ raises questions about the definition of regret, which appears strange.
3. A statement in Line 165 is incorrect; observing $u^T_t p_t$ is unnecessary when using BCO. The authors should clarify the construction of lower bounds, as the negative result in Thm 3.2 may not hold under certain conditions.
4. The authors mention that NSW is not Lipschitz but do not explore the implications of truncation for small utilities. They should clarify the differences between their methods and consider experimental comparisons.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for using NSW by discussing its significance and relevance in the context of bandit literature. Additionally, the authors should provide concrete examples of applications for their model to enhance its appeal. Clarifying the definition of regret and addressing the concerns regarding the use of averages would strengthen the paper. Finally, we suggest that the authors explore the implications of truncation for small utilities and consider conducting experiments to compare their methods with Lipschitz approaches.
