### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative diffusion model that leverages quantum computing techniques for quark and gluon jet generation in high-energy physics. The authors propose using quantum circuits, specifically integrating quantum random unitary matrices in the forward process and a variational quantum circuit within a U-Net architecture. This approach aims to address computational and resource challenges in generative modeling, although the performance on real quantum hardware remains uncertain.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of quantum circuits within diffusion models is an exciting approach for complex tasks like quark and gluon jet generation, potentially reducing computational resource demands compared to classical methods.
- The methodology is clearly articulated, detailing the quantum embedding and denoising process alongside the underlying physics.
- Simulations indicate promising results, with performance metrics showing that quantum models slightly outperform classical counterparts in terms of FID scores.

Weaknesses:
- The authors utilize quantum simulators like Pennylane but do not test the model on actual quantum hardware, leaving the real-world performance and scalability under practical quantum constraints unclear.
- The dataset is reduced in dimensions (from 125x125 to 16x16 pixels), raising questions about how the model would scale to larger datasets or more complex structures.
- There may be overhead in managing quantum circuits and gates that could offset some computational gains unless quantum hardware improves significantly.
- The quality of figures could be significantly improved, and the FID scores from all three methods would be easier to compare; additionally, a reference to a figure is missing on page 4.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their numerical results by providing details on the number of qubits used and the final resource costs of the network. Additionally, we suggest that the authors test their model on actual quantum hardware to assess real-world performance and scalability. Further exploration of how the model scales to larger datasets or more complex structures is also advised. Finally, we encourage the authors to enhance the quality of their figures and ensure all references to figures are correctly cited.
