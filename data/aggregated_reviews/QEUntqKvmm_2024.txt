### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the estimation of rare event statistics in discrete-time, discrete-state Markov chains, demonstrating that under certain locality assumptions, temporal difference (TD) estimators are exponentially more efficient than Monte Carlo (MC) estimators. Specifically, the variance of the TD estimator scales as \(n^3\) in relation to the number of states \(n\), while the variance for MC estimators scales as \(e^n\). The authors analyze the efficiency comparison between TD and MC methods in policy evaluation, particularly regarding rare events, and provide a rigorous sample complexity comparison, showing that LSTD can yield accurate estimations with smaller datasets compared to MC sampling.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-structured and presents a sharp setting that effectively captures the studied phenomenon.  
- It provides a key original insight linking the locality of transitions to the efficiency of TD estimators.  
- The related work is thoroughly covered, distilling essential insights into a coherent set of assumptions and consequences.  
- The presentation is generally clear, with good illustrations of key ideas through examples and figures.  

Weaknesses:  
- The results appear more suited to a probability or statistics journal than a machine learning conference, as the problem of rare event estimation is fundamentally statistical.  
- There are no numerical experiments presented to validate the claims regarding the efficiency of TD versus MC methods in the context of rare events.  
- The writing could benefit from more polish and formalization, particularly in Section 1.2.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the practical applicability of their findings by including numerical experiments to illustrate the efficiency of TD estimators in rare event scenarios. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the meaning of "appropriate choice of reward function" and elaborate on the bias-variance tradeoff in TD versus MC methods. It would also be beneficial to formalize discussions in Section 1.2 and ensure that all terms, such as \(S\) in footnote 1, are defined before use. Finally, addressing the limitations in a dedicated section would enhance the clarity of the paper.
