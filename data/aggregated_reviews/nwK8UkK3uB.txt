Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to enhancing the performance of sparse approximate Gaussian processes by decoupling the mean and covariance parameters, allowing for different kernel hyperparameters. The authors derive a variational approximation that facilitates training and demonstrate improved predictions on various UCI datasets and Bayesian optimization tasks. The proposed method includes an ablation study for the introduced regularization term, \(\beta\), which controls the test conditional component in the objective.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is technically sound and well-structured, with comprehensive evaluations across modeling and decision-making tasks.
- Experimental results indicate promising performance improvements over existing methods, supported by rigorous ablation studies.

Weaknesses:
- Originality is limited, primarily revolving around the proposal of Eq. 3.
- Clarity issues arise from insufficient explanations of key concepts, such as the selection of inducing points and the definition of SVGP in the introduction.
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion of results, particularly in error analysis, and the presentation of RMSE tables is excessive and not very informative.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing definitions for key terms, such as SVGP, and by elaborating on the selection or generation of inducing points. It would be beneficial to include a more intuitive introduction of \(p(f^*|f_m)\) and to clarify the determination of the regularization parameter. Additionally, we suggest condensing the RMSE tables and moving supplementary results to the appendix to allow for a more detailed discussion of the experiments. Finally, incorporating a metric to measure the tradeoff between accuracy and uncertainty would enhance the analysis of the proposed method's performance.
