Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new estimator, the Conditional Quantile Comparator (CQC), aimed at obtaining conditional quantiles of treatment effects, which is argued to be superior to the existing Conditional Quantile Treatment Effect (CQTE) estimator. The authors propose a doubly robust estimation procedure that reframes the estimation as a CATE problem, addressing the limitations of CQTE that relies on strict smoothness assumptions. The paper includes theoretical analyses and empirical simulations to support the robustness of the CQC estimator.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a doubly robust property to conditional quantile treatment effect estimation enhances the reliability of the results.
- The theoretical framework is well-developed, providing finite sample properties that are theoretically convincing.
- The paper is clearly written, with useful numerical experiments and real-world applications that demonstrate the methodology's viability.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for the CQC estimator lacks depth, as existing estimators with double robustness have been proposed, and the authors do not sufficiently contextualize their work within the existing literature.
- The interpretation of the new estimand in relation to traditional CQTE is unclear, which may hinder practitioner adoption.
- The complexity of the algorithms, particularly the data duplication in reindexing, could be simplified for better clarity.
- The method's assumptions regarding the smoothness of the marginal quantiles and their implications are not thoroughly explored, particularly in higher-dimensional settings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the contextualization of their work by comparing the CQC estimator with existing methods, particularly those that also exhibit double robustness. Additionally, the authors should clarify the interpretation of the new estimand in relation to traditional CQTE, especially in the context of real-world data applications. Simplifying the notation in the algorithms would enhance understanding. Furthermore, expanding on the implications of smoothness assumptions and providing examples of poorly behaved marginals where CQC performs well would strengthen the paper. Lastly, including CQTE estimates in the empirical evaluations would allow for a direct comparison between methodologies.
