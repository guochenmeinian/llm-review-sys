Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Structure-aware Embedding Evolution (SEvo), a novel embedding update mechanism for recommender systems that integrates graph structural information directly into embeddings. The authors propose guiding embedding update momentum with graph smoothing regularization, enhancing existing optimizers like AdamW. The theoretical convergence of SEvo is demonstrated, and experiments show significant performance improvements across various recommendation models and datasets, outperforming traditional GNNs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper innovatively utilizes graph information at the algorithm level for recommender systems, ensuring convergence.
2. SEvo's plug-n-play design allows easy integration with various recommendation architectures and popular optimizers.
3. Extensive experiments across different datasets and recommendation backbones demonstrate the method's effectiveness and efficiency.

Weaknesses:
1. The technique in Section 2.4 is overly specific to AdamW.
2. The clarity of the paper is lacking; a summary of the SEvo pipeline would enhance understanding.
3. The reported results raise concerns about their validity, particularly the substantial performance improvements observed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by including a simple summary of the SEvo pipeline in the form of a scheme or algorithm. Additionally, the authors should provide detailed computational and space complexity analyses to better understand the scalability of SEvo. Clarifying the relationship between SEvo and the recommendation task, as well as addressing the reasons behind the significant performance gains, would strengthen the paper. Finally, exploring the incorporation of high-order proximity and long-range dependencies in SEvo could enhance its applicability.
