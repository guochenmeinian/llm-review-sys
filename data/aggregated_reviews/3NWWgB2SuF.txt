Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new Probabilistic Tensor Decomposition (TD) method called EnergyTD, which employs an Energy Based Model (EBM) to model the joint probability of data and latent tensor factors. The authors avoid restrictive structural and distributional assumptions, training the model using an upper bound of the Conditional Noise-Contrastive Estimation Loss. The method is evaluated on simulations with non-Gaussian generative models and real-world tensor completion tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The ability to bypass structural and distributional dependencies is noteworthy, with potential applications beyond tensor completion.  
- The simulated datasets effectively illustrate the method's capabilities.  
- Results from real-world tensor completion tasks are convincing.  
- The paper is well-organized and presents a clear motivation for the proposed method.

Weaknesses:  
- The code is not provided, limiting reproducibility.  
- The introduction lacks motivation for using probabilistic methods over traditional ones.  
- The Energy Based Model section is poorly articulated, particularly regarding the selection of conditional $p_c(y|x)$ for efficiency.  
- The method's evaluation is limited to tensor completion tasks, raising questions about the explanatory value and robustness of the inferred factors.  
- There is no discussion on the computational time of the proposed method.  
- Minor inconsistencies exist in experimental details across the main paper and supplementary materials.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the Energy Based Model section, particularly in explaining how to choose the conditional $p_c(y|x)$ for efficiency. Additionally, the authors should provide the code to enhance reproducibility and motivate the use of probabilistic methods in the introduction. It would be beneficial to evaluate the method's robustness and explanatory value of the inferred factors beyond tensor completion tasks. A discussion on the computational time and scalability of the proposed method is also essential. Finally, ensure consistency in experimental details across all sections of the paper.
