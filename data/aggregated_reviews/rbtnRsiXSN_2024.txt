Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DeMo, a novel framework for motion forecasting in autonomous driving that decouples the task into mode queries for capturing directional intentions and state queries for modeling dynamic states. The authors propose a hybrid design utilizing Attention and Mamba techniques, achieving strong performance on the Argoverse 2 and NuScenes benchmarks. The manuscript includes extensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating the contributions of the proposed architecture.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. A novel decoupled query design for intentions and future states.
2. Simple model design with good performance.
3. Extensive experiments and convincing results on significant benchmarks.
4. Solid performance on prediction benchmarks.

Weaknesses:
1. Overclaim of state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance; for instance, the LOF method outperforms DeMo on AV2.
2. Heavy computational load for long-horizon state queries.
3. Lack of clarity in technical descriptions, particularly regarding the loss function and model design.
4. Missing comparisons with superior models on existing leaderboards, questioning the novelty of the contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of technical descriptions, particularly regarding the loss function and the features considered in different motion models. Additionally, we suggest including a thorough comparison with models like SEPT and QCNet that have demonstrated superior performance. Addressing the computational cost, such as FLOPs and training time of DeMo compared to other methods, would also enhance the manuscript. Finally, providing a precise formulation of the auxiliary losses and reporting training time would improve reproducibility.
