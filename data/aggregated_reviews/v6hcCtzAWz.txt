### Key Points
This paper presents a simple PCFG formulation that generates each child independently, enhancing scalability with a large number of nonterminals. The authors propose a hardware-efficient implementation optimized for GPUs, utilizing techniques such as span-level parallelism and the log-einsum-exp trick. Experimental results across multiple treebanks indicate significant improvements in parsing and language modeling capabilities compared to low-rank PCFGs and other unsupervised parsing algorithms. However, the experiments are limited in scale and lack comparisons to state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Clear and robust formulation with detailed descriptions of GPU efficiency techniques.
- Well-rounded experiments demonstrating significant improvements over previous approaches.

Weaknesses:
- Contributions may be perceived as trivial, as the core technique has been previously proposed.
- Experimental results are small scale and lack comparisons with more recent and stronger baselines.
- No analysis on how the simple PCFG formulation affects memory and speed compared to the rank PCFG formulation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the scale of their experiments and include comparisons to state-of-the-art methods to provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Additionally, we suggest incorporating an analysis of memory and speed implications when comparing the simple PCFG formulation to the rank PCFG formulation.
