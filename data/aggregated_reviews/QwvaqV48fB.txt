Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the positive and unlabeled (PU) learning problem, highlighting that predictive trends differ for positive and negative classes in binary classification tasks. The authors propose a holistic approach utilizing trend scores to capture these predictive trends, supported by extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets that validate the effectiveness of their method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The phenomenon of differing predictive trends in PU learning is intriguing and well-explored.
- The proposed method is novel, clearly articulated, and effectively addresses the PU learning problem from a trend detection perspective.
- The empirical evaluation is comprehensive, including comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and sensitivity analyses.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments lack a presentation of comparing algorithms.
- The meaning of "No trend" in Figure 3 is unclear, particularly regarding whether the trend score is constant.
- The transformation of the unlabeled data classification problem into threshold selection via trend scores requires that these scores show a clear distinction between classes, which is not entirely consistent in the CIFAR10 results as indicated by the Fisher Criterion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental comparisons by including details on the algorithms used for comparison. Additionally, the authors should clarify the meaning of "No trend" in Figure 3 and address the consistency of trend scores with the Fisher Criterion, particularly in relation to the CIFAR10 dataset. Further, we suggest that the authors elaborate on the applicability of their approach to other machine learning topics and provide a discussion on the performance variations observed with different positive priors.
