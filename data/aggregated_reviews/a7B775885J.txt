### Key Points
This paper presents Adaptive Topology-aware Propagation (ATP), a node-wise aggregation strategy designed for large-scale graphs that enhances node classification tasks by considering local topology. ATP is a GNN-agnostic plugin that integrates seamlessly into existing methods, improving their performance. The authors investigate the role of node degrees in feature propagation and propose High-bias Propagation Correction (HPC) and Local Node Context (LNC) encoding to address scalability and efficiency issues.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses significant challenges in scalable GNNs, providing a strong theoretical foundation and comprehensive experiments across various datasets.
2. The plug-and-play nature of ATP enhances its applicability to existing scalable GNN frameworks.
3. Empirical results demonstrate that ATP consistently outperforms traditional models and other optimization strategies.

Weaknesses:
1. The analysis of previous node-wise propagation strategies is insufficient, lacking detailed explanations for their limitations in large-scale graphs.
2. Clarity issues arise in the presentation, making it difficult for readers to grasp the main ideas.
3. The reliance on full-rank eigendecomposition may hinder scalability, especially for large and dense graphs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper to ensure that the main ideas are presented more effectively. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed comparison of ATP with existing node-wise propagation optimization strategies, particularly regarding theoretical computational efficiency and scalability. The authors should also address the potential for overfitting due to the focus on local node contexts and explore alternative designs that avoid reliance on full-rank eigendecomposition. Lastly, clarifying the criteria for separating low- and high-degree nodes in HPC would enhance the understanding of the method's applicability across different graph topologies.
