Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark, DTGB, for dynamic text-attributed graphs (DyTAGs), addressing the lack of benchmark datasets in this field. The authors collect eight datasets and design four tasks to evaluate dynamic graph learning algorithms and large language models (LLMs). Extensive experiments demonstrate the utility of DTGB, providing insights into the limitations of existing models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces the first benchmark for dynamic text-attributed graphs, establishing a new standard for evaluation.
2. It includes a variety of large-scale, domain-diverse datasets with rich text attributes.
3. A standardized evaluation framework is established with four distinct tasks: future link prediction, destination node retrieval, edge classification, and textual relation generation.
4. The paper is clearly written and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
1. The experimental results indicate low accuracy for baselines on GDELT and ICEWS1819, raising questions about the inherent difficulty of distinguishing edges in these datasets.
2. The paper lacks newly proposed algorithms that integrate GNNs with LLMs, which may limit the benchmark's applicability.
3. There is no evidence demonstrating the effect of long-range historical information and dynamic structure on performance.
4. The order of downstream tasks in the experimental section should align with that in Section 4.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the basic paradigm of the DyTAGâ€™s pre-trained model by explaining it in advance to aid reader comprehension. Additionally, we suggest incorporating results regarding few-shot learning to better assess the capabilities of LLM- and graph-based models. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to demonstrate the effect of long-range historical information and dynamic structure on the proposed datasets, as well as to consider integrating existing works that combine LLMs and GNNs into DTGB. Lastly, please ensure that the order of tasks in the experimental section is consistent with Section 4.
