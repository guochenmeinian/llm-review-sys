### Key Points
This paper presents the M4 benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation tool for language models in the medical domain, covering various tasks such as sentence-level and document-level classification, summarization, and more. The authors propose a dataset enriched with expert annotations, addressing the challenge of limited expert-annotated healthcare datasets. The study rigorously evaluates ten language models, revealing insights into their strengths and limitations in medical applications. The authors commit to releasing the data and evaluation codes to facilitate further research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Broad task coverage ensures relevance across multiple medical fields.
- Expert annotations enhance dataset credibility and utility.
- Comprehensive evaluation of ten language models provides valuable insights.
- Real-world relevance of findings benefits clinical applications.
- Commitment to reproducibility encourages further research.

Weaknesses:
- Lack of detailed evaluation of the ten language models in the abstract, particularly regarding performance across different tasks and domains.
- Potential biases in data selection and expert annotation are not explicitly addressed.
- The dataset may still be limited in scope given the vastness of the medical field.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the evaluation details for the ten language models, particularly regarding their performance across various tasks and domains. Additionally, addressing potential biases in the dataset and expert annotations would strengthen the paper. We suggest including more recent language models in the evaluation to enhance relevance. Furthermore, a more detailed explanation of the dataset creation process, including the selection criteria for the 35 body regions and 8 examination modalities, would provide greater transparency.
