### Key Points
This paper presents the Intelligent Edge-Cloud Parameter Request Model (IntellectReq), which aims to enhance edge-specific context-aware adaptivity in sequential recommendation systems. IntellectReq evaluates the cost-benefit landscape of parameter requests while minimizing computation and communication overhead. The authors propose a Mis-Recommendation Detector (MRD) and a Distribution Mapper (DM) to optimize parameter updates and manage uncertainty in recommendations. The empirical results indicate that the proposed methods achieve comparable recommendation accuracy with significantly reduced communication costs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The research addresses a significant problem in edge-cloud collaboration for recommendations.
2. The proposed model is innovative and demonstrates empirical validation of its effectiveness.
3. The systematic presentation of the approach, including adequate formulations, enhances understanding.

Weaknesses:
1. Some technical sections lack depth and clarity, particularly regarding problem formulation and model architecture.
2. The paper does not adequately define key concepts, such as the meaning of "edge" in the recommendation context.
3. The implementation details and hyperparameters necessary for reproducibility are missing.
4. The novelty of the proposed method is somewhat diminished by reliance on existing techniques without substantial innovation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of technical sections, particularly in the problem formulation and model architecture. Additionally, a comprehensive definition of "edge" in the context of dynamic recommendations should be included. The authors should also provide implementation details and hyperparameters to enhance reproducibility. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors discuss the broader implications of their work, including potential limitations and comparisons with existing models like DIN, SASRec, and GRU4Rec. Lastly, incorporating evidence from practical applications could strengthen the motivation for the proposed approach.
