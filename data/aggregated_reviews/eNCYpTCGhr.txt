Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on fully first-order methods for bilevel optimization involving strongly convex lower-level objectives and linear constraints. The authors propose algorithms that utilize penalty methods to construct hypergradient estimators for linear inequality constraints and demonstrate approximation errors. They also combine these methods with gradient techniques for nonsmooth nonconvex optimization to achieve Goldstein stationarity points. The paper addresses both linear inequality and equality constraints, providing complexity bounds that, while not optimal, suggest promising directions for further exploration.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The consideration of both linear inequality and equality constraints is commendable.
2. The hypergradient construction for linear inequality constraints is interesting and offers approximation guarantees, which could benefit future research.
3. The use of zeroth-order oracles in Algorithm 5 is innovative, particularly for problems with small upper-level dimensions.
4. The finite-difference gradient proxy for linear equality constraints is also noteworthy.

Weaknesses:
1. The approach to solving linear inequality constraints with simple gradient methods remains unclear, as the current algorithm is complex and challenging to tune.
2. The optimality of complexity bounds for both constraint types is uncertain, with the paper lacking comparisons to unconstrained lower-level bilevel optimization.
3. The methods presented do not align well with each other, leading to a lack of coherent narrative in algorithmic design.
4. The experiments are limited, with only a single example problem and insufficient comparisons to existing bilevel algorithms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the complexity definitions and ensure consistency in how oracle calls are presented. It would be beneficial to include more comprehensive experiments, comparing the proposed methods against established bilevel algorithms. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the rationale behind using zeroth-order methods in the linear equality constrained setting and explore the potential for deriving fully first-order gradient estimators. Lastly, enhancing the narrative coherence among the proposed methods would strengthen the overall presentation of the paper.
