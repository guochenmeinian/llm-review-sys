### Key Points
This paper presents a new multimodal benchmark called NormLens for moral detection and judgment, focusing on visually grounded commonsense reasoning. It details a dataset construction pipeline that includes generating moral text from image descriptions and manual annotation. The authors propose two tasks, demonstrating that these tasks remain challenging for current large language models (LLMs). The paper also discusses various architectures for decision-making and explanation generation, aiming to align model outputs with human judgments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset construction method is reasonable and well-validated.
- The paper provides rich experimental results and a detailed analysis of LLM performance.
- NormLens serves as a valuable testbed for commonsense reasoning, addressing a gap in prior research on social norms.

Weaknesses:
- There is a lack of comparison with traditional machine learning methods like BERT or T5, leaving questions about their performance on this issue.
- The discussion of results is insufficient, particularly regarding the performance of the Socratic model with GPT-4, which may be influenced by GPT-4's inherent capabilities.
- The coverage of situation types generated by ChatGPT may be limited, and the clarity of social norms in the dataset is not well-defined.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the results, particularly clarifying the performance of the Socratic model with GPT-4. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with traditional ML methods such as BERT or T5 to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the dataset's performance. It would also be beneficial to clarify the types of situations and social norms included in the dataset. Finally, consider analyzing image diversity and the potential for fine-tuning VLMs like BLIP2 on NormLens to enhance explanation generation.
