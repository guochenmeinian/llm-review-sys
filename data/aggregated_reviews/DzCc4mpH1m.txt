### Key Points
This paper presents a new iterative algorithm for minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding, utilizing bootstrapping to estimate the probability of a hypothesis being the final winner. The authors propose an iterative pruning algorithm that reduces the number of hypotheses considered while gradually increasing the candidate samples for utility estimation in neural machine translation. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly decreases utility calls without compromising translation accuracy, achieving similar results to standard MBR with reduced computational costs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The work addresses a crucial efficiency problem in MBR decoding, providing an elegant and statistically grounded formulation.  
- The experiments are thorough, yielding convincing results that support the authors' claims.  
- The writing is clear and well-structured, making the logic easy to follow.  

Weaknesses:  
- There is a lack of wall-clock time comparison, which could enhance understanding of computational efficiency.  
- Some descriptions of methods and baseline approaches are too brief, potentially hindering comprehension.  
- The parameter settings are underspecified, making reproducibility challenging.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by rearranging Equations (3) and (4) for better notation consistency. Additionally, including a pseudo-code in the appendix would enhance the readability of the methods. To address reproducibility, we suggest specifying how hyper-parameters are chosen and considering the inclusion of actual run times in the results. Furthermore, adding legends to Figure 2 and vertical bars in Table 1 would improve the presentation. Lastly, we encourage the authors to release the code to facilitate reproducibility.
