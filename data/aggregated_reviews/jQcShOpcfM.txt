### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to enhancing prosody diversity in text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis by utilizing Determinantal Point Processes (DPP) through a Prosody Diversifying Module (PDM). The authors aim to improve both the diversity within individual samples and among multiple samples while maintaining naturalness. They propose modifications to the prosody predictor, prosodic boundary detector, and MIC objective function, supported by subjective experiments that demonstrate the limitations of previous models. The paper includes a comprehensive analysis of challenges in prosodic modeling and evaluates the proposed method against strong baseline models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The use of conditional DPP for prosody modeling is innovative and addresses significant issues in the field.
- The model is well-structured, with effective components such as the PDM and prosodic boundary detection.
- The authors provide a thorough evaluation through subjective experiments and ablation studies, which validate the effectiveness of their approach.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks completeness, with missing appendices and insufficient experimental details.
- The writing quality requires improvement, particularly in sections that overlap, such as the introduction and related work.
- The experimental results, particularly the Mean Opinion Scores (MOS), raise questions about the model's performance and persuasiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and completeness of the paper by including appendices and a demonstration webpage for subjective listening. Additionally, enhancing the writing quality, especially in overlapping sections, would benefit the overall presentation. We suggest conducting further quantitative experiments comparing against additional baselines, such as VCTK or LibriTTS datasets, to strengthen the experimental foundation. Finally, addressing the low MOS values and providing a more comprehensive analysis of the results would enhance the paper's persuasiveness.
