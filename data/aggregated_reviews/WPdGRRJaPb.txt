Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Full-Atom Iterative Refinement framework (FAIR) for protein pocket sequence and 3D structure co-design, addressing critical aspects such as side-chain atom influence, ligand flexibility, and sequence-structure consistency. The authors propose a two-step refinement process and demonstrate FAIR's effectiveness through extensive experiments on two datasets, showing significant improvements over five baseline methods in generating high-quality protein pockets. The FAIR method utilizes metrics such as Amino Acid Recovery (AAR), Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), and Vina score to evaluate designed pockets. However, the authors acknowledge that while these metrics are commonly used, their relevance to pocket redesign is questionable, as FAIR does not consistently improve Vina scores over original protein-ligand complexes, particularly on the Binding MOAD dataset. The authors plan to explore additional evaluation metrics and optimization methods in future work.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and clearly discusses existing related works.
2. Figures 1 and 2 effectively illustrate the protein pocket design problem and the FAIR method.
3. This is the first study to apply deep learning methods to protein pocket sequence-structure co-design, with a well-formulated problem statement.
4. The coarse-to-fine architecture and iterative refinement schemes are reasonable and effective, considering critical factors like side-chain modeling and ligand flexibility.
5. FAIR demonstrates a strong capability for pocket sequence-structure co-design and is less sensitive to re-docking compared to other methods.
6. Extensive experiments validate FAIR's effectiveness, with code provided for reproducibility.
7. The authors provide detailed responses to reviewer concerns, indicating a willingness to engage with feedback and improve their work.

Weaknesses:
1. The experiments redesign residues within 3.5 Ã… of binding ligands; it is unclear if FAIR can design larger protein pocket regions.
2. The influence of initialization strategies on FAIR has not been explored.
3. The paper lacks a speed evaluation of the FAIR method, raising questions about its high-throughput applicability.
4. The evaluation metrics used may not adequately reflect the biological significance of the redesign, raising concerns about their sufficiency for advancing the field.
5. FAIR does not consistently outperform the original protein-ligand complexes in terms of Vina scores, particularly in real datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental design to explore whether FAIR can redesign larger regions of the protein pocket. Additionally, the authors should investigate the impact of different initialization strategies on the performance of FAIR. To enhance the paper, please include a discussion on the speed of the FAIR method and its potential for high-throughput applications. Clarifying the use of hyperparameter weights for loss functions in Equations 9 and 10 would also strengthen the analysis. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors improve the discussion on the biological relevance of the evaluation metrics used, particularly in relation to pocket redesign. Including violin/box plots of Vina scores with and without re-docking to illustrate score distributions would be beneficial. Finally, we recommend that the authors provide baseline results for the optimization experiments to allow for a more comprehensive comparison.
