Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a benchmark for regressing a child poverty index from satellite images, introducing a dataset of over 33,000 images from 19 countries. The authors evaluate various models, including foundation models, to demonstrate the task's complexity and importance. The dataset aligns with UNICEFâ€™s multidimensional child poverty definition and spans a significant temporal range.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The task is impactful and relatively novel within the machine learning community.
- The dataset is substantial and diverse, providing a meaningful contribution to the field.
- The paper is well-written and clearly presents the task and data.

Weaknesses:
1. Design choices in baseline experiments are questionable, such as using only RGB bands from high-resolution, multispectral, and multi-temporal images, which undermines the analysis.
2. Some claims lack experimental validation and specificity, such as the importance of fine-tuning transformer models.
3. The absence of figures and graphs limits the paper's clarity, particularly in conveying spatial data distribution and results.
4. The potential spatial correlation of the target variable is not adequately addressed, raising concerns about the robustness of the model evaluations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental design by utilizing all available spectral bands and temporal data to fully leverage the capabilities of the models. Additionally, we suggest validating claims with alternative methods, such as comparing fine-tuning with LoRA or using different model architectures like ResNet50. 

To enhance clarity, we encourage the inclusion of visualizations, such as maps showing data distribution and examples of images from different satellite sources. Furthermore, addressing spatial autocorrelation in the train/test split and conducting experiments to measure the correlation between location and target variables would strengthen the analysis. Lastly, we advise providing a more detailed discussion of the dataset's attributes in the main paper to emphasize its contribution over prior work.
