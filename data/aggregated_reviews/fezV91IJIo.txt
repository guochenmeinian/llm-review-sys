Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents NetANOVA, an algorithm designed for constructing a unified structural model for multiple causal networks, specifically directed cyclic graphs (DCGs). The authors propose an analysis of variance (ANOVA) algorithm to identify causalities across networks and utilize singular value decomposition (SVD) for correspondence analysis to pinpoint key drivers and responders. Theoretical properties of the algorithm are established, and its effectiveness is illustrated through simulations and real data examples.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a significant and novel problem in investigating causality across multiple networks, which has not been extensively studied in the literature.  
- It is presented clearly, with a straightforward framework, theoretical guarantees, and computational scalability.  
- The derivation of the method is clear, and the theoretical justification consolidates the authors' contributions.

Weaknesses:  
- The SVD-based technique for correspondence analysis lacks clarity; further elaboration and intuition are needed.  
- The paper does not compare the proposed method with related works, limiting the assessment of its advantages.  
- The literature review is insufficient, merely listing related works without critical analysis or context.  
- The experimental results are limited, and the theoretical results do not address the computational complexity of NetANOVA.  
- There is no discussion of the method's limitations or potential negative societal impacts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the SVD-based technique for correspondence analysis by providing more intuition and details on the bootstrap method used. Additionally, we suggest including a formal definition of the problem being solved and a discussion of how the proposed method compares with existing approaches. It would be beneficial to normalize the coefficient of cause for better interpretation and to clarify the choice of error variance in Section 5, including the corresponding signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, we advise the authors to address the limitations of their method explicitly in the paper and enhance the literature review to provide a more critical analysis of related works.
