### Key Points
This paper presents a rehearsal-based method for graph continual learning (GCL) that emphasizes both class representativeness and diversity in replayed nodes. The authors introduce a novel approach, DSLR, which incorporates a replay buffer and graph structure learning to enhance the connectivity of replayed nodes to informative neighbors. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating improvements over existing GCL techniques, particularly with smaller replay buffer sizes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, clearly articulating the motivation, methodology, and experimental results.
- The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, effectively verifying the proposed method's hypotheses and effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset and experimental settings differ significantly from the baseline ER-GNN, leading to concerns about validation.
- The abstract lacks clarity for a general audience, and the overall performance gains are limited, primarily reducing variance rather than providing substantial improvements.
- The number of references is relatively low and outdated, with most prior to 2022.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the abstract to make it more accessible to a general audience. Additionally, please analyze and explain the limited improvement of PM for DSLR as the buffer size increases. It is crucial to clarify the Forgetting Mean definition in Table 2, as it should typically yield negative values. We suggest providing more details on the construction of D_link in Equation (6) and discussing the efficiency of the proposed method compared to others. Furthermore, please provide experimental evidence supporting the claim regarding the impact of the hyperparameter \(\beta\) in Equation (12) and consider investigating performance when cross-entropy is computed on both \(D_i^{tr}\) and \(B\) without introducing \(\beta\). Lastly, we recommend including more recent references to enhance the relevance of the literature cited.
