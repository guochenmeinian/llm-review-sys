Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents MultiMon, a system designed to automatically identify and categorize systematic failures in multimodal models, particularly those utilizing CLIP embeddings. The authors leverage large language models (LLMs) to detect failures by comparing textual inputs that are similar in CLIP embedding space but dissimilar in DistillRoBERTa. MultiMon generates new failure cases based on these categories, demonstrating its effectiveness across various downstream tasks, including text-to-image, text-to-video, and text-to-3D-model systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The writing and presentation are clear and comprehensive, effectively supporting the claims made.
- The proposed method is simple yet effective, allowing for automatic detection and categorization of failures in multimodal systems.
- The framework is flexible, with a plug-and-play design that can be tailored for specific applications, such as self-driving.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation relied on the authors as annotators, which raises concerns about bias; independent annotators could enhance credibility.
- The system's performance is heavily dependent on the quality of the initial corpus, yet the authors do not analyze how this affects results.
- The paper primarily focuses on failures related to the CLIP text encoder, lacking broader evaluations across different multimodal models and tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by incorporating independent annotators to assess the failure-finding procedure. Additionally, it would be beneficial to quantify the minimum sample size and quality required for the initial corpus to ensure robust evaluations. Including examples of datasets suitable for initial corpus creation, beyond COCO, would also enhance the paper's utility. Furthermore, we suggest exploring the potential for MultiMon to automatically fix identified failures and incorporating this aspect into the motivation for the paper. Lastly, clarifying the nature of the discovered failure categories in Appendix C and providing specific examples for each would strengthen the presentation.
