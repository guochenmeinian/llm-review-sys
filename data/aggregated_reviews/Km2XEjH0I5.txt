### Key Points
This paper presents the Text and Calculations through Tables (TACT) dataset, designed to challenge the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) through complex instructions. The dataset, based on the InstructIE dataset and annotated by experts, includes intricate tasks requiring the synthesis of information from multiple texts and advanced integration. The authors propose a new prompting method, IE as a Tool, which decomposes tasks into components and applies few-shot prompting. Comprehensive experiments reveal significant challenges for LLMs, with accuracy below 38%, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The TACT dataset is meticulously crafted with expert input, ensuring high data quality and presenting new challenges for LLMs in mathematical reasoning.
- The experiments encompass a variety of LLMs, including both open-source and proprietary models.
- The proposed IE as a Tool method shows effectiveness and could serve as a strong baseline for TACT.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a detailed description of task difficulties in the TACT dataset, such as the number of arithmetic operations and table sizes.
- The IE as a Tool approach appears tailored for TACT, and additional experiments on other reasoning benchmarks, like GSM8K, would enhance its generalizability.
- The necessity of generating Pandas code is questionable, as it often contains errors; an ablation study without Pandas code generation could clarify its importance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the description of task difficulties in the TACT dataset, including specifics on arithmetic operations and table sizes. Additionally, conducting experiments on other reasoning benchmarks, such as GSM8K, would provide valuable insights into the broader applicability of the IE as a Tool method. To further validate the necessity of Pandas code generation, we suggest adding an ablation study that examines performance without this component. Finally, a more detailed discussion of the design choices in dataset collection, including alternative considerations and challenges faced, would enhance understanding for the community.
