### Key Points
This paper presents a multi-view feature alignment and memorization framework for emotion recognition in conversation, proposing to align semantic-view and context-view features, utilize memorization techniques for tail-class classification, and model interactions between utterances through probing. The authors achieve state-of-the-art results on four benchmarks, demonstrating the utility of their approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper reports state-of-the-art results on four benchmarks and includes extensive experiments.
- The proposed method is well-motivated, interesting, and has potential applications across various tasks.
- The approach represents a meaningful engineering contribution to emotion recognition in conversation.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for aligning semantic-view and context-view features is unclear, raising questions about its necessity and implications.
- The contribution of the memorization technique is perceived as relatively invalid, being a clich√© approach of storing feature vectors and labels.
- The paper suffers from poor readability, with many confusing descriptions and vague statements, particularly in the abstract and motivation sections.
- There is a lack of qualitative analysis and error analysis, which could enhance understanding of the model's performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind aligning features by explicitly discussing the implications of misalignment and the challenges of modeling interactions through graph neural networks. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the memorization technique to clarify its novelty. Enhancing the readability of the manuscript by revising confusing descriptions and addressing the specific questions raised, such as the definition of "PLMs" and the rationale for using Euclidean distance in equation (4), is essential. We also suggest including qualitative examples and conducting error analysis to provide deeper insights into the model's performance. Finally, organizing the reference list and correcting typos will improve the overall presentation of the paper.
