### Key Points
This paper presents a novel technique for transition path sampling (TPS) using a pre-trained Boltzmann generator's latent space to propose transition paths in MCMC sampling without molecular dynamics. The authors investigate Metropolis-Hastings acceptance criteria and various latent proposal methods, including Gaussian noise and Gaussian processes. Experiments on alanine dipeptide reveal challenges related to path probability calculation and low acceptance rates. The approach allows for parallel evaluation of the energy function, which is a significant advantage over traditional methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The methodology is technically sound, with clear setup and derivations for path probabilities.  
- The paper is well-written, providing sufficient context and clarity in the methodology sections.  
- The exploration of latent space MCMC for TPS is original and offers unique insights into mapping simple latent paths to complex configuration space paths.  

Weaknesses:  
- The insights on learned latent space proposals may not be generalizable, depending on the training of the Boltzmann generator.  
- The low acceptance rates of MCMC steps result in limited path diversity and quantity.  
- The results lack strong or decisive outcomes, highlighting the challenges of sequential MCMC.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis quantifying tradeoffs between different proposal methods to strengthen the quality of the work. Additionally, addressing the challenges associated with low acceptance rates and exploring ways to enhance path diversity would be beneficial. Finally, providing more decisive results or insights could further validate the proposed approach.
