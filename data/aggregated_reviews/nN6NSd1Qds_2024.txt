Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Universal Graph Coarsening (UGC) framework designed to effectively handle both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. The UGC framework utilizes Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to retain important spectral properties and demonstrates significant improvements in computational efficiency and performance, particularly at higher coarsening ratios. The authors propose aggregating node clusters through a hash function, marking a pioneering effort in heterophilic graph datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The UGC framework is a novel approach that effectively integrates node attributes and adjacency information, demonstrating significant speed improvements and efficiency.
- The paper is well-structured, with clear problem definitions and thorough experimental analysis.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation lacks clarity in several areas, including ambiguous formulations and vague claims.
- The experimental setup is insufficiently detailed, particularly regarding software and hardware environments.
- Some figures and tables do not adequately support the claims made, particularly regarding spectral property preservation and accuracy enhancements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their presentation by providing specific definitions and avoiding vague terminology. A formal definition of the Graph Coarsening problem is necessary. Additionally, please clarify the configuration of the number of hash functions and measure the memory space overhead. We suggest including results from more recent models in comparisons and providing a detailed description of the experimental setup. An ablation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed augmented feature vector would also be beneficial. Lastly, addressing the concerns related to the fixed node ordering in the context of graph models is essential.
