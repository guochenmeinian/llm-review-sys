### Key Points
This paper presents SRL4NLP, a novel data augmentation approach for imbalanced text classification, inspired by super-resolution learning from image processing. The authors utilize high-quality Wikipedia texts as "high resolution" to enhance short, noisy tweets as "low resolution." The method is evaluated on urgency detection in crisis tweets, demonstrating significant improvements in F-scores, particularly for minority classes, across both English and French datasets, outperforming existing augmentation techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The innovative adaptation of super-resolution learning to NLP represents a significant contribution to data augmentation strategies.
- The paper is well-structured and articulates the motivation and methodology clearly, providing a solid background on the topic.
- Statistically significant improvements in F-scores and competitive performance across languages enhance the credibility of the results.

Weaknesses:
- The generalizability of the approach is limited due to reliance on suitable external high-resolution texts and the need for alignment between low-resource and high-resource tasks.
- The methodology lacks clarity, making it difficult to discern how SRL4NLP advances previous methods, which may render it appear incremental.
- The absence of comparative analysis with mainstream models, such as large language models, diminishes the study's persuasive power.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodological description to facilitate better understanding. Expanding on how high-resolution texts are mixed with tweets for training and detailing the implementation of augmentation would be beneficial. Additionally, we suggest including a comparative analysis with existing mainstream models to enhance the study's credibility. Finally, clarifying the novelty of the approach, particularly in distinguishing it from domain transfer techniques, would strengthen the paper.
