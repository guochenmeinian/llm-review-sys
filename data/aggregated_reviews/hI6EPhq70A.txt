Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for reconstructing high-resolution face images from feature vectors extracted from a face recognition (FR) system, demonstrating potential attacks in both white-box and black-box scenarios. The authors evaluate their method across five different attack scenarios, highlighting the vulnerability of FR systems and emphasizing the need to protect stored template feature vectors.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper evaluates various attack scenarios using five different face recognition models.  
- The reconstructed face images exhibit high quality, with some closely resembling the original images.  
- The organization and clarity of the paper enhance its readability.  

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty of the proposed framework is limited, relying heavily on existing works like StyleGAN3 and WGAN.  
- The attack scenarios are straightforward combinations of feature extraction models, lacking practical applicability ratings.  
- The implicit assumption regarding input and output uniformity across different feature extraction models needs further analysis, particularly for varying dimensions and pre-processing steps.  
- There are referencing errors in the tables, and grammatical issues throughout the paper.  
- The method's generalizability is questioned due to biases in the generator, such as resolution and demographic factors.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their framework by exploring alternative synthesis networks beyond StyleGAN3, such as Transformer and diffusion models. Additionally, the authors should analyze the practical applicability of the attack scenarios and address the implicit assumptions regarding input and output dimensions in their problem formulation. A more thorough investigation into the biases affecting the quality of reconstructed images, particularly concerning demographic variations, would also enhance the paper. Lastly, correcting the grammatical errors and referencing issues will improve the overall presentation.
