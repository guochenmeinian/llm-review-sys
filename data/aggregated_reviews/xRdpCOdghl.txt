Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new sampling method for semi-supervised learning (SSL) called RDSS, which aims to select a representative and diverse subset from unlabeled data using a modified Frank-Wolfe algorithm to minimize a novel α-Maximum Mean Discrepancy (α-MMD) criterion. The authors demonstrate that RDSS improves the performance of several popular SSL frameworks and outperforms existing sample selection methods in Active Learning (AL) and Semi-Supervised Active Learning (SSAL), even under constrained annotation budgets. However, the paper lacks sufficient comparison with prior works, which diminishes its novelty and significance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, logically organized, and presents a convincing strategy that considers both representativeness and diversity in sample selection.
- The experimental results effectively demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The paper does not adequately reference or compare with existing literature, which affects its novelty and significance.
- The selected baseline methods for comparison are outdated, and the experimental details are sometimes unclear.
- The framing of the paper is somewhat misleading, as it does not clearly differentiate between SSL and AL, nor does it explore the broader context of existing AL methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with existing works, particularly those addressing low-budget AL scenarios, to clarify how their method advances the state of the art. Additionally, the authors should include more updated baseline methods in their experiments and provide clearer details regarding the experimental setup. It would also be beneficial to visualize the actual selected samples and feature distributions to substantiate claims about balancing representativeness and diversity. Finally, the authors should clarify the framing of their work in relation to AL and SSL, possibly by discussing specific use cases where the labeled set for SSL can be predetermined.
