Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Dual Lagrangian Learning (DLL), a framework for dual conic optimization problems that integrates machine learning techniques to produce dual-feasible solutions and corresponding Lagrangian dual bounds for both linear and nonlinear conic optimization problems. The authors discuss the use of differentiable conic projection layers and a self-supervised learning framework, demonstrating that DLL significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly DC3, while providing a faster alternative to traditional interior-point methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The DLL framework guarantees dual feasibility, which is crucial for bounding primal solutions.
- The paper provides a closed-form analytical solution for conic projections and dual conic completion, enhancing the theoretical foundation.
- DLL requires less hyperparameter tuning compared to existing methods, facilitating ease of training and computational efficiency.

Weaknesses:
- The practical applicability of DLL remains unclear, particularly regarding scalability and computational costs.
- The focus on continuous problems limits the framework's relevance to mixed-integer programming (MIP), which is critical in real-world applications.
- The paper lacks detailed exploration of general non-convex constraints and the tuning process for DC3, which could undermine the robustness of the comparisons made.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their claims to avoid overstatements, particularly regarding the quality of bounds produced. Additionally, the authors should provide a more thorough comparison of DLL with existing methods that integrate ML with Lagrangian relaxation, especially in the context of MIP. It would be beneficial to include a discussion on the implications of using implicit layers and how they may affect performance on larger problems. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors include a rationale for focusing on continuous problems and consider incorporating examples that illustrate the direct benefits of learning dual solutions. Lastly, detailing the tuning process for DC3 in the paper would justify the limited tuning claims and enhance reproducibility.
