### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework, Joint Similarity Item Exploration and Overlapped User Guidance (SIEOUG), aimed at addressing the challenges of multimodal cross-domain recommendation (MMCDR). The authors propose three core modules: the Similarity Item Exploration Module for modeling pair-wise and group-wise item similarities, the User-Item Collaborative Filtering Module for aggregating multimodal embeddings, and the Overlapped User Guidance Module for optimizing user matching across domains. Empirical results indicate that SIEOUG significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly in scenarios with sparse user overlap.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The similarity item exploration module effectively reduces irrelevant noise and captures both pair-wise and group-wise item relationships, enhancing item embedding quality.
- SIEOUG demonstrates robustness even with minimal user overlap, unlike traditional cross-domain recommendation models.
- The framework shows stability and effectiveness across varying levels of user overlap.

Weaknesses:
- The rationale for certain procedures requires further emphasis, particularly regarding the GOUM module, which lacks clarity.
- The ablation study is insufficient, failing to adequately demonstrate the utility of each module.
- The paper contains several typographical errors, including a potential mistake in equation (23) and missing sub-captions in Figure 5.
- The analysis does not sufficiently address non-overlapped users or provide comparisons with other datasets beyond Amazon.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the GOUM module's illustration and provide a more detailed explanation of Figure 4 to enhance reader understanding. Additionally, the authors should conduct a more comprehensive ablation study, comparing the performance of single pair-wise or group-wise item similarity, and include analyses on RISGF and SISHE. It would also be beneficial to provide comparisons with the latest methods proposed in 2023 and 2024, as well as additional information regarding computational costs or memory usage relative to baseline methods. Lastly, addressing the typographical errors and ensuring consistency in notation and figure indexing will enhance the paper's overall quality.
