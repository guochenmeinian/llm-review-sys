Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of linear subspaces of activations in Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect the truthfulness of answers. The authors propose that there are at least two-dimensional subspaces for false statements (affirmative and negated), which explains the poor generalization of previous methods. They demonstrate that these dimensions are present across various LLMs (Gemma-7B, LLaMA2-13B, and LLaMA3-8B) and that their detector based on a general truth direction is robust, outperforming the previous method (CSS).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The identification of a two-dimensional subspace comprising a general truth direction and a polarity-sensitive truth direction is a significant contribution.
2. The paper includes a comprehensive evaluation across multiple datasets and LLMs.
3. The method achieves high accuracy in detecting both simple and complex lies, significantly surpassing the CSS method.
4. The analysis of these directions through evaluation and principal components is useful.

Weaknesses:
1. The analysis lacks a theoretical background explaining the emergence of these directions in LLMs.
2. There is no comparison with similar classifier-based methods like ITI to assess the potential for making models more honest.
3. Examples of classifier failures are not provided, which could offer important insights.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical background regarding the emergence of the identified directions in LLMs. Additionally, the authors should provide a comparison with similar classifier-based methods like ITI to clarify whether the general truth direction can enhance model honesty. Including examples of classifier failures would also be beneficial for understanding the limitations of the proposed method. Furthermore, we suggest clarifying the meaning of the j index in Line 141, addressing the skipped line break in Line 157, and correcting the factor in Eq (7) to 2/n_i. Lastly, we recommend referring to figures directly rather than using phrases like "colored boxes below" in Line 282.
