Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on fair hierarchical clustering, proposing an approximation algorithm that modifies an unfair hierarchical clustering to achieve a polylogarithmic approximation of fairness while maintaining a bounded increase in cost. The authors improve upon the results of Knittel et al. [2023], achieving a significant enhancement in the approximation factor. The theoretical findings are supported by simulations on two datasets, demonstrating the algorithm's effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides the first provable polylog approximation for hierarchical clustering under fairness constraints, marking a significant advancement in the field.
- The algorithm simplifies existing methods while achieving the desired approximation bounds.
- The empirical results indicate that the proposed algorithm effectively balances fairness with a modest increase in cost.

Weaknesses:
- The paper heavily relies on the work of Knittel et al. [2023], leading to concerns about originality.
- The scalability of parameters $h$, $k$, and $\lambda$ is questionable, as the experimental settings appear to violate theoretical requirements.
- The presentation is poor, with many technical terms introduced without prior definitions, making it difficult to grasp the content.
- The statements of theorems are complex and require significant effort to understand due to the involvement of multiple parameters.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by defining all technical terms and parameters before their use, particularly in the introduction. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more intuitive explanation of their main contributions and clarify the differences from Knittel et al. [2023]. It would be beneficial to include comparisons with other algorithms in the experiments to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method across various initial clustering algorithms. Lastly, addressing the unclear points raised in the reviews, such as the role of $\gamma$ in Theorem 1 and the definition of cluster balance, would enhance the paper's comprehensibility.
