Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents MaskFactory, a method for generating high-quality synthetic datasets for Dichotomous Image Segmentation (DIS) tasks. The authors propose a two-stage process involving mask editing through rigid and non-rigid transformations, followed by image generation using multi-conditional control methods. The efficacy of MaskFactory is demonstrated through experiments on the DIS5K dataset, showing improvements in dataset quality and efficiency compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a comprehensive solution to DIS dataset creation, with a well-detailed methodology and robust experimental results supporting claims of superior performance.
- The manuscript is well-written and easy to read, with comprehensive ablation studies validating the contributions of each method component.
- The proposed framework shows improvements in the quality and diversity of synthetic datasets, which is critical for advancing DIS applications.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the method is questionable, as it appears to combine existing approaches without significant innovation.
- The evaluation is limited to a single dataset, raising concerns about the generalizability of the results.
- There are several presentation issues, including typos, inconsistent font usage, and unclear descriptions of the mask editing process.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and detail of the mask editing process to better illustrate their unique contributions. Additionally, the authors should address the novelty concerns by providing clearer distinctions between their approach and existing methods. To enhance the generalizability of their findings, we suggest evaluating the method on a broader range of datasets, such as VOC, ADE20K, and CityScapes. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the canny condition and the impact of the L_structure loss in their experiments. Lastly, we advise revising the manuscript for typographical errors and ensuring consistent formatting throughout.
