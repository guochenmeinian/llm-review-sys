### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework called ESSEN (Evolution StateS awarE Network) for temporal graph representation learning, addressing challenges related to the diversity of evolving patterns and high computational costs. The authors propose to incorporate approximate von Neumann Entropy and thermodynamic temperature differences into their model, validated through link prediction tasks across various datasets. The method shows significant performance improvements and computational efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is clearly written and easy to follow.
2. It introduces a thermodynamic perspective to temporal graph learning, potentially inspiring future research.
3. The formulations of approximate von Neumann Entropy and thermodynamic temperature difference are rigorous.
4. The experimental results indicate strong performance of the ESSEN model, outperforming baseline methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The definitions of von Neumann entropy and graph entropy in the context of thermodynamic temperature differences are limited to undirected graphs, raising concerns about applicability to directed temporal networks.
2. Some core concepts, such as von Neumann entropy, require domain-specific knowledge that is not clearly defined.
3. The lack of provided code hinders reproducibility of results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the accessibility of their work by providing intuitive explanations for the quantities $\mathcal{J}(G)$ and $\mathcal{K}(G)$ defined in Eq. (6) and Eq. (7). Additionally, please clarify how the approximation of von Neumann entropy impacts the exact entropy computation and the representations of dynamic networks. It would also be beneficial to discuss the extent to which pre-computed thermodynamic quantities can reduce computational costs as the network evolves. Lastly, we encourage the authors to publish the code for their reported results to enhance reproducibility.
