### Key Points
This paper presents a framework to generate novel reticular materials using GFlowNets, which is an interesting application in a significant area of the chemical sciences. The authors propose a method that could have a substantial impact on the field.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The approach is innovative and relevant to the chemical sciences.  
- The potential impact of the framework is acknowledged, suggesting it could be a valuable tool.  

Weaknesses:  
- The absence of accessible code may hinder constructive feedback and the tool's broader adoption.  
- The title may lack specificity regarding the library name, matgfn.  
- There is insufficient guidance on practical applications of the dataset of hypothetical reticular frameworks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve accessibility by using an anonymous GitHub link to share their code, ensuring compliance with the double-blind policy. Additionally, consider including the library name, matgfn, in the title for clarity. Finally, we suggest providing guidance on how the dataset of hypothetical reticular frameworks can be utilized in practice.
