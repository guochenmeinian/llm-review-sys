### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into differentiation techniques for data-driven differential equation discovery, analyzing four methods: Savitzky-Golay filtering, spectral differentiation, smoothing via artificial neural networks, and regularization of derivative variation. The authors perform numerical experiments to highlight the significance of these differentiation methods in equation discovery. Additionally, the paper evaluates the stability of several existing auto-differentiation algorithms compared to finite differences, focusing on their ability to recover coefficient values under specific scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of various differentiation methods and their relevance to differential equation discovery.  
- The numerical experiments effectively demonstrate the importance of differentiation techniques.  

Weaknesses:  
- The analysis lacks depth regarding the implications of results for real-world applications.  
- The unique contributions of this work relative to existing literature are not clearly articulated.  
- The methodology focuses on narrow scenarios, leaving the applicability of findings to complex real-world situations ambiguous.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of results to better elucidate their implications for real-world applications. Clarifying the unique contributions of this work in relation to existing literature would enhance its impact. Additionally, providing a clearer indication of which differentiation methods are most suitable for real applications would strengthen the paper's relevance.
