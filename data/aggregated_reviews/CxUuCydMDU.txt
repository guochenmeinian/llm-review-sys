Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework, DPM-SNC (Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Structured Node Classification), which integrates diffusion probabilistic models to address structured node classification on graphs. The authors propose a new training algorithm and a variational lower bound, demonstrating that their model is more expressive than the classic 1-WL test. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments across inductive and transductive settings validate the effectiveness of DPM-SNC.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written.
- The application of diffusion probabilistic models in node classification is innovative.
- The theoretical analysis of the 1-WL test is compelling, and the experiments are thorough, showcasing the method's performance across various scenarios.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for using diffusion probabilistic models is unclear, particularly regarding their benefits for partially labeled graphs.
- The computational complexity of DPM-SNC is not analyzed, despite its reliance on multiple sampling steps.
- The paper lacks a self-contained explanation of technical details, which may hinder understanding for readers unfamiliar with diffusion models.
- There is insufficient discussion of related works that combine deep neural networks and label propagation for structured node classification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for using diffusion probabilistic models by clearly explaining how they enhance GNNs for partially labeled graphs. Additionally, the authors should provide an analysis of the computational complexity of DPM-SNC. To enhance clarity, we suggest making the main paper more self-contained by reducing reliance on the appendix for key technical details. Furthermore, the authors should include a discussion comparing their method with existing approaches that integrate deep neural networks and label propagation. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the inductive application of their model and explore its potential as a general node embedding model.
