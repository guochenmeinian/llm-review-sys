Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework called MiTSformer, designed to address the challenges of mixed time series (MiTS) data, which includes both continuous variables (CVs) and discrete variables (DVs). The authors emphasize the necessity of converting some CVs to DVs to tackle the underexplored area of mixed time series modeling, particularly in real-world scenarios where continuous signals are recorded as discrete forms. They propose the use of latent continuous variables (LCVs) to recover the underlying continuous nature of DVs, employing hierarchical aggregation of temporal context and adversarial learning to align DVs with CVs. The framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across five MiTS analysis tasks on multiple datasets, including benchmark datasets and a private thermal power plant dataset, showcasing its effectiveness through downstream task performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of LCVs to bridge the gap between DVs and CVs is innovative and addresses a significant issue in spatial-temporal modeling.
2. The paper addresses a significant gap in the literature regarding mixed time series modeling and provides a clear rationale for the conversion of CVs to DVs, supported by experimental results.
3. The framework shows robust performance across various datasets and tasks, indicating its effectiveness, particularly when compared to baseline models.
4. The inclusion of real-world datasets enhances the practical relevance of the research, and the code is open-sourced, clean, and well-organized, reflecting a high standard of technical implementation.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks sufficient evidence to support the effectiveness of the proposed self-supervised objective functions, particularly the Temporal Adjacent Smoothness Constraint, which requires further theoretical justification.
2. The adversarial framework for discriminating between CVs and LCVs appears weak and lacks a solid theoretical foundation.
3. The experimental setup relies on converting CVs to DVs, which may introduce unnecessary complexity and potential information loss, weakening the paper's motivation.
4. The lack of ground truth labels for LCVs in datasets with natural DVs limits direct evaluation of recovery accuracy.
5. The computational efficiency analysis could be more comprehensive, particularly for datasets with a large number of variables.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical justification for the Temporal Adjacent Smoothness Constraint, particularly addressing how the model handles DVs with inherent sudden changes. Discussing alternative formulations, such as K-Lipschitz continuity, could enhance clarity. Additionally, we suggest providing a more explicit connection between the mathematical formulas and the LCV transformation process to improve presentation. It would be beneficial to conduct experiments on datasets where DVs are discretized from CVs to demonstrate the accuracy of recovering CVs and validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We also recommend improving the clarity of the computational efficiency analysis by providing a more detailed comparison across various datasets, especially those with a larger number of variables. Furthermore, discussing the limitations of the smoothness constraints in handling DVs with inherent sudden changes more thoroughly would be advantageous. Lastly, including more visualizations of the recovered LCVs alongside the actual LCVs could strengthen the claims regarding the effectiveness of their recovery method.
