Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SegRefiner, a model-agnostic solution for refining object masks generated by various segmentation models through a discrete diffusion process. The authors formulate the refinement as a data generation process, progressively improving coarse masks by predicting label and state-transition probabilities for each pixel. Extensive experiments demonstrate SegRefiner's superiority across multiple segmentation tasks, including semantic and instance segmentation, showcasing its ability to capture fine details in high-resolution images.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel diffusion-based approach for segmentation refinement, marking a significant contribution to the field.
- SegRefiner is model-agnostic, applicable across different segmentation models and tasks, and shows consistent performance improvements.
- The manuscript is well-written, organized, and presents strong experimental results, achieving state-of-the-art outcomes on various tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for using denoising diffusion models in segmentation refinement lacks clarity, particularly regarding the technical challenges and innovations proposed.
- The paper does not adequately explain the calculation of state-transition probabilities and lacks proper citations for certain methodologies, such as Gumbel-max sampling.
- There are concerns about the clarity of the training process for coarse masks and the limited examples illustrating the diffusion process during inference.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind using denoising diffusion models for segmentation refinement, explicitly addressing the technical challenges and innovations. Additionally, the authors should provide a detailed explanation of how state-transition probabilities are calculated and ensure proper citations for referenced methodologies. Including more examples of the diffusion process during inference would enhance understanding, and discussing the generation of coarse masks earlier in the paper would improve overall clarity.
