Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel federated learning method, FedInit, aimed at addressing the "client drift" problem caused by NonIID data. The authors propose initializing the local model of each client with its personalized model to enhance consistency and performance. The manuscript includes theoretical analyses on convergence and generalization, as well as extensive experiments demonstrating the method's effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method outperforms baseline methods without increasing communication costs and can be easily integrated into existing frameworks.
2. The manuscript provides a comprehensive theoretical analysis and solid experimental results, showcasing the method's efficiency.
3. The exploration of global consistency constraints in federated learning is an essential contribution.

Weaknesses:
1. The hyperparameters were not adequately tuned across different methods, potentially leading to an overestimation of the proposed method's performance.
2. The theoretical results do not sufficiently demonstrate the effectiveness of the initialization strategy in reducing divergence compared to vanilla FedAvg.
3. The workflow of the proposed method appears incorrect, and the clarity of obtaining certain values is lacking.
4. The experiments are limited in scope, lacking diverse settings such as varying client numbers and participation rates.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the tuning of hyperparameters for different methods to ensure a fair comparison of performance. Additionally, we suggest providing more experimental results across various federated learning settings, such as different numbers of clients and participation rates, to better evaluate the method's robustness. Clarifying the workflow and addressing the placement of lines in the algorithm would enhance the manuscript's clarity. Finally, including a schematic to illustrate the principles of the proposed method would aid in reader comprehension.
