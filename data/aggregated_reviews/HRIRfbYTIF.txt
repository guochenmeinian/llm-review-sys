### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive measurement study of IPFS over a three-year period (2021-2024), analyzing over 20 billion messages. The study reveals three significant findings: (1) IPFS exhibits a low replication level with only 29.20% of content having more than one copy, (2) there is an increasing centralization trend where 5% of nodes host 80.55% of content, primarily driven by cloud nodes, and (3) the current deduplication strategy is inefficient. The authors propose a new metadata format to optimize deduplication while maintaining performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a crucial aspect of Web 3.0 by examining IPFS, contributing significantly to understanding the practical challenges in decentralized systems.
- A substantial dataset spanning three years provides a robust foundation for analyzing long-term trends in centralization and data management.
- The use of statistical measures such as the Gini Coefficient and Shannon Entropy offers clear, quantitative insights into data distribution.
- The proposed new metadata format demonstrates practical applicability for improving deduplication.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks comprehensive analysis and solutions for most identified problems, particularly regarding low replication and increasing centralization.
- Experiments were primarily conducted on specific EC2 instances, limiting the generalizability of results, and the configuration appears inadequate.
- The evaluation of the new metadata format is unduly particular and inadequate, and the paper does not sufficiently explore potential risks associated with centralization.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the data collection methodology to clarify its representativeness of the overall IPFS ecosystem. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more thorough analysis of the implications of low replication levels and increasing centralization. It would also be beneficial to include a broader evaluation of the new metadata format in real-world applications. Finally, addressing the potential risks of centralization on data availability and user trust would enhance the paper's depth.
