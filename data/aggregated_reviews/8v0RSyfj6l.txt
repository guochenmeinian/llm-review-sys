### Key Points
This paper presents a set of heuristics designed to evaluate the quality of AI-generated medical imaging segmentations without requiring expert annotations. The authors developed four specific heuristics to assess segmentation completeness, connected components, laterality, and minimum volume, demonstrating their effectiveness on a dataset of 125K CT scans with segmentations of up to 104 organs. The work aims to address the challenges of manual annotation variability and the absence of expert validation in AI applications. The authors also provide interactive visualization tools and make their code publicly available to support further research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and clearly structured, offering a novel solution to the quality control of medical image segmentation masks.
- The proposed heuristics are practical tools for initial quality control across extensive datasets, validated through various analyses.
- The authors' commitment to reproducibility is evident through the public availability of their code.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks experimental comparisons with existing machine learning methods for quality control, limiting its impact.
- The heuristics may not be applicable to various types of outliers, as they are primarily demonstrated for rib segmentation and may not generalize well to other organs.
- There are clarity issues in Figure 2, and the paper does not address demographic variations in segmentation accuracy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the title and abstract to accurately reflect the specific focus on rib segmentation from CT images. To enhance the paper's impact, it is essential to provide experimental proof of the heuristics' effectiveness across different segmentation tasks and to compare them with state-of-the-art machine learning methods. Additionally, we suggest conducting a demographic variation analysis to assess how the heuristics perform across different ethnicities. Clarifying the captions in Figure 2 and justifying the limitations regarding the population study on organs other than vertebral segments would strengthen the paper. Finally, we encourage the authors to randomly select a subset of CT scans for review by human experts to validate the heuristics further.
