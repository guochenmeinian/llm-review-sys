Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method to measure feature complexity in deep learning models using $\mathcal{V}$-information, an extension of Shannon's mutual information that considers decoder capabilities. The authors analyze features extracted from a ResNet50 model trained on ImageNet, revealing that low-complexity features relate to simple visual elements, while high-complexity features correspond to intricate structures. The study finds that simpler features emerge earlier and are propagated through residual connections, while complex features develop later. Additionally, it highlights a trend where more important features are less complex and their complexity diminishes during training. Furthermore, the authors propose a combination of algorithms and metrics, including the K-means method, to enhance understanding in deep learning, discussing the complexity of features such as *fences* and *dotted texture*. However, concerns about the coherence and significance of the paper persist, particularly regarding the theoretical framework uniting the various components.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces an elegant measure of feature complexity that accounts for computational expressiveness across layers.
- It is well-written, with detailed methods, thorough analyses, and clear visualizations.
- The Related Works section is comprehensive, and the combination of interpretability tools is commendable.
- The analysis of the relationship between complexity and importance throughout training is particularly insightful.
- The authors provide reasonable explanations for their methodological choices, particularly regarding the K-means method.
- The responses to reviewer queries clarify several points and acknowledge remaining open questions, enhancing the paper's transparency.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed measure closely relates to decoding accuracy, and an explicit discussion on its unique contributions compared to raw decoding accuracy is lacking.
- The analysis is limited to a single ResNet model, raising questions about implications for architectures without residual connections, which should be explicitly addressed.
- The assumption that decodability increases across layers may misclassify certain early features as high-complexity; this concern needs discussion.
- The visualization of features undergoing complexity changes during training is insufficient; a clearer depiction of feature evolution would enhance understanding.
- The paper lacks a coherent theoretical framework that justifies the integration of its various components.
- There is ambiguity regarding the compatibility of selected methods, which raises questions about their collective significance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the unique insights provided by the proposed complexity measure compared to traditional decoding accuracy. Additionally, the authors should explicitly predict the behavior of networks without residual connections and discuss the implications of their findings in that context. Addressing the potential misclassification of early features due to the assumption of increasing decodability across layers is essential. We also suggest visualizing the features that change in complexity during training to clarify the nature of these transformations and their relevance to the proposed complexity measure. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the coherence of the paper by clearly justifying the selection of each component within a unified theoretical framework, specifically addressing the compatibility of the Craft method with the proposed $\nu$-information metric and providing a rationale for choosing specific methods like the feature visualization method, the CKA metric, and the importance metric $\Gamma(z_i)$. This would enhance the impact and clarity of the paper.
