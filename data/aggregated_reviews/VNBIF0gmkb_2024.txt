### Key Points
This paper presents a novel autoregressive image generation method utilizing continuous-valued tokens, challenging the conventional reliance on discrete vector-quantized tokens. The authors propose a "Diffusion Loss" function to model per-token probability distributions through a diffusion process, thereby eliminating the need for vector quantization. This approach allows autoregressive models to operate in a continuous-valued space, potentially enhancing generation quality while maintaining speed advantages. The method is validated through extensive experiments on various autoregressive models, including standard and masked variants, demonstrating solid performance improvements across different settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of diffusion loss with autoregressive models is a compelling and innovative idea.
- Comprehensive experiments support the conclusion that the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches.
- The paper is well-structured, clearly articulating motivations and theoretical foundations, with thorough experimental details.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for discarding vector quantization lacks sufficient examples and justification, raising questions about the necessity of the proposed method.
- The theoretical analysis is somewhat insufficient, particularly regarding the information loss associated with diffusion loss compared to quantization.
- The scope of experiments is limited to the ImageNet benchmark, which may not fully represent the method's capabilities across larger-scale tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis by establishing assumptions that demonstrate the advantages of diffusion loss over quantization in terms of information retention. Additionally, providing explicit discussions on the prior and posterior distributions in the autoregressive system post-diffusion would enhance clarity. Expanding the experimental scope to include larger-scale benchmarks would also strengthen the validation of the proposed method. Finally, addressing the interpretability of continuous-valued tokens compared to discrete tokens could provide valuable insights into the method's effectiveness.
