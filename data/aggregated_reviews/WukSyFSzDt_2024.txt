Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of the DANE algorithm, introducing the stabilized-DANE (S-DANE) algorithm, which incorporates insights from the stabilized proximal point method. The authors propose an accelerated version of S-DANE, enhanced with Monterio-Svaiter acceleration, and provide convergence analysis and experimental validation. The algorithms accommodate partial client participation and various local solvers.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The presentation is clear, logical, and easy to follow.
2. The paper introduces two novel algorithms, S-DANE and its accelerated variant, with accompanying convergence analysis and experimental validation.
3. The algorithms support partial participation and various local solvers.

Weaknesses:
1. The reliance on the bounded gradient dissimilarity assumption for partial client participation raises concerns about the algorithm's practicality in heterogeneous data scenarios.
2. The focus on reducing communication rounds overlooks the importance of the number of bits transferred, which is constrained by bandwidth, making the terms communication complexity/efficiency misleading.
3. The analysis assumes each local objective \(f_i\) is \(\mu\)-strongly convex, which is somewhat restrictive.
4. There are several typographical errors present in the manuscript.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion regarding the bounded gradient dissimilarity assumption, as it may not accurately reflect the effects of data heterogeneity. Additionally, we suggest incorporating the total amount of communication into Table 1, rather than just the number of communication rounds, to provide a clearer picture of the trade-offs between algorithms. The authors should also clarify the steps for determining the proper stepsize for S-DANE and its accelerated version, particularly how the constants \(\bar{\delta}_s\) and \(\zeta\) are estimated. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to address the limitations of their assumptions and to provide clearer explanations of the differences between their algorithms and existing methods. Finally, we suggest correcting typographical errors throughout the manuscript.
