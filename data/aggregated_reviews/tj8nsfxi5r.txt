Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a time series forecasting framework that employs LLM-based agents to filter relevant news and enhance forecasting accuracy. The authors propose a method that integrates news with numerical data and introduces iterative self-evaluation through LLM agents, aiming to align social events with time series fluctuations. The results indicate significant improvements in forecasting accuracy by effectively utilizing unstructured news data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The innovative idea of filtering and utilizing news to enhance time series forecasting is compelling.
2. The framework is well-designed, with each component motivated reasonably.
3. Comprehensive experiments across multiple domains demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Weaknesses:
1. The time consumption of the framework needs discussion.
2. The components are largely inherited from existing works, reducing the model's novelty.
3. The collecting-then-filtering mechanism may negatively impact real-time performance.
4. The performance heavily relies on the relevance of selected news data, and inaccurate news could degrade forecasting accuracy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the time consumption of the framework. Additionally, we suggest providing a clearer organization of the three-phase prompting to avoid redundancy. Conducting ablation studies and sensitivity analyses would enhance the understanding of the framework's components. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the filtering criteria and logic used by the LLM agents to ensure the relevance of selected news items. Lastly, addressing the potential impact of conflicting news within a time window would strengthen the paper.
