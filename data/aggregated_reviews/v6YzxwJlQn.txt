Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method that combines Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) with the Deep Equilibrium Model (DEQ) to enhance operator learning under noisy conditions. The authors propose two weight-tied neural network architectures aimed at solving steady-state partial differential equations (PDEs), demonstrating that these architectures outperform existing methods on benchmark problems. The introduction of the weight-tied FNO and FNO-DEQ architectures, along with their empirical effectiveness, constitutes the primary contributions of the paper.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written, providing clear mathematical definitions and a rigorous presentation of the proposed methods.
2. The FNO-DEQ architecture shows significant improvements over traditional FNO in solving steady-state PDEs, demonstrating robustness to noise.
3. The incorporation of a fixed-point iteration mechanism into the FNO framework is innovative and compelling.

Weaknesses:
1. The literature review is insufficient, lacking references to operator learning methods based on attention, which have shown advantages in various applications.
2. The experiments comparing noise effects do not yield significant improvements, raising questions about their necessity.
3. The paper does not explore the potential of DEQ in combination with other models beyond FNO, limiting the scope of its applicability.
4. There is a lack of detailed theoretical analysis regarding the effectiveness of weight-tying for steady-state PDEs, and no comparison with state-of-the-art methods like finite element or spectral methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by including references to operator learning methods based on attention. Additionally, the authors should clarify the necessity of the noise experiments and consider exploring the combination of DEQ with other architectures. A more rigorous theoretical analysis of weight-tying effectiveness and a comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art methods would enhance the paper's depth. Finally, including loss versus training epochs data would provide insights into the convergence of the training process.
