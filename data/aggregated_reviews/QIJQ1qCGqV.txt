Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the first multimodal blind pedestrian motion benchmark, BlindWays, utilizing wearable sensors for data collection across various subjects and routes, accompanied by textual descriptions. The authors evaluate state-of-the-art models, revealing limited performance in the context of motion anticipation for visually impaired individuals. The dataset aims to fill a gap in existing research by providing data that reflects the unique motion patterns of blind individuals.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is meaningful and has positive societal implications, particularly for individuals with disabilities.
- The annotation procedure is mostly reasonable, and the inclusion of textual descriptions enhances context.
- The evaluation of existing methods on the dataset identifies generalization issues in prior works.

Weaknesses:
- The choice of evaluation metrics (APD, ADE, FDE) for text-to-motion and motion forecasting is inadequate, as they do not fully capture generative capabilities.
- The dataset lacks a clear justification for the importance of text-to-motion in the context of BlindWays.
- The potential applications of visual information from recorded multi-view videos are underexplored.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the significance of text-to-motion in the benchmarking process. Additionally, consider incorporating a control group of motion data from sighted individuals for more direct comparisons. We suggest using more robust evaluation metrics such as NPSS or NDMS for motion quality assessment, and including the zero velocity model as a baseline for ADE and FDE. Furthermore, please elaborate on how global translation and rotation are handled in the dataset, and provide a detailed README in the dataset directory to clarify its organization and potential applications in society-centered AI.
