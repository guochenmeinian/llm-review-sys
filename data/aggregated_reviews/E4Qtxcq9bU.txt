### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the availability and reliability of spot instances across AWS, Azure, and GCP cloud providers. The authors conduct a two-step analysis: a passive analysis of datasets from the providers to identify correlations between availability scores and influencing factors, followed by real-world experiments to observe interruption events. The findings aim to enhance the selection of spot instances by predicting future availability scores, providing valuable insights for developers and researchers in the web community.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a highly relevant issue, especially following recent policy changes by cloud providers.
- It is well-written and easy to follow, with several pertinent takeaways.
- The use of real-world experiments adds credibility to the findings.

Weaknesses:
- Section 3 lacks clarity, particularly regarding the time frame of interruption datasets and potential correlations with instance types or geographical regions. The analysis combines all instances and regions, obscuring nuanced differences.
- The conclusions drawn in Section 3 may overestimate the findings, as the stability of SPS values does not strongly motivate the need for prediction. The authors must clarify takeaways by including median and standard deviation of SPS values.
- Limited exploration of GCP due to dataset availability restricts the paper's contributions.
- The methodology for measuring interruptions is inadequately detailed, hindering replication and further research.
- The paper does not address the internal mechanisms of spot instance operations, which diminishes the motivation presented in the introduction.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve Section 3 by providing specific time frames for the interruption datasets and exploring correlations with instance types and geographical regions. Clarifying the takeaways with median and standard deviation of SPS values is essential. Additionally, the authors should enhance the exploration of GCP and adjust the contributions accordingly. We suggest including detailed measurement methodologies to facilitate future research replication. Finally, please tone down the motivation regarding the internal mechanisms of spot operations in the introduction, as it is not adequately addressed in the paper.
