### Key Points
This paper presents DiffSP, a robust framework designed to defend Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) against adversarial evasion attacks. The authors propose a prior-free diffusion-based purification process that effectively removes adversarial perturbations through selective noise injection and entropy-guided denoising. The framework demonstrates strong performance across various graph and node classification tasks, addressing significant challenges in the field.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- DiffSP's prior-free design enhances adaptability across diverse datasets.
- The innovative purification process combines LID-driven non-isotropic diffusion and transfer entropy mechanisms.
- The method is theoretically sound, supported by well-defined mathematical formulations.
- Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of DiffSP across multiple tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The lack of baseline comparisons, particularly against IDEA for node classification and HEAL for graph-level classification, limits the evaluation.
- DiffSP struggles with weaker attacks and naturally noisy data, where adversarial characteristics are less distinct.
- The framework's performance is sensitive to hyperparameter tuning, complicating implementation.
- The scalability of the graph entropy estimation process for large datasets is unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including comparisons with IDEA and HEAL to strengthen the evaluation. Additionally, providing a detailed analysis of the computational cost and runtime performance of DiffSP compared to baseline models would enhance the understanding of its efficiency. The authors should also explore the potential benefits of integrating node features into the diffusion process and clarify how DiffSP handles dynamic graphs and simultaneous feature and structural perturbations. Finally, addressing the trade-off between computational cost and robustness could provide valuable insights for optimizing the method in online learning scenarios.
