Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DASH (Domain-Aware Sparsity Heuristic), a novel framework for pruning neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) models to infer gene regulatory dynamics from time series gene expression data. The authors propose integrating prior biological knowledge as soft constraints during pruning to enhance model interpretability and biological relevance. They evaluate DASH against existing pruning methods on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating its ability to achieve high sparsity while maintaining predictive accuracy and recovering known regulatory interactions. Additionally, the authors conduct a comparative analysis of gene regulatory network (GRN) inference methods, emphasizing DASH's advantages over existing approaches. They argue that while perturb-seq experiments could provide valuable data, they are limited by cost and the inability to capture tissue-level effects, whereas ChIP-seq offers a more accurate representation of direct causal relationships within tissues. The authors also introduce additional experiments demonstrating DASH's robustness against prior noise, showing it consistently outperforms other methods in GRN accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of domain-specific information into DASH enhances model robustness to noise, a common challenge in biological data.
- DASH demonstrates superior performance in GRN accuracy, even under conditions of increased prior noise.
- The problem addressed is scientifically relevant, focusing on extracting biological insights from gene expression data.
- Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate DASH's performance, showing superior results compared to traditional pruning methods.
- The authors provide a comprehensive comparison of methods, highlighting the relative performance of DASH against state-of-the-art techniques.
- The inclusion of additional experiments and ablation results enhances the robustness of the findings.

Weaknesses:
- The mathematical formulation of DASH is confusing, with notation errors and unclear definitions that hinder understanding.
- There is an overemphasis on results from synthetic data, which may not accurately reflect real-world complexities.
- The balanced accuracy metric used for biological alignment is not clearly defined, raising concerns about potential biases in the results.
- The limitations of DASH are not adequately discussed, particularly regarding its applicability to large-scale or complex networks.
- There is a noted discrepancy between the results obtained and those reported in PathReg, raising concerns about consistency.
- The overall structure of the paper requires significant reorganization for improved readability and clarity.
- The biological background lacks sufficient detail, particularly in explaining key concepts such as regulatory factors.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the mathematical formulation by introducing all notation clearly and providing detailed explanations of the underlying principles. Additionally, the authors should expand the analysis of real-world datasets to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of DASH's performance. It would be beneficial to clarify the definition and implications of the balanced accuracy metric and to include discussions on potential biases in the biological alignment process. Furthermore, we suggest incorporating validation from domain experts to substantiate the biological relevance of the results and providing concrete examples where DASH aligns with known biological mechanisms. We also recommend reorganizing the structure of the paper to better motivate the DASH model both mathematically and biologically, introducing PHOENIX earlier, and clearly delineating the differences between PINN+MP/BioPrune and DASH. Additionally, providing more detailed explanations of biological terms and concepts would facilitate comprehension for reviewers. Lastly, addressing the generalizability of DASH to other domains and discussing its limitations more thoroughly would enhance the paper's overall impact. Further polishing of the manuscript is necessary to meet publication standards.
