### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the influence of different error terms for diffusion models from a continuous perspective under $W_1$ distance. The authors propose a WUP theorem to explain the robustness of score-based generative models (SGMs) and analyze the early stopping parameter $\epsilon$, which leads to a memory phenomenon. Additionally, the paper investigates the generalization error of diffusion models using the Wasserstein uncertainty propagation theorem, establishing robust analyses concerning various error sources.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The WUP theorem is novel and can analyze generative flows, generating independent interest.
2. The analysis of the early stopping parameter enhances understanding of the memory phenomenon.
3. The examination of different objective functions is intriguing.
4. The results are new and effectively isolate different sources of errors without restrictive assumptions on the target distribution.
5. The paper is well-written and presents mathematical derivations clearly.

Weaknesses:
1. The abstract claims stochasticity is key for SGM algorithms, yet this is not discussed in detail, particularly regarding the deterministic sampling process.
2. The presentation is dense and may hinder comprehension; actionable insights from the bounds should be included.
3. The paper does not consider the influence of discretization error, which should be addressed.
4. The connection to existing literature is weak, and the bounds in Theorems 3.2 and 3.3 lack explicitness.
5. The reliance on PDE theory and regularity analysis necessitates a discussion of relevant prior work and other machine learning contexts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on stochasticity in relation to the WUP theorem and its applicability to deterministic processes. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on the influence of discretization error and the balance between different terms related to $\epsilon$. Clarifying the connection to existing literature and providing explicit sample complexity results would strengthen the paper. Furthermore, including small-scale experiments to illustrate the tightness and usefulness of the bounds would enhance understanding. Lastly, we suggest adding more explanations regarding the pathwise characterization of probability distributions and relevant prior work in uncertainty quantification used in other machine learning problems.
