Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents two novel metrics, negCLIPLoss and NormSim, aimed at enhancing data selection for vision-language pre-training. negCLIPLoss serves as a normalization term to improve the existing CLIPScore metric, while NormSim provides additional insights when examples from the target task distribution are available. The authors demonstrate that these methods achieve state-of-the-art results on ImageNet-1K and 38 downstream tasks without relying on external data or models. Theoretical justifications for NormSim are also provided within a linear model framework.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is intuitive, well-motivated, and well-written.
2. The proposed methods are simple, effective, and yield significant performance improvements, achieving a 5.3% increase on ImageNet and a 2.8% average improvement across 38 downstream tasks.
3. The experiments are comprehensive, and the theoretical analyses offer valuable insights.

Weaknesses:
1. The authors assert that NormSim does not explicitly consider diversity but fail to elaborate on this point, leaving the connection between their methods and diversity unclear.
2. There are discrepancies between leaderboard scores and reproduced results, raising concerns about the validity of comparisons. The authors should include the DataComp leaderboard results in the Appendix for a fair assessment.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation regarding the implicit connection of NormSim to diversity, as this is crucial for understanding generalization performance. Additionally, we suggest including the DataComp leaderboard results in the Appendix to facilitate fair comparisons. Clarifying the interpretation of metrics in Figure 1 and providing more detailed descriptions of the algorithm steps would enhance the paper's clarity. Finally, addressing the questions regarding batch size and the selection process using NormSim would strengthen the theoretical foundation of the work.
