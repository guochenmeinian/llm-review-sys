### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) that integrates foveation and saccades inspired by the human visual system. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on benchmark datasets, claiming it exhibits "human-like" classification and exploration properties, particularly through the Duck and Rabbit optical illusion. However, the experimental evidence supporting the claim of human-like behavior is limited to a single image.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is clearly written and well-organized, addressing an important problem related to the resiliency of vision models to complex stimuli.
- The incorporation of human vision features into the models is a significant contribution to the neuro-inspired algorithm literature.
- The literature review and contextualization of the work are excellent, providing valuable insights for the reader.

Weaknesses:
- The quantitative results are weaker than expected, particularly when comparing FALcon to DenseNet161, which outperforms it across all metrics.
- The claims regarding the performance benefits of FALcon, especially on the ImageNet dataset, lack sufficient quantitative support.
- The methodology lacks clarity regarding the biological inspiration behind design choices, and the experimental focus on a single optical illusion limits the generalizability of claims.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their claims regarding the "human-like" behavior of FALcon, particularly by addressing the limitations of the optical illusion experiment and providing broader empirical evidence. Additionally, the authors should refine their evaluation metrics to ensure they align with standard practices in the WSOL literature and provide interpretations of the AP and mAP numbers. It would be beneficial to move the description of initial fixation generation earlier in the paper and clarify the number of fixation points. We also suggest explicitly stating which design choices are biologically inspired and which are not, to enhance the credibility of the neuro-inspired claims. Finally, addressing writing and formatting issues will improve the overall presentation of the paper.
