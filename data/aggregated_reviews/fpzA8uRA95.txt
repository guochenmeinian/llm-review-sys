Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a robustness-aware coreset selection (RCS) method aimed at enhancing adversarial contrastive learning (ACL) without requiring label information. The authors demonstrate that RCS effectively minimizes the representational divergence (RD) between natural and adversarial data, thus accelerating ACL while maintaining robustness transferability. The theoretical foundation includes a greedy search algorithm that guarantees optimality for the original problem, and empirical results validate the method's efficacy on large-scale datasets like ImageNet-1K.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method is novel and reasonable, selecting subsets based on RD without needing label annotations, which supports its originality.
2. The submission is technically sound, with claims well-supported by theoretical analyses and comprehensive experimental results.
3. The paper is well-organized and easy to follow, making it accessible to readers.

Weaknesses:
1. The proposed algorithm still requires considerable time for execution, which may hinder practical application despite being acknowledged in the limitations.
2. The coreset selection process, while efficient, may not significantly outperform random selection, raising questions about its computational advantages.
3. There is a lack of focused discussion on the characteristics of the coreset, such as class balance and distribution.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the computational efficiency of RCS compared to random selection, providing a detailed explanation of the performance gains. Additionally, we suggest a more in-depth discussion on the characteristics of the coreset, including its class balance and distribution, to enhance understanding of its effectiveness. Furthermore, addressing the impact of the parameter $\lambda$ on ACL's effectiveness and efficiency could provide valuable insights.
