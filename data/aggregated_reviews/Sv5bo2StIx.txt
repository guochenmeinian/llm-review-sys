Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of expected distortion in voting rules within a distributional framework, extending the work of Boutilier et al. (2015). The authors define expected distortion as the expected ratio of the total utility of the winning candidate to that of the candidate with the highest utility, given a preference profile. They demonstrate that the majority voting rule optimally minimizes expected distortion for two candidates and propose a novel binomial voting rule that achieves good expected welfare and distortion across various distributions. The authors also explore the relationship between expected social welfare and expected distortion, establishing an asymptotic equivalence between expected distortion and welfare maximization. The binomial voting rule is introduced as a method that approximates expected welfare maximization in a distribution-independent manner, with guarantees dependent on the median of the distribution.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and presents high-quality mathematics, making complex ideas accessible.  
- The distributional model is reasonable, avoiding questionable assumptions about random rankings.  
- The new definition of expected distortion is well-motivated, and the results under various distributional assumptions are diverse.  
- The proposed binomial voting rule is novel, intuitive, and shows promise for achieving good expected welfare and distortion, contributing to the theoretical analysis with proofs of key hardness and approximation results.  
- The analysis provides a novel perspective by examining distortion in an average-case Bayesian setting rather than a worst-case framework.

Weaknesses:  
- The assumption that all utilities are i.i.d. is overly strong and unrealistic, as it excludes correlated distributions common in many domains, such as politics.  
- The paper tends to oversell its applicability, claiming to work for “all distributions” while primarily focusing on i.i.d. distributions.  
- Many main claims lack verification due to proofs being deferred to the appendix, which may hinder confidence in the results.  
- The results for two candidates and the connections between expected welfare and expected distortion are not particularly surprising, and the techniques used are straightforward.  
- The notion of optimizing distortion may be questionable, as it assumes truthful voting, which is problematic in positional voting schemes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for their assumption of i.i.d. utilities, as this is crucial for the validity of their results. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide more detailed comparisons with existing literature, particularly regarding why other voting rules, such as those proposed by Ebadian et al. and Boutilier et al., are not suitable in their context. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the rationale behind the choice of benchmarks, particularly regarding the necessity and interest of using EDMR and EWMR. It would be beneficial to address the correctness issues in the proofs, particularly in Lemma F1 and Theorem 4.2, to bolster confidence in their results. We also suggest including more proof sketches or discussions on the expected distortion of known rules to enhance understanding and intuition. Lastly, addressing the implications of the median of the underlying distribution on their results and exploring the potential impact of correlated utilities would strengthen the paper's conclusions and provide insights on how their results might adapt to such scenarios.
