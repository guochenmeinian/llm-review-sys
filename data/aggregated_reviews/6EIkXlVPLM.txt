### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical method to enhance the usage of OWL ontologies through a diagrammatic reasoning system, focusing on ALC description logic, which encompasses the expressivity of most OWL ontologies. The authors propose a diagrammatic reasoning system based on Logic Graphs, inspired by the tableau algorithm, and demonstrate its soundness and completeness. The paper is well-written and self-contained, with a clear contribution to the literature.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The diagrammatic reasoning system improves the human interpretability of OWL ontologies, enhancing trustworthiness and explainability in Web 3.0 contexts.
2. The use of Logic Graphs simplifies visualizations for reasoning about ontologies, making complex concepts more accessible.
3. The adaptation of the tableau algorithm for ALC to Logic Graphs offers a practical tool for reasoning about concept satisfiability.

Weaknesses:
1. The first example in the introduction is problematic due to ill-defined concepts, which affects the motivation and application of the proposed algorithm.
2. The related work section includes formal parts that should be moved to the Background section, with a focus on related approaches.
3. The paper lacks experimental evaluations or clearly defined use-cases, making the practical value of the approach less convincing.
4. The target user of the proposed reasoning system is unclear, and the authors do not adequately address how their work compares to NLP-based approaches or its potential contributions to reasoning challenges in current Large Language Models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the first example in the introduction by accurately defining concepts. Additionally, we suggest moving the formal parts of the related work section to the Background section and focusing on relevant approaches. To enhance the paper's practical value, we encourage the authors to include experimental evaluations or clearly defined use-cases. Furthermore, we advise the authors to clarify the target user of the reasoning system and discuss how their work compares to NLP-based approaches, as well as its potential implications for Large Language Models. Lastly, including draft visualizations would be beneficial for future papers.
