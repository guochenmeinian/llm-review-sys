Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel motion generation pipeline utilizing a three-level hierarchical semantic graph to address text-to-motion generation challenges. The authors propose a coarse-to-fine diffusion model that extracts fine-grained control signals from captions through Graph Attention Networks (GAT). Extensive experiments on HumanML3D and KIT datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better motion generation and sensitivity to subtle text differences compared to existing techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The hierarchical semantic graph effectively models coarse-to-fine textual descriptions, enhancing fine-grained control.
- The proposed method shows impressive performance metrics, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
- The ability to refine generated motion adds meaningful interactivity and utility for users.

Weaknesses:
- Qualitative comparisons of different hierarchies are lacking; visualizations of motion generated from various latent embeddings would be beneficial.
- The motivation behind the imbalance problem needs further substantiation, and the authors should clarify the implications of the action level in the hierarchical graph.
- The paper lacks a detailed description of the motion refining procedure and does not adequately address the limitations of their own method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the qualitative comparison by visualizing motion generated from different levels of latent embeddings to better evaluate performance. Additionally, we suggest that the authors conduct experiments to demonstrate the "overemphasis" of the Transformer and clarify how their hierarchical semantic graph mitigates this issue. A more detailed explanation of the motion refining procedure, potentially including figures or algorithms, would enhance clarity. Finally, addressing the limitations of their method, particularly regarding the imbalance problem and failure cases, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of their approach.
