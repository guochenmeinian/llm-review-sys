Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a unified framework inspired by bracket-based dynamical systems to analyze the oversmoothing problem in graph neural networks (GNNs). The authors propose four novel architectures that span the reversibility and irreversibility spectrum, utilizing geometric brackets to parameterize dynamics without relying on empirical physical models. The framework allows for reinterpretation of message-passing and graph attention mechanisms as physical fluxes and conservation balances. Empirical comparisons with classical GNNs, such as GAT and GDE, are conducted across several benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed architectures in physical systems and node classification tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written, providing valuable insights and innovative ideas for constructing GNNs.
2. The experimental results, particularly in damped double pendulum and MuJoCO dynamics, are promising.
3. The availability of code promotes reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper may be challenging for readers without a physics background.
2. The proposed algorithm does not consistently outperform baselines in node classification tasks.
3. The presentation lacks clarity in distinguishing the authors' contributions from prior work, particularly in the mathematical aspects.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation, particularly by including a notation section and more motivating examples for a general audience. Additionally, the authors should explicitly investigate the role of depth in their experiments, as current results do not adequately address this aspect. To enhance understanding, we suggest providing concrete values for the computational complexity of the proposed architectures in the context of N nodes or N neighbors. Furthermore, the authors could elaborate on the role of (ir)reversibility in their experiments and clarify the implications for practitioners regarding the choice of bracket structures for different applications. Lastly, addressing the performance of the gradient model in various conditions would strengthen the paper's contributions.
