Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of existing Offline Meta-Reinforcement Learning (OMRL) methods, focusing on the informational quantities maximized by different approaches and their interrelations. The authors demonstrate that earlier methods like FOCAL maximize an upper-bound of the target quantity, while their new method maximizes a lower bound, leading to improved performance. They provide a comprehensive evaluation of their approach across various settings, including in-domain, out-of-distribution (ood), model-based scenarios, and varying data quality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The information theoretical analysis is novel, particularly in its comparative evaluation of existing methods.
- The proposed methods are well-motivated and demonstrate strong performance across diverse problem settings.
- Source code is made available for further research.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation of the Information Theoretical Framework in Section 2.2 is difficult to follow, particularly the terms "minimally causally related" and "maximally causally related," which require clarification. A clearer expression, such as $I(Z;M) \geq I(Z:M|X_b)$, is recommended.
- The experimental validation lacks a discussion on hyper-parameter choice and optimization, aside from one ablation study. A thorough hyper-parameter optimization for both baselines and proposed methods would enhance the evaluation's reliability.
- Theorem 2.4 (Concentration Bound for Supervised UNICORN) appears to be a straightforward application of Chebyshev without further discussion, leaving its inclusion and insights unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 2.2 by providing a more accessible explanation of the information theoretical terms used. Additionally, a detailed discussion on hyper-parameter optimization for both the proposed methods and baselines should be included to strengthen the experimental validation. The authors should clarify the insights provided by Theorem 2.4 and justify its inclusion in the paper. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to address the limitations regarding the applicability of the proposed methods to continuous task spaces and discuss potential adaptations. Lastly, incorporating ContraBAR into the comparison of methods would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach.
