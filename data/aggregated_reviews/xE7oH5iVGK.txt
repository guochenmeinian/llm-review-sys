Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents LVM-Med, a self-supervised learning (SSL) technique for medical imaging tasks, utilizing a second-order graph matching strategy. The authors trained LVM-Med on a large-scale dataset comprising over 1.3 million medical images from 55 publicly available datasets. The method significantly enhances performance across various downstream tasks, including segmentation, object detection, and image classification, outperforming both supervised learning methods and foundation models like Clip, Align, Flava, and SAM. The evaluation was conducted using two architectures: ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer (ViT).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- LVM-Med was evaluated on multiple tasks, showing superior performance on eight medical segmentation tasks compared to 2D SSL methods and foundational models.
- The model's training on a large-scale dataset demonstrates its capability to learn from extensive data, a necessity in medical imaging.
- LVM-Med exhibits robustness in in-out-distribution settings and flexibility in both end-to-end and prompt-based segmentation tasks.
- The authors conducted an ablation study, confirming the significance of various components, particularly second-order graph matching and Gumbel noise.

Weaknesses:
- The focus on a 2D backbone limits discussion on challenges related to applying this framework in 3D settings.
- Concerns arise regarding potential data leakage in the testing dataset and the generalizability of the model, given its training on a single dataset.
- The performance benefits of LVM-Med may diminish if a large-scale dataset is unavailable.
- Some related works on graph matching in computer vision are missing, which could enhance the novelty of the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion regarding the challenges of applying LVM-Med in 3D settings. Additionally, addressing the potential data leakage in the testing dataset and ensuring robust performance across diverse datasets is crucial. Clarifying the choice of baselines and providing more details on the experimental settings, particularly regarding the use of 3D data and data augmentation strategies, would enhance the paper's clarity. Lastly, including missing related works on graph matching in computer vision would strengthen the context of the proposed method.
