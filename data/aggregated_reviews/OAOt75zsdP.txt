### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach called Geometrically-Calibrated Distributionally Robust Optimization (GCDRO) to address the over-pessimism issue in traditional Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) methods. The authors analyze the excessive focus on noisy samples as a cause of this over-pessimism and propose incorporating data geometry into calibration terms. They demonstrate that their risk objective aligns with Helmholtz free energy concepts and develop an approximate minimax optimization algorithm to optimize GCDRO. Empirical validation shows GCDRO outperforms conventional DRO methods in prediction accuracy, parameter estimation, and generalization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of GCDRO provides a unique perspective on mitigating the impact of noisy samples in machine learning.
- The theoretical analysis connects GCDRO's risk objective to Helmholtz free energy, enhancing understanding of the problem.
- The optimization algorithm developed guarantees a bounded error ratio and standard convergence rate, ensuring reliability.
- Comprehensive experiments validate GCDRO's superiority over conventional methods, highlighting its practical significance.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a broader comparison with state-of-the-art approaches, limiting contextual evaluation of GCDRO's performance.
- There is an absence of real-world applications, which restricts understanding of GCDRO's practical applicability.
- The organization of the paper is somewhat confusing, particularly regarding the explanation of the graph structure $G_N$ and its relevance.
- Limitations of the method are not thoroughly discussed, particularly concerning the reliance on $k$-NN graphs for complex datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization of the paper by clearly distinguishing between DRO and ERM in Section 2 and elaborating on the graph structure $G_N$. Additionally, including a confidence interval for results in Figure 2 and providing a vector image format would enhance clarity. We suggest extending the evaluation to real-world datasets to better demonstrate GCDRO's applicability. Finally, a discussion on the computational complexity, including references to NN-Descent, should be included in the main text or appendix.
