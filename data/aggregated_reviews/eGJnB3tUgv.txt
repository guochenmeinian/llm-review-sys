Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method to tackle hypergradient conflicts in fairness-aware meta-learning, where the validation loss gradient does not align with per-group validation loss. The authors propose a two-stage solution utilizing Nash Bargaining to achieve consensus on gradient updates. The first stage focuses on optimizing towards a Pareto front, followed by fairness optimization. The approach is theoretically validated and empirically tested across multiple datasets, demonstrating improvements in various domains.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written, with effective visualizations that enhance understanding of the approach.  
- It derives a closed-form update rule for weights from Nash Bargaining, contributing significantly to the field.  
- The identification of hypergradient conflict as a challenge is intuitive and well-articulated, with reasonable and original methods proposed for resolution.  
- The theoretical contributions are robust, providing closed-form solutions and demonstrating Pareto improvement.

Weaknesses:  
- Clarity is lacking regarding when to transition to the second stage of the algorithm and how the threshold for this decision is determined.  
- The histograms in the visualizations are unclear, raising questions about the overlap of data representations.  
- Empirical results are based on limited synthetic data and specific model architectures, with insufficient discussion on the limitations of the experiments' scale.  
- The novelty of the closed-form update is questioned, as it appears similar to previous work, raising concerns about the uniqueness of the contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity on the transition criteria between the two stages of the algorithm, specifying how the threshold number of steps is determined. Additionally, please clarify the overlap in the histograms to enhance the visual representation of results. We suggest including more detailed discussions on the limitations of the experimental scale and the implications of using small datasets. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the novelty of the closed-form update and its differentiation from prior work. Lastly, an evaluation of the frequency of bargaining failures in real-world data would provide valuable insights.
