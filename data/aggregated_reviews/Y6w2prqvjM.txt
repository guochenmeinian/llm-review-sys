### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of the impact of continuous updates to black-box APIs, particularly the Perspective API, on the reproducibility of toxicity research. The authors demonstrate how these updates can lead to instability in research results and biased conclusions due to the joint usage of outdated and fresh scores. They provide a rigorous comparison of various models and methods using datasets like RealToxicityPrompts and UDDIA, along with concise recommendations for stakeholders to improve reproducibility in this field.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper identifies a critical issue with black-box APIs for toxicity evaluation, emphasizing the implications for fair comparisons over time.
- It is supported by detailed data analysis and illustrations that show how the distribution of RealToxicityPrompts changes over time and its effects on model rankings and reproducibility.
- The authors offer valuable recommendations for both API maintainers and researchers.

Weaknesses:
- The focus on a single API, Perspective, may limit the paper's audience and generalizability.
- The recommendations provided are perceived as relatively shallow compared to the depth of the analysis, lacking a systematic setup for practitioners.
- Some reviewers argue that the evolving nature of APIs could offer advantages, suggesting that static benchmarks may lead to overfitting in research.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their framing by explicitly acknowledging the focus on the Perspective API and considering a broader discussion on black-box APIs in general. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explore the use of open-access models as alternatives to Perspective in their recommendations for living benchmarks. Clarifying the last two paragraphs of Section 3.2 would enhance understanding, particularly regarding the scoring of prompts and continuations. Lastly, we encourage the authors to address the identified typos and improve the overall clarity of the paper's presentation.
