Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to human pose estimation using signals from six inertial measurement units (IMUs). The authors propose a Sequence Structure Module (SSM) that incorporates both spatial and temporal dependencies, enhancing the transformer model's ability to process fixed-length sequences. The proposed architecture demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy compared to previous methods, leveraging a learnable weight matrix initialized from dataset distributions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively identifies the structural relations in IMU signals across spatial and temporal dimensions.
- Experimental results show significant accuracy improvements over prior methods.
- The writing is clear, and the structure of the paper is well-organized.

Weaknesses:
- The authors attribute performance improvements to multiple components but only conduct ablation studies on two of them, leaving the contribution of the spatio-temporal framework underexplored.
- The SSM modules are heuristically designed, raising questions about their effectiveness compared to standard self-attention mechanisms.
- The novelty of the proposed method is somewhat limited, and comparisons with other neural network structures that inherently include inductive biases are lacking.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the spatio-temporal framework by conducting additional ablation studies to clarify its contribution to the overall performance. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to provide comparisons with other neural network architectures that incorporate inductive biases, such as GNNs and CNNs. Additionally, we suggest including visualizations of the learned weight matrices to illustrate the changes pre- and post-training, and to clarify the operational effectiveness of the SSM-T module in enforcing temporal correlations.
