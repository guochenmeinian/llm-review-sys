### Key Points
This paper presents a phishing cloaking attack targeting mobile app Webviews, where phishing content is selectively revealed based on the user-agent of the app's Webview. The authors evaluate the responses of Google Safe Browsing (GSB) and in-app anti-phishing systems to reported phishing URLs, revealing that current anti-phishing engines struggle with this cloaking technique. The study employs an automated evaluation framework across eight popular social and messaging apps, testing 210 phishing websites.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The first comprehensive study of Webview user-agent-based cloaking for phishing.
- Development of an automated framework for evaluating anti-phishing properties in selected apps.
- Responsible disclosure of identified vulnerabilities.

Weaknesses:
- Limited study scale (only eight apps) fails to capture the diversity of Webview user-agents.
- The automated test suite lacks scalability for larger tests.
- Security recommendations are unclear and require further clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the study's scale by including a broader range of apps and user agents to better reflect the diversity of Webview environments. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the automated test suite to support large-scale evaluations, possibly by simplifying the testing process to focus on binary outcomes (blocked or not). The authors should clarify their security recommendations, particularly regarding the role of HTTPS in phishing detection, and consider providing app-specific user agents to third-party services for more effective phishing checks. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore additional evasion tactics beyond user-agent-based methods and to incorporate real-world phishing datasets to strengthen their findings. Finally, we advise improving the organization and clarity of the presentation, particularly in tables and figures, to enhance reader comprehension.
