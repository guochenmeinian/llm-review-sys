Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents methods to enhance communication efficiency in distributed optimization, specifically addressing server-to-worker (s2w) communication costs, which are often neglected. The authors introduce MARINA-P, an innovative downlink compression method that utilizes correlated compressors to reduce communication complexity as the number of workers increases. The study also includes a theoretical analysis that establishes lower bounds on communication rounds and demonstrates that improvements can be achieved when the Hessians of individual functions are similar or aligned.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is original, focusing on uplink compression, a frequently overlooked aspect in federated learning.  
- It introduces a formal quantification, the functional $(L_A, L_B)$ inequality, to measure the similarity in the smoothness of individual functions.  
- The theoretical results are rigorously proved, and the paper is well-written, clearly presenting the problem and proposed solutions.  

Weaknesses:  
- The main weakness is the assumption of data homogeneity; experimental evidence on MARINA-P's performance with heterogeneous data would be beneficial.  
- There is a gap in the argument regarding the lower bound on communication load, as the authors claim it is lower bounded by $d$ times the rounds of communication, which may not hold true if a compressor is used.  
- The compressor model is somewhat contrived and may not directly translate to the information-theoretic setting.  
- The paper lacks empirical results to validate the theoretical convergence guarantees and does not consider quantization methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including experimental evidence demonstrating MARINA-P's performance with heterogeneous data. Additionally, clarify the communication load argument to address the gap identified regarding the use of compressors. It would also be beneficial to simplify the concept of the functional $(L_A, L_B)$ inequality, focusing on the $L_A$ condition. Lastly, consider including empirical comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods, including those that utilize quantization, to strengthen the paper's contributions.
