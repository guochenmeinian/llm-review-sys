Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SyMat, a novel approach for generating periodic materials that captures their unique symmetries. The authors propose using a variational auto-encoder (VAE) to generate atom types and lattice structures, while employing a score-based diffusion model for atom coordinates. The method maintains invariance to permutations, rotations, translations, and periodic transformations, demonstrating promising results in random generation and property optimization tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Clear and well-structured presentation.
- Insightful approach for incorporating symmetric properties.
- Extensive validation with comparisons to prior work and ablation studies.
- Strong empirical results, with SyMat performing well across various metrics.
- Theoretical derivations ensure robustness to symmetric transformations.

Weaknesses:
- Contributions to machine learning method development are minor.
- The assumption of equiprobable molecules (P(M) = P(M')) is not universally valid.
- The independence of "type vector A" from "lattice matrix L" appears heuristic and requires further elaboration.
- The need for better motivation regarding the importance of modeling symmetry in molecule generation.
- Limited qualitative results and insufficient analysis of SyMat's limitations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for modeling symmetry in molecule generation to enhance the paper's impact. Additionally, providing more qualitative results, particularly similar to those in Figure 3 of the supplementary material, would strengthen the analysis. The authors should also elaborate on the assumption of independence between "type vector A" and "lattice matrix L," as well as the implications of the equiprobable molecule assumption. Finally, improving the clarity of figures, especially Figure 2, would enhance understanding of the method.
