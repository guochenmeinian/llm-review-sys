### Key Points
This paper presents the Scientific Generative Agent (SGA), a bilevel optimization framework that integrates the abstract reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the computational strength of simulations to enhance physical scientific discovery. In this framework, LLMs propose hypotheses in a discrete optimization setting, while simulations perform continuous optimization through experimental feedback. The authors conduct extensive experiments demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed method in domains such as constitutive law discovery and molecular design, revealing novel solutions that challenge conventional approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The SGA framework is innovative, combining LLM-based hypothesis generation with simulations in a bilevel optimization context.  
2. The framework is applicable to multiple challenging domains, including molecular design and constitutive law discovery.  
3. The experiments are well-executed, showing significant improvements over strong baseline methods.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The caption for Figure 2 is missing, and expanding the descriptions for Figures 3-5 would clarify the specific tasks they illustrate and their motivations.  
2. There is limited discussion regarding the interpretability of the solutions generated by the LLM.  
3. The paper briefly mentions computational requirements, but more detailed information on the computational costs associated with using LLMs and simulations together would be beneficial for practitioners considering practical deployment.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the figures by adding the missing caption for Figure 2 and expanding the descriptions for Figures 3-5. Additionally, we suggest including a more thorough discussion on the interpretability of the LLM-generated solutions and providing detailed information on the computational costs associated with the SGA framework. Furthermore, addressing how the framework scales with increased problem complexity and how it handles contradictions between simulation results and proposed hypotheses would enhance the paper's robustness.
