Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the strategic linear contextual bandit problem, where agents can misreport their feature vectors to influence the learner's decisions. The authors propose the Optimistic Grim Trigger Mechanism (OptGTM) to incentivize truthful reporting while minimizing regret. They analyze two scenarios: one where the underlying parameter $\theta^*$ is known and another where it is unknown, demonstrating that neglecting agent incentives can lead to linear regret. The proposed mechanisms achieve sublinear regret under both conditions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem addressed is novel and has practical implications.
- The algorithm design is intuitive, and the theoretical analysis is rigorous.
- The paper is well-written, with excellent readability and logical coherence.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks matching lower bound analysis for strategic regret in both settings.
- The notation in the Introduction is confusing, particularly the use of "arms" for agents and "learner" for the bandit agent.
- The assumption that arms do not under-report their value is not adequately justified, especially given discussions in Appendix C.
- There is no experimental evaluation to support the theoretical findings, although some experiments were added after the rebuttal.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the notation in the Introduction to avoid confusion regarding the roles of arms and the learner. Additionally, we suggest providing a matching lower bound analysis for the strategic regret in both known and unknown $\theta^*$ settings. It would also be beneficial to justify the assumption regarding under-reporting more thoroughly. Finally, we encourage the authors to conduct numerical studies to validate their theoretical claims and include a discussion on the assumption of arms responding in Nash Equilibrium, possibly with real-life examples to clarify its implications.
