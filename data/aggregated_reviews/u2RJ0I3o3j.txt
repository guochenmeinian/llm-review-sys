Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents PLANE, a graph neural network designed to be complete on planar graphs, inspired by the KHC algorithm. The authors argue that while general graphs are challenging to separate, planar graphs can be efficiently handled, making a complete algorithm for these graphs valuable. The framework is based on the graph isomorphism algorithm for planar graphs, allowing for the efficient learning of complete invariants. The authors claim that their approach closes a significant gap in graph machine learning literature by achieving completeness guarantees that cannot be obtained merely by detecting biconnected or triconnected components. Empirical results demonstrate promising performance on planar graph benchmarks, and the algorithm achieves linear runtime, which is a notable improvement over existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation for finding complete invariants for planar graphs is well-articulated, and the method achieves good empirical results.
2. The framework efficiently learns isomorphism-complete invariant functions, balancing algorithmic efficiency and representation power.
3. Extensive experiments validate the proposed framework's effectiveness on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
4. The authors provide additional experiments, including time complexity analysis, which enhances the understanding of the algorithm's performance.
5. The theoretical and empirical evidence presented supports the claim of completeness over planar graphs.

Weaknesses:
1. The algorithm is technically complex and difficult to understand, lacking clarity in presentation, particularly in sections 4 and 5.
2. The novelty of the approach is questioned, as it appears to leverage existing algorithms like KHC without significant new insights or contributions.
3. There is skepticism regarding the algorithm's ability to distinguish planar graphs without preprocessing components, with some reviewers believing that similar results could be achieved using biconnected components alone.
4. The experimental results are insufficient to convincingly demonstrate the method's advantages over state-of-the-art models, and comparisons with more expressive models are lacking.
5. The paper does not provide a comprehensive complexity analysis or sufficient details on hyperparameter tuning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of sections 4 and 5 by providing a pseudocode illustration of the algorithm. Additionally, the authors should discuss the impact of the top-down graph decomposition method on runtime and computational complexity. It would be beneficial to include comparisons with other expressive models, such as 3-WL GNN and PF-FGNN, to highlight the advantages of PLANE. Furthermore, we suggest conducting a thorough hyperparameter tuning for all methods to ensure fair comparisons. Lastly, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions by explicitly detailing the non-trivial aspects of their algorithm's design in relation to KHC and provide more concrete examples or counter-examples demonstrating how their approach distinguishes planar graphs beyond what is achievable through existing methods.
