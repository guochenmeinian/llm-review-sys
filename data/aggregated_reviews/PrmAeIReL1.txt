### Key Points
This paper presents a novel theoretical framework, MER-Inspector, for assessing model extraction risks, significantly contributing to machine learning security. The framework integrates a new metric, Model Recovery Complexity (MRC), with Victim Model Accuracy (VMA) to evaluate risks associated with model extraction attacks (MEAs). The authors employ Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory to formulate these metrics, providing a solid theoretical foundation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed metrics across various model architectures and datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper innovatively analyzes model extraction risks through an attack-agnostic lens, filling gaps in existing research.
- The application of NTK theory to derive theoretical bounds for MEAs enhances understanding of model extraction risks.
- Comprehensive experimental validation demonstrates the robustness and effectiveness of the MER-Inspector framework.

Weaknesses:
- The threat model assumes attackers have access to all existing black-box models and unlabeled training samples, which may be overly optimistic.
- The reliance on NTK theory, which primarily applies to infinite-width networks, raises questions about the applicability to finite-width networks commonly used in practice.
- The description of how MRC and VMA metrics complement each other is insufficiently detailed, lacking concrete examples.
- There is limited discussion on how the risk assessments can inform the design and evaluation of defense strategies against MEAs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the applicability of NTK theory to finite-width networks and provide insights into how their findings might differ in practical scenarios. Additionally, a more detailed analysis of the computational costs associated with the MRC approximation algorithm, along with potential optimizations, would enhance the feasibility of their approach. The authors should also consider expanding their analysis to include a broader range of attack vectors to ensure the robustness of their metrics across various threat models. Finally, elaborating on how the risk assessment framework could be integrated into defense mechanisms or used to evaluate existing defenses against MEAs would add significant value to the paper.
