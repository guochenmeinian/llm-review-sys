Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CoHeat, a method for addressing the cold-start bundle recommendation problem by leveraging user-bundle and user-item representations. The authors propose a popularity-based coalescence strategy, which combines scores from both views, particularly emphasizing user-item scores for less popular bundles. Additionally, the model employs curriculum learning and contrastive learning to enhance the alignment of user and bundle representations. Comprehensive experiments validate CoHeat's performance improvements over baseline methods in both cold and warm settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The writing is clear and the overview of CoHeat is well-articulated.
- The problem addressed is significant and relevant in practical applications.
- Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial performance improvements compared to baselines.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks comparisons with two state-of-the-art baselines in the warm setting.
- The experimental analysis is insufficient, requiring further exploration of key modules.
- There is a need for more discussion on cold-start scenarios, particularly regarding cold-start items.
- The generalizability of CoHeat to different bundle types and larger datasets is unclear.
- The novelty of the method is questioned, as similar approaches have been previously explored.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including comparisons with the following state-of-the-art baselines: 
1. Distillation-Enhanced Graph Masked Autoencoders for Bundle Recommendation. Ren et al. SIGIR 2023
2. Strategy-aware Bundle Recommender System. Wei et al. SIGIR 2023

Additionally, we suggest that the authors conduct a more thorough analysis of the key modules to provide a comprehensive evaluation. It would also be beneficial to include discussions on more cold-start scenarios, such as cold-start items, and clarify how CoHeat generalizes across different bundle types and scales with larger datasets.

Furthermore, we recommend enhancing the introduction by mentioning the popularity-based coalescence, as it is a key insight of the proposed method. The authors should also address the triviality of the lemmas in Section 3 and clarify the reasons behind the first row (CoHear-PC) of Table 4 being all zeros. Lastly, we encourage the authors to consider evaluating the proposed method using nDCG@5/10 to assess its performance in top-ranked product recommendations.
