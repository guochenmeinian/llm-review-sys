### Key Points
This paper presents a new large-scale benchmark for Open Information Extraction (OIE) to Knowledge Graph (KG) linking, assessing performance at a granular triple slot level. The benchmark includes multifaceted evaluation protocols and several baselines, focusing on transductive and inductive fact linking, polysemous fact linking, and out-of-KG detection. The authors demonstrate that current baselines can detect out-of-KG entities, though detecting out-of-KG relations remains challenging.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The benchmark covers multiple aspects of OIE to KG linking and includes out-of-KG detection.
- Evaluation with various baselines is provided.
- The paper is clearly presented and well-written.

Weaknesses:
- The setup is artificial, relying solely on triple slots without contextual sentence usage.
- Baselines are weak, lacking context sentence integration.
- Data augmentation is applied at the triple level rather than the sentence level, limiting the use of source sentences.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the realism of their setup by incorporating context sentences in the linking process. Additionally, the authors should strengthen their baselines by including models that utilize context sentences. We also suggest that the authors clarify the novelty of their framework and provide a clearer comparison with existing datasets like T-Rex and ReVerb45K. Furthermore, addressing the potential for shortcut learning in data augmentation and the handling of polysemous entities would enhance the robustness of their approach.
