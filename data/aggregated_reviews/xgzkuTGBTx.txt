Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of random feature (RF) regression in high-dimensional settings, comparing the variance of Bayesian posterior distributions to that of the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimator. The authors compute the high-dimensional asymptotic of the Bayesian posterior variance and find it aligns with the MAP estimator's variance under certain conditions, particularly when optimal L2 regularization is non-vanishing. They conjecture that the fluctuations of these observables are Gaussian distributed with non-overlapping support around the interpolation threshold.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The authors effectively compare Bayesian and frequentist variance-like observables, providing a novel characterization and interesting numerical observations that lead to new conjectures.  
- The results contribute to understanding the relationship between Bayesian credible sets and frequentist confidence sets, particularly in high-dimensional contexts.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks clarity in several areas, with many details needing improvement.  
- There is no code provided for reproducing the figures, which limits the paper's accessibility.  
- The main proof appears to be a minor variation of existing work, which may obscure the authors' technical contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their presentation by numbering all equations for easier reference.  
- The authors should clearly define $p(y | x, \Theta, a$) between lines 103 and 104, specifying its relationship to the equation between lines 95-96.  
- We suggest adding the missing subscript $i$ for the data point $x$ between lines 105 and 106.  
- The reference to Eq 5 on line 106 may be incorrect; the authors should clarify whether they meant Eq 4 or intended to indicate that the Gaussian measure is centered around $\hat{a}$.  
- We recommend deriving the equation between lines 113 and 114 in the main text or appendix, as its origin is not immediately clear.  
- The authors should define the marginal likelihood and clarify the source of Eq 10 on line 123.  
- We suggest revising the unclear paragraph between lines 183-190 to specify whether "The second point" refers to the full Proposition 2 or just part of it.  
- The authors should explicitly justify the coincidence of equations between lines 207-208 and 176-177 in the second regime.  
- We recommend improving the captions and legends for Figures 1 and 2 for clarity, particularly regarding the representation of curves and error bars.  
- The authors should clarify the sources of disorder causing fluctuations in Figure 3.  
- We suggest addressing the potential misunderstanding regarding Proposition 4, point 1, on lines 285-287.  
- We recommend correcting the possible typo on line 216 regarding $+\alpha$.  
- The authors should clarify the assumptions regarding the instances $x_i$ in their model and ensure consistent notation throughout the manuscript.
