Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an approach to enhance the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm for differentially private (DP) regression on sparse data. The authors propose a modified algorithm that significantly reduces training time and improves algorithmic complexity from linear to sub-linear. The proposed methods leverage appropriate data structures, such as a Fibonacci queue and a big-step little-step sampler, to handle sparse inputs effectively. Empirical results indicate a performance improvement of up to 30x on large datasets, particularly under high privacy requirements.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed data structures effectively manage sparse data for DP-FW, leading to improved computational complexity.
- The paper is well-written, with clear delineation of algorithms and substantial commentary, showcasing versatility and significant performance improvements.
- Empirical results demonstrate a notable speed-up in practical applications.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a comparison with other data structures, such as locality-sensitive hashing, and does not provide proven error bounds or discuss potential accuracy trade-offs.
- The explanation of the algorithms is at times confusing, with technical terms introduced before being defined, and the paper lacks clarity in figures and captions.
- There is insufficient discussion on utility guarantees and the theoretical dependence of the proposed method on various parameters.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the algorithm explanations and definitions of technical terms, perhaps by including additional discussions in an appendix. It would be beneficial to provide a comparison with other relevant data structures and to include proven error bounds for the proposed methods. Additionally, the authors should clarify how their algorithm satisfies the DP condition and explore alternative privacy accounting methods that could enhance performance. Finally, addressing the theoretical guarantees regarding utility and performance in relation to existing methods would strengthen the contribution of the paper.
