### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach called the Heterogeneous Graph Co-Attention Network (HetCAN) for corporate default risk assessment, particularly for small companies facing financial risks. The authors identify two main challenges: the presence of noise in financial graphs and the issue of transitive default risk. To address these, they introduce a co-attention mechanism based on collaborative metapaths and employ pairwise importance learning to model multiple semantic connections, thereby reducing noise effects. The paper includes extensive empirical evaluations demonstrating the model's effectiveness on real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper identifies significant challenges in default risk assessment and proposes a sound methodology to address them.
- It conducts thorough experiments and ablation studies, showing the proposed model's superiority over existing methods, particularly in predicting defaults for small companies.
- The case study effectively illustrates the model's application and interpretability through visualizations of attention weights.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity on the definition and extraction of metapaths from financial graphs, which may confuse readers.
- There is insufficient comparison with state-of-the-art methods in corporate default risk assessment, limiting the evaluation's robustness.
- The assumption of complete and accurate graph data may not reflect real-world scenarios, and the paper does not discuss potential limitations or drawbacks of the proposed approach.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definition of metapaths and provide detailed explanations on how to extract them from financial graphs. Additionally, including more comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods would strengthen the evaluation of the proposed approach. We suggest addressing the limitations of the model, particularly regarding data completeness and accuracy, and discussing how these could impact risk assessment. Finally, providing insights into the model's scalability, hyperparameter sensitivity, and interpretability would enhance the paper's contribution to the field.
