### Key Points
This paper presents a study on fair online bilateral trade, where a platform posts prices for an item based on the private valuations of a buyer and seller. The objective is to maximize the minimum utility of both parties, differing from previous work that focused on total utility. The authors explore various valuation regimes, including deterministic and stochastic settings, and provide bounds on regret for each case. Notably, they establish a linear lower bound in the stochastic case with dependent valuations and an upper bound of $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ for independent valuations, utilizing the Convolution Lemma. In deterministic scenarios, they achieve a tight regret bound of $\Theta(\ln(T))$, while in full information settings, they demonstrate an $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem is well-motivated and presents a clear distinction from prior work.
- The paper is comprehensive, providing both upper and lower bounds across multiple valuation assumptions.
- The presentation is clear, with rigorous theorem statements and proof sketches enhancing understanding.

Weaknesses:
- Section 1's structure complicates comprehension; a clearer division into introduction, related work, and contributions would be beneficial.
- The paper lacks a discussion on practical applications of fair online bilateral trade, which would enhance its relevance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the structure of Section 1 by splitting it into distinct parts to clarify the main contributions. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion on potential applications of fair online bilateral trade to provide context for the objective function. A summary table of rates across different settings would also aid reader comprehension, given the paper's density.
