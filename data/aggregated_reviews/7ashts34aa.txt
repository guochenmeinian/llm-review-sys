### Key Points
This paper presents a measurement method to identify 1-day rug pull serial scammers in Ethereum and BSC, reconstructing scam networks and estimating scammers' profits more accurately. It analyzes rug-pull scams on Uniswap and Pancakeswap V2, defining key scam patterns such as star-shaped, chain-shaped, and majority-flow clusters to illustrate how serial scammers organize multiple scams. The authors conduct a large-scale analysis of 356,295 pools and 343,637 tokens on Uniswap, and 1,694,058 pools and 1,510,774 tokens on Pancakeswap, identifying 161,339 scam pools and 145,654 unique scammers on Uniswap, and 32,336 scam pools and 18,346 unique scammers on Pancakeswap. The method addresses gaps in existing research by uncovering multi-hop wash trading activities and providing a network-aware profit formula that accounts for wash-trading expenses.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides novel insights into coordinated rug pull schemes and develops methodologies to identify and analyze scam patterns.
- It fills important research gaps by demonstrating connections between seemingly independent scams.
- The large-scale analysis of scam pools and tokens offers valuable data for understanding scammer behavior.

Weaknesses:
- Limited experimental evaluation and absence of comparison with existing methods hinder the depth of insights.
- The focus is restricted to 1-day rug pulls, excluding longer-duration scams, and the time period of data collection is not clearly specified.
- The reliance on predefined patterns and fixed thresholds raises concerns about generalizability and robustness, particularly in identifying complex scammer interactions.
- The paper lacks concrete recommendations for scam prevention and does not explore mitigation strategies in depth.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental evaluation by including a large-scale analysis of scam profits to provide deeper insights into the broader economic impact of rug-pull scams. Additionally, the authors should benchmark their approach against existing techniques to validate its effectiveness. Clarifying the rationale behind the thresholds used in their methods and providing a comprehensive discussion on the implications of their findings for scam prevention would enhance the paper's contribution. We also suggest revising the introduction to focus on primary research questions and improving the quality of figures and tables. Finally, addressing the concerns regarding the robustness of the clustering method and the potential for false positives in address identification would strengthen the paper.
