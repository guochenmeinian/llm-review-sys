### Key Points
This paper investigates the performance of the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) for testing the independence of two random vectors, particularly in high-dimensional scenarios where existing theory is limited. The authors present convergence rates for HSIC as dimensions increase and demonstrate its ability to measure nonlinear dependence. They show that the rescaled HSIC converges in distribution to a standard normal distribution under the null hypothesis and outline conditions for achieving nontrivial power in high dimensions. The theoretical findings are supported by simulations and real-world data from the US stock market.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well-structured, presenting strong theoretical insights and convincing numerical support. Theorem 1 alleviates the need for permutation tests to determine critical values, which is a significant advantage. The phase transition of convergence rates in Theorem 3 is particularly illuminating.

Weaknesses:  
Some conditions in the theory are stringent, raising questions about their applicability to real-world problems. The choice of isotropic kernels is a strong restriction, potentially limiting the practical utility of the results. Additionally, the paper may not be self-contained for non-specialists, as it lacks clear definitions of technical concepts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the differences between their theory and that of the 2021 paper by Gao et al. in the Annals of Statistics, particularly regarding technical tools and levels of difficulty. We suggest that the authors provide a more comprehensive discussion on the implications of kernel choice, especially the effect of changing \(\gamma\) in Theorem 3. Additionally, we encourage the authors to make the paper more accessible to non-specialists by defining technical terms and providing a clearer motivation for the choice of kernel functions. Lastly, a comparison with other methods, such as distance correlation, could enhance the understanding of HSIC's performance.
