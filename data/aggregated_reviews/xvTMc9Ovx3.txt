### Key Points
This paper presents a new large-scale dataset named Traffic Object Importance (TOI) aimed at addressing the problem of on-road object importance estimation using video sequences from the driver's perspective. The authors propose a model that integrates multi-fold top-down guidance factors—driver intention, semantic context, and traffic rules—with bottom-up features. The dataset is significantly larger than existing datasets, and the proposed method effectively models the impact of traffic rules on object importance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of the TOI dataset provides a robust foundation for training and evaluating models in on-road object importance estimation, addressing a major limitation in the field.
2. The proposed model integrates various top-down guidance factors with bottom-up features, demonstrating good performance for the TOI task.
3. The paper describes the methodology and model structure in detail, contributing to the understanding of on-road object importance estimation.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a detailed discussion on the computational efficiency of the proposed method, which is crucial for real driving scenarios.
2. Insufficient evaluation of indicators in the experimental section; the authors should consider adding another evaluation metric.
3. The annotation process details are lacking, including the number of annotators and their familiarity with traffic rules, which raises concerns about label quality.
4. The definition of object importance is not sufficiently clear, particularly regarding the treatment of nearby pedestrians and their categorization.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the computational efficiency of the proposed method and compare model parameters and latency with other methods. Additionally, the authors should clarify the annotation process by providing details on the number of annotators involved and their familiarity with traffic rules. We suggest adding more statistics about the dataset, such as the number of important objects in different categories, and consider building a benchmark using existing object detection methods like YOLO. Furthermore, the authors should elaborate on the definition of object importance and how various driver intentions are represented within the dataset.
