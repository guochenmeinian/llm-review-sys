Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents TRACER, a Bayesian methodology designed to learn robust policies from offline datasets affected by various data corruptions. TRACER utilizes Bayesian inference to model uncertainty in the action-value function and employs an entropy-based uncertainty measure to differentiate between corrupted and clean data. The methodology aims to reduce the influence of corrupted data, thereby enhancing the robustness of learned policies. Experimental results demonstrate that TRACER outperforms state-of-the-art methods in managing both individual and simultaneous data corruptions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an important problem and proposes a compelling solution.
- Theoretical guarantees are provided, supporting the methodology.
- Extensive experimental validation shows consistent performance improvements across multiple tasks and corruption types.

Weaknesses:
- The complexity of the method, which incorporates various components like distributional value functions and variational inference, may hinder practical application.
- The contribution compared to existing methods, particularly RIQL, is unclear, especially regarding handling simultaneous corruptions.
- Readability issues arise from insufficient explanations of key equations and missing implementation details.
- The analysis of experimental results lacks depth, particularly regarding the accuracy of corrupted data measurements during training.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing, particularly in Equations 10 and 11, by providing necessary explanations and insights. Additionally, the authors should expand the related work section to include important references [1,2], which discuss credal Bayesian deep learning and its relevance to the proposed methodology. It would also be beneficial to simplify the method to enhance its practical applicability. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors provide a computational cost comparison with prior work and clarify the contribution of TRACER relative to RIQL, especially in the context of simultaneous corruptions. Lastly, addressing the observed decrease in accuracy for corrupted data during training would strengthen the analysis.
