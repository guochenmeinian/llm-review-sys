Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents OpenMask3D, a zero-shot approach for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation that predicts 3D object instance masks and their categories. The authors address the limitations of traditional closed-vocabulary methods, which are constrained by predefined object categories, by utilizing class-agnostic 3D instance masks and CLIP-based image embeddings for mask-feature aggregation. The method shows superiority over closed-vocabulary counterparts and has potential applications in robotics, augmented reality, scene understanding, and 3D visual search.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors propose OpenMask3D as the first zero-shot approach for open-world 3D instance segmentation, demonstrating originality in problem formulation and model architecture.
- The methodology is clearly presented, allowing for easy understanding, and includes comprehensive experimental evaluations on common benchmark datasets with insightful ablation studies.
- Results indicate that OpenMask3D outperforms other methods, particularly in scenarios with a long-tail distribution of objects.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation is limited to a single dataset, ScanNet200, which may restrict the generalizability of findings; broader evaluation across multiple datasets is needed.
- The long pipeline of OpenMask3D, comprising multiple stages, may introduce computational complexity, affecting efficiency and real-time applicability.
- There is a lack of thorough comparison regarding computational costs and inference speed between OpenMask3D and existing methods.
- Section 4.1's structure is problematic as it combines closed-set and open-vocabulary instance segmentation results, leading to potential confusion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by evaluating OpenMask3D on multiple datasets, including those with varying object distributions. Additionally, a more concise pipeline design could enhance the model's efficiency and real-time applicability. It would be beneficial to include a comprehensive comparison of computational resources and inference speed between OpenMask3D and existing methods. Furthermore, we suggest reorganizing Section 4.1 for clarity and providing a more detailed analysis of the limitations of OpenMask3D, including potential directions for future work.
