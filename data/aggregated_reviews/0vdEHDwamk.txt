Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the "Lovasz Principle," an unsupervised or semi-supervised graph representation learning approach inspired by the Lovasz number. The authors motivate the use of this principle and discuss related work extensively. They evaluate the Lovasz Principle against various established graph representation learners, demonstrating superior performance across multiple experiments. The method incorporates handle vectors to capture global graph features and employs a neural network for optimization, addressing computational challenges associated with traditional methods. Additionally, the authors propose a method for approximating the Lovasz number using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), arguing that the handle vector captures the global structure of a graph and serves as a natural representation. While the Lovasz number is polynomial-time computable, the authors acknowledge the current inability to prove that it can be exactly solved by a GNN. They also discuss the use of spectral embedding and the Lovasz-ϑ kernel to enhance graph representation learning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents compelling arguments with intuitive explanations.
- The derivation of the Lovasz Principle is clearly laid out.
- The experimental setup is robust, showing consistent performance improvements over various datasets, with variants of the Lovasz Principle achieving the best scores.
- The Lovasz Principle is simpler and faster than InfoMax, as it does not require a discriminator for the Jensen-Shannon MI estimator.
- The authors provide a clear explanation of the handle vector's role in capturing graph structure.
- The paper demonstrates promising experimental results, showing that the GNN's predictions for the Lovasz number are close to those from exact solvers.

Weaknesses:
- The authors mention the non-uniqueness of $U_i*$ and $c_i*$ but do not empirically demonstrate the similarity of representations for similar graphs.
- There is a lack of empirical evidence showing that $\mathcal{F}_W$ approximates $(U_i*, c_i*)$ effectively.
- The paper could benefit from moving footnotes to captions for better readability.
- Hyperparameter sensitivity is discussed in the supplementary material but not in the main text, which could mislead readers regarding their impact on performance.
- No code is provided for reproducibility.
- There is a lack of intuitive explanation regarding why the method is effective and why the Lovasz number is chosen over other graph properties.
- The authors' claim that GNNs can learn to solve for the Lovasz number is based on experimental evidence rather than theoretical proof, raising skepticism about the GNN's capability to express the solution.
- The motivation for adapting the spectral embedding idea is inadequately explained.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical demonstration of the similarity of representations for similar graphs by computing $c*$ for various graph pairs. Additionally, we suggest that the authors empirically validate whether $\mathcal{F}_W$ serves as a good approximator for $(U_i*, c_i*)$ by comparing it with $\mathcal{A}(G_i)$. To enhance readability, we recommend relocating the footnote from page 4 to the caption of Table 1. It would also be beneficial to include a discussion of hyperparameter sensitivity in the main text, as this significantly affects performance. Lastly, we urge the authors to provide code for reproducibility to strengthen the paper's credibility. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the intuitive explanation of why their method works effectively and clarify the rationale for focusing on the Lovasz number instead of other graph properties. We also suggest that the authors provide a theoretical proof or a counterexample to substantiate their claims regarding the GNN's ability to express the Lovasz number, and elaborate on the motivation behind the adaptation of the spectral embedding idea to strengthen their argument.
