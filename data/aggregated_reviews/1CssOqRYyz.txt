### Key Points
This paper presents Diff-PCC, the first diffusion-based point cloud compression method. It employs a dual-space latent representation with two independent encoding backbones to extract expressive shape latents. A diffusion-based generator is utilized for high-quality reconstructions, achieving state-of-the-art compression performance, including a 7.711 dB BD-PSNR gain against the latest G-PCC standard at ultra-low bitrates. The authors claim superior subjective quality and demonstrate improvements over existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The novelty of using diffusion models for point cloud compression is a significant strength, as it is the first application of this approach in this domain.  
- The manuscript is well-structured and easy to follow, with a solid introduction to related works in image and point cloud compression.  
- The performance improvements on sparse point clouds are notable.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks comprehensive comparisons with commonly used compression methods, particularly for dense point clouds, limiting the evaluation's robustness.  
- The motivation for using diffusion models is questioned, as their sampling-based nature may lead to variability in decompressed results.  
- The method's performance is inadequately compared to advanced techniques like CNet and SparsePCGC, and the evaluation is restricted to simpler datasets.  
- The measurement of speed in Table 1 is unclear, and additional details on hardware and command line should be included in the supplementary material.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with more established methods, including PCGC, PCGCv2, and 3QNet, to strengthen the evaluation. Additionally, the authors should explore the performance of their method on more complex and dense shapes, such as those in the 8iVFB and RWTT datasets. Addressing the uncertainty inherent in diffusion models through experiments on the variance of decompressed results would clarify the appropriateness of this framework for point cloud compression. Furthermore, providing clarity on how speed is measured and including hardware specifications in the supplementary material would enhance the manuscript's rigor. Lastly, correcting minor typographical errors and ensuring accurate references will improve the overall quality of the paper.
