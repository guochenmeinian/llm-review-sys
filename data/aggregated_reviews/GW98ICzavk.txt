### Key Points
This paper presents an item-aligned federated recommendation model designed for new item cold-start recommendations. It learns two item representations based on interactions and item attributes, aligning them during training to infer new items using their attributes. The method operates within a federated learning framework, preserving user interaction data privacy and securing item attributes against malicious use, a rarely explored aspect in federated recommendation research. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms both centralized and federated baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses the challenging cold-start recommendation task while ensuring privacy, presenting a novel approach that prompts further exploration in federated learning.
2. The method effectively utilizes cold item attributes for inference, making it intuitive and easy to follow.
3. The proposed model shows substantial performance improvements over various baselines and demonstrates robustness to system noise.
4. The paper is well-organized, with clear clarifications and a solid experimental evaluation.

Weaknesses:
1. The definition of federated cold-start recommendation in the preliminary section does not adequately reflect the federated learning framework, lacking explicit distinction from centralized models.
2. The scalability of the proposed method for large-scale datasets is not thoroughly discussed.
3. There are typographical errors, such as inconsistent naming of the item representation alignment mechanism in table captions.
4. Related works lack sufficient citations for collaborative filtering, content-based, and hybrid models, leading to less informative context.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the definition of federated cold-start recommendation in the preliminary section to clearly distinguish it from centralized models. Additionally, we suggest discussing potential deployment issues, particularly regarding the management of numerous new items and ensuring high-quality representations for local model inference. The authors should also address the scalability of their method for large datasets and correct typographical errors. Furthermore, clarifying the notation system in the paper, especially in Figure 2, would enhance understanding. Lastly, the authors should consider providing insights into the training and inference efficiency of the proposed framework.
