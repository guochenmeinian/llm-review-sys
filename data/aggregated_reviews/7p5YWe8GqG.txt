### Key Points
This paper presents a novel methodology for capturing long-range interactions in graph-based learning models through multi-scale graph construction and merging. The authors introduce a pooling method called S-EdgePool, which generalizes EdgePool, and utilize the MeGraph framework for merging inter-graph and intra-graph connections. Extensive experimentation across over 10 datasets demonstrates the solid performance of the MeGraph framework, particularly in tasks requiring both shallow and deeper architectures. Additionally, a new benchmark, the Graph Theory Benchmark, is proposed to evaluate the model's prediction capabilities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed framework is fairly novel and addresses the important long-range interaction problem in graph learning.
2. The hierarchical pooling and merging methodology is interesting and intuitive, despite some existing similar approaches.
3. Extensive experimentation suggests strong performance of the MeGraph framework across a broad set of datasets.
4. The introduction of the Graph Theory Benchmark provides a useful tool for evaluation.
5. The paper is clearly written, though clarity could be improved in the contributions section.
6. The problem addressed by MeGraph is significant due to the limitations of existing graph neural network architectures.

Weaknesses:
1. Concerns exist regarding the computational complexity of the model, particularly with pooling, merging, and message passing.
2. The model has a high number of trainable parameters, and further investigation into the parameters of the modules is needed.
3. There is insufficient theoretical insight into how the multi-scale method captures long-range interactions, which undermines the model's justification.
4. The paper lacks a discussion of the hierarchies discovered by MeGraph for specific datasets/tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the contributions section to enhance reader understanding. Additionally, providing theoretical motivations for the combination of the SRC framework with the MeGraph framework would strengthen the paper. Investigating the computational complexity and exploring potential improvements to balance parameter space with training time is essential. Furthermore, extending the Graph Theory Benchmark to include larger graphs and those with clustering or hierarchical patterns would be beneficial. Lastly, including a discussion on the hierarchies discovered by MeGraph could provide valuable insights into the method's workings.
