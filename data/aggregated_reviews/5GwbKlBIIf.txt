Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical framework for training analog systems using resistive memories, specifically addressing the issue of weight update asymmetry in resistive devices. The authors develop a model for weight dynamics under “Analog SGD,” demonstrating that it does not converge due to asymptotic errors. They propose the Tiki-Taka algorithm, which shows improved convergence properties by eliminating these errors and converging to critical points, supported by simulations. The paper emphasizes the importance of developing theoretical models for analog computing to enhance understanding and efficiency compared to digital neural networks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The topic is crucial for advancing energy-efficient analog computing.
- The paper is clear, well-organized, and presents thorough theoretical foundations.
- Empirical simulations validate the theoretical claims, showing Tiki-Taka's superiority over Analog SGD.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical analysis relies on models and assumptions that may not accurately reflect real-world behavior, with insufficient discussion on their validity.
- The paper assumes backpropagation for weight gradient computation, overlooking alternative methods explored in neuromorphic computing.
- Experimental results are limited to small datasets and a single network type, raising questions about generalizability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the validity of their models and assumptions, clarifying which are widely accepted and which are debated within the community. Including alternative gradient-descent-based algorithms from recent literature would enhance the paper's impact. Additionally, expanding experimental results to include larger datasets like ImageNet and various network architectures would strengthen the findings. Finally, elaborating on how computations can be realized on analog devices and comparing their efficiency to digital devices would provide valuable insights.
