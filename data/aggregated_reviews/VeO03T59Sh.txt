Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for uncertainty quantification in learned dynamics models using conformal prediction, aimed at enhancing sequential decision-making tasks such as planning in various environments. The authors propose a framework that integrates diffusion models for learning dynamics and employs conformal prediction to quantify uncertainty, demonstrating its effectiveness on D4RL benchmarks and other tasks. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms baselines lacking uncertainty quantification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of planners with diffusion models is an innovative approach.
- The methodology provides a robust framework for quantifying and mitigating uncertainties in dynamics models.
- The paper is generally well-written, with a clear problem statement and intuitive evaluation metrics.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks comparisons to other uncertainty quantification methods, particularly within the offline RL literature.
- Clarity issues exist in Sections 3.3 and 3.4, and the overall presentation could be improved.
- The experimental results are not compelling, lacking systematic evaluation of uncertainty and comparisons to state-of-the-art methods.
- The distinction between planning and reinforcement learning is not adequately addressed, leading to confusion regarding the paper's contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity in Sections 3.3 and 3.4, and consider including comparisons to established uncertainty estimation methods in model-based RL. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the discussion of the experimental results, particularly regarding the significance of the findings and the implications of using conformal prediction. It would be beneficial to provide more details on the computational aspects of the proposed framework and to clarify the role of expert trajectories and the calibration process in the methodology. Lastly, we encourage the authors to refine the writing for grammatical accuracy and clarity throughout the paper.
