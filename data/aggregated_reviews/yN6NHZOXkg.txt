Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new framework for unsupervised multi-view learning grounded in information bottleneck theory. The authors define three desiderata for multi-view representation learning—comprehensiveness, concentrate, and cross-diversity—while introducing a clustering term to maintain the original data structure. By employing deep neural networks and stochastic gradient variational Bayes, the method is evaluated across four real-world datasets, demonstrating superior clustering performance compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a principled information-theoretic framework for multi-view clustering without relying on strict semantic consistency assumptions.
- It innovatively combines information theory with multi-view clustering, providing solid theoretical foundations and detailed proofs.

Weaknesses:
- The authors need to clarify how their definitions of comprehensiveness, concentrate, and cross-diversity differ from those in Completer [22].
- The loss function comprises four terms, and ablation studies are necessary to demonstrate the contribution of each term.
- Guidance on selecting the balance parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$ for different datasets is lacking.
- The definition of robustness in relation to the proposed information bottleneck theory is not provided.
- The experimental evaluation is limited in scope, using small datasets and outdated comparison baselines, which diminishes the results' persuasiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by elaborating on the distinctions between their definitions and those in existing literature. Conducting ablation studies to assess the necessity of each term in the loss function would enhance the paper's contribution. Additionally, providing theoretical or empirical guidance for the selection of balance parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$ is essential. The authors should also define robustness in the context of their framework and clarify the differences between $\mathbf{Z}^{(v)}$ and $\mathbf{Z}$ in Eq. (4). Finally, expanding the experimental evaluation to include larger and more challenging datasets, as well as updating comparison baselines, would strengthen the paper's findings.
