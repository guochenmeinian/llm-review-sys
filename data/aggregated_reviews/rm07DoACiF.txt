### Key Points
This paper presents LLM-BS, a decoder-only LLM-based generative recommendation framework that integrates endogenous and exogenous behavioral and semantic information. The framework employs a high compression ratio to derive semantic indices and introduces a non-invasive multi-scale alignment reconstruction task, alongside multi-stage training, to enhance the understanding of recommendation data. The authors propose an annealing adapter to balance textual reasoning and recommendation accuracy. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate performance improvements.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The presentation is clear and the research topic is timely and relevant to the community.
2. The proposed method shows performance improvement across multiple datasets, supported by convincing ablation studies.
3. The integration of behavioral signals into the semantic codebooks is intuitively effective.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty is limited, as the framework largely combines existing techniques without significant innovation.
2. The methodology is overly complex, lacking clear explanations for key components like the Global Contrast Decompression Task and the annealing adapter.
3. There is no hyperparameter sensitivity analysis, and the high compression ratio raises concerns about information loss and scalability.
4. The empirical claims regarding performance superiority lack sufficient evidence and clarity, particularly concerning the integration of signals and computational efficiency.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology section by providing more intuitive explanations and examples for complex components. Additionally, we suggest conducting a hyperparameter sensitivity analysis to explore the effects of different combinations of $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$. To address scalability concerns, we encourage the authors to test the proposed approach on larger datasets and provide empirical evidence supporting the necessity of the high compression ratio. Finally, we advise including comparisons with a broader range of related methods to strengthen the claims regarding performance improvements.
