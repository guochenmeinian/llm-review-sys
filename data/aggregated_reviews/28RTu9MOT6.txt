Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to deep graph matching through the introduction of a positional reconstruction encoder-decoder (PR-EnDec) and an end-to-end graph matching network (PREGM). The authors claim that existing methods primarily focus on visual features while neglecting the spatial positioning of key points. The proposed model captures both spatial and visual features, utilizing a well-designed loss function for effective graph positional encoding. Experimental results demonstrate that PREGM outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The integration of spatial information alongside visual features is a compelling enhancement, as existing methods largely overlook this aspect.
2. The proposed method shows superior performance compared to current state-of-the-art techniques on various datasets.
3. The manuscript is well-structured and easy to comprehend.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the approach may be overstated, as existing frameworks like BBGM already incorporate spatial information.
2. Not all baseline performances are reported in the experiments, raising questions about the completeness of the evaluation.
3. The experimental methods compared are somewhat outdated, and the datasets used are relatively small and older.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their claims regarding novelty by explicitly discussing how their spatial information differs from that of BBGM. Additionally, the authors should ensure that all baseline performances are included in the experimental results to provide a comprehensive evaluation. We suggest incorporating more recent large-scale datasets, such as PhotoTourism (IMC-PT) 2020, for a more robust comparison. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to enhance the paper's visualizations to better illustrate the model's performance and to revise the formatting of Tables 4 and 5 for improved clarity. Lastly, we recommend including a discussion on the limitations of the proposed method and its potential societal impacts to provide a more nuanced understanding of the work.
