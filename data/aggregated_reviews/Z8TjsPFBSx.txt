Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a systematic analysis of the interplay between weak supervision (WS) and semi-supervised learning (SSL), focusing on three axes: thresholding, SSL technique, and re-labeling. The authors conclude that while SSL can enhance WS, it is primarily beneficial in scenarios with low coverage of weak labels. The design space they propose allows for a thorough examination of existing methods, revealing that simpler techniques can match the performance of more complex ones. The findings indicate that SSL is not essential for optimal performance on most WS benchmarks, particularly when the labeling function is accurate.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a clear and systematic framework for analyzing the effects of SSL on WS, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of existing methods.
- Extensive empirical evaluations across multiple datasets provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of various approaches.
- The design space is shown to be robust, with simpler methods achieving competitive results against state-of-the-art techniques.

Weaknesses:
- The emphasis on SSL being unnecessary is questioned, as the results indicate SSL can still provide benefits in many cases.
- The analysis lacks theoretical underpinnings, relying heavily on empirical results from potentially non-representative datasets.
- The clarity of method descriptions is sometimes lacking, making it difficult to follow the proposed framework.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of method descriptions by including formalizations in the appendix to enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest conducting a more comprehensive analysis that includes competitive alternatives to Snorkel, such as FlyingSquid, and exploring the interaction of SSL with smoothness-based methods like LIGER. It would also be beneficial to clarify the conditions under which the labeling function must exceed random accuracy and to include ablation studies on labeling function accuracy. Lastly, we encourage the authors to consider the implications of their findings on real-world datasets and the potential for integrating augmentations in their analysis.
