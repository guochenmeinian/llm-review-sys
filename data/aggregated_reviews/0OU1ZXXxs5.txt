Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comparative analysis of neural network pruning and quantization, focusing on their performance under the same compression ratio. The authors employ statistical methods to evaluate the per-layer error and conduct empirical experiments on various models, concluding that post-training quantization generally outperforms pruning. The analysis includes theoretical insights into signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and kurtosis, alongside empirical evaluations on models from the PyTorch Model Zoo.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a comprehensive analysis of pruning versus quantization, integrating both theoretical and empirical perspectives.
- The use of a reasonable FP16 baseline and the connection made between kurtosis and quantization performance is noteworthy.
- The empirical evaluation spans multiple tasks, enhancing the robustness of the findings.

Weaknesses:
- The submission lacks novel algorithms or insights, primarily presenting a collection of empirical results.
- The experimental focus is limited to magnitude-based pruning and uniform quantization, which may not represent the broader landscape of compression techniques.
- The comparison methodology, which equates model sizes post-compression, raises questions about its appropriateness, as model size is not the sole factor in efficiency.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of the submission by incorporating a more diverse range of compression techniques beyond magnitude-based pruning and uniform quantization. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the analysis of statistical methods and their relationship to final performance metrics. It would also be beneficial to explicitly demonstrate the connection between the SNR metric and model accuracy, potentially by adding relevant figures or tables. Finally, considering the applicability of pruning and quantization in various scenarios, including hardware considerations and the potential impact on model robustness, would strengthen the paper's contributions.
