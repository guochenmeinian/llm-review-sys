Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for cardinality-aware top-k classification, addressing an important problem by formulating an optimization problem that incorporates the cardinality of set selectors. The authors generalize their approach to two types of surrogate losses and provide theoretical justifications under certain assumptions about the hypothesis set H. The paper also empirically evaluates the proposed algorithms on benchmark computer vision datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper tackles a significant problem and achieves commendable results, effectively transferring the cardinality-aware term into surrogate terms and demonstrating their sub-optimal properties theoretically.  
- The contribution is novel, identifying a new prediction problem with varying top-k set sizes and introducing two new surrogate loss functions for optimization.  
- Empirical results indicate that the proposed top-k predictors outperform existing methods that fix cardinalities a priori.  
- The paper is clearly presented and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:  
- The lack of error bars and limited evaluation weaken the findings, alongside strong assumptions on the hypothesis set that may be impractical.  
- The intractability of the original loss function compared to the surrogate loss needs clarification.  
- The abstract should better explain H-consistency and the introduced losses for clarity.  
- The experimental results section could be enhanced by analyzing additional aspects of the predictors, such as cardinality distributions and performance on harder examples.  
- The significance of the linear cost function in Figure 2 is unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the abstract by elaborating on H-consistency and the types of losses introduced. Additionally, please clarify why the cost-constrained surrogate loss is tractable while the original loss is not. We suggest including error bars in the results to indicate statistical significance and expanding the experimental analysis to consider other aspects of the predictors, such as the distribution of cardinalities and the relationship between example difficulty and prediction set size. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore simpler techniques for cardinality-varying top-k prediction as potential baselines.
