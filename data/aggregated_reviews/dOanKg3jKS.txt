Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel multi-band diffusion (MBD) model aimed at generating high-fidelity audio from low-bitrate discrete representations. The authors propose a band-specific diffusion model, a frequency equalizer processor, and a power noise scheduler, demonstrating that MBD outperforms existing methods like EnCodec and Opus in perceptual quality. The extensive experimental evaluations support the model's effectiveness across various audio domains.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a unique band-specific diffusion model that effectively reduces entangled errors in audio generation.
- The methodology includes a frequency equalizer and a power noise scheduler, both of which are validated through comprehensive experiments.
- The results indicate significant improvements in audio quality, showcasing the model's applicability in diverse audio tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for using a multi-band approach lacks clarity, particularly regarding its implementation on the hidden representations of EnCodec, which may not retain frequency information.
- The experiments are limited to EnCodec tokens, necessitating validation on vocoder tasks and comparisons with additional baselines such as SoundStream, bigvgan, hifigan, wavegrad, and multi-band MelGAN.
- There is insufficient analysis of computational costs and model sizes, particularly in comparison to EnCodec, raising concerns about the practicality of the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind the multi-band approach and provide a more detailed explanation of its implementation. Additionally, the authors should conduct experiments on vocoder tasks and include comparisons with a broader range of baselines to strengthen their claims. It would also be beneficial to include a thorough analysis of the computational costs and model sizes, particularly in relation to EnCodec, to provide a clearer understanding of the trade-offs involved.
