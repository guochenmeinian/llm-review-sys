Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a communication-efficient algorithm, FedNPG-ADMM, for federated natural policy gradient, reformulating the quadratic problem to reduce communication complexity from $\mathcal{O}(d^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(d)$. The authors provide convergence analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the method through experiments in MuJoCo. The proposed method combines ADMM with natural policy gradient, achieving a stationary convergence rate similar to FedNPG.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and clearly presented.
2. The reformulation of the original quadratic problem into a distributed manner is a smart move.
3. The reduction in communication complexity is significant, addressing a key bottleneck in federated learning.
4. The stationary convergence in the non-convex case is provided, matching the order of standard FedNPG.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper does not clearly discuss the impact of data heterogeneity on model performance in the federated learning context.
2. There is no local update step for each agent in the FedNPG-ADMM algorithm, raising questions about the potential for further communication cost reduction.
3. The experimental setting lacks comparable baselines, and the communication costs should be directly compared with other methods.
4. Some assumptions, such as the invertibility of the Hessian, may be too strong in practice.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on data heterogeneity and its effects on model performance in federated learning. Additionally, consider incorporating local update steps in the FedNPG-ADMM algorithm to explore further reductions in communication costs. We suggest providing direct comparisons of communication costs in the experimental results, including results with communication cost as the x-axis. Including additional baselines beyond FedNPG would enhance the analysis of communication efficiency. Lastly, clarify the assumptions made for convergence analysis and provide examples where these assumptions hold true.
