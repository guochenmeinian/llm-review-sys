Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method to accelerate the Best-of-N decoding process by pruning unpromising sequences early using a reward model to estimate rewards on partial utterances. The authors empirically demonstrate that the reward model's estimates for partial sentences correlate well with those for complete sentences, achieving a 2-8 times speedup with only a marginal drop in output quality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for improving inference efficiency in large language models (LLMs) is clearly articulated.
- The proposed method is simple, effective, and shows promising empirical results.

Weaknesses:
- The organization of the paper, particularly the related work section and discussions on the method's applicability, requires significant improvement.
- The experimental evaluation is limited to the AlpacaFarm-Eval dataset, raising concerns about the generalizability of the findings across different tasks and languages.
- The novelty of the Best-of-N method is questioned, as it may be considered outdated in decoding-time alignment.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the overall organization of the paper and expand the related work section to include various decoding strategies for LLMs. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more detailed discussion on the implications of using partial rewards and include empirical evidence to support their claims. It would also be beneficial to evaluate the proposed method on a broader range of datasets and tasks to assess its robustness across different contexts. Finally, we advise the authors to clarify the sampling process for prompts and ensure consistent terminology throughout the paper.
