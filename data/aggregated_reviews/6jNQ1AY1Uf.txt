Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Synthetic Experience Replay (SYNTHER), a novel diffusion-based approach aimed at enhancing the training dataset for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. The authors demonstrate that SYNTHER effectively improves performance in both offline and online settings, particularly for small datasets and larger networks. The method is compared to traditional augmentation strategies and shows promise in both state-based and pixel-based environments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of SYNTHER addresses data scarcity in RL, potentially impacting sample-efficient algorithms.
- The authors conduct thorough experiments, showcasing SYNTHER's effectiveness and its superiority over other generative models like GAN and VAE.
- The paper is well-structured, clearly written, and provides open-source code for reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- The performance improvement of SYNTHER appears limited with small networks.
- The number of seeds used in experiments is insufficient for reliable results; only four repetitions are noted.
- The paper lacks a detailed description of how the diffusion model generates data and misses some relevant references in the literature.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors validate their approach using the Antmaze D4RL datasets, as this domain presents greater challenges than those currently tested. Additionally, please run more seeds per experiment to enhance reliability and consider employing the methods from "Deep Reinforcement Learning at the Edge of the Statistical Precipice" (Agarwal et al., 2021) for better aggregation across tasks. We also suggest evaluating the hyperparameters for the generative models used, as the current settings may not be optimal for robotics interactions. Finally, please provide a clearer explanation of the diffusion model's application in data generation and address the missing references to enhance the paper's comprehensiveness.
