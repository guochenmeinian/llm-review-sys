### Key Points
This paper presents the LucidAction dataset, a multi-view, multi-level action quality assessment (AQA) dataset designed to address limitations in current AQA research, such as reliance on single-modality data and lack of generalizability. The dataset includes eight sports, four skill levels, and multi-modal data, comprising multi-view RGB videos and 2D/3D pose sequences, captured using a high-precision motion capture system. The data is meticulously annotated by professional gymnasts, providing a solid benchmark for AQA. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the dataset's complexity and the advantages of multi-modal data and fine-grained annotations for improving AQA performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is systematically collected and structured based on curriculum learning principles, featuring a three-tier hierarchical design across diverse sports events.
- Multi-modal data inclusion allows for accurate analysis of action quality, while fine-grained penalty-based score annotations enhance understanding and model robustness.
- The paper is well-structured, with clear communication of methodologies and experimental results, promoting transparency and reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset's collection in controlled environments may limit its applicability to real-world scenarios with varying conditions.
- Subjective biases may exist in scoring despite professional gymnast annotations.
- The current focus on gymnastics events restricts the dataset's broader applicability; expansion to other sports is needed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing by addressing areas that are long-winded or confusing, such as the narrative flow and specific technical details. Please clarify whether 2D or 3D ground truth is being collected, and provide information on the accuracy of the automatic 3D pose estimation pipeline. Additionally, we suggest including more details on how action sequences were collected and the criteria for gymnast expertise levels. Expanding the dataset to include a wider variety of sports would enhance its applicability. Lastly, we encourage the authors to address potential biases in the annotation process and discuss any ethical implications more thoroughly.
