Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method called MatrixIRLS to address the Euclidean Distance Geometry (EDG) problem, particularly when pairwise distances are partially observed. The authors propose an innovative algorithm based on iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) and provide a local convergence guarantee, ensuring accurate geometry recovery from minimal distance samples. The paper also establishes a restricted isometry property (RIP) relevant to non-convex approaches, with numerical experiments demonstrating the algorithm's efficiency and robustness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The method introduces a novel application of IRLS for non-convex optimization in EDG problems, with significant theoretical contributions including local convergence guarantees and RIP.
- The paper is well-researched, featuring rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical validation through synthetic and real-world datasets.
- It is well-structured and clearly written, making complex concepts accessible, and provides a complete anonymized code repository for reproducibility.

Weaknesses:  
- There are numerous typos and undefined notations that hinder readability, such as the undefined $\nu$ in line 66 and $\sigma_i(\cdot)$ in line 158.
- The practical impossibility of solving the rank minimization problem is not adequately addressed, and the paper appears to be an incremental update of previous work [KV21] without sufficient comparison.
- The experiments lack diversity in comparisons with newer methods and could benefit from more parameter and robustness analyses.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by addressing the numerous typos and undefined notations, particularly defining $\nu$ and $\sigma_i(\cdot)$ earlier. Additionally, we suggest rephrasing the rank minimization problem to allow for a polynomial solution and providing a more detailed discussion on global convergence properties. Including more diverse comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and enhancing the experimental analysis with parameter sensitivity would strengthen the evaluation of the proposed method. Finally, we encourage the authors to discuss the challenges of global convergence in Section 5 to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the algorithm's performance.
