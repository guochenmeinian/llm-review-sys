### Key Points
This paper presents a novel sampling method, *Gumbel Consistency Sampling* (GCS), aimed at enhancing the consistency of language model outputs across semantically similar prompts. By leveraging the Gumbel reparameterization trick and introducing a shared latent variable, the authors demonstrate improvements in both semantic and stylistic consistency across various benchmarks and models. The method is computationally efficient, requiring no additional training, and shows significant gains in response similarity, particularly with GCSwR.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The method is innovative, computationally efficient, and model-agnostic, improving language model consistency without altering the underlying architecture.
2. The paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrating clear improvements in consistency metrics across multiple models and datasets.
3. The clarity of the writing and the organization of the paper enhance its accessibility.

Weaknesses:
1. The evaluation is limited, primarily focusing on short-form question answering, with a lack of exploration into longer-form questions and multi-turn dialogues.
2. The emphasis on stylistic consistency may not align with all use cases, raising questions about the method's utility for factual consistency in real-world applications.
3. The explanation of semantic similarity is insufficiently detailed, particularly regarding the choice of the E5mistral-7b model, and the potential for over-smoothing in token similarity measurements warrants further investigation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation scope by including longer-form questions and multi-turn dialogues to better assess the method's applicability in interactive scenarios. Additionally, the authors should clarify the rationale behind the choice of the E5mistral-7b model for measuring semantic similarity and explore the trade-off between consistency and diversity in their results. It would also be beneficial to extend the evaluation to cover diversity-specific benchmarks and assess performance on longer text formats, such as rephrasing or essay writing. Lastly, the authors should clarify whether the rephrased questions using GPT-4o mini were measured for semantic similarity prior to their experiments.
