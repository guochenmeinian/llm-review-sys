### Key Points
This paper presents the Poisoning Malware-Similar Benignware (PMSB) method, which enhances clean-label backdoor attacks on malware classifiers by embedding triggers into benign samples that resemble malware. The authors propose three distance metrics for sample selection and demonstrate the method's effectiveness across multiple datasets (EMBER, SOREL-20M, and BODMAS), achieving a significant increase in attack success rates (ASR) compared to existing methods. The paper also evaluates PMSB's resilience against common defense mechanisms, asserting its robustness in adversarial settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The PMSB method represents a significant advancement in clean-label backdoor attacks, effectively reducing conflicts between trigger and benign features.
- Comprehensive experiments validate PMSB's effectiveness and generalizability across various datasets and model architectures.
- The method shows strong resilience against mainstream defense mechanisms, maintaining high ASR even under defensive conditions.

Weaknesses:
- The computational complexity of the proposed sample selection methods poses challenges for large-scale applications, with insufficient discussion on the implications of this overhead.
- Embedding triggers may alter the distribution of benign samples, potentially creating detection signals that the paper does not adequately address.
- The discussion on defense strategies is shallow, lacking concrete methods to counter PMSB attacks effectively, limiting the paper's contribution to adversarial research.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the computational overhead associated with PMSB, particularly for large-scale datasets. Additionally, the authors should explore the potential detection signals arising from the altered distributions of benign samples and provide a more thorough analysis of defense strategies against PMSB attacks. Expanding the related work section to include a deeper comparison with existing literature on poisoning attacks would enhance the paper's novelty. Furthermore, clarifying the characteristics of the triggers used and providing examples would strengthen the practical understanding of the method. Lastly, addressing the implications of sample selection strategies and their generalizability beyond malware classification would improve the paper's overall robustness.
