Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an empirical study on generative retrieval methods, focusing on their effectiveness in large-scale settings, particularly through the evaluation of existing methods on the MS MARCO Passage retrieval dataset. The authors categorize various methods based on document representation, synthetic query generation, and document identifiers, and they highlight the effectiveness of query generation while suggesting future research directions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and provides a comprehensive review of generative ranking models.
- It addresses a timely topic with growing interest in the community and evaluates methods on a large corpus, which has been largely overlooked in prior studies.
- The findings offer valuable insights and potential directions for future research.

Weaknesses:
- The study is limited to the MS MARCO Passage retrieval dataset, which has known limitations, potentially skewing results.
- There is a lack of novelty in methodology, and the paper could benefit from proposing improved methods based on the findings.
- Some statements lack clarity and detail, and the experiments primarily rely on a single metric per dataset, which may not provide a complete evaluation.
- Certain abbreviations are used without explanation, and some relevant literature is omitted.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by incorporating evaluations on additional large-scale datasets, such as TripClick, to strengthen their conclusions. We suggest providing clearer definitions for terms and abbreviations used throughout the paper, particularly in tables. Additionally, we encourage the authors to include multiple evaluation metrics, such as "@100", to enhance the robustness of their experimental results. Finally, we advise addressing the lack of detail in certain statements to clarify the implications of their findings.
