### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to referring video object segmentation (R-VOS) that adapts models trained on clean text-video pairs to handle noisy speech input. The authors propose two key modules: Noise-Aware Semantic Adjustment (NSA) for accurate semantics extraction from noisy speech, and Semantic Jitter Suppression (SJS) to enhance model robustness against noisy queries. Comprehensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks demonstrate the proposed method's superiority over state-of-the-art approaches, effectively bridging the gap between speech and text input.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method effectively addresses the challenges of noisy speech input, enhancing the R-VOS models' performance.
2. Comprehensive experiments validate the method's robustness across both clean and noisy speech scenarios.
3. The writing is clear and the references are comprehensive, contributing to the paper's accessibility.

Weaknesses:
1. The analysis of failure cases is lacking, which limits understanding of the method's limitations.
2. The evaluation is primarily based on benchmark datasets, with insufficient exploration of real-world scenarios or complex visual scenes.
3. The types of noise considered are limited, primarily focusing on background noise, which may restrict generalization.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the types of noise addressed, particularly by expanding the definition beyond background noise and including a discussion on accents, which were mentioned in the abstract but not elaborated upon in the main text. Additionally, the authors should analyze failure cases to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of their approach. Including real-world scenarios in the evaluation would enhance the practical relevance of the findings. Furthermore, we suggest exploring the potential of using noise reduction techniques prior to ASR and considering the incorporation of other modalities, such as visual cues, to improve performance.
