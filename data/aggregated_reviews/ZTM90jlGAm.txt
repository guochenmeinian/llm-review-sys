Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a model for sentiment analysis of streaming user reviews by incorporating temporal information through a dynamic graph neural network (DC-DGNN). The authors argue that existing approaches overlook the time-varying nature of user preferences and product dynamics. The proposed model updates user and product representations based on incoming review data, demonstrating effectiveness through experimental results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and easy to read.
- It adopts effective existing modules to capture user and product dynamics, yielding promising performance.
- The classification accuracy surpasses that of baseline models, including recent BERT-based approaches.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for the temporal aspect is not convincingly linked to the sentiment analysis task, as user reviews primarily reflect past experiences rather than current preferences.
- The novelty of the model is limited, with significant reliance on existing architectures like MUSE and JODIE, raising questions about their adaptations.
- Experiments are biased towards heavy users and items, potentially skewing results and limiting generalizability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for incorporating temporal dynamics, particularly in relation to user reviews. Additionally, including temporal baselines from temporal recommender systems would strengthen the evaluation. The authors should also address the bias in their experimental design by considering a more diverse set of users and items. Clarifying the computational complexity of the proposed approach and ensuring reproducibility by promising to release the codebase would enhance the study's credibility. Lastly, we suggest refining the notation and definitions used in the paper to avoid confusion.
