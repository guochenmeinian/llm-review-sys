Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an idealized Platonic Distance (PD) metric for measuring image similarity, which is zero for identical objects and nonzero for different ones. The authors propose a model that utilizes a pretrained foreground segmentation model to extract features from a grid of patch features, averaging them to create an image feature vector compared using cosine distance. The model is evaluated on the CUTE dataset, which comprises 10,000 images of 100 objects (50 pairs from diverse categories) under various lighting conditions and poses, including in-the-wild images. The authors demonstrate that PD can enhance re-identification approaches and aligns reasonably with human perception of object similarity. The dataset has been expanded to include 180 unique objects across 10 categories, increasing the total images to 18,000, and the authors clarify that no finetuning of the DINOv2 backbone is performed to avoid overfitting.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**  
- The CUTE dataset offers unique data that supports future research in lighting and pose-invariant computer vision, particularly for object re-identification, with controlled variations in illumination and pose, and the inclusion of in-the-wild images enhances generalizability.  
- The Platonic Distance model is an innovative integration of existing techniques, with flexible architecture requirements that enhance its applicability.  
- The evaluation of PD against human performance in outlier detection and image similarity ranking is commendable, addressing the relevance of human preferences in AI.  
- The significant expansion of the dataset and thorough investigation of feature extraction methods enhance the paper's practical relevance.  
- The authors have effectively addressed reviewer concerns regarding clarity and methodology, particularly in emphasizing the nonparametric classifier approach.

**Weaknesses:**  
- The choice of baseline methods in experiments is flawed, as LPIPS and SSIM are not suitable for object re-identification.  
- The idealized Platonic Distance metric may not add value unless it can provide meaningful interpretations for non-zero values.  
- The paper lacks clarity on the relationship between the practical Platonic Distance and cosine distance, and the model's connection to the metric is tenuous.  
- The dataset's limited number of object instances and extrinsic variations restrict its generalizability to real-world scenarios.  
- The combination of DINOv2 with a standard segmentation model does not constitute a novel metric, and clarity on modifications to DINOv2 is needed to establish novelty.  
- The limited number of in-the-wild images (4 per object) and lack of varied poses further constrain the dataset's utility.  
- The discussion on object similarity lacks depth, particularly regarding structural similarities and the role of background features.  
- The authors did not initially compare PD with other metrics like LPIPS, which would strengthen their claims.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the choice of baseline methods in Section 4.2 by selecting metrics more appropriate for object re-identification. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the relationship between the practical Platonic Distance and cosine distance, potentially renaming the model to Foreground Feature Averaging for clarity. An ablation study using DINOv2 features should be included to compare the proposed model's performance against other feature extractors. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to expand the dataset by including more instances per class and additional poses, particularly those that capture different orientations of the objects. We suggest that the authors engage in a more nuanced discussion of object similarity, addressing questions about structural similarities and the influence of background features. The authors should include comparisons of PD with other metrics like LPIPS in vehicle re-identification to substantiate their claims regarding PD's effectiveness. Lastly, we recommend a more thorough discussion of the dataset's limitations, particularly regarding the lack of images depicting occluded objects and the limited variation in capture conditions.
