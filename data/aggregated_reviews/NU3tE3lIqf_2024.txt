Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents WildGaussians, an approach that enhances 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to address occlusions and appearance changes in in-the-wild data. The authors introduce appearance modeling through a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for color transformation and utilize DINOv2 features to create an uncertainty mask that helps avoid reconstructing occluded areas. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining real-time rendering speeds, demonstrating robustness against dynamic objects and varying appearances.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The presentation is clear and easy to understand, with a well-structured approach.
2. The method effectively captures both local and global perspectives through Gaussian and image-specific embeddings.
3. The results show significant improvements over baselines on relevant datasets, particularly in handling occlusions and illumination changes.

Weaknesses:
1. The contributions lack novelty, as the techniques for appearance embedding and uncertainty masking are derived from existing works, such as SWAG and NeRF On-the-go.
2. The experimental comparisons are limited, primarily focusing on small-scale dynamic objects, with insufficient visual examples for large-scale occlusions.
3. There are issues with the experimental design, including unfair comparisons in test-time optimization and a lack of ablation studies on specific improvements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their contributions by clearly distinguishing their method from existing works, particularly in the context of appearance modeling and uncertainty masking. Additionally, we suggest including experimental data that utilizes half-image optimization for a fair comparison and providing visual examples that demonstrate the method's effectiveness in handling large-scale occlusions. Furthermore, clarifying the choice of using a binary uncertainty mask over uncertainty weights and correcting minor typos will enhance the paper's clarity. Lastly, we encourage the authors to include comparisons with stronger baselines and address the discrepancies in performance metrics across different datasets.
