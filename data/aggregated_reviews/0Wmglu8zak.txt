Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the BubbleML dataset and benchmark, targeting phase change phenomena through physics-driven simulations. It encompasses a variety of boiling scenarios, including nucleate pool boiling, flow boiling, and sub-cooled boiling, with 51 simulations covering diverse parameters such as gravity conditions and flow rates. The authors propose two benchmarks: (a) optical flow analysis for bubble dynamics and (b) operator networks for learning temperature dynamics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is comprehensive, addressing a wide range of two-phase change phenomena in boiling.
- Validation against experimental data enhances the dataset's accuracy and reliability.
- The potential for diverse downstream tasks is demonstrated through two benchmark scenarios.

Weaknesses:
- The paper benchmarks only three models, which is insufficient for a thorough evaluation.
- The documentation lacks clarity on the quantitative justification for simulation parameters and the limitations of the dataset.
- Some links provided in the paper are broken, hindering access to resources.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the documentation by providing a Jupyter notebook on GitHub to demonstrate data loading, processing, model training, and performance evaluation. Additionally, include benchmark results in the GitHub README for easier access. To strengthen the benchmark, we suggest incorporating more models, specifically those referenced in the reviews, to align with recent advances in PDE modeling. Clarifying the distinction between multi-phase and multi-physics is also necessary. Finally, we advise enhancing the discussion of limitations and providing a more detailed analysis of the results, particularly regarding factors affecting model performance.
