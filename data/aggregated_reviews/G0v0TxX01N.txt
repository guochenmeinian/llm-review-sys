Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents "Diffusion of Thought" (DoT), a method that integrates diffusion models with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to enhance reasoning capabilities. The authors explore the capabilities of diffusion language models in reasoning tasks, questioning whether they can match or exceed the efficiency and performance of autoregressive (AR) models utilizing CoT reasoning. The authors propose two training-time sampling strategies aimed at improving self-correction during inference. Experimental results indicate that DoT achieves significant speed-ups in simple reasoning tasks, demonstrating up to 27× speed-up without performance degradation compared to CoT, and shows promising self-correction abilities in complex reasoning scenarios. However, the exploration appears to be initial, highlighting the need for further investigation into the potential of diffusion models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper explores the reasoning ability of diffusion language models, a novel area of research.
- DoT achieves up to 27× speed-up in simple reasoning tasks without performance degradation compared to CoT.
- The method shows effective self-correction in complex reasoning problems.
- The paper addresses a significant gap in current reasoning paradigms by exploring diffusion models.

Weaknesses:
- The coupled sampling strategy's assumption about noise in previous rationales lacks intuitive clarity and detailed explanation.
- There is no comparison with the DiffuSeq model, which has a similar backbone, limiting the evaluation of DoT's effectiveness.
- The paper does not adequately separate the contributions of DoT from the inherent advantages of diffusion models.
- The exploration appears to be initial, lacking comprehensive data or comparisons with existing models.
- Presentation issues, such as unclear figure colors and rendering problems, hinder clarity.
- The manuscript may require additional details to substantiate claims regarding performance and efficiency.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the coupled sampling strategy to clarify its assumptions regarding noise and error correction. Additionally, including comparisons with the DiffuSeq model would strengthen the evaluation of DoT. We suggest providing more detailed comparisons between diffusion models and autoregressive models, including specific performance metrics. A qualitative comparison of reasoning paths between DoT and DoT$^{MP}$ should be provided for deeper insights. Furthermore, addressing the presentation issues, such as enhancing figure clarity and ensuring proper rendering across PDF viewers, would improve the overall readability of the paper. Lastly, including more comprehensive data to support the claims about the potential of diffusion models would strengthen the paper.
