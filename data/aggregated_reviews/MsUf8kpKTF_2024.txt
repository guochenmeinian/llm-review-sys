### Key Points
This paper presents an extensive empirical analysis of plasticity loss in on-policy reinforcement learning (RL), particularly focusing on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The authors demonstrate that plasticity loss occurs in on-policy RL and that “regenerative” methods that promote network parameter growth are effective in mitigating this issue. The empirical evaluation utilizes ProcGen and ALE benchmarks, incorporating various environmental distribution shifts to investigate the root causes of plasticity loss. The study examines eight previously proposed methods to counteract plasticity loss, analyzing metrics such as weight magnitude, number of dead neurons, and gradient norm.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and provides a comprehensive evaluation of plasticity loss in on-policy RL, supported by robust experiments.  
- It introduces important insights regarding the warm-start problem and the effectiveness of regenerative methods in minimizing dead units in the network.  
- The empirical investigations are thorough, covering diverse environments and intervention methods, with clear reporting of correlation results.  

Weaknesses:  
- While the experimental setup is extensive, the findings lack deeper analysis and do not introduce novel insights or methods for mitigating plasticity loss.  
- Some figures are cluttered, hindering quick interpretation; specifically, Figures 4 and 5 could benefit from summarizing results into a single scalar per method.  
- The statistical significance of results is unclear, and details regarding the number of experimental runs and the meaning of shaded regions in figures are insufficiently explained.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the depth of analysis regarding the interactions between methods and their impact on plasticity loss, particularly exploring differences between off-policy and on-policy methods. Additionally, consider clarifying the statistical significance of results by detailing the number of runs performed and the meaning of shaded regions in the figures. To enhance figure clarity, we suggest summarizing results from Figures 4 and 5 into a single scalar per method and relocating detailed figures to the appendix. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to utilize the rliable library for more effective results aggregation.
