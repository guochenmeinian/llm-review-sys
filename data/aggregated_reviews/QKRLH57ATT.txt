### Key Points
This paper presents an efficient approach for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in large language models (LLMs), addressing the high computational costs of existing UQ methods. It evaluates single-sample, multi-sample, and probing-based methods across various datasets, revealing that multi-sample methods offer only marginal performance improvements at significantly higher costs. The authors propose a method that combines single-sample features to achieve comparable or superior performance to multi-sample approaches, providing a more cost-effective solution.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper offers a comprehensive evaluation of various UQ methods across multiple models, datasets, and prompt settings, highlighting performance and cost trade-offs.
2. By focusing on single-sample methods and their combinations, the paper presents a practical approach that significantly reduces computational expenses without sacrificing performance.
3. The integration of single-sample, probing-based, and multi-sample methods into a unified framework effectively leverages their complementary strengths.

Weaknesses:
1. The primary contribution appears to be the combination of established techniques (single-sample, multi-sample, and probing-based) rather than the development of new methods.
2. Although the paper emphasizes computational cost, it lacks experiments that analyze or quantify computational complexity, focusing solely on performance, which is inadequate for an analytical study on efficiency.
3. The assertion that probing-based methods require additional datasets and impose computational overhead may be overstated, as training probes can be rapid depending on their size.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Fig. 1 to enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest expanding the discussion on limitations to provide a more balanced view of the proposed methods. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify Section 4 regarding the signals compared in the correlation plots and to provide more convincing evidence of the significance of the improvements observed in Fig. 3.
