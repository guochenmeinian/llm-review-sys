### Key Points
This paper presents a method for online statistical inference using streaming data, focusing on the optimal ratio of real to synthetic data. The authors propose adaptations for Kalman filtering-based online inference and extend existing methods to dynamic linear models, incorporating synthetic data through prediction-powered inference estimators. The approach utilizes optimal experimental design to iteratively determine the optimal amount of synthetic data under budget constraints.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The work addresses a significant area of online statistical inference with practical applications.  
- The integration of synthetic data into dynamic models is a relevant and innovative contribution.  
- The use of optimal experimental design is a valuable aspect of the methodology.  

Weaknesses:  
- There is insufficient data simulation, with only a single set of simulations provided.  
- The paper lacks comprehensive simulation analysis involving varying model parameters, sample sizes, and forgetting factors.  
- The proposed method for determining the optimal sample size ratio of real and synthetic data is not validated through corresponding simulation analysis.  
- The absence of real-data analysis limits the demonstration of the proposed method's performance.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by conducting more extensive simulation analyses, including varying model parameters, sample sizes, and forgetting factors. Additionally, we suggest validating the optimal sample size ratio of real and synthetic data through corresponding simulation studies. To enhance the analysis, we propose that the authors include real-data analysis to demonstrate the performance of their method. Furthermore, adding priors for the forgetting rates and obtaining posterior inference of these rates could strengthen the overall approach.
