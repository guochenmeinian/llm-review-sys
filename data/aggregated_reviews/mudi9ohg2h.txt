### Key Points
This paper analyzes individual bidder welfare loss in autobidding auctions with and without machine-learned (ML) advice, linking advertiser strategies to these losses. The authors propose that ad platforms can enhance welfare guarantees at both aggregate and individual levels by using ML advice as personalized reserve prices for autobidders under a return on ad spend (ROAS) constraint. The paper presents theoretical results, including a worst-case welfare lower-bound guarantee for individual auto-bidders and extends findings to various auction mechanisms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant question regarding individual welfare guarantees in the context of autobidders and ML advice.
- The theoretical results are solid, including the performance of VCG and its optimality in truthful auctions.
- The paper is well-written and structured, with a detailed related work section.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the technical contributions is unclear, particularly regarding the individual welfare metric and its interpretation.
- The empirical evaluation lacks real dataset experiments and does not introduce other baselines for comparison.
- The definition and clarity of ML advice and algorithms are insufficient, leading to potential misunderstandings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the individual welfare metric, elaborating on its underlying logic and the rationale for its definition. Additionally, we suggest providing better guarantees by incorporating assumptions about market conditions, such as distinguishing between large and small advertisers. The authors should also consider including experiments with ML models predicting values based on features rather than sampling from a distribution. Furthermore, sharing code would facilitate replication of the experiments, and addressing the lack of real dataset evaluations would strengthen the empirical section. Lastly, clarifying the definition of ML advice and providing examples in the introduction would enhance understanding.
