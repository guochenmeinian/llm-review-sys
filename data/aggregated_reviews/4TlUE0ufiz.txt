Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method that utilizes introspective planning to enhance robotic task execution through large language models (LLMs). The authors propose a framework for LLMs to create uncertainty-aware plans without fine-tuning, addressing issues of hallucination and task ambiguity. The method integrates introspective reasoning with conformal prediction and includes the introduction of a new dataset for safe mobile manipulation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The use of introspective planning with LLMs is promising for improving task planning performance.
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with intuitive figures aiding comprehension.
- Sufficient comparison and ablation experiments are provided, demonstrating improved performance on various metrics.
- The creation of a new dataset on Safe Mobile Manipulation adds value to the robotics community.

Weaknesses:
- The term "introspection" lacks a scientific definition, raising questions about its application to robotic agents, LLMs, or the proposed approach.
- The novelty of the work is unclear, particularly in relation to existing literature, such as reference [31], which also addresses uncertainty and ambiguity.
- The paper does not provide theoretical or mathematical proofs to support claims regarding the advantages of introspective planning.
- The method's approach to task safety appears similar to existing methods, lacking clarity on how it uniquely addresses safety concerns.
- The knowledge base's construction and its impact on performance are inadequately discussed, particularly regarding potential biases from user-generated content.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the scientific definition of "introspection" to clarify its application within the context of their work. Additionally, the authors should provide a more robust analysis of the novelty of their contributions compared to existing literature, particularly reference [31]. We suggest including theoretical or mathematical proofs to substantiate claims about the benefits of introspective planning. Furthermore, the authors should clarify how their method uniquely addresses task safety and provide more details on constructing the knowledge base, including addressing potential biases from user-generated content.
