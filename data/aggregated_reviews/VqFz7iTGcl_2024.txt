### Key Points
This paper presents a task-agnostic method for evaluating embedding models called "information sufficiency." The authors generate a pairwise matrix to assess how well each embedding model can simulate the information content of others, ultimately computing an "information sufficiency score" for each model. They demonstrate that this metric correlates well with downstream task performance across various domains, including NLP and molecular biology.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with a strong theoretical foundation and extensive experimental validation.
- The proposed method allows for community analysis of embedding models, revealing their relationships.
- The topic is highly relevant, addressing the need for a better understanding of embedding model quality.

Weaknesses:  
- The practical computation of the information sufficiency metric is insufficiently detailed, leaving readers unclear on the estimation process.
- The method may favor more "central" embeddings, potentially overlooking unique, niche information that could be valuable.
- The connection between deficiency and information sufficiency is not clearly articulated, and the implications of using this metric for specific applications are not fully explored.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the estimation process for the information sufficiency metric, providing more detailed procedures and examples. Additionally, addressing the potential bias towards central embeddings by discussing how unique information is evaluated would enhance the method's applicability. It would also be beneficial to elaborate on the practical utility of the method and its computational efficiency compared to traditional benchmarks. Finally, including a baseline for comparison, even a simple one, could strengthen the evaluation of their results.
