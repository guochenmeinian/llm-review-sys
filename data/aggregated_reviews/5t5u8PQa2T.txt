Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents StreamNet, a method aimed at enhancing patch-based inference on microcontrollers by reducing redundant computations through a buffering technique. StreamNet includes two variants, StreamNet-1D and StreamNet-2D, which optimize the trade-off between memory usage and computational overhead. Additionally, the authors propose an auto-tuning framework to derive an inference schedule that adheres to memory constraints while minimizing latency. Evaluation results demonstrate significant improvements in memory efficiency and latency compared to prior work.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively addresses critical MCU metrics (latency and memory) through runtime optimization.
- It achieves state-of-the-art performance against a strong baseline (MCUNetv2).
- The methods are intuitive and well-illustrated, facilitating reader comprehension.
- On-device evaluations demonstrate the practicality of the proposed methods.

Weaknesses:
- The results could be better interpreted as points on a latency-memory Pareto curve rather than through tables and charts, with the most informative data buried in the appendix.
- Comparisons are limited to MCUNetv2, neglecting other relevant patch-based optimizations.
- The experimental settings lack diversity, missing control variables like input resolution and number of patches, which limits generalizability.
- The contributions in the introduction need rewording for consistency.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation of results by emphasizing the latency-memory trade-offs more clearly, potentially through a Pareto curve representation. Additionally, the authors should expand their experimental settings to include a wider range of scenarios and control variables, such as input resolution and the number of patches, to better assess the effectiveness of StreamNet. Clarifying the contributions in the introduction for consistency is also advised. Finally, providing insights into the reuse distance of patches and the applicability of StreamNet to transformer models would enhance the paper's depth.
