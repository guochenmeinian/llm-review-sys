Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a model-based approach for 6D object pose estimation using an SE(3) diffusion model for point cloud registration. The authors formulate point cloud registration as a denoising diffusion process, leveraging Lie algebra to perform perturbation and interpolation on SE(3). A registration-specific variational lower bound serves as the optimization objective, and experiments on TUD-L, LINEMOD, and Occluded-LINEMOD datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness. The results indicate significant improvements over baseline methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a novel diffusion process on the nonlinear SE(3) space, showcasing originality and a solid mathematical foundation.
2. The writing is clear and well-organized, making complex mathematical concepts accessible.
3. Extensive experiments validate the method's performance, with ablation studies highlighting the impact of various configurations.

Weaknesses:
1. The title claims robustness, yet there are concerns regarding sample diversity and efficiency, suggesting that fixed hyper-parameters may not perform well across different datasets.
2. Evaluation relies solely on mAP; other metrics like ADD and BOP should be included for a comprehensive performance assessment.
3. Comparisons with more state-of-the-art methods, particularly in 6D pose estimation, are limited, raising questions about the method's competitiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the robustness of their method by addressing the sample diversity and efficiency issues, potentially by exploring adaptive hyper-parameter tuning. Additionally, incorporating a broader range of evaluation metrics, such as ADD and BOP, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's performance. We also suggest including comparisons with more recent state-of-the-art methods in both point cloud registration and 6D pose estimation to strengthen the validation of their approach. Furthermore, discussing the training time and inference speed in relation to existing methods would enhance the practical applicability of the proposed framework.
