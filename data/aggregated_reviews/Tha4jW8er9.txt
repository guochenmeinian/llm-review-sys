### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method called Case-based Reasoning for Machine Reading Comprehension (CBR-MRC), which utilizes a semi-parametric approach to enhance prediction accuracy by reasoning over retrieved answers from memory. The authors demonstrate that CBR-MRC achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets, NewsQA and NaturalQ, and effectively identifies relevant supporting spans alongside correct answer tokens. The method's design allows for interpretability and robustness against variations in question phrasing.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method achieves high accuracy on MRC tasks and provides interpretability by identifying relevant supporting evidence.
- The experimental results indicate significant improvements over baselines, showcasing robustness to lexical changes.
- The paper is well-organized and clearly written.

Weaknesses:
- The complexity of the proposed system may hinder practical scalability due to the efficiency of case retrieval and heuristic construction.
- The reliance on training data for case retrieval raises concerns about potential overfitting and the unclear impact of the casebase on model performance.
- The experiments primarily utilize BERT-base, which may not reflect the performance of more recent models, and the method's superiority over baselines remains ambiguous, particularly in F1 scores.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the scalability analysis of the case retrieval process to address practical implementation concerns. Additionally, conducting further ablation studies would clarify the essential factors contributing to the method's success, particularly regarding the overlap between retrieved and golden answers. We also suggest evaluating the method's performance using newer models like T5 or DeBERTa to enhance confidence in the results. Finally, a discussion on the relationship between this approach and nearest-neighbor models would provide valuable context.
