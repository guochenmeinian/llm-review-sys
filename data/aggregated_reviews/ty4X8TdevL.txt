### Key Points
This paper presents a hybrid quantum-classical generative-adversarial network (GAN) designed to produce jet images, utilizing a parameterized quantum circuit as the generator and a classical discriminator to differentiate between generated and true images. The authors propose that this approach is promising due to the efficiency of quantum networks in sampling from complex distributions, particularly since the dataset originates from a quantum process.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The concept of applying a quantum GAN to generate jet images is innovative and relevant, leveraging the unique capabilities of quantum sampling.

Weaknesses:  
- The scaling of training the network raises concerns, particularly regarding the potential for local minima and bad gradient scaling in parameterized quantum circuits.  
- The justification for using a quantum generator lacks clarity, particularly in terms of its advantages over deterministic or other probabilistic models.  
- The absence of innovation in optimizing the qGAN approach for specific quantum computing paradigms questions the paper's fit for the workshop.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the training efficiency of the quantum model, specifically addressing the issues of local minima and gradient scaling, potentially by incorporating network structures suggested by the dataset. Additionally, we suggest providing a clearer justification for the quantum generator's advantages, including a comparison with deterministic generators or other probabilistic modeling approaches. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore innovative optimizations for the qGAN model tailored to specific quantum computing paradigms.
