Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method called LOKI for adapting pretrained models to predict unseen classes using a geometric approach. The authors leverage label information as a metric space, replacing the traditional argmax operation with the Frechet mean to enhance zero-shot predictions. Theoretical analyses regarding sample complexity and optimal label subspaces are provided, alongside empirical results demonstrating LOKI's effectiveness across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and accessible, with clear explanations of concepts and methodologies.
- LOKI introduces a novel approach to geometry-aware adaptation, addressing the challenge of predicting unobserved classes.
- The theoretical foundations and experimental results support the proposed method, showcasing its significance in machine learning.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed method may depend on prior knowledge of label relationships, limiting its applicability in real-world scenarios.
- There is a lack of comparative analysis against stronger baselines, which would bolster the claims regarding LOKI's effectiveness.
- Empirical results are insufficient to fully support the main claims, and additional experiments on diverse datasets are needed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical analysis by including more comprehensive results across various real-world datasets to validate LOKI's effectiveness. Additionally, a detailed comparative analysis against stronger baselines should be conducted to enhance the argument for LOKI's originality and performance. The authors should also consider providing "error bars" or significance levels for reported results and clarify the implications of Theorem 1. Finally, addressing the scalability of LOKI in higher-dimensional metric spaces and discussing the reliability of the class graph in practical applications would strengthen the paper.
