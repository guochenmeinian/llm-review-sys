### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of decision-making under uncertainty through the lens of Bayes' theorem, proposing that decisions can be viewed as two Bayesian decisions. It discusses the implications of this framework, particularly in relation to classifier optimality and the challenges of computing the Bayes classifier. The authors analyze a vase/faces example to illustrate their concepts and conclude with an application.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
* The paper offers a novel perspective on decision-making and Bayes classifiers, which is relevant to machine learning.  
* The generality of the discussion makes it applicable to a wide range of machine learning contexts.  

Weaknesses:  
* The presentation is disorganized, with unclear connections between topics.  
* The goals and claims of the paper are not clearly articulated, leading to confusion about the proposed approach.  
* Specific sections, particularly Section 4, introduce strong assumptions without adequate justification or clarity regarding the underlying probability models.  
* The vase/faces example lacks coherence and does not effectively illustrate the theoretical implications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by clearly articulating the goals and claims. Specifically, please formalize and list the assumptions made on the probability \( P \) and justify them in the context of predicting a categorical variable. We suggest rewriting Section 4 to use the vase example as a consistent reference point throughout the paper, enhancing the connection between decisions and probabilities. Additionally, consider simplifying the theoretical implications by illustrating the approach with a more straightforward model, such as a linear one. Finally, adding more illustrations or diagrams may help clarify complex ideas and improve overall comprehension.
