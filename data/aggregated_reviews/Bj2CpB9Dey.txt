Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Tangent Space Causal Inference (TSCI) method as a lightweight and effective alternative to the convergent cross mapping (CCM) method for identifying causal relationships in time series data generated by dynamical systems. TSCI innovatively utilizes vector fields as explicit representations of dynamic systems, assessing synchronization between these fields to determine causal direction. The authors argue that TSCI offers higher interpretability and scalability compared to CCM, while also acknowledging the challenge of finding real data sets with a nontrivial causal ground truth and an underlying dynamical manifold structure, which limits the applicability of both methods. They clarify that applying TSCI to arbitrary bivariate causal discovery data sets without such structure is theoretically unjustified and note that both TSCI and CCM have comparable time complexity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a novel algorithmic approach that is well-motivated within the existing CCM literature.
2. TSCI's use of tangent vectors for causality identification enhances interpretability.
3. The writing is clear, making complex concepts accessible to readers with limited background in causal inference.
4. The authors provide a clear rationale for the theoretical foundations of TSCI and CCM, emphasizing the importance of manifold structure in causal discovery.
5. The clarification of the abstract enhances the understanding of the distinct claims regarding TSCI's effectiveness and computational efficiency.

Weaknesses:
1. The rationale for preferring correlation coefficients over trajectories in CCM is inadequately justified and requires further elaboration.
2. Experimental evaluations are limited, lacking robustness checks on reconstruction quality and comparisons with existing methods in more complex scenarios.
3. The reliance on synthetic data due to the scarcity of appropriate real data sets may limit the practical applicability of the findings.
4. The justification for applying TSCI to non-time series data sets remains unclear, raising questions about the scientific value of such applications.
5. The paper does not sufficiently address the performance of TSCI in real-world applications or under conditions of low-quality state reconstruction.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the choice of correlation coefficients by expanding the discussion on the limitations of measuring correlation in ambient space. Additionally, conducting experiments that assess TSCI's performance under varying reconstruction quality and comparing it with classical CCM in more complex systems would strengthen the findings. It would also be beneficial to include a comprehensive analysis of TSCI's robustness in real-world datasets and to clarify the theoretical advantages of TSCI over existing bivariate causal discovery methods. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to actively seek and include any potential real data sets that align with the manifold structure assumption to strengthen their claims. Lastly, we suggest that the authors further clarify the implications of applying TSCI to data sets lacking inherent time series structure, to address concerns regarding its theoretical justification.
