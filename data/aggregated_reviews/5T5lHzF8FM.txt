### Key Points
This paper presents FPrompt, a fairness-aware prompt tuning approach designed to mitigate biases in pre-trained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) while enhancing their generalization capabilities. FPrompt employs hybrid graph prompts that integrate counterfactual data and edge modifications to improve message-passing between sensitive groups, effectively reducing statistical bias and improving predictive performance across various datasets. The authors provide a theoretical analysis of fairness metrics and demonstrate FPrompt's superiority over existing models in both fairness and accuracy through extensive experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The framework innovatively integrates fairness constraints with graph prompt tuning, addressing biases in pre-trained GNNs.
- Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate that FPrompt outperforms state-of-the-art methods in fairness and predictive performance.
- The introduction of a new benchmark for evaluating transferability adds significant value to the research.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of hybrid graph prompts is limited, closely resembling GPF, and the authors should clarify the similarities and differences.
- The theoretical contribution of Theorem 1 is derived from prior work, and the authors need to revise the abstract to accurately reflect this.
- The literature review on graph fairness is insufficient, lacking recent works and comparative discussions with related methods like GraphPAR.
- The paper does not adequately address the application of FPrompt to multi-value sensitive attributes and lacks validation for scenarios with partially accessible sensitive attributes.
- The hyper-parameters introduced by FPrompt are not well analyzed, leaving their influence unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the similarities and differences between hybrid graph prompts and GPF. Additionally, the authors should revise the abstract to accurately reflect the source of Theorem 1. To enhance the literature review, please include recent works and a comparative discussion with GraphPAR. We also suggest providing a clearer explanation of how FPrompt can be applied to multi-value sensitive attributes and conducting validation with partially accessible sensitive attributes. Finally, we recommend including ablation studies to assess the contributions of each component and a thorough analysis of the hyper-parameters to clarify their influence on model performance.
