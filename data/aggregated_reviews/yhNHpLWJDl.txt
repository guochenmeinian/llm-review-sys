Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a neural network approach to learning the Whittle index policy for restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) problems, specifically through a novel algorithm called Neural-Q-Whittle. The authors provide a finite-time analysis of the algorithm, demonstrating its convergence to optimal or approximately optimal solutions without requiring a projection step. The algorithm employs two-timescale stochastic approximation (2TSA) to jointly update the neural network parameters and Whittle indices, with a convergence rate of \(K^{2/3}\). The paper includes experiments validating the convergence performance and the sufficiency of the proposed conditions for stability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with sound technical claims and a solid theoretical analysis.
- It eliminates the projection step, which is a significant advancement over previous works.
- The finite-time performance bounds are provided, contributing to the understanding of neural network settings in this context.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation could be improved by reducing the use of remarks/lemmas blocks in favor of paragraph form.
- The comparison to previous algorithms lacks clarity, particularly regarding the necessity of projection steps and the implications of the different definitions of the Whittle index.
- The simulation settings are overly simplistic, limiting the demonstration of the advantages of neural approximation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the comparison to previous algorithms, particularly emphasizing why the absence of a projection step is beneficial. Additionally, please clarify the differences in the definition of the Whittle index compared to existing literature and justify its validity. It would also be beneficial to enhance the complexity of the simulation settings to better showcase the advantages of the proposed method. Lastly, consider summarizing the contributions of the theoretical analysis more explicitly to highlight the significance of not using projection steps.
