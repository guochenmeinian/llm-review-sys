Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of asynchronous Proportional Response Dynamics (PRD) in linear Fisher markets under adversarial scheduling. The authors propose an associated game with specific player utilities that admits an exact potential function. They demonstrate that the pure Nash equilibria of this game correspond to market equilibrium bids and maximizers of the potential function. The authors show that best response dynamics (BRD) converge to equilibrium prices and that PRD, with subsets of active players, strictly increases the potential function value unless bids remain unchanged. The main theorem proves that if the market is generic and players are activated in subsets at least once every $T$ rounds, then PRD converges to the unique market equilibrium.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors present significant foundational results for future research in game and market dynamics, articulated clearly with informative proof sketches.
- The theoretical results are sound, with novel proof techniques establishing important connections between the associated game and the original game.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for studying linear Fisher markets with asynchronous PRD is unclear, necessitating justification for this specific setting.
- The organization of the paper lacks clarity, particularly regarding the relationship between results in Sections 3-5 and the proof of Theorem 1.
- The definition of the "generic case" requires further explanation, and the challenges of achieving convergence under full asynchrony need to be specified.
- The paper does not address the rate of convergence, which remains an open question.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation section to clarify the significance of studying asynchronous PRD in linear Fisher markets. Additionally, we suggest reorganizing the paper for better clarity, particularly in linking the results of Sections 3-5 to Theorem 1. The authors should provide a clearer definition of the "generic case" and elaborate on the challenges associated with convergence under full asynchrony. Finally, we encourage the authors to investigate and discuss the rate of convergence, as this is a critical aspect that remains unaddressed.
