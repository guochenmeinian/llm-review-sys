Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to address graph heterophily in training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by introducing a GNN architecture called TeDGCN, which allows for trainable and potentially negative depth. The authors utilize graph spectral analysis to connect the depth of a GCN with its performance on homophilic and heterophilic graphs. They propose two versions of the method: one that generalizes depth as a trainable parameter and another that extracts low and high-frequency components of the graph, each with tunable depth parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods yield significant improvements on heterophilic datasets compared to baseline methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized and presents its ideas clearly, making it easy to follow.
- The introduction of trainable real-valued depth is a significant contribution, enhancing the adaptability of GNNs to different graph types.
- The empirical results show that the proposed methods effectively capture heterophilic patterns, with comprehensive experiments validating their performance.

Weaknesses:
- The comparison with existing methods is insufficient, particularly regarding how the proposed approach differs from other adaptive methods that also incorporate high-frequency components.
- The method is limited to static undirected graphs in a transductive setting, which restricts its applicability.
- The simplification of GCN to achieve trainable depth sacrifices some non-linearity, potentially limiting the model's expressive power.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section by providing a more thorough comparison with existing methods that address heterophily, clarifying the unique contributions of their approach. Additionally, consider expanding the evaluation to include a wider variety of datasets, particularly those that have been recently revised for accuracy. It would also be beneficial to discuss how the proposed algorithms can be adapted for larger graphs and to explore the implications of using multiple trainable depth parameters for different eigengraphs. Finally, addressing the limitations regarding the expressiveness of the linear model and its applicability to inductive settings would strengthen the paper.
