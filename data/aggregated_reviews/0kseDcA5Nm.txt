### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive survey of methods and datasets for probing factual knowledge in pre-trained language models (PLMs). The authors propose a novel categorization scheme for factual probing methods and provide an overview of relevant datasets. They synthesize insights regarding knowledge retention, prompt optimization, and challenges associated with adopting PLMs as knowledge bases, while outlining future research directions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-organized, easy to follow, and offers a comprehensive review of factual knowledge probing, reflecting considerable effort in its compilation.  
- The categorization schema is novel and well-structured, providing clarity in organizing relevant studies.  
- It summarizes existing probing methods and datasets effectively, as illustrated in Tables 1 and 2.  

Weaknesses:  
- The survey lacks novel insights, as many discussions, particularly in Sections 4 and 5, echo previous reviews, limiting its originality.  
- The insights section is not particularly engaging, and the discussion on future directions is too brief, hindering deeper understanding for future researchers.  
- Some representative works from the current year are missing, and there are excessive references to existing surveys.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of the discussions, particularly regarding knowledge retention and prompt optimization, by incorporating more original insights. Additionally, we suggest expanding the future work section to provide a more thorough exploration of potential research directions. Finally, we encourage the authors to include more recent representative works to enhance the survey's comprehensiveness.
