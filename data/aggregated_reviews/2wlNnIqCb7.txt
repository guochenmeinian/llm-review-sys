Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the emergence of communication in artificial agents, focusing on the interplay between pragmatics and lexical semantics while abstracting from syntax. The authors propose a framework for studying pragmatic language emergence through a reference-game setup using naturalistic images. They demonstrate that agents must optimize for utility, informativeness, and complexity to achieve human-like linguistic systems. The study employs the vector quantize variation information bottleneck (VQ-VIB) to evaluate the trade-offs among these aspects, revealing that human-like outcomes arise from non-trivial balances rather than singular focus. The authors estimate that human performance on the task is between 50%-80%, with their model achieving approximately 72%. They clarify that their work does not address the complexities of the syntax-semantics interface, which are considered open challenges in cognitive science and linguistics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The exploration of pragmatics in NLP is novel and significant, contributing to understanding language modeling.
- The experimental design is robust, with both quantitative and qualitative evaluations showing that human-like lexicons can emerge through optimization of context-specific and general objectives.
- The UIC framework provides a general perspective on emergent communication systems, supported by psycholinguistic theories.
- The authors provide a clear estimation of human performance based on existing data, which supports their conclusions.
- The paper follows common practices in the field and makes simplifying assumptions to advance understanding.

Weaknesses:
- The significance of training in a pragmatic setting and testing in a semantic setting is inadequately explained.
- The contributions of the paper are somewhat unclear, with similarities to prior works raising questions about novelty.
- The argument for the necessity of optimizing utility, informativeness, and complexity is methodologically problematic, as the best-performing system does not achieve high task performance.
- The distinction between syntax and semantics is not clearly defined, leading to potential ambiguities in the analysis.
- The authors' claim that restricting the model to single words disables the learning of syntactic structures lacks sufficient justification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by explicitly defining semantics and pragmatics, and discussing their relationship and importance. Additionally, we suggest elaborating on the significance of training in a pragmatic setting versus testing in a semantic setting. The authors should also address the methodological concerns regarding the evaluation metrics, ensuring that task performance is adequately contextualized within the framework of emergent communication. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the distinction between syntax and semantics in their analysis, particularly in relation to the gray areas highlighted by previous studies. We also suggest providing a more robust justification for how the single-word constraint impacts the learning of syntactic structures. Addressing the limitations of their simplifying assumptions more explicitly in the paper would enhance its rigor. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore the stability and generalizability of their results in greater detail, particularly regarding the stopping criteria used in training.
