Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of the convergence rate of the CART algorithm under a sufficient impurity decrease (SID) condition in regression settings. The authors demonstrate that the SID condition ensures consistency and polynomial convergence of CART, providing examples and sufficient conditions for various function classes, including additive models and polynomials. The paper also introduces the locally reverse Poincare inequality, establishing a connection between additive models and the SID condition.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The analysis refines the understanding of CART under the SID condition, improving prediction error bounds compared to previous work.
- The introduction of the locally reverse Poincare class clarifies the SID condition and connects it with additive functions.
- The paper is well-written, with detailed proofs, simulations, and figures that illustrate its findings.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on specific technical assumptions, such as bounded errors and the LRP property, may limit applicability and require further justification.
- The examples satisfying the SID condition are primarily restricted to additive models, which may not be practical in real-world scenarios.
- The discussions on optimality and the implications of the SID condition could be more rigorous.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the applicability of the SID condition to non-additive models, addressing the limitations of the current examples. Additionally, providing more intuition and motivation for the technical assumptions would enhance the paper's clarity. We also suggest exploring the implications of the LRP condition further, particularly regarding its potential impact on improving the CART algorithm. Lastly, expanding empirical evidence beyond simple cases would strengthen the paper's contributions.
