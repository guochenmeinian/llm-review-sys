Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CLIP4HOI, a two-stage framework for zero-shot Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection that leverages the generalizable knowledge of CLIP for interaction classification. The approach first generates pairwise proposals of human-object interactions and then classifies these proposals using CLIP. The authors conduct extensive experiments on well-known datasets, demonstrating competitive performance in both zero-shot and fully-supervised settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation for the paper is reasonable, and the proposed method is simple and easy to follow.
2. The utilization of large-scale vision-language models like CLIP for HOI detection is innovative and effective.
3. The overall performance of the proposed method shows significant improvement compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the work is marginal, with some components reused from existing methods, and important baselines like HOICLIP are omitted.
2. The motivation and differences from prior works are unclear, with several unexplained terms and claims.
3. The proposed method may not generalize well to truly novel HOIs, particularly with unseen objects and verbs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind the proposed approach and explicitly address how it differs from prior works. Additionally, the authors should include a detailed discussion and comparison with omitted baselines such as HOICLIP. We suggest providing more qualitative examples in the supplementary material to illustrate the successes and failures of the method. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the definitions of terms like "valid" human-object pairs and "feature interaction," and discuss the computational complexity introduced by traversing all feasible HO combinations. Lastly, justifications for the observed performance discrepancies, particularly regarding unseen classes, should be provided.
