Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on risk-sensitive Bayesian decision-making, introducing the Risk-Sensitive Variational Bayesian (RSVB) framework to address intractable posterior distributions. The authors propose a dual representation of the entropic risk measure to approximate the risk-sensitive posterior and derive corresponding decision rules. Theoretical analyses, including convergence rates for the approximate posterior and decision rules, are supported by practical examples in both parametric and nonparametric settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Innovative Approach: The introduction of the RSVB framework significantly advances the field by providing a novel solution for decision-making problems where posterior calculation is intractable.
- Practical Relevance: The framework effectively addresses challenges in modern applications involving large datasets and complex models, making it valuable for researchers and practitioners.
- Theoretical Analysis: Comprehensive theoretical insights, including convergence rates and statistical properties, enhance the understanding of the proposed approach.
- Illustrative Examples: The inclusion of practical examples demonstrates the applicability of the RSVB framework, reinforcing theoretical findings.

Weaknesses:
- Clarity of Exposition: The overall clarity could be improved, as some technical details may require further explanation or examples for better reader comprehension.
- Comparison with Existing Methods: A more detailed comparison with existing approaches would clarify the advantages and limitations of the RSVB framework.
- Empirical Evaluation: While illustrative examples are provided, a broader empirical evaluation comparing performance against alternative methods would strengthen the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of exposition by providing additional explanations or examples for complex concepts. A detailed comparison with existing methods for handling intractable posterior distributions should be included to enhance understanding of the RSVB framework's advantages. Furthermore, we suggest conducting a more extensive empirical evaluation across various datasets and problem domains to robustly support the practical effectiveness of the RSVB framework. Additionally, incorporating proof sketches and intuitions throughout the paper would make the technical analysis more accessible.
