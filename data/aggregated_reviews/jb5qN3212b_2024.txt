Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a methodology called Graph-Augmented Score Propagation (GRASP) aimed at detecting Out-of-Distribution (OOD) nodes in graph data and enhancing the performance of graph-based models by addressing the limitations of raw Maximum Score Propagation (MSP) in selecting edges. The authors propose an edge augmentation strategy that improves the ratio of intra-edges, which connect in-distribution nodes or OOD nodes, thereby enhancing OOD detection performance. Theoretical analyses support the effectiveness of GRASP, and experimental results demonstrate its superiority over existing OOD detection methods across various datasets. The authors claim that GRASP remains effective even when raw MSP fails, although concerns have been raised regarding the accuracy of edge selections and the conditions under which GRASP operates efficiently.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method is introduced in an informative manner.
2. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
3. The comparative experiments are comprehensive, providing substantial experimental evidence supporting the effectiveness of GRASP across multiple datasets and base models.
4. The incorporation of additional results and visualizations enhances the clarity of the paper and strengthens the argument for GRASP's efficacy.
5. The hyperparameter sensitivity analysis is thorough, providing valuable insights.

Weaknesses:
1. The authors may overstate the novelty of their contribution, neglecting prior works in graph OOD detection that should be discussed.
2. The selected baselines in the experiments may lack novelty, rendering the results less convincing.
3. There are concerns regarding the claim that "GRASP still works when raw MSP fails," particularly due to the potential introduction of errors when selecting edges based on MSP.
4. The conditions under which GRASP is efficient remain unclear, specifically regarding the types of graph datasets and base models used.
5. The proposed method requires more motivation from both theoretical and practical perspectives, particularly regarding the assumption of edges following a Bernoulli distribution.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review to include a broader investigation of existing works in graph OOD detection, explicitly discussing the differences between their method and related approaches. Additionally, the authors should consider selecting more novel baselines to enhance the credibility of their experimental results. To strengthen the theoretical foundation, we suggest providing concrete examples or previous studies that support the assumptions regarding intra-edges and inter-edges. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify their claims regarding the effectiveness of GRASP in scenarios where MSP fails by providing detailed explanations of the conditions under which their algorithm operates efficiently, including the types of graph datasets and base models. Including error bars and statistical significance analysis in the results would enhance the robustness of the findings. Lastly, we encourage the authors to release the source code of their experiments for transparency and reproducibility.
