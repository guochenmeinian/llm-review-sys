### Key Points
This paper presents the development of a Metaball-Imaging algorithm that transforms pixel data into a lower-dimensional space vector, followed by conditional generation using these descriptors to create 3D particles. The authors explore generating particles with similar shape features but different morphologies and demonstrate the limitations of using shape descriptors to predict physical processes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is clearly written with high-quality figures and effectively communicates the model's objectives. It successfully generates particles from pixel data with desired shape constraints similar to XRCT images and documents applications for exploring the limitations of shape descriptors in predicting particle drag.

Weaknesses:  
The paper lacks a comparison of how the model's generation from XRCT images contrasts with results from VAEs and compressed particle representations. Additionally, a defined set of criteria or metrics for quantitatively assessing the adequacy of the selected shape descriptors for specific tasks is missing, which would enhance clarity and applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve their work by including a comparison of their model's performance against baseline models, such as VAEs and compressed particle representations, to better contextualize their results. Furthermore, providing a detailed discussion on the quantitative assessment of the selected shape descriptors would significantly enhance the study's clarity and applicability.
