Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CAT, a prompt-based deep model for organ and tumor segmentation that utilizes both anatomical and textual prompts to enhance segmentation accuracy. The authors propose a dual-prompt schema, integrating the ShareRefiner and PromptRefer modules, demonstrating good performance across multiple public CT datasets and an in-house dataset. The approach aims to address challenges in medical image segmentation, such as the long-tailed nature of data and variations in tumor characteristics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The combination of anatomical and textual prompts is a novel approach that enhances medical image segmentation.
2. The development of the ShareRefiner and PromptRefer modules showcases a sophisticated method for refining and integrating multimodal prompts.
3. The paper includes thorough experimental analyses, including ablation studies and qualitative comparisons, supporting the proposed methods.
4. The focus on both organ and tumor segmentation is commendable, demonstrating the model's versatility.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation for using textual descriptions is unclear, as the authors rely on generic information rather than specific details that could enhance segmentation performance.
2. The comparative results lack convincing evidence of CAT's superiority, particularly when other models like CT-SAM3D perform better in certain cases.
3. The paper does not sufficiently clarify the training methods for comparison models, leading to potential inconsistencies in results.
4. The novelty of the work is questioned, as it appears to be an incremental extension of existing methods without clear explanations of how text contributes to performance improvements.
5. The rationale for certain design choices, such as hard assignments in ShareRefiner, is inadequately justified.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their motivations for using textual prompts by incorporating specific details relevant to each sample, particularly regarding cancer staging. Additionally, the authors should enhance the comparative analysis by including state-of-the-art segmentation models like UNet, nn-UNet, and Swin UNETR to provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Clarifying the training protocols for comparison models and providing detailed explanations of the techniques used, including the rationale behind choices like hard assignments, would strengthen the paper. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors include more detailed visual examples of the prompts used and clarify the outputs of their models, particularly in Figure 2. Lastly, addressing the long-tailed problem more explicitly in the context of CAT's design would enhance the paper's contribution to the field.
