Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DEX, a novel technique aimed at enhancing DNN inference efficiency on resource-constrained tiny AI accelerators by extending data channels. The authors propose a method that utilizes patch-wise even sampling and channel-wise stacking to incorporate additional spatial information from the original image, addressing the accuracy degradation caused by downsampling due to limited memory. Evaluations demonstrate a 3.1% accuracy improvement without additional inference latency, showcasing the method's potential for maximizing resource utilization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for DEX is clearly articulated, addressing significant issues of accuracy degradation and resource under-utilization.
- The proposed method is simple yet effective, improving inference accuracy without increasing latency.
- Evaluations are conducted on real hardware, providing practical insights into the method's performance.
- The paper is well-structured, with clear presentation of methodology and results.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation lacks comparisons with a broader range of complex models and tasks beyond classification, limiting the generalizability of the findings.
- The impact of channel expansion on end-to-end performance, including latency and power consumption, is not adequately addressed.
- The assumption that unused memory instances trigger the proposed method may not always hold true, raising questions about its applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including comparisons with more complex models and exploring the applicability of DEX to other tasks such as object detection and segmentation. Additionally, a thorough analysis of the end-to-end performance, including latency and power consumption, should be incorporated to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's impact. Further clarification on the assumptions regarding memory utilization and the feasibility of extending DEX to intermediate layers would also strengthen the paper.
