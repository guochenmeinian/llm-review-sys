Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a generalization of node-level random walk positional and structural encoding to edge-level and higher-order simplex random walks, focusing on edge-level for both theoretical and empirical results. The authors introduce EdgeRWSE and Hodge1Lap, proving their architecture's expressivity surpasses that of 1-FWL. Hodge1Lap serves as an edge-level positional encoding (PE) method that provides information about edges rather than nodes. The authors clarify that projecting a constant vector to the kernel space of $\mathbf L_1$ indicates whether an edge is in a cycle but does not identify which cycle it belongs to. They introduce an alternative implementation, ABS, which can distinguish different cycles by utilizing the absolute values of eigenvectors. Empirical results indicate that their methods outperform selected baselines, although some datasets show better performance from other models. The paper also discusses the theoretical expressivity of these methods and extends the analysis to higher-order simplices. Additionally, the authors assert that the random projection technique enhances the model's robustness and ability to learn different cycles, even in dense or overlapping cases.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The novel approach to generalizing random walks to edge-level and beyond is a significant contribution.
- The ABS implementation of Hodge1Lap effectively distinguishes and detects different cycles in graphs.
- The use of Hodge Laplacians in GNN contexts is innovative, providing practical applications.
- The random projection technique enhances the model's robustness and generalization capabilities.
- The paper is well-organized, with clear sections on simplices and theoretical expressivity.

Weaknesses:
- The empirical results lack convincing evidence, with some datasets showing better performance from alternative models.
- Clarity issues exist, particularly regarding the explicit definitions of algorithms and the construction of the vector $v_i$ and its relationship to the eigenvectors.
- The introduction of the "novel Random Walk Message Passing scheme" in the experiments section is not clearly articulated.
- The limitations of the projection method are not adequately discussed in the paper.
- Numerous grammatical and syntactical errors detract from the overall presentation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by explicitly defining the algorithms EdgeRWSE and Hodge1Lap in dedicated sections. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the construction of vector $v_i$, explicitly stating how it is built and its implications for the method's performance. We encourage the authors to provide more comprehensive empirical evidence, including experiments on synthetic datasets that require models to be strictly more expressive than 1-FWL. Testing the proposed methods on a wider range of GNN architectures beyond GPS and GINE would strengthen the validation of their approach. Furthermore, we recommend including a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the projection method in the main text, particularly regarding its inability to distinguish between different cycles. Careful proofreading to eliminate grammatical and syntactical errors is necessary. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the theoretical implications of their methods and address the limitations regarding the focus on simplicial complexes.
