Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents block variants of Broyden's methods for solving nonlinear equation systems, establishing explicit local superlinear convergence rates. The authors propose both a block good Broyden's method, which shows faster convergence independent of the Jacobian's condition number, and a block bad Broyden's method, which directly estimates the inverse Jacobian, thus reducing computational costs. The theoretical analysis provides insights into the performance differences between the two methods, and empirical results support the proposed methods' superiority.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors provide explicit convergence rates for both the block good and block bad Broyden's updates.
- The block good Broyden's update approximates a nonsingular matrix \( A \) with a linear rate of \( (1-k/d)^t \), while the bad update approximates the inverse matrix \( A^{-1} \) with a linear rate of \( (1-k/(d \hat{\kappa}^2))^t \).
- The first explicit convergence rate for the block bad Broyden's update is proposed.
- The theoretical assumptions are well-supported by both theory and experiments.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental section contains confusing figures, such as Figure 1(a) and Figure 1(d), which represent experiments for the same \( N \) and could be grouped.
- The novelty of the block Broyden's methods is limited, closely resembling previous work.
- The theoretical analysis lacks a discussion on global convergence.
- Implementation details are missing, raising concerns about practical applicability.
- The numerical experiments are insufficient, focusing only on a simple problem without comparisons to well-known methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental section by grouping related figures. Additionally, it would be beneficial to clearly distinguish the novelty of the proposed methods from existing literature. We suggest including a discussion on global convergence and providing detailed implementation information to enhance practical applicability. Expanding the numerical experiments to include a variety of problems and comparisons with established methods, such as the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method, would strengthen the claims made in the paper.
