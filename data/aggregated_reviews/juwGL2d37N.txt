### Key Points
This paper presents ETS-MM, a multimodal framework for detecting social bots by leveraging topic preferences and emotional tendencies in user tweeting behavior. The authors propose a novel integration of multidimensional text-based information and semantic features, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods through experimental results across two datasets. The paper is well-structured and effectively communicates the motivation, methodology, and results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The ETS-MM framework is technically sophisticated, combining multiple modalities of user data in a novel way.
- Experimental results indicate significant improvement over existing methods.
- The paper is well-written and organized, making the contributions clear and accessible.
- The work introduces a unique approach to social bot detection, enhancing semantic feature representation.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty primarily lies in the combination of existing techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new methodologies.
- The use of LLMs and GNNs presents computational challenges that may hinder scalability for large datasets.
- The reliance on user metadata and social network interactions raises privacy and ethical concerns.
- There are unclear definitions and terminology, such as the distinction between LMs and LLMs and the definition of social bots.
- Some figures, such as Fig. 7, lack clarity and require better interpretation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of definitions and terminology used in the manuscript, particularly regarding LMs, LLMs, and social bots. Additionally, we suggest providing specific examples of bots detected by the proposed model but not by others to highlight its advantages. The authors should clarify the significance of the Cresci15 results and address potential limitations related to the framework's scalability and ethical implications. Furthermore, we advise enhancing the explanation of figures, particularly Fig. 7, and ensuring consistent color usage in visualizations for better accessibility. Lastly, addressing minor text errors, such as missing spaces, would improve overall presentation.
