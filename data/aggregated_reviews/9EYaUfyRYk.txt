### Key Points
This paper presents WEAVER, an interactive tool designed to assist NLP model testers in generating specifications for less defined topics, such as "online toxicity." The tool aims to address limitations of the previous AdaTest system by reducing the burden on testers to summarize and organize test cases. Controlled experiments indicate that WEAVER enables testers to explore a wider range of topics, enhancing NLP testing. The authors emphasize the importance of identifying "what to test" in model testing and provide empirical evidence through user studies and case studies demonstrating WEAVER's effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles a relevant problem in requirement elicitation for NLP models, making it timely for the NLP testing community.
- The method for creating a knowledge base (KB) using large language models is innovative, and the user-friendly interface is a positive aspect.
- Empirical evidence from user studies shows that WEAVER helps users identify more diverse concepts for testing.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution appears incremental, focusing on improving a single component of AdaTest without enhancing error rates.
- The reliance on the closed-source API `text-davinci-003`, which will be discontinued, raises concerns about the tool's future viability.
- The user study lacks completeness, and the paper is difficult to follow due to insufficient technical detail and clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing more detailed descriptions of the technical implementations, particularly regarding the construction of the knowledge graph and the processing time for queries. Additionally, we suggest that the authors enhance the user study by including more comprehensive details about the practical problems faced by practitioners and the seed queries used. To address the limitations of using `text-davinci-003`, we encourage the authors to rebuild WEAVER on open-source models and reproduce experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness without reliance on proprietary APIs. Furthermore, we advise the authors to discuss the validity of generated topics and the potential biases in using ConceptNet relations. Lastly, we recommend formulating the optimization objective as a multi-objective problem to balance diversity and relevance more effectively.
