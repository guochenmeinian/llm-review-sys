### Key Points
This paper presents Understanding Model Behavior (UMB), a framework for Open-World Object Detection (OWOD) that detects unknown objects and analyzes decision-making using text attributes. UMB prompts large language models to generate text attributes and models empirical, in-distribution, and out-of-distribution probabilities to estimate the likelihood of an object being predicted as a foreground. This approach allows UMB to infer the similarity of unknown objects to known classes, identifying the most significant attributes. The method shows significant performance improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods on the Real-World Object Detection (RWD) benchmark.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation for modeling fine-grained text attributes in open-world learning is reasonable and interesting.
2. The performance gains on benchmarks are significant for both known and unknown classes.
3. The method can predict attributes for unknown classes, enhancing practical usage.

Weaknesses:
1. The compared methods lack some advanced open-world object detection works.
2. The ablative studies are insufficient.
3. There are typographical errors that hinder readability.
4. The method relies on high-quality text attributes and positive sample probability modeling, which may be affected by data quality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison by including more advanced open-world object detectors in Table 1. Additionally, more ablative studies should be conducted to justify fine-grained designs, including the linear interpolation in PMM, different texture attribute designs, and shift & scale in Eqn. 11, with corresponding experimental analysis provided. The authors should also clarify mismatches between Fig. 2 and method descriptions, particularly regarding Class-agnostic Text Embedding in Sec 4.1, and correct the Fig. 3 caption. Furthermore, the literature review should encompass more recent works on open-set learning for object detection. Lastly, we suggest including more metrics, such as AUROC and FPR, and providing ablation results on prompt templates and the LLM used.
