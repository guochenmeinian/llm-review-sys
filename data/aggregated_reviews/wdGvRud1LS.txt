Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach called the Functional Maximal Correlation Algorithm with Trace cost (FMCA-T) for estimating cortico-muscular dependence by leveraging orthonormal decomposition of density ratios. The authors propose this method to model the relationship between EEG and EMG signals, addressing challenges in interpretability, scalability, and local temporal dependence. Key contributions include matrix trace cost optimization for improved stability and efficiency, robustness against nonstationary noise and delays, and enhanced classification accuracy in cross-subject scenarios. The method outperforms existing baselines and provides insights into channel-level and temporal dependencies, suggesting potential applications in brain-computer interface development and neuromuscular disorder diagnostics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Innovative Method: Introduces FMCA-T, providing a novel approach for estimating cortico-muscular dependence.
2. Improved Stability and Efficiency: Utilizes matrix trace cost optimization, enhancing stability and computational efficiency.
3. Enhanced Classification Accuracy: Effectively captures movement and subject information from EEG features, significantly improving classification accuracy, especially in cross-subject scenarios.
4. Validation on Multiple Datasets: Validated using both simulated and real EEG-EMG datasets, confirming the methodâ€™s effectiveness and robustness.
5. Open Data and Reproducibility: Offers open access to datasets and detailed implementation code, facilitating reproducibility and further research.

Weaknesses:
1. Limited Baselines: The provided baselines are relatively few; future work could expand on this.
2. Limited Dataset Size: The cross-subject classification performance drops, potentially due to the limited dataset size of only 25 participants.
3. Generalization to Other Modalities: The method's generalizability to other types of biosignals or broader neural data modalities has not been extensively discussed.
4. Mathematical and Algorithmic Complexity: The proposed method involves complex mathematical formulations that may be challenging for a broader audience to grasp.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the computational resources required for training and inference of the FMCA-T method. Additionally, we suggest expanding the baseline comparisons to include methods such as EEG Conformer and Deep4. The authors should also simplify some mathematical derivations or provide more intuitive explanations and visualizations to enhance accessibility. Further elaboration on the physiological and neuroscientific significance of the identified EEG channel activations is needed, along with concrete examples or case studies demonstrating the method's applications in diagnosing neuromuscular disorders and developing brain-computer interfaces. Finally, we encourage the authors to validate their approach to interpreting the decision rule with simulated data and address the scalability of the method to larger datasets or longer signal durations.
