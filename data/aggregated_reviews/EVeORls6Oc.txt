### Key Points
This paper investigates target user attacks against recommender systems, proposing the Uplift-guided Budget Allocation (UBA) framework to optimize budget allocation for fake users. The authors aim to enhance the effectiveness of attacks by considering the varying difficulty of attacking different users. They validate their approach through empirical tests on three datasets, employing two estimation methods to assess budget allocation effects.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The model-agnostic UBA framework effectively migrates traditional injective attack methodologies to target user attacks.
2. The correlation found between recommendation prediction scores and high-order interaction paths is both simple and insightful.
3. The paper is well-structured and presents extensive experimental validation across multiple scenarios.

Weaknesses:
1. The individual estimation of treatment effects for each target user overlooks the interdependencies between users, limiting the budget assignment's effectiveness.
2. Existing attack methods were directly utilized without proposing new algorithms based on the UBA framework.
3. The hyper-parameter tuning section lacks sufficient variation in the choices of α and β.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the treatment effect estimation by considering interactions among multiple target users rather than treating them individually. Additionally, we suggest proposing new attack algorithms that leverage the UBA architecture to enhance the originality of the work. The authors should also expand the hyper-parameter tuning section to include a broader range of values for α and β. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of the datasets used for validation by testing on larger datasets would strengthen the generalizability of the findings. Lastly, we encourage the inclusion of more recent defense methods in the discussion to enhance the paper's relevance.
