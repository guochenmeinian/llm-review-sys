Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the contextual bandit with knapsack (CBwK) problem, incorporating a fairness constraint of equalized average costs between groups. The authors propose a dual algorithm based on projected gradient descent (PGD) with adaptive step sizes, aiming to maximize cumulative rewards while adhering to cost constraints. The paper discusses the implications of the algorithm for fairness-related applications and provides regret bounds under specific conditions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The problem statement is clear, and the literature review is thorough.  
2. The motivation for integrating fairness into the CBwK framework is convincing.  
3. The paper is well-organized, well-written, and presents interesting results, particularly regarding the use of adaptive step sizes in the algorithm.  
4. Limitations of the work are explicitly discussed, enhancing transparency.

Weaknesses:  
1. The novelty of the algorithm is questionable, as it seems to build on established methods in online optimization and bandit literature, with proofs appearing standard.  
2. The algorithm's regret bound is only superior under certain conditions and does not address soft constraints effectively.  
3. No numerical results are presented, which limits the practical validation of the proposed algorithm.  
4. The fairness example provided may not be particularly motivating or relevant to the paper's contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their contribution by specifying a more narrow scheme to distinguish their work from existing literature. Additionally, we suggest including numerical experiments to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm against other algorithms, as this would provide empirical validation of the adaptive step size's effectiveness. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to discuss the limitations of assuming known proportions $\gamma_g$ and explore less restrictive alternatives. Lastly, enhancing the examples in the paragraph starting at line 158 could strengthen the paper's arguments.
