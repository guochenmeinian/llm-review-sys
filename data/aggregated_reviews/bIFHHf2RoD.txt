### Key Points
This paper presents CulturePark, a multi-LLM-agent framework designed for cultural data collection through simulated cross-cultural dialogues. The framework includes a main English-speaking agent and various cultural delegates, enabling the generation of high-quality dialogues that reflect human beliefs and customs. The authors created 41,000 cultural samples to fine-tune eight culture-specific LLMs, which were evaluated across three downstream tasks: content moderation, cultural alignment, and cultural education. Results indicate that these models perform comparably or better than GPT-4 in content moderation and excel in cultural alignment and education. The authors also propose that their method demonstrates superior performance in various tasks while acknowledging the complexity of culture, which includes factors beyond language such as ethnicity, religion, and socio-economic conditions. Additional experiments were conducted to validate their approach, specifically focusing on Korean models and comparing their results with other culture-specific models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses the important issue of cultural alignment using role-playing with LLMs.
- Empirical results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in downstream tasks and alignment with the World Values Survey (WVS).
- The incorporation of seed knowledge from humans enhances the grounding of role-playing in real cultural trends.
- The authors provide a multi-agent communication platform that shows promising results in cultural simulations.
- Additional experiments were conducted to enhance the fairness of comparisons, particularly with Korean models.
- The paper acknowledges the complexity of culture and attempts to address it through empirical evaluations.

Weaknesses:
- The definition of culture is overly coarse, equating language with culture, which overlooks the diversity within linguistic groups.
- The validation step involving only two participants per culture is deemed insufficient for representing an entire culture.
- Comparisons between LLMs are unfair due to differences in model size and training recipes.
- Concerns remain regarding fair comparisons with other open-source models and the assumption that language alone can capture cultural nuances.
- Evaluation settings are problematic, with mismatched training and testing datasets for certain models.
- The data collection process lacks clarity, particularly regarding input-output pairs for fine-tuning and the removal of non-factual or redundant sentences.
- The reliance on language as a cultural proxy is contested, with reviewers emphasizing the need for a more holistic approach.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the granularity of cultural definitions by considering the complexities within linguistic groups. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the validation process by including a larger and more diverse participant pool to better represent cultural perspectives. Conducting fairer comparisons by using models with the same architecture and training data, as well as extending comparisons to include a broader range of open-source models, would ensure fairness in evaluations. Clarifying the evaluation settings and ensuring that training and testing datasets align would enhance the robustness of the findings. Furthermore, providing more detailed explanations of the data collection process, including how non-factual and redundant sentences are filtered, would strengthen the paper's methodology. Lastly, we advise toning down causal claims regarding the framework's impact on cultural understanding and ensuring that the societal impact statement is supported by empirical evidence while clarifying the authors' stance on the use of language as a cultural proxy, considering the multifaceted nature of culture.
