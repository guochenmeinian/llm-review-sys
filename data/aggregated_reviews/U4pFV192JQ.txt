Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework for incomplete multi-view weak multi-label classification (iMvWMLC), addressing the challenges of missing views and labels. The authors propose a two-channel decoupling mechanism (MTD) to extract shared and view-specific features, complemented by a cross-channel contrastive loss, a random fragment masking strategy, and a label-guided graph regularization loss. The effectiveness of the framework is validated through experiments on five datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to eight state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem addressed is complex and significant, focusing on doubly incomplete data, which is a challenging area in multi-view learning.
- The writing and presentation are clear, making the authors' motivation easily understandable.
- The method of using labels to constrain feature extraction is innovative, and the local masking of input features contributes to performance improvements.
- Experimental results indicate that the proposed method shows significant advantages over existing multi-view multi-label classification techniques.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks sufficient explanation regarding the coefficient 2 in Eq.(1) and the motivation behind its design.
- Clarification on the value of the mask rate $\sigma$ is missing.
- The computational complexity may increase with the number of views due to the proposed encoder-decoder groups.
- Some expressions are unclear, such as the reference to "conventional deep multi-view networks" without proper citations.
- The one-HL metric used for evaluation does not effectively assess the performance of different methods.
- The similarity matrix based on weak tags does not account for interference from unknown tags, which should be addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the coefficient 2 in Eq.(1) and clarify the motivation for its inclusion. Additionally, a detailed discussion on the value of the mask rate $\sigma$ should be provided. To mitigate potential increases in computational complexity, the authors should consider optimizing the encoder-decoder architecture for scalability with more views. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors clarify the term "conventional deep multi-view networks" with appropriate references. The authors should also enhance the evaluation metrics used, particularly addressing the significance of the one-HL metric. Lastly, it would be beneficial to discuss the potential interference caused by unknown tags in the similarity matrix calculation.
