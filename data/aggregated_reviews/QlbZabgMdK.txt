Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for goal-conditioned control using data from unsupervised exploration, addressing the challenge of mitigating estimation artifacts in value functions. The authors identify $\mathcal{T}$-local optima as a significant issue and propose a value aggregation scheme that combines shorter-horizon estimates to enhance performance in various tasks. The method integrates model-based planning with graph-based aggregation, showing improvements in tasks like maze solving and fetch push.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-motivated, clearly written, and presents a novel observation regarding $\mathcal{T}$-local optima, contributing to future research directions.
- The proposed graph aggregation method effectively addresses local optima and improves performance on certain tasks.
- Extensive empirical analysis supports the findings, with a solid theoretical foundation.

Weaknesses:
- The clarity of the contributions is lacking; the authors should enhance the organization and presentation of the paper, particularly by adding pseudocode for the algorithm.
- The performance of the proposed method does not consistently match that of prior works, and the computational costs are significantly higher than existing methods.
- The literature review is insufficient, failing to cite relevant prior works and missing comparisons with other goal-conditioned methods that utilize model-based planning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions by reorganizing the paper and possibly relocating sections to enhance focus on experimental results. Including pseudocode for the algorithm would also aid understanding. Additionally, conducting a comprehensive comparison with prior works, particularly those by Lowrey et al. and others, would strengthen the paper. The authors should also address the computational cost concerns by discussing potential optimizations and providing further evidence from additional benchmarks, such as AntMaze and FetchSlide. Lastly, enhancing the literature review to include relevant offline goal-conditioned works would provide a more robust context for their contributions.
