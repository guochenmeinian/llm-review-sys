Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method that leverages symmetry to enhance equation discovery for ordinary differential equations (ODEs), particularly through the integration of symbolic regression techniques like SINDy with symmetry-based constraints. The authors utilize Lie group symmetries to guide the learning process, proposing a regularization scheme for cases where the symmetry is unknown, parameterized via neural networks. The approach is validated on various dynamical systems, demonstrating its effectiveness in recovering governing equations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively establishes a pipeline for incorporating Lie point symmetries into the equation learning problem.
- It provides a theoretically grounded criterion for symmetry in time-independent ODEs, facilitating a more manageable learning process.
- The numerical results indicate strong performance compared to baseline methods, particularly in noisy environments.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the proposed technique is questioned, as it relies heavily on existing methods for known symmetries and lacks clear enhancements.
- The methodology for the regularization approach, especially concerning unknown non-linear symmetries, is not sufficiently explained.
- The experiments are primarily conducted on relatively simple dynamics, raising concerns about the generalizability of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the regularization approach, particularly for unknown non-linear symmetries, by providing a more detailed explanation of how it differs from existing methods like LaLiGAN. Additionally, we suggest including experimental results on more complex dynamics, such as chaotic systems, to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of the approach regarding dimensionality, ODE order, and sample complexity would enhance the paper's comprehensiveness. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the relationship between their method and existing works on symmetry exploitation in ODEs.
