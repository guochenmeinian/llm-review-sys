Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of causal k-means clustering techniques to hierarchical and density-based clustering, aiming to address treatment effect heterogeneity and evaluate subgroup effects. The authors propose a solution that integrates causal k-means with hierarchical and density-based clustering algorithms, providing novel estimators and convergence guarantees. The work is motivated by the need to identify homogeneous subgroups in treatment response, with a focus on improving the robustness and applicability of clustering methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The originality of introducing simple plug-in estimators that can be implemented with off-the-shelf algorithms is notable, contributing to the identification of homogeneous subgroups.
- The paper thoroughly explores finite sample properties through simulations, presenting convergence rates and including standard error bars for reliability.
- The clarity of experiments and the effectiveness of graphical representations enhance the communication of results.
- The theoretical contributions, including rigorous error bounds and assumptions, are well-founded and significant for the causal inference community.

Weaknesses:
- The lack of comparative analysis against existing methods in the empirical section weakens the paper, as it does not demonstrate the new method's accuracy relative to others.
- Presentation issues arise from unclear definitions and the cryptic nature of problem statements, which could benefit from clearer articulation.
- The paper suffers from instances of verbatim copying from prior works, raising concerns about originality and proper citation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparative analysis by including performance evaluations against existing methods, such as causal rules extraction or hierarchical DBSCAN, to strengthen their claims. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the clarity of the presentation by explicitly defining the problems being addressed and the novel contributions of the work. The authors should also address the instances of verbatim copying to ensure originality and proper attribution. Finally, providing guidance on interpreting subgroup cluster results and their practical implications would enhance the applicability of the proposed methods.
