Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Event-3DGS, the first framework for event-based 3D reconstruction utilizing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). The authors propose a high-pass filter-based photovoltage estimation module and a novel event-based 3D reconstruction loss, demonstrating superior reconstruction quality, robustness, and efficiency through extensive experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The integration of event cameras with 3DGS addresses challenges in fast-motion and low-light scenarios, paving the way for high-quality, efficient, and robust 3D reconstruction.
2. The experimental results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with thorough evaluations including ablation studies.
3. The proposed method's ability to handle noisy inputs through photovoltage contrast images enhances its applicability to real data.

Weaknesses:
1. The combination of 3DGS with event cameras may be ineffective due to the loss of crucial information, such as color and resolution, which are incompatible with high-quality rendering tasks.
2. The experimental setup lacks sufficient comparisons with Event NeRF methods and utilizes a limited range of datasets, necessitating broader evaluations.
3. Setting the threshold as a global learnable variable is unreasonable; it should be encoded into (𝑥,𝑦,𝑧,𝜃) for optimization to account for dynamic changes in camera movement and lighting.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental setup by including a more comprehensive comparison in Table 2, incorporating additional baselines from Event NeRF literature. Furthermore, expanding the dataset range to include real-world data similar to EventNeRF would enhance the evaluation. Additionally, we suggest that the authors reconsider the threshold optimization approach, encoding it into (𝑥,𝑦,𝑧,𝜃) rather than using a global threshold. Lastly, clarifying the initialization and optimization process of the threshold, as well as providing detailed explanations for equations and experimental results, would improve the paper's clarity and presentation.
