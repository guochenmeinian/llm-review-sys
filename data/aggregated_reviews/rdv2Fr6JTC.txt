Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to data valuation in graph-structured data, introducing the Precedence-Constrained Winter (PC-Winter) Value, which adapts the Shapley value concept to quantify the utility of nodes and edges. The authors propose methods for efficient computation of PC-Winter through hierarchical truncation and local aggregation, supported by extensive experiments. The paper emphasizes the importance of graph data valuation and its implications for enhancing model performance in graph neural networks (GNNs). Additionally, the authors focus on the inductive node-classification setting, providing a rationale for this choice and acknowledging the deterministic nature of their processes and the challenges associated with error bars in their evaluations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is clearly written, with well-explained background information.
- It addresses a significant problem in graph data valuation, formalizing contributions of labeled and unlabeled nodes.
- The use of DFS for obtaining permutations and the proposed approximation methods make valuation feasible with neural networks.
- The authors demonstrate responsiveness to reviewer feedback, indicating a commitment to improving their work.
- The experiments are compelling and provide thorough analyses, particularly within the context of data valuation for graph-structured data.

Weaknesses:
- Limited experimental evaluation, primarily focusing on one GNN variant and lacking cross-validation.
- The authors may be overselling the general applicability of their method beyond the inductive node-classification setting.
- Insufficient discussion of potential negative impacts and limitations of the proposed method.
- The current evaluation lacks error bars, raising questions about robustness and noise handling.
- The paper does not adequately address the correlation between the number of nodes and edges and efficiency improvements.
- Some figures, such as Figure 1, may be unnecessary or poorly formatted.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of limitations and potential negative societal impacts, particularly regarding data poisoning and adversarial attacks. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the scope of their method by explicitly stating that it is developed for the inductive node-classification setting. Expanding the experimental evaluation to include multiple GNN variants and diverse tasks beyond inductive node classification would strengthen the claims. We also recommend conducting experiments with randomized node removal to allow for the reporting of error bars, which could involve selecting nodes based on an importance sampling distribution derived from node values. Finally, addressing the formatting and relevance of figures, particularly Figure 1, and ensuring that all symbols are defined in the main text would improve the overall presentation.
