### Key Points
This paper presents TacoPrompt, a prompt-based framework for self-supervised taxonomy completion, which involves attaching new concepts to suitable positions in an existing taxonomy. The authors propose a completion task that incorporates hypernym and hyponym matching to enhance concept representation learning. They highlight the challenges of attaching non-leaf queries, particularly in low-resource or imbalanced taxonomies. TacoPrompt utilizes explicit answers and implicit hidden vectors to facilitate task collaboration, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper proposes a novel application of prompt learning to the taxonomy completion task, transforming it into a masked language model (MLM) problem.
- Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of TacoPrompt, particularly for non-leaf concept attachment.
- The writing is clear and well-structured, making the contributions easy to understand.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the approach is questioned, as it primarily revolves around applying MLM in a taxonomy sequence, which has been previously explored.
- The reported performance improvements over baselines, such as "TaxoExpan," raise concerns about the significance of these enhancements, particularly given the lack of network information utilization.
- Some inconsistencies and complexities in the presentation of equations and methods detract from clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method's presentation, particularly regarding the equations and their interpretations. Additionally, providing further analysis on the performance discrepancies among baseline methods would enhance the paper's credibility. We suggest including a discussion on the choice of the prompting template and conducting ablation studies to justify its effectiveness. Finally, addressing the missing references, particularly the relevant work on prompt-based methods for taxonomy completion, would strengthen the paper's context and contributions.
