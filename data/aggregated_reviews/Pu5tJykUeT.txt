### Key Points
This paper presents a rule-based future-inference deduction task (ART task) aimed at exploring deductive reasoning in the multi-modal domain. The authors construct a large-scale dataset, Video-ART, comprising 23,895 examples with detailed annotations, including rule sets and reasoning processes. Additionally, they develop a baseline model, ARTNet, which integrates knowledge-guided target perception, a rule-based graph reasoning network, and reasoning path review. Experimental results validate the model's effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed task is innovative and has the potential to advance rule-based reasoning in the multi-modal domain.  
- The dataset is extensive and richly annotated, which could significantly benefit related research.  
- The paper is well-written, providing a clear task definition and formulation.  
- High ratings for soundness and excitement indicate strong support for the study's claims and contributions.  

Weaknesses:  
- The task may lack real-world applicability due to the absence of additional annotations, such as the rule set.  
- The dataset quality is questioned due to the setting of confusing items in candidate events, which may not adequately challenge the model.  
- There is insufficient analysis of dataset bias, particularly regarding the importance of each modality (image or text) and the potential for models to exploit shortcuts rather than engage in genuine reasoning.  
- The paper does not discuss potential applications or downstream tasks that could enhance the significance of the proposed task.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset by providing a more detailed description of the confusing items in candidate events to enhance its quality. Additionally, evaluating the performance of models relying solely on image or text inputs would clarify the importance of each modality. Addressing potential dataset bias is essential to ensure robustness. Furthermore, we suggest incorporating discussions on potential applications or downstream tasks to highlight the significance of the ART task. Lastly, providing insights into the inter-annotator agreement (IAA) for the data collection process would strengthen the paper's claims regarding data quality.
