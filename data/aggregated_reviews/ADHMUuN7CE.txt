### Key Points
This paper presents a Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA) method specifically designed for multi-hop fact verification tasks. The authors propose a new pipeline method called RACE, which generates logically coherent, linguistically diverse, and label-flipping counterfactual data to enhance the generalization and robustness of multi-hop fact verification models. Key contributions include the Explain-Edit-Generate framework for generating counterfactual evidence, the use of constrained beam search and entity constraints during statement generation, and the introduction of a Checking and Filtering module to ensure semantic reasonability and topic consistency. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method improves model performance across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is clearly explained and easy to follow.
- High interpretability is achieved through the proposed framework.
- The introduction of counterfactual data augmentation is novel and relevant.
- Experimental results are solid and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.

Weaknesses:
- The complexity of the multi-stage pipeline may hinder adaptation to other tasks or datasets.
- Improvements in out-of-domain results are limited, necessitating further analysis of robustness and generalization.
- There is insufficient exploration of large language models for generation, and prompts could be optimized.
- The lack of rigorous manual evaluation of counterfactual statements raises concerns about the validity of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their claims regarding the limitations of previous methods by providing evidence for the assertion that they struggle to preserve logical relationships. Additionally, we suggest conducting more extensive analyses of the robustness and generalization capabilities of the proposed method, particularly in out-of-domain scenarios. The authors should also explore the potential of large language models more thoroughly and refine the prompts used for generating counterfactuals. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to incorporate rigorous manual evaluations of the counterfactual statements to substantiate their findings. Lastly, we advise a thorough proofreading of the paper to address language and presentation issues, ensuring consistency in terminology throughout.
