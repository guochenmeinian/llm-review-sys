Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a convolutional neural network for spherical deconvolution of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data, aiming to estimate fiber orientation distribution. The authors propose innovations such as Spatio-Hemispherical Equivariant Convolution, Dense Matrix Multiplication, and Pre-computed Chebyshev Polynomials, which enhance efficiency. Evaluation on simulated data shows improvements in memory usage, runtime, and accuracy, with reduced false positive rates and angular error. The authors also extend previous work with an efficient $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{3}) \times \mathbf{SO}(\mathbf{3})$ equivariant network, achieving a 65% reduction in computation time.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Enhanced efficiency for DWI spherical deconvolution using deep neural networks.
2. Improved accuracy demonstrated with simulated data designed for such experiments.
3. Excellent writing and attention to detail, rivaling full-length journal articles.
4. Provided code for reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
1. Limited novelty; the main innovations focus on efficiency, leaving unclear how they contribute to accuracy improvements.
2. Clarity of presentation is lacking, making it difficult to follow the main contributions.
3. Limited demonstration of practical impact beyond accuracy on simulated data; clinical applications remain uncertain.
4. Mixed results, particularly in Figure 6D, where the proposed method's results deviate from the reference.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the contributions section by restating the main aims of the paper and clearly introducing the technical contributions with descriptions of their achievements. Additionally, please thoroughly discuss Figure 6D, addressing the substantial deviations from the reference. We suggest including further explanations in Figure 1 to clarify differences in gradient directions and showing a zoomed-in version of the T1w image. Consistency in figure referencing should be maintained throughout the manuscript. Furthermore, we advise discussing the potential limitations of the antipodal symmetry assumption and the generalizability of the method across diverse clinical conditions. Lastly, a more extensive discussion on the method's performance under varying noise levels and patient motion would enhance the manuscript.
