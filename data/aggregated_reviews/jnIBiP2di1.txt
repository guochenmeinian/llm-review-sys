Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new framework for generating interpretable and verifiable logical rules through differentiable learning, building on the SATNet architecture. The authors propose a novel interpretation method called maximum equality to decode SATNet weights into logical rules and introduce verification methods to validate these rules against ground truth. Experiments demonstrate that the decoded rules achieve perfect accuracy and are functionally equivalent to the ground truth.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively distills the complex weights of SATNet into human-interpretable boolean expressions that can be verified.
- The decoded rules achieve 100% test accuracy, showcasing true generalization in logical reasoning.
- The interpretation method is well-motivated and allows for the integration of symbolic knowledge, enhancing flexibility.
- The verification methods are sound and have been successfully applied to various experimental tasks, demonstrating practical effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- Achieving 100% accuracy relied on incorporating symbolic constraints, which may limit general applicability.
- The experiments could benefit from clearer presentation and additional tasks, such as visual Sudoku.
- Some theoretical aspects, particularly regarding the limitations of SATNet, require further elaboration for clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental results by including comparative tables for different tasks and evaluations. Additionally, we suggest that the authors extend their discussion on the challenges of applying their methods to more expressive logics like FOL and HOL, addressing potential bottlenecks. It would also be beneficial to explore the application of their technique to visual Sudoku, as this was a significant aspect of the original SATNet work. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide a more detailed discussion on future research directions in the limitations section or an appendix.
