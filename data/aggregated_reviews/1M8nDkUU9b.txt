Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework linking discrete graph neural networks (GNNs) to continuous graph diffusion functionals via Euler-Lagrange equations, while also addressing oversmoothing in GNNs by formulating graph learning as an ill-posed optimization problem using a total variation (TV) method. The authors propose a selective inductive bias to mitigate over-smoothing and introduce a generative adversarial network (GAN) for predicting flow dynamics in graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed GNN models achieve state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets such as Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed, as well as significant improvements in node classification on heterophilic datasets compared to existing baselines. However, the theoretical basis for the reduction in oversmoothing, particularly regarding the TV method, remains heuristic and lacks comprehensive analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers an innovative perspective by applying concepts from traditional physics to GNN design.
- The proposed GNN architecture is clearly described, and the experimental setup is well-defined.
- The results demonstrate remarkable performance on heterophilic datasets, indicating potential effectiveness of the proposed method.
- The authors have made substantial efforts to address reviewer comments and provide additional details in the supplementary materials.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on the Euler-Lagrange equation may hinder accessibility for some readers; a brief introduction or appendix is recommended for clarity.
- The theoretical foundation for the TV method's effectiveness in reducing oversmoothing is insufficiently rigorous and primarily intuitive.
- The theoretical basis for over-smoothing claims appears hasty; further deductions are needed to ensure logical rigor.
- The derivation of the duality problem in Eq. (1) lacks clarity and requires further explanation, which is essential for the paper's coherence.
- The experimental details in the 1-page addendum are too succinct, lacking comprehensive analysis, ablation studies, and comparative analysis necessary for understanding the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing a brief introduction to the Euler-Lagrange equation when it first appears or including it in the appendix. Additionally, we suggest that the authors enhance the theoretical analysis of the TV method to provide a more rigorous foundation for their claims regarding oversmoothing reduction. A comprehensive treatment of the results, including detailed explanations, ablation studies, and comparative analyses, should be included in the final version. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors clarify the derivation process of the duality problem in Eq. (1) to ensure it is mathematically defined and clearly articulated. Lastly, including a related work section would help contextualize the contributions of this paper within the existing literature.
