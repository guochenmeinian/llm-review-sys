Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Flow Matching-based generative model for discrete data, utilizing the Fisher-Rao metric to establish a Riemannian geometric structure on the simplex. The authors propose a simplification of the geometry using a sphere map and define conditional paths via geodesic interpolation. The method is validated through experiments on DNA sequences and large-scale experiments on the LM1B dataset, claiming improved performance. The authors address concerns regarding empirical validation, including the reproduction of DNA promoter experiments and the calculation of perplexity (PPL). However, the novelty of using Riemannian Optimal Transport with mini-batches is questioned, as similar approaches exist in prior works.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written, with a rigorous presentation of the proposed method.
2. The approach effectively connects to established methods, facilitating understanding and potentially lowering implementation costs.
3. The geometric perspective introduced is a novel extension of flow matching models for discrete data.
4. The authors have added new experiments that strengthen the empirical validation of their methods.
5. The commitment to open-source code and detailed discussions on discrepancies enhances transparency and reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the Riemannian Optimal Transport with mini-batches is low, as it has been previously explored.
2. Key contributions, particularly the Fisher-Rao metric and sphere map, lack clear experimental validation of their impact on results.
3. The writing is mathematically dense, and justifications for the Fisher-Rao metric appear circular.
4. Limited experimental validation on more complex datasets raises concerns about the model's scalability and generalizability.
5. The reported MSE for DFM was based on a single checkpoint, which may not fully represent model performance.
6. Some reviewers noted that the results on graph generation were not as strong, and the advantages of using the sphere geometry over the simplex were not clearly demonstrated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental validation by including a broader range of datasets, particularly those with higher cardinalities, to demonstrate the model's scalability. Additionally, we suggest conducting ablation studies to isolate the contributions of the Fisher-Rao metric and sphere map to the model's performance. Clarifying the mathematical justifications in Sections 3.3 and 3.4 would enhance the paper's rigor. We also recommend improving the clarity of the discrepancies between their DFM reproduction and the published results by providing a detailed discussion in the updated draft. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to revisit the promoter design task to ensure it effectively demonstrates the capabilities of their models. Lastly, including results from multiple seeds for all baseline models would enhance the robustness of their findings and address concerns regarding the strength of results on graph generation.
