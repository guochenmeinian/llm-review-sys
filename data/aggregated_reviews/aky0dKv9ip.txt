Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DT2GS (Decompose a Task inTO a series of Generalizable Subtasks), a framework aimed at enhancing generalizability in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) by decomposing tasks into generalizable subtasks. The architecture includes a scalable subtask encoder that selects subtasks based on historical entity-observation pairs and an adaptive subtask semantics module utilizing a self-attention mechanism to compute action semantics. The authors claim that DT2GS can generalize task-independent subtasks from source to target tasks, as evidenced by experiments shown in Figures 5 and 6. Empirical results indicate that DT2GS achieves superior performance in zero-shot generalization and transferability across both multi-task and single-task scenarios. The Adaptive Subtask Semantics module is introduced as a first-of-its-kind solution for providing consistent yet scalable semantics across tasks, enhancing the model's generalization capability. Additionally, the Scalable Subtask Encoder employs a structure-designed approach, differing from previous data-driven methods, and can be combined with such approaches for improved generalization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The framework's structure, including the scalable subtask encoder and adaptive subtask semantics, is well-suited to the problem setting.
2. The paper provides compelling empirical results demonstrating improved performance compared to baseline methods, with insightful analyses on subtask percentages.
3. The concept of defining subtasks based on the influence of agents on other entities is intuitive and effectively translates into multi-agent RL contexts.
4. Detailed pseudocode enhances understanding.
5. Revisions have improved clarity, including clearer symbol definitions and comprehensive experimental results.
6. The rebuttal addressed many concerns, leading to a more favorable assessment of the paper.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a dedicated section for related work, which hinders readers' understanding of the study's originality and contributions.
2. Clarity issues arise from undefined notations and inconsistent terminology, complicating comprehension of the technical content.
3. The generalization capacity of the algorithm is limited to tasks that can be decomposed into task-independent subtasks, potentially overlooking task-specific subtasks in more diverse scenarios.
4. Extensive rewriting is still necessary to fully address proposed changes.
5. Uncertainty remains regarding the technical novelty of the approach.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the manuscript by addressing the inconsistent use of notations and providing definitions earlier in the text. Additionally, including a comprehensive related work section would contextualize the study within the broader literature and highlight its unique contributions. We suggest that the authors consider comparing their approach with hierarchical methods to strengthen the empirical evaluation. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors provide more explicit evidence of the technical novelty of their approach to alleviate concerns regarding its originality. Lastly, discussing potential limitations explicitly, particularly regarding the generalization to tasks with larger distribution shifts, would enhance the paper's rigor.
