### Key Points
This paper presents "AdaNeg: Adaptive Negative Proxy Guided OOD Detection with Vision-Language Models," which introduces a novel method for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection using pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). The primary innovation is the adaptive negative proxies, generated dynamically during testing by exploring actual OOD images, addressing semantic misalignment issues of previous static approaches. AdaNeg employs a feature memory bank to cache discriminative features, creating task-adaptive and sample-adaptive proxies that enhance OOD detection performance, achieving significant improvements in benchmarks like ImageNet. The method is training-free, annotation-free, and maintains fast testing speeds.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of adaptive negative proxies significantly advances OOD detection by dynamically generating proxies during testing.
2. Effective integration of VLMs enhances robustness and accuracy.
3. Demonstrates substantial performance improvements, including a 2.45% increase in AUROC and a 6.48% reduction in FPR95 on ImageNet.
4. Highly efficient as it requires no additional training or manual annotations.
5. Maintains fast testing speeds and adapts to new OOD datasets without significant computational overhead.
6. Comprehensive evaluation across various benchmarks supports the effectiveness of the approach.

Weaknesses:
1. The memory bank's implementation may introduce overhead in memory management, particularly with large-scale datasets.
2. Uncertainty regarding generalization to other domains and types of data.
3. Dependency on the number of test images raises concerns about reliable performance in practical applications.
4. The test-time adaptation method may risk model collapse in close-world environments where most samples are ID samples.
5. The necessity of negative labels in the memory bank design is questionable, warranting further theoretical analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind the use of negative labels in the memory bank. A detailed theoretical analysis should be provided to justify their necessity. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments with varying ratios of ID and OOD samples to assess the impact on misclassification rates and model stability. It would be beneficial to clarify the connections between the dynamic updates of the memory bank and test-time training, as well as to provide more detailed experimental settings regarding memory bank independence for different OOD datasets. Finally, addressing the potential overhead in memory management and ensuring the method's robustness in diverse deployment scenarios would strengthen the paper.
