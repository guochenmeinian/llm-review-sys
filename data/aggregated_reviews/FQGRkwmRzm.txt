Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of streaming PCA using Oja's Algorithm, focusing on estimating the largest eigenvector of a covariance matrix from data sampled from a reversible Markov chain. The authors propose a theoretical justification for applying Oja's algorithm without downsampling, establishing a multiplicative factor that differentiates optimal error rates in non-IID settings from IID scenarios. The work aims to address the challenges posed by dependence in streaming data, particularly in the context of Federated PCA.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper tackles an important problem with a novel approach, improving upon existing methods by eliminating the need for downsampling. The theoretical results are sophisticated and provide valuable insights into the performance of Oja's algorithm in a non-IID context. The authors also highlight potential applications of their findings beyond the immediate scope of the study.

Weaknesses:  
The writing quality is subpar, with numerous typos and unclear notation, which detracts from the overall presentation. The paper lacks clarity on the broader implications of the results and does not adequately discuss the relevance of the reversible Markov chain assumption. Additionally, there is insufficient exploration of practical settings, such as the effects of burn-in periods on algorithm performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and coherence of the writing, particularly in Sections 4 and 5, to enhance reader comprehension. A more thorough discussion of the implications of the reversible Markov chain assumption and its relevance to broader applications should be included. We suggest conducting experiments to explore the impact of different burn-in periods on Oja's method in practical scenarios. Furthermore, a comparison with the Chen et al. (2018) algorithm should be added to strengthen the paper's contributions. Lastly, we advise defining all notations clearly and addressing the identified typographical errors throughout the manuscript.
