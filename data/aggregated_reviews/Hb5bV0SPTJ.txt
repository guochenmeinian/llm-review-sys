### Key Points
This paper presents HMatch, a hybrid algorithm for entity matching between knowledge graphs that integrates key-based and embedding-based approaches. It employs a two-step process: first, embeddings generate sampled subgraphs based on identity links, and second, Linkex extracts link keys from these subgraphs, enhancing scalability and explainability. The authors claim that this method improves efficiency without compromising the quality of extracted link keys.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach effectively combines embedding-based methods with an exhaustive method for link key discovery, offering an interesting perspective on explainability in entity matching.
- The paper is well-written and clearly describes the proposed method, reflecting current trends in neuro-symbolic approaches.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution of the proposed method is limited, primarily combining existing methods (BERT-INT and Linkex) without significant innovation.
- The motivation for combining these methods lacks clarity, as the paper does not convincingly demonstrate substantial improvements in performance or explainability.
- There is insufficient experimental validation to support claims regarding the enhanced explainability of identity links generated by embedding-based techniques.
- The methodology section lacks detail on the subgraph sampling process, and the paper does not adequately situate itself within the broader entity matching literature.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their motivation for the proposed method and provide a more compelling case for the necessity of link keys in web knowledge graphs. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on the subgraph sampling process, detailing the selection criteria and potential optimizations for larger knowledge graphs. We also suggest including a deeper comparison with other explainability methods for entity matching to strengthen the paper's contributions. Finally, we advise adjusting the font size in Figures 1 and 2 for better legibility and correcting the typo on line 586.
