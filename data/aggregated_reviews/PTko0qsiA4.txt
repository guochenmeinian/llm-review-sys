### Key Points
This paper presents a framework named SAFARI, which aims to enhance dialogue systems by incorporating multiple knowledge sources for personalized knowledge-grounded dialogues. The authors introduce a new dataset called KBP, specifically curated for this purpose, where responses are influenced by both persona and knowledge. The experimental results indicate that SAFARI effectively generates persona-consistent and knowledge-enhanced responses.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- The KBP dataset could serve as a valuable resource for research on personalized dialogue.
- The SAFARI framework demonstrates effectiveness in generating engaging and informative conversations.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset size is limited, with only 2,477 dialogues, which could hinder its utility.
- The paper lacks empirical results showcasing the combined use of all knowledge sources and human performance benchmarks, limiting comparative analysis.
- The knowledge in the KBP dataset is primarily persona-related, restricting its applicability to general knowledge-grounded dialogues.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors increase the size of the KBP dataset to enhance its utility. Additionally, conducting more experiments on benchmark datasets would help demonstrate the generalization ability of the proposed framework. To strengthen the paper, we suggest including empirical analyses that illustrate the limitations of existing datasets like FoCus in capturing knowledge dependency. Furthermore, incorporating human performance benchmarks in the evaluation would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the system's effectiveness. Finally, exploring how LLMs perform without the planning and assembling stages could yield valuable insights into the necessity of these components in the SAFARI framework.
