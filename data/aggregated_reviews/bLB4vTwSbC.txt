Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a parser-free virtual try-on network (USC-PFN) that generates realistic try-on results using only unpaired images. The authors propose a novel approach to model the deformation field estimation through a Markov Random Field (MRF) and introduce a self-cycle consistency pipeline for training the try-on generator. Additionally, the paper integrates a Self-cyclic Image Generator (SIG) and a Non-rigid Garment Deformer (NGD), emphasizing the use of human images to capture rich 3D spatial information. The method is evaluated against state-of-the-art techniques on the VITON benchmark, demonstrating comparable performance while significantly improving computational efficiency over existing models like VITON-HD and HR-VTON.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The exploration of parser-free virtual try-on is significant and addresses a challenging problem.
- The introduction of the Markov Random Field for garment deformation is a novel contribution.
- The self-cycle consistency pipeline effectively utilizes unpaired images for training.
- The proposed model shows substantial improvements in computational efficiency and performance metrics compared to existing models.
- Clear differentiation between the roles of SIG and NGD in the architecture is provided.
- The authors effectively address previous concerns through additional experiments, enhancing the paper's quality.

Weaknesses:
- The explanation of the Markov Random Field's advantages over traditional methods like appearance flow is unclear.
- The experiments are limited to the low-resolution VITON dataset, which may not reflect real-world scenarios.
- The writing lacks clarity, making it difficult to understand key algorithmic components and design choices.
- There are discrepancies in results between Tables 3 and 7 that require further clarification.
- Some technical details, such as the specific implementation of $D$ in equation 1, remain ambiguous.
- The performance improvements over existing methods are not substantial, raising questions about the method's overall impact.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing, particularly in the method section, to facilitate understanding of the algorithm. Specifically, clarify how the Markov Random Field differs from appearance flow and why it outperforms other methods. Additionally, provide a detailed explanation of the deformation field and its computation, as well as the rationale behind the cycle-consistency loss design. It would be beneficial to conduct experiments on higher-resolution datasets to better assess the method's applicability in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the results presented in Tables 3 and 7 by providing a detailed explanation of the measurement methods used for Table 7. An analysis to identify which specific module within the proposed architecture contributes to the reduced computational cost would also be beneficial. Lastly, we encourage the authors to incorporate the clarifications and additional analyses discussed in the rebuttal into the main manuscript or appendix to enhance the paper's comprehensibility.
