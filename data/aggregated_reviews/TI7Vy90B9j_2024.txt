### Key Points
This paper presents a study on last-iterate convergence rates of online learning in monotone games, introducing the Gradient Ascent with Boosting Payoff Perturbation (GABP) algorithm. The GABP algorithm achieves an $O(\log T / T)$ last-iterate convergence rate with full gradient feedback, which is near-optimal, and an improved $O(1/T^{1/7})$ rate under noisy gradient feedback, enhancing prior results of $O(1/T^{1/10})$. Additionally, GABP guarantees an individual dynamic regret of $O(\log^2 T)$ under full gradient feedback. The paper includes numerical experiments on small game instances to demonstrate GABP's effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The problem addressed is relevant, with GABP providing a near-optimal last-iterate convergence rate under full gradient feedback and improved rates under noisy feedback.
- The theoretical development is rigorous, with thorough proofs and a clear presentation of the algorithm and results.
- The paper's organization and clarity, including the use of pseudo-code, enhance understanding.

Weaknesses:  
- GABP does not achieve the optimal $O(1/T)$ last-iterate convergence rate under full gradient feedback, and the rate for noisy feedback is not tight.
- The relationship between GABP and the AOG algorithm is not clearly discussed, lacking insights into their similarities and differences.
- The experimental validation could be expanded to include a broader range of game types and noise levels.
- The paper lacks specific examples illustrating the importance of the feedback models considered.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the relationship between GABP and the AOG algorithm, including an acknowledgment of inspirations from prior works. Additionally, we suggest expanding the experimental validation to cover a wider variety of game types and noise levels. The authors should also provide concrete application examples to illustrate the significance of the full and noisy feedback settings. Finally, including a comparative table with existing literature would help contextualize the contributions more effectively.
