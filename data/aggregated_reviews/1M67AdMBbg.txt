Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a self-supervised learning regime for spatio-temporal data called multi-view masked contrastive learning, which integrates a frame-aggregated attention guided tube mask and a multi-view mask strategy within a student-teacher framework. The authors evaluate the learned representations across multiple downstream tasks on publicly available datasets, demonstrating improvements over recent competing methods. Additionally, the study investigates the impact of different masking rates on endoscopic representation learning using the FAGTM (global views) and RTM (local views) strategies, showing that both excessively high and low masking rates hinder effective representation learning. The paper emphasizes the importance of a balanced masking rate to maximize the model's ability to extract features from video data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The manuscript is well-written, with clear motivations and explanations.
- The background section effectively summarizes related literature and highlights challenges in endoscopy, justifying the proposed approach.
- The experiments are comprehensive, testing learned representations on various tasks (classification, segmentation, detection) across three datasets, with consistent improvements shown in results averaged over three runs. An ablation study is included to analyze the impact of different method components.
- The authors provide a thorough analysis of masking rates and their effects on model performance, supported by empirical data.
- The combination of contrastive learning with masked modeling is a notable contribution, addressing limitations in capturing fine-grained features in endoscopic videos.
- The method, while developed for endoscopy, is applicable to general spatio-temporal imaging and relevant for other medical imaging modalities.

Weaknesses:
- Additional details on downstream tasks are needed, including the number of classes, types of labels, and their acquisition.
- The source code has not yet been released.
- Some passages are confusing and require clarification, particularly regarding experimental details and hyperparameter selection.
- The novelty of the approach is questioned, as it appears to extend existing methods without significant differentiation.
- There are concerns regarding the completeness of comparisons with other methods, particularly the absence of certain baselines like TeCNO and LoViT.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental details, specifically in Section 4.2, by addressing whether all methods were pretrained on the same union of datasets and how hyperparameters were selected. Additionally, please provide more information on the downstream tasks, including the number of classes and label types. We urge the authors to discuss potential negative societal impacts in the broad impact statement. We also recommend improving the novelty aspect by clearly articulating how their approach significantly differs from existing methods, particularly in the context of self-distillation and contrastive learning. Furthermore, we suggest including missing baselines such as TeCNO and LoViT in the comparisons to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of their method's performance. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the pre-training epochs and consider conducting ablation studies on larger model architectures to better illustrate the effectiveness of their approach. We also suggest proofreading the manuscript for typos and confusing passages, particularly in the sections highlighted in the reviews.
