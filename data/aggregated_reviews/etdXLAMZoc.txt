Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents LibMOON, a comprehensive gradient-based multi-objective optimization library implemented in PyTorch. It addresses the gap in existing MOO libraries, which primarily support evolutionary algorithms, by offering state-of-the-art gradient-based methods that can scale to large models with millions of parameters. The library supports both synthetic and real-world problems, providing a fair benchmark and being open-sourced for the community. The authors propose a standardized framework for evaluating gradient-based multi-objective solvers, including discrete Pareto solution optimization and multi-objective Bayesian optimization. Improvements in documentation, experimental results, flexibility for community contributions, and GPU acceleration analysis have also been highlighted.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of a gradient-based MOO library is a significant advancement, filling a notable gap in the field.
2. LibMOON incorporates over twenty state-of-the-art gradient-based MOO methods, offering a wide range of tools for researchers and practitioners.
3. The library's open-source nature and easy installation via pip enhance accessibility and encourage community adoption.
4. The documentation has been significantly improved, making it user-friendly and well-organized.
5. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of LibMOON on various tasks, validating the library's capabilities and aiding method selection for practitioners.
6. Community engagement is encouraged through examples and collaboration requests.

Weaknesses:
1. A more detailed comparative analysis of LibMOON against existing libraries would strengthen the argument for its novelty and effectiveness.
2. Usability and documentation could still be improved; comprehensive tutorials and user feedback are lacking.
3. The current implementation lacks backend-agnostic capabilities, limiting its applicability across different platforms.
4. Detailed benchmarks on performance scalability across different hardware configurations are not provided.
5. Some reviewers expressed concerns regarding writing clarity and the need for further adjustments in the presentation of code snippets, including font size and caption placement.
6. The supplementary file appears incomplete, lacking explanations for metrics.
7. The empirical results do not sufficiently demonstrate the library's versatility or discuss trade-offs between different methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparative analysis by including benchmarks or performance comparisons against existing libraries like pymoo, PlatEMO, and Pagmo. Additionally, enhancing usability through comprehensive tutorials and documentation would benefit new users. Improving the backend-agnostic implementation of LibMOON is essential to enhance its versatility across various platforms. The authors should also ensure that the supplementary file includes complete explanations for all metrics. Providing detailed benchmarks on performance scalability across various hardware configurations is crucial. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the terminology used in code snippets and adjust the font size and caption placement for better readability, while also including a discussion on the trade-offs between different methods to provide deeper insights into the library's capabilities.
