Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DrugCLIP, a novel virtual screening framework that reformulates the drug binding problem as an information retrieval task. The authors utilize a contrastive learning approach to learn representations of molecules and proteins, aiming to identify potential binding interactions without relying on explicit binding-affinity scores. The framework incorporates a biological-knowledge inspired augmentation method, HomoAug, to enhance data diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DrugCLIP outperforms traditional methods, particularly in zero-shot settings, across multiple benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- DrugCLIP effectively employs a self-supervised multi-modal learning approach, outperforming previous label-dependent methods in terms of efficiency and cost.
- The introduction of the HomoAug augmentation technique is innovative and addresses data scarcity in drug discovery.
- Strong experimental results, including human evaluations, validate the framework's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental settings lack detailed explanations, which could aid reader comprehension.
- The phrase "an end-to-end manner" in line 109 may mislead readers regarding the framework's two-phased nature and requires clarification.
- The treatment of missing biological data as negative samples is problematic; recent self-supervised learning techniques could be utilized to address false negatives.
- The model's interpretability is limited compared to traditional docking methods, which provide clearer insights into binding mechanisms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental settings to enhance reader understanding. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the "end-to-end manner" statement to accurately reflect the two-phased nature of DrugCLIP. The authors should also consider adopting recent self-supervised learning techniques to better handle missing biological data. Finally, enhancing the model's interpretability by providing correlation analyses and demonstrating interaction patterns learned by DrugCLIP would strengthen the paper's contribution to the field.
