Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a benchmark for Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) in Natural Language Processing (NLP), addressing the challenges of transferring knowledge across domains and distinguishing unknown samples. The authors propose two novel metrics, Performance Drop Rate (PDR) and Distinction Difficulty Score (DDS), to evaluate these challenges. Extensive experiments demonstrate the performance of existing methods on the benchmark, revealing that UniDA methods from computer vision can be effectively applied to NLP.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark and testbed for evaluating UniDA in NLP, covering multiple datasets with varying difficulty levels.
- The proposed metrics (PDR and DDS) enhance the evaluation of domain and category gaps, contributing to the novelty of the work.
- Empirical evaluations provide insights into the performance of existing UniDA methods in the context of language inputs.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed metric for the task is incomprehensive, as the H-score does not adequately reflect the model's ability to address specific gaps.
- The evaluation is limited to text classification tasks, restricting the generalizability of findings to other NLP applications.
- The study lacks evaluations of larger language models and zero-shot or few-shot learning capabilities, limiting the understanding of UniDA methods across varying model sizes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comprehensiveness of the proposed metrics to better reflect the challenges of UniDA. Additionally, expanding the evaluation to include larger language models and incorporating zero-shot and few-shot models would provide a more thorough assessment of UniDA's performance. Finally, addressing the limitations of focusing solely on classification tasks could enhance the applicability of the findings to a broader range of NLP applications.
