Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Neural P3M, a framework that enhances geometric Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by integrating mesh points and utilizing Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for efficient computation of long-range interactions. The framework effectively models both short-range and long-range interactions, addressing limitations in existing methods. Empirical studies demonstrate significant improvements in energy and force predictions across various datasets, including MD22 and OE62, outperforming traditional Ewald methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Neural P3M captures long-range interactions more accurately than traditional GNNs, addressing a critical limitation in molecular modeling.
- The framework is grounded in established principles like Ewald summation, enhancing its credibility.
- It is compatible with various existing GNN architectures, promoting widespread adoption.
- The reduced computational complexity allows for efficient handling of large-scale systems, with faster computation times compared to Ewald methods.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty and overall impact of the work may be limited, as Ewald summation has been previously adopted in GNNs.
- The experimental design lacks comprehensiveness, with insufficient comparisons to relevant works and limited exploration of hyperparameter impacts.
- The integration of mesh and atom representations may lead to increased memory usage, posing challenges for large datasets.
- Some trivial errors exist in the presentation of results, such as in Table 2.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction by explicitly referencing the Ewald summation in subsequent sections and elaborating on the connection between Equation 17 and Equation 9. Additionally, we suggest providing ablation studies on the proposed components and discussing the effectiveness of the FFT in enhancing performance. It would be beneficial to address the different choices for the distance cut-off and their implications on performance. Furthermore, including comparisons of GPU memory usage across methods and exploring the feasibility of uniform hyperparameters across diverse datasets would strengthen the experimental section. Lastly, consider simplifying the mathematical presentation by removing unnecessary equations or moving them to the appendix.
