Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SEEDS, a few-step sampler for diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) that accelerates sampling by utilizing exponential integrators. The authors claim that SEEDS achieves competitive sampling quality with fewer function evaluations (NFEs) compared to existing methods. The method is theoretically grounded, providing exact solutions for diffusion stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and rigorous convergence guarantees, including a strong order of 1.0. The authors clarify that the It√¥-Taylor expansion is necessary for establishing the theoretical foundation of SEEDS and argue that the stochastic noise contributions in SEEDS-2 satisfy the Markov property, ensuring independence of Brownian increments on non-overlapping intervals. However, the novelty of the proposed representation of diffusion SDEs is questioned, as it appears to rely on established techniques in the literature. Additionally, while SEEDS distinguishes itself from DPM-Solver by addressing robustness tasks and providing theoretical justifications for the choice of noise components, some reviewers express concerns that not all points have been sufficiently addressed.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors provide exact solutions for diffusion SDEs and a thorough theoretical derivation, ensuring clarity and rigor in their approach.
- SEEDS demonstrates strong empirical performance, achieving competitive results with fewer NFEs across various benchmarks, including CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-64.
- The paper is well-written and self-contained, making it accessible to readers.
- The paper provides a clear theoretical foundation for the SEEDS method, including strong order convergence guarantees.
- The authors effectively clarify the distinction between SEEDS and DPM-Solver, particularly in terms of robustness and theoretical contributions.
- The explanation of stochastic terms and their benefits in generation aspects is well-articulated.

Weaknesses:
- The claimed novelty of the representation of diffusion SDEs is overstated, as it relies on well-known techniques in the SDE community.
- The convergence guarantees provided may not be optimal, particularly when compared to higher-order methods like the stochastic Runge-Kutta method.
- The method requires a substantial number of NFEs to maintain sampling quality, limiting its practical applications.
- Some reviewers express concerns that not all points have been sufficiently addressed, particularly regarding the significance of the contributions compared to existing methods.
- The explanation of the specific benefits of stochastic terms in generation quality could be elaborated further.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the connection between SEEDS-1/2/3 and the stochastic Runge-Kutta method combined with the Exponential Integrator. Additionally, the authors should justify the novelty of their solution representation more robustly, considering existing literature. It would be beneficial to provide a quantitative comparison of the SEEDS-3 algorithm's generation speed with actual runtime and NFE, similar to the DPM-Solver's evaluation. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve their responses to the remaining concerns of other reviewers to ensure all aspects of the paper are adequately addressed. Lastly, we suggest that the authors provide a more detailed explanation of the specific benefits of incorporating stochastic terms in generation quality, as this could strengthen their argument regarding the advantages of SEEDS over existing methods.
