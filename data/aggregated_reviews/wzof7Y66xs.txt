Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents hierarchical selective classification, a method that selects the hierarchical granularity of its prediction based on uncertainty. The authors propose an algorithm that guarantees target accuracy and formulates hierarchical risk and coverage, allowing for benchmarking against different selective classification methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the method's effectiveness across 1115 ImageNet classifiers.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
* The paper is well-written and intuitive, providing a solid background on selective classification and hierarchical risk.  
* The theoretical analysis is sound, relying on conformal prediction, and the method shows potential in high-risk settings.  
* Extensive experimental results indicate the superiority of the proposed method over DARTS and a non-hierarchical baseline.  

Weaknesses:  
* The similarity to conformal prediction raises concerns about the novelty of the work.  
* The requirement for a pre-defined hierarchical class tree limits applicability, particularly in complex scenarios.  
* The method operates post-hoc rather than being optimized during training, potentially affecting performance.  
* The empirical evaluation lacks detail and could benefit from optimized training regimes for hierarchical selective classification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty discussion by addressing the similarity to conformal prediction and clarifying how their method differs. Additionally, we suggest exploring ways to unsupervisedly learn the hierarchical structure to enhance applicability. The authors should consider integrating the method into training rather than relying solely on inference. Finally, we encourage the inclusion of more baseline approaches and datasets in the experimental section to provide a comprehensive understanding of the method's performance.
