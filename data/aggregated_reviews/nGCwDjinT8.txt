### Key Points
This paper presents an Adaptive Hinge Balance Loss (HingeABL) aimed at addressing the class imbalance issue in document-level relation extraction. The authors propose a combination of hinge loss and cross-entropy loss, utilizing Separate Adaptive Thresholding (SAT) to modulate the loss function and focus on hard, misclassified relations. The evaluation on the Re-DocRED dataset demonstrates the method's effectiveness in improving F1 scores and reducing false negatives.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is well-motivated and effectively addresses a significant problem in document-level relation extraction.
- The paper is well-structured, clearly identifying the problem, its root causes, and presenting a viable solution supported by experimental evidence.
- HingeABL shows consistent improvement over three fundamental methods.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks comparisons with state-of-the-art models, particularly those using margin-based losses, which is essential for contextualizing the proposed method's performance.
- The method does not adequately address the class imbalance issues, as the proposed weighting mechanism does not favor minority relations.
- The evaluation metric used (micro F1) may obscure the performance of minority classes, necessitating the use of macro F1 for a more accurate assessment.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with state-of-the-art models, particularly those employing margin-based losses, to better contextualize their results. Additionally, the authors should consider implementing a weighting mechanism that favors minority relations to address the class imbalance more effectively. We also suggest using macro F1 as the evaluation metric to provide a clearer picture of the method's performance on minority classes. Lastly, please clarify the use of the term "imbalance" if it refers to issues beyond class distribution.
