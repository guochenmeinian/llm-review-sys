Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach called Zipfian whitening for static word embeddings, which utilizes empirical word frequencies as a prior instead of a uniform prior. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method through empirical results on downstream tasks and provide a metric for measuring symmetry in word embeddings. Theoretical connections to exponential family distributions are also discussed to support the superiority of Zipfian whitening over uniform whitening.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach introduces a novel method for inducing symmetry in the embedding space based on Zipf's law.
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- Empirical results indicate the efficiency of Zipfian whitening on downstream tasks.
- The authors provide a comprehensive analysis and draw connections to prior research.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation is limited to one language and one dataset, which restricts the generalizability of the findings.
- The empirical results are based on small, unrealistic datasets, and the relevance to dynamic or causal embeddings is unclear.
- Some theoretical explanations are presented at a high level, making it difficult to assess their correctness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including a broader range of languages and datasets to enhance the generalizability of their findings. Additionally, exploring the impact of varying empirical distributions on downstream task performance would be beneficial. Addressing the handling of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) embeddings, particularly for low-frequency tokens, is crucial, especially for low-resource languages. We also suggest incorporating token-level embeddings, as they are a standard in the field, to strengthen the paper's claims. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the theoretical sections and provide more detailed explanations to support their arguments.
