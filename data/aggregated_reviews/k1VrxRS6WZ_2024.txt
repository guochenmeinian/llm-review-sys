Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach named SLAN for classifying instances with unknown labels in a multi-label open set recognition (MLOSR) setting. SLAN leverages sub-labeling information enriched by structural details in the feature space. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through extensive experiments across various datasets, demonstrating its capability to address the challenges posed by MLOSR.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a relevant and novel problem in MLOSR, expanding the scope of traditional multi-label learning by addressing unknown open labels.
- It provides a clear and thorough analysis of the SLAN method, supported by comprehensive empirical validations that show superior or comparable performance across multiple evaluation metrics.
- The methodology is well-structured and easy to follow, enhancing the clarity of the presented ideas.

Weaknesses:
- The introduction of the MLOSR problem may overlap with existing tasks like zero-shot multi-label classification and open-vocabulary multi-label classification, raising questions about its distinctiveness.
- Limited baselines for comparison are provided; the paper should include state-of-the-art methods specifically designed for zero-shot and open-vocabulary multi-label classification.
- The SLAN approach involves multiple optimization problems, which may not scale well to larger datasets, and the paper lacks a discussion on computational efficiency and scalability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by including a flowchart outlining the key steps in the proposed approach. Additionally, the authors should provide a more extensive experimental analysis in the Parameter Sensitivity Analysis section that considers the interactions between different parameter combinations. It would also be beneficial to elaborate on the performance differences of SLAN compared to other methods across various datasets and to address the robustness of SLAN when faced with errors or irrelevant labels. Finally, we suggest that the authors consider the theoretical foundation of their approach and discuss the interpretability of the SLAN algorithm.
