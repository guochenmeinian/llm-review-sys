### Key Points
This paper presents ClaPS, a Clustering and Pruning method for Efficient Black-box Prompt Search, aimed at enhancing prompt-based learning for large pretrained language models (LLMs). The authors propose a novel approach that reduces the search space by clustering tokens in the embedding space and pruning redundant candidates. Empirical results demonstrate that ClaPS achieves state-of-the-art performance with improved runtime compared to existing methods, addressing the high computational costs associated with black-box discrete prompt optimization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles an important problem in black-box prompt search, showcasing strong performance across various tasks and LLMs.
- The methodology is intuitive, and the empirical results indicate significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency.
- Figure 4 effectively visualizes the sensitivity analysis and influential prompt tokens, enhancing clarity.

Weaknesses:
- The complexity of the multi-stage ClaPS method may hinder understanding and reproducibility.
- There is insufficient analysis on design choices, and the paper lacks comprehensive implementation details.
- The evaluation is limited to text classification tasks, raising questions about the method's generalizability to other tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the ClaPS methodology by providing more detailed explanations of each step involved in the process. Additionally, conducting ablation studies on the search algorithm is necessary to validate its effectiveness in the reduced search space. We suggest evaluating the method on a broader range of tasks beyond text classification to demonstrate its versatility. Furthermore, reporting standard deviations and conducting statistical tests when comparing ClaPS with baseline methods would enhance the reliability of the performance claims. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide a qualitative comparison of the prompts generated by ClaPS versus those from existing methods to highlight differences more clearly.
