Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a conditional 3D generation method that aligns features of different modalities during training of a 3D autoencoder (AE). The authors propose using a latent diffusion model to generate latent vectors for a 3D decoder conditioned on text or image inputs. The results demonstrate impressive performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The method successfully addresses multiple tasks, which is significant for a generation-related paper.
2. The main figure is clear and facilitates understanding, enhancing the paper's readability.
3. The core idea appears original, leveraging the alignment of 3D shapes with 2D data.

Weaknesses:
1. There is a lack of qualitative results showcasing the diversity of the proposed method, which is crucial for generative approaches.
2. The concept of pre-alignment lacks convincing justification, as other methods also align text/image to shape latent space. Further discussion on the advantages of this approach is needed.
3. The novelty is limited due to reliance on existing architectures and methods, such as those in [63].

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the qualitative analysis by including results that demonstrate the diversity of generated outputs. Additionally, we suggest providing a more robust discussion on the advantages of the pre-alignment concept compared to existing methods. Clarifying the necessity of using a latent diffusion model in conjunction with pre-aligned features would strengthen the argument. Addressing the concerns raised regarding the performance comparisons and the clarity of the experimental implementation is also essential.
