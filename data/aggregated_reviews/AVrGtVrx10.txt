Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to address the missing modality robustness problem in multimodal training through probabilistic conformal distillation (PCD). The authors propose an objective function that promotes consistent latent representations of multimodal embeddings for data points within the same class and ensures geometric consistency among inter-class representations. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of PCD in enhancing robustness against missing modalities, particularly in classification tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-organized and the proposed loss function (PCD) is intuitively appealing.
2. Simulations indicate a clear advantage of the proposed strategy in classification tasks.
3. The idea of probabilistic conformal distillation is innovative, providing a mild approach to propagate task-relevant information while mitigating overfitting.

Weaknesses:
1. The applicability of PCD is limited, as it relies on a clear definition of positive and negative points, which is not straightforward in many multimodal learning scenarios, such as cross-modal retrieval and missing-modal imputation.
2. The scalability of PCD raises concerns due to the quadratic scaling of loss \(L_g\) with batch size, necessitating a formal analysis of time and memory complexity.
3. Improvements in segmentation tasks appear marginal; thus, error bars should be included to assess statistical significance.
4. Some equations are misleading or unclear, particularly regarding the definitions and implications of certain terms, which could hinder comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their equations, particularly in Eq. (2) and Eq. (3), to clearly distinguish between cumulative and individual probabilities. Additionally, the authors should provide evidence or ablation studies to justify the shared coefficient in Eq. (10) and clarify the stability of this optimization. It would also be beneficial to conduct multi-round trials for experiments in Table 1 to report standard deviations for statistical significance. Lastly, addressing the motivation behind the proposed properties and the methodology's general logic could enhance the paper's readability and impact.
