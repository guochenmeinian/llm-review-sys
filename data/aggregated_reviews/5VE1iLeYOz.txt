Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an algorithm that approximates centroid linkage clustering, achieving subquadratic time complexity through a dynamic approximate nearest neighbor (NN) search data structure. The authors propose a method that allows merging any two clusters within a factor of c of the closest clusters, rather than strictly the closest pairs. The experimental results indicate that this approximation does not significantly compromise clustering quality, often yielding better results than optimal algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed algorithm significantly improves upon existing methods, particularly in theoretical runtime, breaking the quadratic barrier typical of hierarchical clustering.
- The dynamic approximate NN search algorithm with adaptive updates is innovative and of independent interest.
- Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the approximate centroid HAC algorithm closely matches the exact centroid HAC results while providing substantial speed improvements.

Weaknesses:
- The techniques are primarily tailored to centroid linkage, with limited discussion on their generalizability to other linkage functions.
- The ANNS algorithm used in experiments differs from the one analyzed in the paper, leading to potential confusion regarding the contributions.
- The novelty of the ‘approximate centroid HAC’ concept remains unclear, independent of the ANNS algorithm.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by explicitly discussing the generalizability of their techniques to other linkage functions and identifying potential bottlenecks. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the relationship between the ANNS algorithm used in experiments and the one proposed in the paper to avoid confusion. It would also be beneficial to include more diverse datasets in the evaluation and to provide a more rigorous theoretical presentation, particularly regarding the objective function in Theorem 5. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore comparisons with other approximate HAC methods and to consider using modern datasets for benchmarking.
