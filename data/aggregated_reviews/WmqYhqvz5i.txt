### Key Points
This paper presents a study on contextual bandits and imitation learning with preference-based feedback. The authors propose an oracle-based contextual bandit algorithm that achieves both worst-case and instance-dependent regret bounds, along with guarantees on query complexity. The algorithm is further extended to the imitation learning setting, maintaining provable performance metrics. The interaction protocol involves rounds where the learner receives context, requests expert comparisons, and selects actions based on feedback indicating which of two actions is preferred.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method demonstrates strong theoretical guarantees on regret and query complexity, with sufficient discussion to differentiate it from similar algorithms like MinMaxDB and AdaCB.
- The paper is well-structured, clearly written, and the proofs appear self-contained and rigorous.
- Lower bounds are provided to justify the upper bounds on regret and query complexity.

Weaknesses:
- The relationship between the regret bound in Theorem 1 and the optimal regret bound for dueling bandits is unclear, particularly regarding the scale of $dim_{E}(\mathcal{F}, \frac{\Delta}{2A^2})$.
- Practical implementation concerns arise due to reliance on an online regression solver, which may not be feasible under the preference-based feedback model.
- The instance-dependent regret bound shows room for improvement compared to existing methods like AdaCB.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity on how the regret bound in Theorem 1 relates to optimal bounds for dueling bandits. Additionally, providing concrete examples of the online regression oracle applicable to the preference-based feedback model would enhance the practical applicability of the proposed method. Furthermore, we suggest discussing the tightness of the instance-dependent bound and exploring the potential for a simpler function class that maintains similar regret bounds while reducing computational complexity. Lastly, including experimental results to support theoretical claims would strengthen the paper's contributions.
