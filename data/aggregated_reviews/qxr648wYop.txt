### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to the multi-scenario recommendation task by proposing a causal-driven adaptive network, termed M-scan. The authors utilize a Scenario Bias Eliminator to mitigate biases from other scenarios and a Scenario-Aware Co-Attention module to capture user interests across scenarios. The results demonstrate improvements over existing methods on real-world datasets, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed model.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The work effectively addresses prediction bias in multi-scenario recommendations through a causal-driven framework.
2. The analysis of both direct and indirect influences of scenarios on user behavior is a significant contribution.
3. The experimental results validate the proposed model's effectiveness, supported by ablation studies.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper does not clearly differentiate the multi-scenario recommendation task from cross-domain recommendation tasks, leaving potential confusion.
2. The rationale behind not considering user interests across all scenarios during final inference is not adequately discussed.
3. The counterfactual reasoning in the Scenario Bias Eliminator module lacks clarity and demonstration.
4. The writing quality is inconsistent, with several notation errors and unclear explanations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the differentiation between multi-scenario and cross-domain recommendation tasks to clarify their contributions. Additionally, we suggest providing a more thorough discussion on the implications of not considering user interests across all scenarios. To enhance clarity, the authors should better explain the counterfactual reasoning in the Scenario Bias Eliminator module. Furthermore, we advise correcting notation errors and improving the overall writing quality, particularly in the introduction and related works sections. Finally, including additional datasets and detailed experimental settings would strengthen the validation of the proposed model.
