Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on learning to defer (L2D), where a classifier can defer decisions to an expert while minimizing costs. The authors propose a new family of surrogate losses based on comp-sum losses, establishing realizable H-consistency and H-consistency bounds under specific conditions. Notably, they demonstrate that certain expert cost choices lead to surrogate losses that are both Bayes and realizable H consistent. The work also addresses an open question from prior research and evaluates the proposed surrogates against existing baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The originality of the proposed surrogate losses and the theoretical proofs is commendable, particularly in establishing conditions for realizable H-consistency.
- The paper is well-written, clearly articulating its contributions and theoretical insights, making it accessible to readers.
- The work closes an important open question in the literature, potentially guiding future research in learning to defer.

Weaknesses:
- The realizable H-consistency results are limited to a subset of comp-sum losses, raising questions about broader applicability.
- The requirement for querying expert responses for training under the proposed loss function may contradict the motivation behind learning to defer.
- Some theoretical results necessitate case-by-case analysis, which could be streamlined for all comp-sum losses.
- The experimental evaluation is somewhat restricted, lacking clarity on the expert algorithm used and the scenarios where the new surrogate outperforms prior methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 5, particularly regarding the implications of realizable settings on surrogate minimizability gaps. Additionally, we suggest exploring the generalizability of the realizable H-consistency results to all comp-sum losses. To enhance practical applicability, consider addressing the training cost associated with querying expert responses. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide a more comprehensive empirical evaluation that clearly delineates the conditions under which the proposed surrogate is superior to existing methods.
