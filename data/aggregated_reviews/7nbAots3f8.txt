Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for learning unsigned distance functions (UDFs) called LoSF-UDF, which is not dependent on specific training datasets, unlike existing supervised learning methods. The authors utilize a specific neural network architecture to predict UDF values from point cloud data, demonstrating that once trained on synthetic datasets, the method can be directly applied to new datasets without modification. The approach is evaluated on various datasets, including ShapeNet, DeepFashion3D, and ShapeNetCars, achieving good experimental results and showing robustness against noise and outliers. The authors argue that their method effectively generalizes across different surface types, despite being trained solely on synthetic data. Users can fine-tune the hyperparameter related to the size of local patches through a linear scan if the default setting is suboptimal, which enhances usability and eliminates the need for re-training.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The analysis of local surface patches is well-conceived, allowing for localized treatment of surface reconstruction, which is a significant contribution.
2. The method shows impressive performance in noisy conditions, outperforming other approaches in such scenarios.
3. The dataset independence allows for direct application to new datasets, enhancing the method's versatility.
4. High runtime performance and robustness against noise and outliers are notable strengths.
5. The simple fine-tuning process for hyperparameters enhances usability.

Weaknesses:
1. The architecture's complexity is not sufficiently validated; a quantitative evaluation of its suitability is needed.
2. The role of the cross-attention mechanism remains unclear, and the architecture lacks comprehensive ablation studies.
3. The reliance on a single model-dependent parameter may limit flexibility in certain contexts.
4. The evaluation lacks quantitative results on real-world data, and the inference time is not addressed, raising concerns about practical applicability.
5. While experimental results are good, they may require further validation across additional datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the cross-attention mechanism and provide a detailed quantitative evaluation of the architecture's performance. Additionally, including specific details about the experimental setup, such as query grid resolution and Chamfer distance parameters, would enhance the paper's rigor. A time evaluation comparing the proposed method's reconstruction speed against baselines is necessary to substantiate claims of computational efficiency. We also suggest conducting quantitative assessments on real-world scanned data to validate the method's robustness beyond synthetic scenarios. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the implications of the single model-dependent parameter and explore its impact on flexibility, as well as provide more extensive validation of experimental results across a broader range of datasets to strengthen the paper's claims.
