### Key Points
This paper presents **Distribution-Aware Graph Prompt Tuning (DAGPrompT)**, which addresses challenges in graph prompt tuning for heterophilic graphs by integrating the **GLoRA module** and **hop-specific prompts**. The GLoRA module enhances message passing and model parameter adjustment, while hop-specific prompts incorporate multi-hop information to improve predictions. The authors provide a clear motivation and extensive experiments demonstrating the method's superiority over existing approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The identification of challenges in adapting graph prompting methods to complex graphs is commendable.
2. Extensive experiments validate the proposed method's effectiveness compared to previous techniques.
3. The writing is clear and accessible, facilitating understanding.

Weaknesses:
1. The GLoRA module shows notable similarities to prior research, limiting its novelty, and the use of multi-hop information lacks significant innovation.
2. The GLoRA module primarily modifies existing edges, potentially overlooking critical high-hop edges in heterophilic graphs.
3. The contributions largely involve adding parameters for model configuration adjustments, aligning more with low-rank adaptation methods than with true graph prompt tuning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of the GLoRA module by clearly differentiating it from existing methods and addressing the limitations in handling high-hop edges. Additionally, the authors should provide a more comprehensive comparison with related works, particularly those that address hop-specific variations. Clarifying the terminology around "distribution" in the context of heterophilic graphs would enhance understanding. Furthermore, we suggest including results for link prediction tasks as stated in subsection 3.2 and discussing the implications of the homophily ratio observed in the experiments. Finally, a deeper analysis of the method's efficiency and complexity, especially regarding scalability and real-time applications, would strengthen the paper.
