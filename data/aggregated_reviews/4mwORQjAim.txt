Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a significant advancement in topological data analysis (TDA) by vectorizing multiparameter persistence homology (MPH) through signed barcodes. The authors propose two vectorization techniques: kernel (MP-SW) and direct (MP-C), which enhance the computational feasibility of MPH while providing richer information than traditional persistent homology (PH). Additionally, the paper includes a comparative analysis of vectorization methods, emphasizing the use of consistent filtrations for fair performance evaluation. The authors discuss how different choices of filtrations affect outcomes, highlighting the advantages of Rips over Alpha for UCR data and the use of KDE instead of DTM for its ease of tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that their model consistently outperforms existing MPH vectorizations across various applications, including point cloud classification and graph similarity measurements.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors cleverly utilize signed barcodes to achieve practical vectorizations, addressing a critical need in the field.
- The versatility of the proposed vectorizations (MP-SW and MP-C) is valuable for machine learning applications, as performance varies by domain.
- Computational efficiency is significantly improved compared to existing MP vectorizations, making it a notable contribution from a machine learning perspective.
- The paper is well-organized, with rigorous definitions and extensive experimental validation.
- The authors demonstrate a commitment to improving their methodology by rerunning experiments and including a comprehensive discussion of filtration choices.
- The paper addresses the stability properties of Rips and the theoretical advantages of KDE, which are well-articulated.

Weaknesses:
- The technical complexity may be challenging for non-expert audiences, although efforts have been made to enhance accessibility.
- Performance in graph classification and virtual screening is less robust compared to point cloud settings.
- Hyperparameter tuning poses challenges, requiring expertise in TDA for practical applications.
- The clarity regarding the definition of the nearest neighbor in baseline B1 is lacking, as the term appears infrequently in the paper.
- The rationale for not using all pairwise distances as a baseline is not adequately justified, despite its theoretical backing.
- The response to literature citations lacks specificity, failing to connect claims to exact results or page numbers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the accessibility of the paper for non-experts by simplifying some technical aspects without compromising depth. Additionally, we suggest including further experiments to validate the stability theorems and estimate the Lipschitz constant. Clarifying the inconsistencies in the definitions of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein norm and providing a brief discussion on the choice of filtrations and their influence on results would enhance the paper's clarity. We also recommend improving the clarity of the definition of B1 by explicitly stating whether it refers to a single distance to the nearest neighbor. Furthermore, the authors should provide a detailed explanation of the proportion of datasets where their methods outperform the baselines B1, B2, and B3. We suggest that the authors consider including all pairwise distances as a baseline, given its theoretical advantages. Lastly, we encourage the authors to enhance their literature review by linking claims to specific results or citations, ensuring that they acknowledge previous work that addresses similar problems.
