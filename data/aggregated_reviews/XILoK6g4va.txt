### Key Points
This paper investigates an approach to dialog act recognition using both textual and audio inputs. The authors propose a modality-fusing architecture that includes feature extraction from pretrained RoBERTa and Whisper models, unimodal encoding through convolution and LSTM with attention, and a modality-fusing encoding that combines these embeddings. The model is evaluated on the MRDA and EMOTyDA datasets, demonstrating performance improvements in customized online settings but slightly lagging behind state-of-the-art unimodal baselines in oracle settings. The ablation study indicates that the modality-fusing component significantly contributes to performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper presents an effective method for combining textual and audio features for dialog act recognition.
- Comprehensive experiments and quantitative analysis show the proposed system outperforms several baselines.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the hierarchical fusion approach is limited, as similar concepts have been previously introduced.
- The experimental design and model architecture do not clearly indicate which factors most significantly improve performance.
- Important technical details are missing, and the writing could be clearer regarding certain architectural choices.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental design to allow readers to determine the most impactful factors on performance. Additionally, please provide more details on the cross attention mechanism mentioned in Section 3.3.1. We suggest addressing the novelty of the hierarchical fusion by elaborating on its unique contributions compared to existing methods. Furthermore, consider including a broader range of references in the related work section to better contextualize the research. Lastly, clarify the rationale behind the choice of architectures, particularly the use of BiLSTM over other potential models for early-stage fusion.
