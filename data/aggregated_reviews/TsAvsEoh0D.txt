### Key Points
This paper presents a new benchmark dataset called the Wason Inductive Logic Test (WILT), designed to evaluate the multi-turn reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). The benchmark requires models to infer a hidden Boolean function through a series of test cases, emphasizing inductive reasoning and robustness against memorization. The authors demonstrate that existing LLMs struggle with this task, highlighting significant differences in their reasoning capabilities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The benchmark addresses a novel problem of multi-turn inductive reasoning, modeled after the classic Wason 2-4-6 task, which is particularly challenging for LLMs.
- The authors evaluate a wide range of models, providing a comprehensive analysis of their performance across various reasoning metrics.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a thorough review of related literature, particularly comparisons with existing interactive reasoning benchmarks, which could enhance the contextual understanding of WILT.
- There is insufficient theoretical analysis regarding why models struggle with WILT, and the absence of proven prompting methods, such as chain-of-thought reasoning, limits the evaluation's depth.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by including comparisons with existing interactive reasoning benchmarks to provide context for WILT. Additionally, we suggest incorporating a more detailed discussion on the nature of model failures and exploring the integration of prompting techniques like chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance the assessment of LLM capabilities on WILT.
