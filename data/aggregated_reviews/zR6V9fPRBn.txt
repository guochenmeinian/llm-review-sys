Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Shapley value-based cohort discovery method that constructs a "Negative Sample Shapley Field" to effectively cluster and separate negative samples in healthcare datasets. The authors propose calculating the data Shapley value of negative samples to identify those that contribute most to the predictive power of models. They argue that their work extends the concept of Shapley values to explore interrelationships between samples, emphasizing the significance of negative samples in revealing future positives and pathological correlations. The methodology includes representation learning via a stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) to address nonuniform changes in Shapley values, followed by clustering in the learned representation space to identify significant negative examples. Empirical evaluations provide insights into the clinical relevance of discovered cohorts, supported by clinician commentary.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses the important cohort discovery problem in healthcare, highlighting the under-analysis of negative samples.
- The proposed method is straightforward and demonstrates improved classifier performance by filtering negative samples based on Shapley values.
- The authors provide a unique perspective on cohort discovery by focusing on negative samples, which is a valuable contribution to medical research.
- The proposed methodology demonstrates effectiveness in identifying negative samples and outperforms traditional algorithms in clustering analysis.
- The results are clinically validated, showcasing the medical utility of the proposed approach.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks sufficient technical novelty and does not compare the proposed method against baseline approaches, limiting the understanding of its performance.
- Key concepts, such as the role of data Shapley values and the non-uniform distribution of negative samples, are not well explained, hindering clarity.
- The computational complexity of the proposed approach is inadequately addressed, particularly regarding the isotropy constraints and the evaluation of the entire negative set.
- Concerns regarding the feasibility of the proposed techniques, particularly the computational demands of calculating Shapley values, remain unaddressed.
- The novelty of the paper is questioned, as cohort discovery and the asymmetry between positive and negative examples are established problems in health analytics.
- The paper may require substantial revisions to incorporate additional experiments and clarifications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of key concepts, particularly the role of data Shapley values and the intuition behind their use. Additionally, the authors should conduct more exhaustive empirical evaluations, including comparisons with alternative methods to better contextualize their findings. Addressing the computational complexity of the proposed method and providing a clearer analysis of its feasibility would also enhance the paper's rigor. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors provide further justification for the novelty of their approach in the context of existing literature on cohort discovery and Shapley values. Incorporating more comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods could strengthen their claims of superiority. Lastly, we encourage the authors to revise the manuscript to integrate the additional experiments and clarifications discussed in their responses.
