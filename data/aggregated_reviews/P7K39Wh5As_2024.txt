### Key Points
This paper presents an interesting adversarial attack against NMT models by inserting a word between two sentences, causing the model to ignore the second sentence. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this attack using the WMT14 test set on state-of-the-art NMT models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The overall writing is well structured and easy to follow.  
2. The proposed attack has a clear mathematical formulation and is well-explained.  
3. The evaluation is comprehensive, with detailed performance metrics (ASR, BLEU, BERTScore, Perplexity) to assess the attack's success.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The paper lacks sufficient discussion on the setup of the experiment tasks and the rationale behind design choices.  
2. The experiments are limited to English-to-French and English-to-German tasks; additional experiments on more language pairs would enhance the generalizability of the NMT-Obfuscator.  
3. The comparison with only the baseline method (Suffix-Dropper) does not provide a comprehensive view of whether this attack outperforms other existing adversarial attacks in NMT.  
4. Minor issue: elaboration in the abstract and conclusion regarding the different NMT models and success rates would be beneficial rather than solely descriptive.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the experimental setup and design choices to provide clearer insights. Additionally, we suggest expanding the experiments to include more language pairs to better assess the generalizability of the NMT-Obfuscator. It would also be advantageous to compare the proposed attack with a broader range of existing adversarial attacks in NMT. Finally, we encourage the authors to elaborate more in the abstract and conclusion on the different NMT models and their success rates.
