Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel task called human-assisting dexterous grasping, which aims to train a policy for controlling a robotic hand's fingers based on human wrist movements. The authors propose a two-stage framework that includes a Grasping Gradient Field (GraspGF) for estimating grasping success and a history-conditional residual policy for determining grasping execution timing. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms baseline approaches in user-awareness and practicality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The task introduces a unique aspect of shared autonomy between humans and robots, which has not been extensively explored.
- The application of the Denoising Score Matching method is innovative.
- The framework effectively separates finger target positioning and movement velocities, enhancing learning efficiency.
- Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- The qualitative results suggest that grasping actions are predominantly from the same angle, raising concerns about adaptability to different user intentions and approach angles.
- The method appears better suited for teleoperation settings than for reinforcement learning baselines, necessitating comparisons with teleoperation methods without assisted grasping.
- Presentation issues exist, such as the need for clearer explanations of figures and inconsistencies in formatting.
- The reliance on complete point cloud observation may limit real-world applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the adaptability of the proposed method by demonstrating its performance across various approach angles and user intentions. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons to teleoperation methods without assisted grasping to better contextualize the results. Enhancing the clarity of figures and ensuring consistent formatting throughout the paper would also strengthen the presentation. Finally, addressing the limitations related to point cloud reliance and exploring alternative methods for wrist pose estimation could broaden the method's applicability.
