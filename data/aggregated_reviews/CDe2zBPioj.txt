Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Signed Graph Augmentation (SGA) framework aimed at enhancing the performance of Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) by addressing graph sparsity and unbalanced triangles. The authors demonstrate the ineffectiveness of the DropEdge method for signed graph augmentation and propose SGA, which incorporates structure augmentation, candidate edge selection, and a new data augmentation perspective. The methodology is validated through experiments on six real-world datasets, showing significant improvements in link sign prediction tasks. Additionally, the paper provides a generalization error bound for SGNNs and critiques existing augmentation methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Originality: The introduction of a new augmentation framework specifically for SGNNs addresses unique challenges in signed graphs.
- Quality: The methodology is well-validated through extensive experiments, demonstrating substantial performance improvements.
- Clarity: The paper is well-organized with clear explanations and thorough discussions of results.
- Significance: The work offers valuable insights for improving SGNNs, particularly for tasks like link sign prediction.

Weaknesses:
- Generalization: The effectiveness of SGA on other signed graph tasks, such as node classification or community detection, remains unexplored.
- Complexity: The framework's multiple steps and parameters may complicate implementation and tuning.
- Resource Intensive: High computational requirements may limit practical application in resource-constrained environments.
- Limited Comparison: Experimental results lack comparisons with other augmentation methods beyond DropEdge, which would strengthen the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalization of SGA by exploring its applicability to other signed graph tasks, such as node classification and community detection. Additionally, a comparative analysis with other augmentation methods, including mixup-based and spectrum-based techniques, would enhance the credibility of the results. We suggest providing a complexity analysis and a comparison of training time and parameter counts to better assess the efficiency of SGA, especially for larger datasets. Lastly, addressing the limitations related to balance theory and exploring potential solutions would strengthen the paper's contributions.
