### Key Points
This paper presents a multidimensional evaluation framework for assessing Large Language Models (LLMs) as recommenders, introducing four dimensions: history length sensitivity, candidate position bias, generation-involved performance, and hallucinations. The framework evaluates seven LLM-based recommenders against six traditional models across ranking and re-ranking tasks on four datasets, addressing unique challenges in LLM-based systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of four LLM-specific evaluation dimensions is novel and addresses underexplored aspects of LLM-based recommendation systems.
- Comprehensive experiments involving multiple datasets and prompting strategies enhance the robustness of the findings.
- The paper offers practical insights into LLM strengths, particularly in handling shorter input histories and excelling in re-ranking tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the introduced dimensions is questionable, as many have been previously explored in existing literature.
- The comprehensiveness and independence of the metrics require further exploration, particularly regarding explainability.
- The paper lacks a discussion on the potential of fine-tuning LLMs to mitigate biases and hallucinations.
- The use of numerous symbols may hinder readability, suggesting a "Notations Used" table could be beneficial.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their contributions by exploring truly new dimensions or providing deeper insights into existing challenges. Additionally, clarifying the meaning of "Generation-Involved Performance" and its relevance as a metric would enhance understanding. The authors should also discuss the implications of fine-tuning LLMs on bias and hallucination issues, and consider comparing conventional recommendation systems' performance on the proposed metrics. Lastly, addressing the readability concerns related to symbol usage would benefit the overall presentation of the paper.
