Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents BrainMD, the first large multimodal longitudinal brain tumor dataset, consisting of 2,453 studies from 561 patients, including 3D medical images, radiology reports, and longitudinal medical records. The authors propose a novel representative slice selection method called Vote-MI to enhance the efficiency of large volumetric machine learning models (VLMs) in processing 3D imaging data. Additionally, two benchmarks are established for diagnosing and prognosticating brain tumor outcomes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The construction of a multimodal dataset is pioneering and advances the field significantly.
2. The Vote-MI method facilitates efficient inference for large VLMs applied to 3D medical images.
3. The authors provide publicly available code and example data, enhancing evaluation and reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of combining 2D/3D medical images with radiology reports and longitudinal records lacks acknowledgment of similar prior studies, which could provide a more comprehensive context.
2. The limited comparison methods for slice selection do not fully evaluate Vote-MI's advantages; relevant methods from video action recognition should be included.
3. The focus on the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task may restrict the dataset's broader applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related works section by discussing similar prior studies to contextualize their contributions better. Additionally, the authors should expand the comparison of slice selection methods to include relevant techniques from video action recognition, such as those proposed in [3, 4]. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors dedicate more space to the dataset's design and annotation processes, as these aspects are equally significant as the Vote-MI method. Lastly, when evaluating Vote-MI, comparisons should include ground truth annotations from radiologists and center slices from all axes to provide a more comprehensive assessment.
