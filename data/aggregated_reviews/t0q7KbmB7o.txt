### Key Points
This paper presents the HyperHawkes model, which utilizes hypergraphs and Hawkes processes to model user sessions and capture user intents through contrastive clustering. The model aims to enhance sequential recommendation systems by effectively addressing both long-term and short-term user interests, particularly in the context of repetitive consumption patterns. The authors integrate a multi-level attention hybrid network and a generalized EM framework, demonstrating improved modeling of user intent and providing more personalized recommendations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The innovative combination of hypergraphs and Hawkes processes enhances the understanding of user behavior, particularly in capturing repeated consumption patterns.
2. The authors conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets, showing the model's superiority over various state-of-the-art methods.
3. A detailed ablation study clarifies the contributions of different components within the HyperHawkes model, reinforcing the validity of the findings.
4. The paper is well-structured and provides source codes for reproduction, along with thorough experimental settings.

Weaknesses:
1. The presentation requires improvement, with ill-defined notations such as the variable ‘chi’ in Eq. (9) and small text in Figure 4.
2. The model's complexity may lead to scalability issues as user and item numbers increase, potentially affecting real-time recommendations.
3. The authors do not compare the model with more recent sequential recommendation models, limiting the evaluation's comprehensiveness.
4. The method's reliance on high-quality user interaction data may diminish its effectiveness in sparse or noisy data scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by defining all ill-defined notations, such as the variable ‘chi’ in Eq. (9), and consider providing a notation table. Additionally, we suggest including more recent sequential recommendation models for a fairer evaluation. To enhance the rigor of the generalized EM framework, the authors should provide more detailed theoretical proof or derivation processes. Furthermore, addressing the model's scalability and adaptability to rapidly changing user preferences could strengthen its applicability in real-time systems. Lastly, we encourage the authors to discuss the combination of long-term intents and short-term interests further, possibly by representing each aspect with dense embeddings and fusing them using multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs).
