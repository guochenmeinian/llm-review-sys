### Key Points
This paper presents significant contributions to the field of German-English code-switching by releasing a corpus of naturally occurring English-German code-switched tweets, which includes a human-annotated test set. The authors propose two methods for identifying code-switching: a rule-based system called TongueSwitcher, which is non-generalizable, and an automated method that achieves state-of-the-art performance on their dataset and strong results on existing benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors conduct comprehensive experiments across island sizes and calculate token-level and entity-level F1 scores, demonstrating the effectiveness of their system for both challenging and simpler cases.
- They present separate experiments for cross-lingual homographs, addressing one of the most difficult issues in code-switching.
- The comparison with existing baseline systems on both their dataset and established datasets enhances the credibility of their claims.

Weaknesses:
- The TongueSwitcher method is highly specific to the English-German language pair, limiting its generalizability.
- While the authors assert that their methods do not require high-quality lexica or human-annotated training material, the ruleset necessitates considerable manual supervision for wordlist construction.
- The use of a precursor system in section 3 is not clearly explained, leading to confusion regarding its role.
- The effectiveness of TongueSwitcher appears dependent on the quality of the wordlists, POS tagger, and segmentation subsystem, suggesting a need for ablation studies.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the preprocessing step used in the dataset selection, as it is crucial for evaluating the performance of TongueSwitcher. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a clear definition of the code-switching and borrowing distinction, as well as guidelines for annotators to enhance the reliability of the annotations. It would also be beneficial to include metrics for single-token islands and to clarify the criteria for loanword annotation, including whether any inter-annotator agreement metrics were calculated. Finally, we encourage the authors to separate the conclusions from future work in section 8 for better readability and to mention earlier in the paper that the released resource is silver-annotated.
