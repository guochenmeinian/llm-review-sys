Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative approach to align diffusion models for image inpainting with human aesthetic standards through a reinforcement learning framework. The authors construct a dataset of 51,000 inpainted images annotated with human preferences and theoretically deduce the accuracy bound of the reward model, enhancing the efficacy and efficiency of the diffusion model.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper proposes a novel integration of human feedback into diffusion models via reinforcement learning, improving image quality.
2. It introduces a comprehensive dataset that addresses the lack of evaluation resources for image inpainting, facilitating future research.
3. The authors provide extensive experiments and supplementary materials, demonstrating the effectiveness of their method across various applications.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper does not sufficiently elaborate on existing work related to human preferences in diffusion models, such as Human Preference Score and ImageReward, nor does it compare methodologies or results.
2. The rationale and implementation details of key contributions, particularly Equation 11, are inadequately explained, including hyperparameter selection and the choice of functions.
3. The weighting of scores in the manuscript lacks clarity regarding its determination and justification.
4. The "Rank" metric in Table 2 is not explained, and details about the dataset annotation process are missing, including the number of annotators and their training.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related work on human preferences in diffusion models, providing a thorough comparison of methodologies and results. Additionally, the authors should clarify the rationale and implementation details of Equation 11, including hyperparameter selection and the validation of function choices. It is also essential to explain the basis for the weighted scores and the significance of the "Rank" metric in Table 2. Finally, we suggest providing more comprehensive details regarding the dataset annotation process to enhance transparency.
