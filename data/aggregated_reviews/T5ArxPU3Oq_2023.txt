Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper formulates a tensor network contraction ordering problem and proposes a dataset with a benchmark for classical simulation of quantum circuits. The authors introduce a reinforcement learning approach, RL-Ising, which demonstrates a significant speedup of 4.62Ã— over state-of-the-art heuristic methods, achieving an estimated simulation time of less than 4 days. The authors propose a unified representation of tensor network contraction orders and develop multiple GPU-based implementations for various quantum circuits, including tensor-train and synthetic networks. The work emphasizes the need for collaboration between AI/ML and quantum physics communities to validate empirical quantum supremacy. Additionally, the paper provides a synthetic dataset for evaluating classical simulation techniques against claims of quantum superiority, particularly those made by Google regarding their quantum circuits.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a significant topic in quantum computing, contributing a benchmark that enhances the validation of empirical quantum supremacy.  
- The reinforcement learning method shows impressive performance, outperforming existing heuristic methods.  
- The proposed method demonstrates a notable speedup in simulation time, showcasing the potential of reinforcement learning in this domain.  
- The development of a unified representation of tensor network contraction facilitates fair comparisons for future research.  
- The dataset includes diverse benchmarking methods and environments, facilitating further research.  
- The authors provide comprehensive details on the dataset and implementation in their GitHub repository, and the implementation details and experimental results are clearly articulated.

Weaknesses:  
- The evaluation criteria for classical simulation performance are unclear, particularly regarding scalability metrics.  
- The dataset lacks sufficient detail, which is critical since the paper is submitted to a Datasets Track.  
- Limited discussion on the conditions under which the benchmark can reliably declare quantum supremacy.  
- The paper does not adequately discuss the limitations of the proposed approach or the implications of its findings on claims of quantum supremacy.  
- Some technical details, such as the implications of varying parameters like K in the K-spin Ising model, are insufficiently elaborated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the evaluation criteria for classical simulation performance, particularly in Section 5, to aid understanding for non-experts. Additionally, the authors should provide more comprehensive details about the dataset, including its advantages over Google's Sycamore circuits and insights into simulation approaches. We suggest enhancing the clarity of the dataset information in their GitHub repository, ensuring that it includes clear instructions for downloading and utilizing the dataset. Running ablation studies to analyze the relationship between runtime and criteria such as the number of nodes and edges would also be beneficial. Furthermore, a more thorough discussion of the limitations of the proposed approach is necessary, particularly regarding the conditions under which the benchmark should be relied upon to declare quantum supremacy. Including code snippets in the README for Gym-like APIs, iterating over the dataset, inference on a trained model, and training a new model would facilitate user engagement and evaluation.
