### Key Points
This paper presents a novel concept, (d,s)-graphlet, aimed at discovering indirect connections between nodes. The authors propose the EDGE algorithm, which efficiently counts occurrences of (d,s)-graphlets, demonstrating significant performance improvements over naive enumeration methods. The work is empirically validated across various tasks, including graph clustering and characterization, highlighting its relevance in graph analysis. However, the efficacy of (d,s)-graphlets may diminish with increasing distance d and graph size s. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper provides new insights into counting (d,s)-graphlets with higher-order connections.  
2. It includes a comprehensive experimental evaluation on 13 real-world datasets, assessing the effectiveness and scalability of the EDGE algorithm.  
3. The organization and clarity of the paper are commendable.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The complexity of computing (d,s)-graphlets increases significantly for larger values of d, making it more challenging than traditional graphlets.  
2. There is limited exploration of larger graphlets, which could enhance the applicability of the findings.  
3. The paper lacks a discussion on how the algorithm can be adapted or extended for specific graph analysis applications.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by providing additional illustrative examples, particularly regarding the differences between semi-deducible and non-deducible graphlets. We also suggest that the authors explore larger graphlet configurations beyond (2,3), (3,3), and (2,4) to strengthen their analysis. Additionally, a formal definition of "clique" should be included, and the authors should clarify how random graphs are configured in their experiments. Finally, we encourage the authors to discuss potential adaptations of the (d,s)-graphlets and the EDGE algorithm for more meaningful graph analysis.
