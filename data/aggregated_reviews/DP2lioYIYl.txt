Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical framework for unsupervised machine translation (UMT) that operates without parallel data, addressing challenges such as the lack of shared linguistic structures and domain gaps. The authors propose two models: the knowledge graph model, where text represents edges in a graph, and the common nonsense model, which assumes no linguistic structure. They establish error bounds for both models, showing that the error rate is inversely related to sample size, common ground, and language complexity. Additionally, the paper explores the realizability assumption and its implications for error bounds, proposing a general theorem that relates divergence and loss through plausible ambiguities. The discussion emphasizes that without the realizability assumption, the expected accuracy of the learned translator is limited.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel theoretical framework for UMT, which is a significant contribution to the field.
- The proposed models provide a comprehensive analysis of UMT, with theoretical bounds on data requirements.
- The insights regarding the relationship between error rates and language complexity are intriguing.
- The paper includes a rigorous theoretical exploration, including a novel theorem that connects divergence and loss.
- Empirical validation of theoretical findings demonstrates the robustness of the authors' claims.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks empirical validation for some theoretical claims, particularly regarding the assumptions made in the models.
- The structure is unusual, with a lengthy introduction that overlaps with later sections, leading to clarity issues.
- The mathematical content is dense, with limited intuitive explanations or visual aids, making comprehension challenging.
- There is an implicit assumption in Lemma C.1 that may conflict with the presumption of Theorem A.2, raising concerns about the application of the union bound in Theorem 3.4.
- The realizability assumption is deemed essential for achieving non-trivial bounds, and its removal could lead to significantly lower accuracy in practical scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by restructuring the introduction to focus more on motivation and high-level intuition, while minimizing overlap with subsequent sections. Additionally, providing intuitive explanations for the mathematical symbols and formulas would enhance understanding. We suggest including empirical experiments, even with toy data, to validate the theoretical framework and further experiments to demonstrate the robustness of their claims when relaxing the realizability assumption. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the assumptions made in their models and explicitly discuss their limitations. Starting with a simpler setup could enhance accessibility, avoiding complex sample complexity considerations initially, and including intuitive toy thought experiments and high-level proof ideas in the main text would also be beneficial. Lastly, a more robust connection to the motivation of translating animal communication would strengthen the paper's relevance.
