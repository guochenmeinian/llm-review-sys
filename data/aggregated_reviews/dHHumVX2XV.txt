### Key Points
This paper presents a novel syntax-guided temporal language model (SG-TLM) aimed at enhancing the efficiency of continued training on Temporal Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). The authors propose a syntax-guided lexicon selection method to identify words that have undergone significant syntactic changes over time, which are then masked during the post-tuning stage. The SG-TLM achieves state-of-the-art performance over baselines, demonstrating improved memorization and generalization abilities across various model architectures. The paper is well-organized, with clear experiments that validate the proposed techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The idea of capturing temporal information through syntactic change distribution is novel and well-executed.
- The paper is clearly written and well-structured, making it easy to understand.
- The proposed methods show strong empirical improvements and efficiency in lexicon selection compared to semantic-based methods.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on the accuracy of the Parsing Toolkit for the Syntax-Guided Lexicon Selection may significantly impact the overall F1 score.
- The assumption that temporal information can be captured solely through syntactic role changes neglects cases where semantic information changes without syntactic role alterations.
- The method for converting syntactic dictionaries to feature vectors lacks clarity.
- The results would benefit from statistical tests and a more comprehensive evaluation across diverse tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the conversion process for syntactic dictionaries to feature vectors. Additionally, we suggest including statistical tests to bolster the results and interpretations, as well as conducting a more comprehensive evaluation involving a wider range of tasks. It would also be beneficial to address the potential limitations of the method's generalizability beyond well-written text and consider integrating both lexical semantic and syntactic information for a more holistic approach. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide qualitative analysis to elucidate how the proposed techniques lead to performance improvements.
