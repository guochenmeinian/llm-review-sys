Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a valuable dataset of particulate matter collected from low-cost sensors mounted on public buses in Delhi, addressing air pollution challenges in developing countries. The authors propose a novel mobile air quality monitoring approach that utilizes a dynamic sensing network, differing from traditional static sensor deployments. Their dataset, which includes over 12 million PM2.5 samples, is benchmarked against existing static sensors and evaluated using various machine learning methods for spatio-temporal interpolation, missing data imputation, and forecasting. The findings highlight the dataset's complexity and its potential for machine learning applications, while also including extensive data exploration analyses, such as correlation studies and assessments of meteorological factors.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
- The dataset is publicly accessible and recognized as a significant contribution to air quality modeling, particularly due to its detailed collection methodology and inclusion of various environmental parameters.
- The authors effectively address reviewer feedback by enhancing the manuscript with additional analyses and improved discussions on limitations and the relationship to prior work.
- Benchmarking results demonstrate that traditional machine learning methods can effectively learn patterns from the data, showcasing the dataset's complexity and uniqueness.

**Weaknesses:**
- The paper's focus on benchmarking may detract from its primary aim as a dataset paper, potentially leading to a lack of clarity regarding its core contributions.
- The dataset's collection period of three months may limit the comprehensiveness of the findings, and the uneven spatial distribution of sensors may introduce biases due to specific bus routes.
- Some sections lack clarity, particularly regarding the definitions and operationalization of benchmarking tasks, and initial difficulties in following the manuscript's structure necessitated reordering for clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on how this work relates to prior studies to avoid potential double submission policy violations. Additionally, the authors should expand on the differences between static and dynamic pollution maps of Delhi and provide a clearer exploration of the dataset, including the percentage of non-pollution data, air pollution episodes, and potential external data sources for augmentation. 

The authors should clarify the definitions of spatio-temporal tasks in Section 4.1 and maintain consistent terminology for PM measurements. We also suggest that the authors address the limitations related to sensor accuracy, intermittent connectivity, and the uneven spatial distribution of data, considering alternative data collection methods, such as using commercial cabs, in future work. A thorough exploration of autocorrelation and spatial lag in the dataset should be included, along with a clean version of the dataset that accounts for measurement errors.

Lastly, we encourage the authors to consider separating the dataset and benchmarking components into distinct papers to allow for a more comprehensive exploration of each aspect, and to extend the data collection period in subsequent studies to enhance the robustness of the findings.
