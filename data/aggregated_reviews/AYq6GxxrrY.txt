Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Transferable Boltzmann Generators (TBGs), a generative model designed to estimate Boltzmann distributions for unseen molecular datasets. The authors propose a method that utilizes continuous-time normalizing flow, enabling the model to be trained on one set of molecules and applied to others, as demonstrated through numerical experiments on dipeptides. The method incorporates flow matching, equivariant neural networks, and reweighting to ensure unbiased sampling from the target Boltzmann distribution.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method shows significant improvement over existing Boltzmann generators, which are typically limited to trained systems.
- The experiments effectively support claims of transferability, with relevant ablation studies highlighting practical applicability.
- The paper clearly distinguishes between Boltzmann generators and emulators, emphasizing the former's importance in predicting downstream quantities accurately.

Weaknesses:
- The methodological innovation appears incremental, primarily involving the inclusion of topology information in the embedding, with standard techniques like flow matching and reweighting.
- The dataset of dipeptides in gas phase may not represent real-world applications, raising concerns about scalability to larger molecular systems.
- The employed EGNN architecture is outdated, and comparisons with more recent models would enhance the analysis.
- The lack of comparison with the TimeWarp method, which addresses similar challenges, limits the evaluation of the proposed method's merits.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the differences between their approach and previous models, particularly regarding the incorporation of auxiliary inputs and topology information. Additionally, the authors should conduct experiments comparing TBGs with the TimeWarp method to assess sampling efficiency and transferability. Expanding the evaluation to larger molecular systems and discussing the implications of chirality in their model would also strengthen the paper. Finally, clarifying the distinctions between the various TBG architectures and addressing the target distribution in relation to the training data would enhance the manuscript's comprehensibility.
