### Key Points
This paper presents a Riemannian generative model called RicciNet for clustering via Ricci flow, encoding data points as Gaussian mixture samples on a Riemannian manifold. The authors perform geometric adjustments based on Ricci curvature during decoding and derive a differentiable formulation to address challenges in gradient backpropagation. Experimental results indicate that RicciNet effectively captures complex structures, outperforming Euclidean methods across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The study of deep clustering through Riemannian geometry effectively models complex structures.
2. The use of Ricci flow for clustering is a novel and interesting approach.
3. Comprehensive experiments, including multiple independent runs and ablation studies, validate the proposed model's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper contains several typos and minor presentation issues, such as incorrect references to equations and terms.
2. The performance difference between the proposed model and the variant without reparameterization on the USPS dataset raises questions about the necessity of replacing log-likelihood optimization with differential geometric learning.
3. The explanation of Ricci flow's suitability for deep clustering is insufficiently detailed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction by providing an intuitive example to illustrate how "Ricci flow demonstrates that particles in the manifold tend to aggregate into several submanifolds, influenced by the Ricci curvature." Additionally, please clarify the derivation of Eqs. (6) and provide more theoretical interpretations of the statement regarding data points from Gaussian mixtures. A comparative analysis of computational complexity between the proposed model and other Euclidean methods would also enhance the paper. Finally, including a parameter sensitivity analysis and addressing the choice of the k-NN graph in the context of other potential options would strengthen the experimental section.
