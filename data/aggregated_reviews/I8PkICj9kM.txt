Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of score distillation methods within a unified framework, identifying two error sources: the first-order approximation and the mismatch between the assumed and true source image distribution. The authors propose a custom negative prompt design to address the first error, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving image quality across various tasks, including 2D and 3D generation. The paper also interprets score distillation sampling (SDS) through the lens of the Schr√∂dinger Bridge problem, suggesting that SDS serves as a linear approximation of the optimal path between distributions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The analysis of score distillation methods in a single framework is engaging and enhances understanding of the state-of-the-art.
- The exposition is generally clear, with effective illustrations and experiments supporting the findings.
- The proposed negative prompt approach shows significant effectiveness in the tested scenarios.
- The inclusion of both quantitative metrics and a user study enriches the evaluation of results.

Weaknesses:
- The technical contribution is limited, with the new proposed gradient closely related to existing methods like DDS, raising concerns about originality.
- The negative prompt idea lacks novelty, as it is commonly used in image generation interfaces.
- The analysis primarily focuses on one error source, neglecting the first-order approximation, which warrants further investigation.
- The related work discussion is relegated to the appendix, making the main text harder to follow.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the originality of their contribution by clearly distinguishing their method from existing approaches like DDS and including it in comparative analyses. Additionally, we suggest that the authors conduct a more thorough investigation of the first-order approximation error, potentially testing the multi-step ODE solver in conjunction with various gradient definitions. The analysis in Section 2.3 should be expanded to address the performance discrepancies observed with different values of s for SDS and DDS. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to enhance the related work discussion within the main text for better coherence. Lastly, providing detailed rationales for the choice of negative prompts and the optimization pipeline would strengthen the technical foundation of the proposed method.
