### Key Points
This paper presents an approach to ontology-mediated query answering by optimizing query rewritings using a summary of the database. The authors propose a method that prunes conjunctive query clauses that have no answers in the specific database, thereby improving query evaluation performance. The experimental evaluation, conducted using the LUBM benchmark, demonstrates the effectiveness of this optimization, although it raises concerns regarding the summary-generation process and its potential for false negatives.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem addressed is relevant and significant, pushing the boundaries of traditional query rewriting by incorporating database-specific optimizations.
- The writing is generally clear, and the proofs are correct, making the proposed solution easy to understand.
- The experimental setup is decent, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed solution for certain classes of queries.

Weaknesses:
- The time complexity aspect of Problem 1 is not fully addressed, and theoretical guarantees would enhance the evaluation.
- The summary-generation process is simplistic, potentially leading to false negatives due to the collapsing of instances across disjoint classes.
- The experimental evaluation is limited to a single dataset (LUBM), raising questions about the generalizability of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical discussion surrounding the time complexity of Problem 1 to provide clearer guarantees. Additionally, consider refining the summary-generation process to avoid collapsing instances of disjoint classes, which could lead to inaccuracies in identifying empty conjunctive queries. Expanding the experimental evaluation to include multiple datasets would also strengthen the findings and demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method. Lastly, we suggest including more detailed explanations of technical terms and concepts to enhance clarity for non-expert readers.
