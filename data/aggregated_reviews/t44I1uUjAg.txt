Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents MerKury, a lightweight framework aimed at enhancing the performance of Kubernetes master nodes, specifically targeting API server access latency and scheduling throughput. The system incorporates a request wrapper to reduce API server latency and a recommender module for adaptive resource allocation using queueing theory. Evaluations in a simulated environment demonstrate significant performance improvements over baseline implementations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The framework is well-structured and addresses critical challenges in Kubernetes performance.
2. It serves as a non-intrusive plugin, facilitating ease of deployment.
3. Empirical results indicate substantial enhancements in scheduling throughput and reduced request latency.

Weaknesses:
1. The writing lacks clarity, making it difficult for readers unfamiliar with Kubernetes to follow.
2. The results on business workloads are not as significant as those on synthetic workloads, raising questions about the framework's effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
3. The proposed algorithm may be perceived as over-engineered for the problem domain.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by providing more background information on Kubernetes-related terms and including end-to-end examples to illustrate the processing of requests with and without MerKury. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the novelty of their queueing model and justify the choice of the ARMA model for load prediction, considering modern alternatives. A detailed comparison with other resource allocation methods, even if intrusive, would strengthen the paper's contributions. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to enhance the readability of figures by increasing font sizes and providing more elaborate captions to highlight key insights.
