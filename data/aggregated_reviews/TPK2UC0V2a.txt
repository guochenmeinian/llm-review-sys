### Key Points
This paper studies the bidder selection problem (BSP), where a subset of k bidders is chosen from n bidders to optimize expected social welfare or revenue in multi-position VCG auctions. The authors propose a Poisson relaxation approach, demonstrating that BSP is polynomial-time solvable up to a vanishing error as k increases. They provide an Efficient PTAS and empirical results showing that their algorithm outperforms Greedy algorithms in both running time and approximation quality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem is highly relevant to ad platforms, addressing practical challenges in bidder selection.
- The proposed Poisson relaxation and Efficient PTAS are novel contributions, with the position auction environment being a new focus.
- The empirical study shows the algorithm's effectiveness compared to heuristic benchmarks, highlighting its implementability.

Weaknesses:
- The worst-case running time of the proposed algorithm, as indicated by Corollary 1.1, is in \(n^{poly(1/\varepsilon)}\), which appears less efficient than prior work.
- The empirical results rely on synthetic datasets, which may not reflect real-world complexities, potentially weakening the conclusions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical section by comparing their algorithm against more naive benchmarks, such as selecting distributions with the largest means or medians, to demonstrate observable performance gains. Additionally, addressing the incentive compatibility of their mechanism would strengthen the paper's contributions. Lastly, optimizing the algorithm for speed to reduce running times significantly would enhance its practical applicability.
