### Key Points
This paper focuses on evidence retrieval for claim verification, proposing a feedback-based evidence retriever (FER) that optimizes the retrieval process by incorporating feedback from the claim verifier. The authors report a 23.7% F1 performance gain over the state-of-the-art baseline on the FEVER dataset. The method consists of two phases: coarse retrieval to generate a candidate set and fine-grained retrieval to select evidence for verification, utilizing a combination of classification loss and divergence utility.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method effectively aligns evidence retrieval with the verification model, demonstrating significant improvements in F1 performance on the FEVER dataset.
- The approach is intuitive and presents a novel way to utilize feedback from the verifier, which is a strong contribution to the field.

Weaknesses:
- The explanation of the fine-grained retrieval process is unclear and lacks detail, particularly regarding how the final evidence set is constructed and the optimization with feedback.
- The paper does not sufficiently clarify the relationship between the proposed loss function and the improvements observed, leading to potential confusion regarding the contributions of the additional loss versus the point-wise model.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the fine-grained retrieval explanation and provide more details on the optimization process with feedback. Additionally, we suggest addressing the confusion around the relationship between the proposed loss function and the retrieval improvements, possibly by including results from the pure coarse model. It would also be beneficial to clarify the distinction between point-wise and pair-wise models in the context of their methodology. Finally, we encourage the authors to enhance the presentation of results in Tables 1 and 2 to avoid confusion regarding performance comparisons.
