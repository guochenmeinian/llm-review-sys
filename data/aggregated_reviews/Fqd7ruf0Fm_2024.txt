### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to persona assignment by incorporating short biographies as context, which enhances the understanding of user personas. The authors propose an innovative modification of education level, distinguishing their work from previous studies that typically focus on limited persona attributes such as race or gender. The experimentation landscape is comprehensive, including recent large language models (LLMs) like Claude, which supports the generalizability of their findings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The study's design of using short biographies for persona assignment is intriguing and offers a fresh perspective.  
- The innovative contribution of modifying education level adds depth to persona-based injection research.  
- The thorough experimentation with recent LLMs enhances the validity of the results.  

Weaknesses:  
- The prompt for generating biographies lacks controllability, introducing additional features that are not accounted for, which undermines causal claims regarding LLM biases towards "vulnerable users."  
- The clarity of the prompt for injecting personas is insufficient, potentially leading to confusion about whether the bio represents a user or model persona, which could introduce bias.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the controllability of the prompt used to generate biographies to ensure that only the intended features are included. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the model instruction regarding whether the biography pertains to a user persona or a model persona to prevent confusion and bias. The authors should also consider referencing: Park, Minju, et al. "Empowering personalized learning through a conversation-based tutoring system with student modeling."
