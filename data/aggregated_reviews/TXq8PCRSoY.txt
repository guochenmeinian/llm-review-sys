Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents forced Lagrangians to enhance the understanding of discrete schemes for accelerated convex numerical optimization from a continuous-time ODE perspective. The authors propose a combination of variational perspective and high-resolution ODE functions to investigate the Nesterov accelerated gradient descent algorithm (NAG), leading to improved convergence rates. They also introduce a stochastic version of NAG, termed NNAG, and analyze its performance empirically.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of external forces in the Lagrangian formulation is innovative and contributes to the unification of various optimization dynamics.
- The manuscript presents several important theoretical results, with proofs that are generally correct and well-articulated.
- Empirical results indicate the potential for better optimization algorithms based on the theoretical findings.

Weaknesses:
- The use of specialized jargon from the outset makes the paper challenging for a broader audience; terms like “LR-ODE,” “HR-ODE,” and “rate matching technique” require clearer definitions in the introduction.
- The introduction of i.i.d. noise in Section 5 lacks a theoretical justification, and the proof of Proposition 4.1 is perceived as more intuitive than rigorous.
- Numerous typos and unclear parts in the proofs need to be addressed, including specific corrections to equations and notation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by providing clear definitions of specialized terms to enhance accessibility for a wider audience. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the theoretical motivation for introducing i.i.d. noise in Section 5. The proof of Proposition 4.1 should be made more rigorous, and the authors should meticulously check for typos and unclear parts in the proofs to ensure clarity. Finally, we encourage the authors to conduct more numerical experiments to strengthen the practical implications of their findings.
