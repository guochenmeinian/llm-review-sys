Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to unsupervised object discovery that extends the capabilities of Complex-Valued Autoencoders (CAEs) by introducing a binding mechanism termed 'rotating features.' The authors propose a model that utilizes an extra set of dimensions to encode object assignments based on rotation, allowing for flexible object representation beyond traditional slot-based methods. The method demonstrates promising results on both toy tasks and real-world images, addressing limitations in object storage capacity and scaling to more complex scenes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work represents a significant shift in the approach to object discovery, moving away from prevalent slot-based methods.
- The model shows strong performance on toy tasks and promising results on real-world datasets, indicating its scalability.
- The efficiency of the proposed method is notable compared to existing slot-based approaches, and it opens avenues for future research.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the evaluation method is questionable, as it relies on binary weights that may not significantly differ from previous methods.
- The model's ability to handle instances of the same color or similar features remains unclear, raising concerns about its generalization capabilities.
- The paper lacks empirical comparisons with traditional slot-based methods in scenarios involving more objects than available slots, which could clarify the advantages of the proposed approach.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the evaluation method by providing a more detailed explanation of how the binary weighting differs from previous approaches. Additionally, including comparisons with slot-based methods in scenarios with varying object counts would strengthen the argument for the model's flexibility. It would also be beneficial to investigate and report on the model's performance when tested on datasets without depth information, as well as to clarify the binding mechanism and its implications for dynamic variable binding. Lastly, addressing the questions regarding the model's behavior with similar features and the evolution of object assignments across layers would enhance the paper's comprehensiveness.
