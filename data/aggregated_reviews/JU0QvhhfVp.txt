Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel dataset for drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction, utilizing Cell Painting features derived from seven publicly available datasets. The authors propose a dataset splitting strategy tailored for cold-start scenarios within an inductive learning framework and introduce a method for negative data sampling. The integration of a knowledge graph with imaging data is highlighted as a significant advancement in DTI research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors effectively analyze the limitations of existing DTI datasets, addressing issues such as the lack of empirical node features and dataset volume.
- The construction of a DTI dataset using Cell Painting features is a notable contribution, providing new modalities for research.
- The paper includes a well-designed data splitting strategy and a negative sampling method that prevents data leakage.

Weaknesses:
- The contributions are limited, primarily focusing on link prediction without addressing challenges in data construction and preprocessing.
- Claims regarding model performance using Cell Painting features lack experimental validation, and the exploration of alternative features, such as word2vec, is absent.
- The use of basic models for experiments diminishes confidence in the dataset's validity, and the metrics employed are inadequate.
- The paper does not clarify how isolated nodes benefit from GNNs or how their embeddings are updated.
- The related work section lacks a detailed discussion on how the proposed methods address existing limitations in capturing higher-order relationships.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental validation of their claims regarding model performance with Cell Painting features by including relevant results. Additionally, exploring other feature representations, such as embeddings based on molecular structures, would enhance the robustness of the approach. We suggest employing state-of-the-art methods in experiments to validate the dataset's effectiveness and revising the metrics used for evaluation. Clarifying the benefits of GNNs for isolated nodes and providing a detailed discussion on how the proposed methods address existing challenges in related work would strengthen the paper. Furthermore, addressing the signal and noise in CP assays and discussing normalization and curation steps would improve the dataset's quality. Lastly, we recommend refining the algorithms presented for clarity and ensuring consistent notation throughout the paper.
