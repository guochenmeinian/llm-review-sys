Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for estimating object orientation from images by predicting Wigner-D coefficients in the frequency domain of SO(3). The authors utilize SO(3) equivariant layers and train the network using a mean squared error (MSE) loss between predicted and ground truth Wigner-D coefficients. The model effectively captures complex rotational components, as evidenced by its prioritization of higher frequencies, particularly in low data regimes. Evaluated on PASCAL3D+ and ModelNet10-SO(3), the method demonstrates superior rotation precision and accuracy compared to existing baselines. An ablation study indicates that the proposed output formulation outperforms traditional rotation representations, such as quaternions and Euler angles, and shows robustness to various sampling strategies during inference. The authors also explore the limitations of MSE loss and acknowledge the need for further research into out-of-distribution (OOD) performance, as initial evaluations show poor results in OOD scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel approach for training Wigner-D coefficients, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.
- The model demonstrates effective prioritization of complex rotational components.
- The exploration of MSE loss limitations is a valuable direction for future research.
- The visualization method using the Mollweide projection enhances understanding of pose distributions.
- The experimental section is comprehensive, including competitive baselines and statistical data, along with a new variation on the ModelNet10-SO(3) dataset to assess sample efficiency.
- The overall organization and clarity of the paper are commendable, with useful figures and a well-structured presentation.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution appears minimal compared to prior work, particularly the neural network model and evaluation scheme, which closely resemble those in existing literature without clear differentiation.
- The clarity of the mathematical transformation from Euler angles to Wigner-D coefficients remains insufficient.
- The explanation of the second contribution regarding "intrinsic properties of SO(3) equivariant representations" is vague, and claims about guaranteeing 3D rotational equivariance are misleading.
- The computational efficiency of the proposed method is questioned, particularly regarding its time and space complexity.
- The core contribution of applying a regression loss to Wigner-D coefficients lacks thorough examination, including insufficient justification for the choice of MSE and its sensitivity to object symmetries.
- The ablation study lacks detail on modifications made to produce outputs in other rotation representations, such as Euler angles and quaternions.
- Some writing lacks clarity, particularly regarding the dimensionality of 3D orientation compared to translation and the necessity of SO(3)-equivariance.
- The evaluation on SYMSOL shows that the method does not surpass existing approaches.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the contributions by explicitly distinguishing their work from prior research, particularly in Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, and 4.6. Additionally, we suggest providing a clearer explanation of the "intrinsic properties of SO(3) equivariant representations" and revising the claim about guaranteeing 3D rotational equivariance. 

We encourage the authors to closely examine the regression loss applied to Wigner-D coefficients, including a comparison with alternative loss functions and an analysis of how the proposed loss interacts with object symmetries. 

Furthermore, we recommend expanding the description of the ablation experiment in Section 5.5 to clarify how outputs were modified to produce Euler angles and quaternions, and to ensure that SO(3) equivariant layers were still utilized. 

We also suggest addressing the concerns regarding computational efficiency by providing a more detailed justification of the time and space complexity of the proposed method. It is advisable to revise the claim about the method's continuity during inference to accurately reflect its discretization. Finally, we encourage the authors to focus on enhancing the model's performance on SYMSOL and other symmetric objects to better compete with existing methods.
