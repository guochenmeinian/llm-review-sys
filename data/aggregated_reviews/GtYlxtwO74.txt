Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an unbiased estimator for covariance in the presence of missing values and outliers, avoiding the need for imputation. The authors propose a method that achieves minimax bounds with the operator norm and demonstrate its effectiveness through numerical experiments. They claim competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, including KNN and MICE imputation, across synthetic and real-world datasets. Additionally, the paper provides a comparative analysis of various imputation methods for handling missing data, specifically focusing on the performance of MIWAE and GAIN alongside classical methods. The authors provide extensive experimental results, including relative spectral errors and execution times across different datasets such as Abalone and Breast Cancer, indicating that while DDC MIWAE performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods for cell-wise contamination, DDC GAIN shows discrepancies in accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces a rigorous theoretical framework for covariance estimation under missing data, establishing bounds that extend previous work.  
- The methodology avoids matrix inversion, addressing complexity issues in high-dimensional settings, and shows robustness against cell-wise contamination.  
- The experimental results are clear and indicate advantages over existing methods, significantly enhancing the paper's appeal to those interested in missing data handling.  
- The authors demonstrate a thorough understanding of the problem by discussing the performance of various imputation methods and their dependence on data structure and missingness.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper's structure is unclear, making it difficult for readers to follow the narrative and understand the ultimate goal.  
- The assumptions regarding missing values and outliers are overly restrictive, limiting practical applicability.  
- There is a lack of comprehensive comparison with recent state-of-the-art imputation methods, and the experimental section does not adequately describe the datasets used.  
- There is a need for clearer explanations regarding the performance of state-of-the-art methods like MIWAE and GAIN, particularly when they underperform.  
- The paper currently lacks standard errors in the results tables, which could improve the robustness of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper's structure to enhance clarity and coherence, ensuring a clear narrative thread throughout. It is essential to define all terms and assumptions explicitly, particularly regarding the independence of missing values and the nature of cell-wise contamination. We suggest including a dedicated section on related work to contextualize the contributions and clarify the differences from existing methods. Additionally, we advise that the authors expand their experimental comparisons to include more recent state-of-the-art imputation techniques, such as those based on deep generative models, to strengthen their claims of outperforming existing methods. We also recommend that the authors improve clarity by adding comments on why state-of-the-art methods may fail or excel compared to their approach. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors perform multiple runs with different seeds to obtain standard errors for the results presented in the tables. To enhance the experimental section, we advise moving proof arguments to the appendix to allow for more space to display relevant figures and tables. Finally, we encourage the authors to include a brief discussion on the decision to filter out categorical variables in Section 5.3, directing readers to Appendix B for further details on preprocessing.
