### Key Points
This paper presents Box2EL, an innovative approach for ontology embeddings that enhances the expressivity of the Description Logic EL++. Unlike previous methods that utilize hyperspheres, Box2EL employs hyperrectangles to better represent complex relationships such as one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many. The authors evaluate their method on three tasks: general subsumption prediction, link prediction, and deductive reasoning, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline competitors.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach is novel and well-articulated, with a solid comparison to related work.
- The technical presentation is robust, proving soundness and achieving good results across multiple evaluation tasks.
- The paper is relevant to the conference audience and contributes to the field of ontology reasoning.

Weaknesses:
- The motivations for the study are unclear, particularly the claim regarding the rigidity of standard logical reasoning.
- Key aspects of the EL++ description logic are not clearly defined, and the paper lacks a self-contained explanation of the proposed method.
- The novelty of the benchmark for subsumption prediction is questionable, as it primarily involves splitting existing ontologies into training, validation, and testing sets.
- Some formal details, such as the definitions of bump vectors and the normalization procedure, are inadequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their motivations for the study, providing more convincing arguments for the relevance of ontology embeddings in approximate reasoning. Additionally, the authors should ensure that the EL++ description logic is clearly defined and that all constructs are discussed in detail. We suggest that the authors provide a self-contained proof of Theorem 1 and clarify the definitions of bump vectors and the normalization process. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to enhance the accessibility of the paper's presentation, particularly regarding the soundness proof and the discussion of related work. Lastly, we advise the authors to elaborate on the novelty of their benchmark and its implications for the field.
