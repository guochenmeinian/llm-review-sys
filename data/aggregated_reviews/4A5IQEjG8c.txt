Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Spiking Neural Network (SNN) formulation, termed SF-HMVC, designed to solve the Hypergraph Minimum Vertex Cover (HMVC) problem without the need for slack variables. The authors propose that this slack-free approach translates the problem's constraints directly into the dynamics of SNN neurons, targeting implementation on neuromorphic hardware like Intel's Loihi 2. The method shows promise in solving HMVC problems effectively and provides a comparative analysis with optimization techniques such as Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Innovative approach to solving HMVC without slack variables, enhancing solver effectiveness and reducing the search space.
2. The proposed method demonstrates scalability and can handle larger problem instances efficiently due to the parallel nature of neuromorphic computing.
3. The paper is well-organized and provides a clear explanation of the neuromorphic computing background and the rationale behind the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
1. The scale of experiments is relatively small and lacks comparison with other solving methods like Gurobi and D-Wave.
2. Algorithm 1, which is not the proposed algorithm, occupies significant space in the paper and should be moved to the appendix.
3. There is a lack of detailed metrics on energy consumption and scalability analysis, particularly for larger problem instances.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental scale and include comparisons with other solving methods, such as Gurobi and D-Wave, to enhance the evaluation of their approach. Additionally, we suggest moving Algorithm 1 to the appendix to streamline the main content. Providing a more detailed explanation of the W matrix setup and conducting appropriate ablation experiments to analyze hyperparameters like $\lambda$ and timestep $T$ would strengthen the paper. Lastly, a clearer discussion on the scalability of the proposed method and empirical evidence supporting its claims would be beneficial.
