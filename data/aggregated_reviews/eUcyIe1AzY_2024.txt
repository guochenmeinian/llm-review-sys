Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the GENSIT framework for generating origin-destination matrices (ODMs) in agent-based models, addressing the limitations of traditional methods that rely on continuous approximations and ad-hoc discretizations. The authors propose a more efficient approach that operates directly on the discrete combinatorial space, utilizing neural differential equations to model spatial interactions. The method demonstrates superior performance in reconstruction error and computational efficiency, validated through real-world datasets from Cambridge, UK, and Washington, DC, USA.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The integration of neural differential equations within the GENSIT framework introduces a novel approach to generating ODMs directly in the discrete space.
2. Empirical validation on large-scale real-world datasets shows the framework's effectiveness in terms of reconstruction error and computational efficiency.
3. The paper is well-structured, with clear motivation, methodology, and results, supported by effective use of figures and tables.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks theoretical guarantees; the authors should provide theorems on consistency and robustness to enhance reader understanding.
2. The computational cost is inadequately discussed; the complexity $O(NEJ(\tau|W|+I))$ needs clarification on the scale of each parameter.
3. The explanation of the sampling schemes for the neural network loss is insufficient, requiring more detail on their practical implications.
4. The paper's dense mathematical notation may hinder comprehension, necessitating more intuitive explanations or examples.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical framework by including theorems on consistency and robustness to clarify the method's reliability. Additionally, a more detailed discussion of the computational cost, including the scale of parameters in the complexity expression, would enhance understanding. The authors should also provide a clearer explanation of the sampling schemes used in the loss computation, elaborating on their practical significance. Simplifying some of the mathematical notation and providing intuitive explanations or examples would make the content more accessible to a broader audience. Lastly, including a summary table of high-level results in the experimental section could help clarify the improvements over existing techniques.
