Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to environment dynamics modeling, focusing on counterfactual prediction, off-policy evaluation, and offline reinforcement learning. The authors introduce adversarial weighted empirical risk minimization (AWRM) to address the selection bias in empirical risk minimization (ERM) that can lead to failures in counterfactual action prediction. They implement this through the GALILEO algorithm, which is evaluated across synthetic, continuous-control, and real-world tasks. The results indicate that GALILEO can accurately predict counterfactual actions and enhance various downstream tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper tackles a significant issue in accurate environment dynamics model learning, which has broad implications for downstream tasks.
2. The introduction of AWRM is a novel contribution that integrates adversarial training concepts with reinforcement learning.
3. The analysis of conventional ERM's limitations is insightful, and the transition to AWRM is well-supported.
4. The experiments are comprehensive, demonstrating GALILEO's effectiveness across multiple tasks.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks sufficient baseline comparisons to validate GALILEO's superiority.
2. The method's description, while comprehensive, could be simplified for better understanding.
3. There are minor typographical errors and formatting issues that need correction.
4. The coverage of related works and justifications for baseline choices is inadequate.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the validation of GALILEO by including additional baseline comparisons, particularly with recent GAIL-based methods. To enhance clarity, consider simplifying the method's description. Please address the typographical errors, such as the subtitle in Section 5.3, and improve the formatting, particularly the upper margins on several pages. Additionally, we suggest providing more detailed explanations of the metrics and downstream tasks used in the experiments to better situate the work within the existing literature.
