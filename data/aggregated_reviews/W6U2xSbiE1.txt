Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel backdoor defense framework called "zero-shot image purification" (ZIP) aimed at protecting against backdoor attacks on black-box models. The authors propose a two-stage process: first, a linear transformation is applied to a poisoned image to eliminate backdoor patterns, followed by the use of a pre-trained diffusion model to recover the lost semantic information. The effectiveness of ZIP is demonstrated through experiments against various backdoor attacks across different datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method is innovative, leveraging diffusion models for image recovery, which has not been extensively explored in this context.
2. The theoretical analysis of zero-shot image purification is clear and comprehensive.
3. Experimental results indicate that ZIP outperforms existing state-of-the-art backdoor defense methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The choice of evaluated backdoor attacks is limited to older methods, such as BadNet and PhysicalBA, which may not adequately represent current threats; more recent attacks should be included.
2. The paper lacks a well-defined threat model, leaving the capabilities of defenders and attackers unclear.
3. There are inconsistencies in the results and claims made regarding the effectiveness of different transformations, particularly concerning the use of Grayscale.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including a broader range of backdoor attacks, such as WaNet and hidden trigger backdoors, to validate the effectiveness of ZIP against more advanced threats. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the threat model to better define the capabilities of both defenders and attackers. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to address the inconsistencies noted regarding transformation effectiveness and to provide empirical evidence supporting the theoretical claims made about the diffusion model's adaptations. Finally, proofreading for typographical errors is necessary to enhance the overall presentation of the paper.
