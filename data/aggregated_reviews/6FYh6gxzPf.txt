Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an active perception method for grasp detection that integrates a Neural Graspness Field (NGF) with a graspness inconsistency-guided next-best-view planning strategy. The authors propose a framework that incrementally models the scene and utilizes a pre-trained graspness prediction network to enhance grasp pose detection. The evaluation benchmarks are based on the GraspNet-1B dataset, demonstrating improvements across various experimental setups.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The novel approach of modeling graspness as a neural field is innovative and well-structured, with clear visualizations aiding comprehension.  
- The integration of NeRF with graspness concepts is a significant contribution to the robotics community, addressing the challenge of selecting optimal views for grasping.  
- Comprehensive evaluations through simulations and real-world experiments show the framework's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:  
- The definition of next-best-view (NBV) for grasp perception lacks clarity, as the goal should focus on identifying a single executable grasp rather than all feasible grasps.  
- Experimental validation of the proposed method's performance is insufficient, with only marginal improvements over existing methods.  
- The incremental training of the NGF may lead to inaccuracies in graspness maps for novel views, and the grasp network's predictions could be inconsistent across views.  
- The absence of supplementary video materials and detailed experimental setups limits the verification of real-world performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the NBV definition in the context of grasp perception, emphasizing the goal of identifying a single successful grasp. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the experimental validation to demonstrate significant performance gains over baseline methods. Addressing the potential inconsistencies in the grasp network's predictions during field optimization is crucial. We also encourage the inclusion of supplementary video materials and detailed documentation of experimental setups, including the number of scenarios and objects used, to strengthen the rigor of the evaluation. Lastly, we recommend conducting further ablation studies on hyperparameters and providing clearer visualizations of trajectory planning outcomes to elucidate performance differences.
