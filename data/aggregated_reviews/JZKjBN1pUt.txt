### Key Points
This paper presents TourRank, a novel zero-shot document ranking method inspired by sports tournament mechanisms, addressing key challenges in LLM-based ranking such as input length limitations, ranking inconsistency, and the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off. The authors propose a multi-stage grouping and selection system, utilizing a points-based ranking mechanism. Empirical results on TREC DL datasets and the BEIR benchmark indicate that TourRank achieves robust and cost-efficient performance, often outperforming other zero-shot and supervised baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The tournament-inspired mechanism is innovative and effectively addresses LLM limitations.
2. The multi-round tournament design mitigates input sensitivity issues.
3. Comprehensive experimental validation across multiple datasets enhances the method's credibility.
4. Strong empirical results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks.

Weaknesses:
1. The multi-stage grouping and points accumulation may introduce implementation complexity.
2. Some figures and captions lack clarity, affecting comprehension.
3. The writing quality requires improvement.
4. Performance is significantly influenced by the choice of grouping size, number of stages, and tournament rounds.
5. Diminishing returns may occur when increasing tournament rounds, raising concerns about resource cost versus performance gain.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of figures and captions to enhance reader understanding. Additionally, providing more justification for parameter choices, particularly the number of tournaments, would strengthen the paper. A detailed comparison with fine-tuned models, as well as an exploration of the impact of different document types on performance, would provide a more comprehensive analysis. Furthermore, testing TourRank on larger document collections would better reflect its applicability in real-world scenarios. Lastly, a discussion on the sensitivity of performance to hyperparameter choices and the implications of grouping biases should be included.
