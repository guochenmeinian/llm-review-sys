Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to ab-initio homogeneous reconstruction in cryo-EM, utilizing a tailored encoder and semi-amortization to handle multi-modal pose distributions. The authors propose a shared CNN feature extractor with multiple pose predictor heads, allowing for the prediction of several plausible poses per image to address pose uncertainty. The method employs an explicit 3D decoder, which accelerates pose optimization compared to the implicit networks used by cryoDRGN and cryoAI. The architecture is trained with a "winner-takes-all" loss, leading to faster convergence and improved accuracy in pose predictions. Evaluations indicate that this approach outperforms cryoAI and competes well with cryoSPARC on both synthetic and experimental datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a two-stage ab-initio homogeneous reconstruction algorithm based on a multi-head transformer architecture, yielding superior performance on synthetic and real datasets compared to learning-based baselines.
- A novel winner-takes-all loss is presented, allowing each decoder head to specialize in local pose estimation, thus reducing the decoder's burden.
- The manuscript is well-structured and clearly written, with appropriate references.

Weaknesses:
- The claim that the semi-amortized method is faster than cryoAI is questionable due to minor modifications in the decoder. There is no ablation study on the decoder's representation or its impact on training and inference time. Additionally, the implications of using explicit volumes, which increase memory costs, are not adequately discussed.
- The performance improvements are incremental, with subtle enhancements on synthetic datasets and cryoSPARC achieving better results in some cases. The reasons behind the resolution limits in EMPIAR-10028's FSC curve are unclear.
- The method lacks support for translation estimation, which is critical for a complete ab-initio model, unlike cryoAI.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their claims regarding speed advantages by providing a detailed ablation study on the decoder's representation and its effects on computational and memory costs. Additionally, we suggest conducting a more comprehensive performance analysis of both the encoder and decoder to identify potential bottlenecks, particularly regarding the image encoder's limitations. A PCA visualization of the feature space or cosine similarity analysis would be beneficial to validate the effectiveness of the encoder in clustering similar poses. Furthermore, addressing the lack of translation estimation in their method and exploring its implications would enhance the paper's contribution. Lastly, we encourage the authors to expand their experimental testing beyond EMPIAR-10028 to include a wider variety of datasets.
