### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the primacy effect in ChatGPT, investigating whether the order of labels in prompts influences prediction outcomes. It defines the primacy effect as the tendency to better recall information presented first and analyzes this phenomenon through natural language understanding tasks by shuffling label orders before predictions. The findings indicate that ChatGPT is sensitive to label order, favoring earlier positions, contributing to the understanding of how prompts affect model performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper provides an interesting evaluation of the primacy effect in ChatGPT, contributing to the understanding of prompt influence on model performance.  
- It is self-contained and addresses a relevant research question, potentially advancing knowledge in the field of large language models (LLMs).  

Weaknesses:  
- The experiments are preliminary, with unresolved concerns that could lead to different conclusions.  
- The comparison with BERT may not adequately justify whether the observed phenomenon is unique to ChatGPT or applicable to other generative models.  
- The paper lacks comprehensive exploration of the primacy effect across various tasks and does not sufficiently detail prompt formatting or dataset complexity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the robustness of their findings by performing experiments on a broader range of tasks, including other classification and generation tasks like QA or summarization. Additionally, shuffling the labels more times could strengthen the evidence for the primacy effect. We suggest comparing results across different temperature settings to validate the findings further. Clarifying the formatting of actual prompts and providing examples would enhance the paper's clarity. Lastly, addressing the concern regarding ChatGPT's confidence levels in predictions through additional experiments would be beneficial.
