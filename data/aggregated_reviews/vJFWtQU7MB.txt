### Key Points
This paper presents a novel two-stage watermarking method called WIND for images generated by diffusion models. It leverages initial noise from the generation process as a distortion-free watermark, enhancing robustness against forgery and removal attacks. The method combines initial noise with Fourier patterns to create a group identifier, allowing for efficient detection while maintaining high accuracy. The authors empirically validate their approach against various attacks, demonstrating significant improvements in watermark robustness compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The concept of leveraging initial noise as a watermark is innovative and compelling.
- The WIND method shows state-of-the-art resistance to removal and forgery attacks, addressing critical challenges in image watermarking for AI-generated content.
- Extensive experimental results validate the method's effectiveness across various transformation attacks, showcasing its practical applicability.

Weaknesses:
- The robustness of the watermarking technique relies heavily on the security of the private model; if compromised, the watermarking may be rendered ineffective.
- The approach is heavily dependent on inversion, a limitation acknowledged by the authors.
- The paper may not account for all possible future attack vectors, leaving room for potential vulnerabilities.
- Testing whether the watermark embedding is preserved with deep learning-based super-resolution would be beneficial.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors explore how this method could be extended to scenarios where a single instance of initial noise is used as a watermark. Additionally, we suggest zooming in on parts of the figures to better highlight details demonstrating the method's effectiveness. A trade-off setting between fast mode and full mode should be provided to offer more options for users. Finally, addressing how the WIND method specifically mitigates vulnerabilities associated with existing techniques, particularly against forgery attacks, would strengthen the paper.
