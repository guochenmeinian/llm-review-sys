Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for sketch-based person re-identification (ReID) utilizing optimal transport theory and a visual question answering (VQA) model to reduce the high costs associated with text annotation. The authors propose a novel sketch-based ReID framework named OLTM, which incorporates text information for modal alignment and introduces a triplet alignment loss to enhance distance calculations. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements on two public datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The use of the VQA model to generate attribute descriptions effectively reduces manual labeling costs.  
2. The method leverages optimal transport theory and text prompts to enhance model performance, along with a new triplet alignment loss that prioritizes local feature similarity.  
3. Experimental results convincingly outperform state-of-the-art methods.

Weaknesses:  
1. The computational complexity of using CLIP as a backbone may hinder performance compared to CNN-based methods.  
2. Minor issues include the need to bold symbols for K, Q, and V in equations, inconsistencies in naming (HTL/TRL), and a blurry Figure 2 in the supplementary material.  
3. The paper lacks clarity on whether the process of obtaining text attributes occurs during model training or post-processing, and it does not compare experimental results with existing image-based ReID methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding the use of the ViLT-based VQA model versus alternatives like the Bert-based model. Additionally, please clarify any potential errors in Eq. 7, ensuring that the optimal transport matrix P* is accurately described. We suggest providing more detailed analysis on optimal transport and triplet loss, including parameter settings for α and β, and their relationship with the cost matrix C. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include comparisons with related methods in TABLE 1 and TABLE 2, and to address the computational burden introduced by the additional structural designs. Lastly, we recommend enhancing the description of the multiple-query experimental results and ensuring consistency in the presentation of symbols throughout the paper.
