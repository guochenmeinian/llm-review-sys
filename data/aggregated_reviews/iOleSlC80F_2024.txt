### Key Points
This paper presents 3DET-Mamba, the first application of the State Space Model (SSM) for end-to-end 3D object detection. It introduces a local-to-global scanning technique with an Inner Mamba block for local geometry and Dual Mamba blocks for global scene features. Additionally, a query-aware Mamba block is proposed to decode scene context into object sets guided by box queries. Experiments on ScanNet and SUN RGB-D datasets demonstrate promising results compared to 3DETR, supported by detailed ablation studies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The basic idea is straightforward, with clearly presented key challenges.
- Methodology and implementation details are well-articulated, supported by good illustrations and mathematical presentations.
- The framework is the first to effectively utilize Mamba for end-to-end 3D object detection.
- Experimental results and ablation studies convincingly support the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks analyses of memory costs and latency, limiting the understanding of Mamba's computational efficiency compared to transformers.
- The mechanism for handling unordered point clouds is not optimal; a more suitable approach aligned with the State Space Model is expected.
- There are several typographical errors that need correction, such as "Obejct" to "Object" and "Transforme" to "Transformer."
- Inconsistencies exist between the structure in Figure 3 and Algorithm 2, particularly regarding the inclusion of Linear-SiLU.
- The labeling in Table 4 is incorrect, and the mAP@0.5 value appears abnormal compared to other results, raising questions about potential errors.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of memory costs and latency to better highlight the advantages of the Mamba framework. Additionally, we suggest developing a more suitable mechanism for unordered point clouds that aligns with the fundamental principles of the State Space Model. The authors should also conduct a thorough proofreading to correct typographical errors and ensure consistency between figures and algorithms. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the experimental results' stability and provide a more detailed comparison with state-of-the-art voxel-based methods like FCAF3D.
