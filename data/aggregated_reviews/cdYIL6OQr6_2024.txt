Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel mixture of experts model that applies local differential privacy (LDP) to the gating mechanism, leveraging a one-out-of-n gating mechanism and providing specific generalization bounds. The authors derive PAC-Bayesian and Rademacher bounds tailored to their approach, demonstrating that LDP regularization improves model generalization, particularly in overfitting scenarios. The paper claims to enhance the robustness and scalability of mixture of experts models, making them more applicable to real-world tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The overall insight of the paper is clear and strong, demonstrating originality by integrating LDP into the mixture of experts model.
2. The theoretical contributions, including PAC-Bayesian and Rademacher bounds, are rigorously derived and tailored to the new approach.
3. The clarity of exposition makes complex concepts accessible, and the experiments validate the practical benefits of the method.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks insight into why PAC-Bayesian bounds are preferred over other bounds, and similar explanations are needed for Rademacher bounds.
2. The experimental section does not clarify the choice of dataset or the rationale behind selecting only five epsilon values, and it lacks comparisons with other methods as baselines.
3. The focus on mixtures of n linear experts in binary classification tasks appears simplistic; additional classification tasks should be included.
4. There is insufficient discussion on the datasets used in experiments, and the paper lacks a smooth flow, making it difficult to follow.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for using PAC-Bayesian bounds and provide more context on the choice of LDP as a regularization method. Additionally, the authors should include comparisons with existing differential privacy methods to clarify the advantages of LDP. Expanding the experimental framework to include a broader range of datasets and classification tasks, as well as additional baselines such as dropout or non-MoE models, would strengthen the paper's claims. Finally, addressing the clarity and flow of the paper would enhance its readability.
