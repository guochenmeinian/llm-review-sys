Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework, Jigsaw, for assembling fractured 3D objects from point clouds. The authors address the dual challenges of surface segmentation and multi-part matching to recover global poses of fragments. Their approach integrates learning-based techniques with traditional optimization methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on the Breaking Bad dataset. The contributions include a joint learning framework for segmentation and matching, along with a unique primal-dual descriptor for capturing geometric properties. Additionally, the authors focus on pairing complementary fracture surfaces, ensuring that each fracture point is uniquely matched to one counterpart. They acknowledge the absence of real-world data evaluations, which is crucial for demonstrating the value of their method compared to registration methods, but argue that their synthetic dataset is sufficiently challenging and serves as a benchmark for fractured object reassembly algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors tackle a relevant and novel problem, establishing a new state of the art.
- The combination of learning and traditional optimization techniques is effectively executed.
- The simultaneous matching of all pieces is crucial for addressing the complexity of the problem.
- The introduction of a primal-dual feature descriptor is both innovative and beneficial.
- The proposed method effectively utilizes a primal-dual descriptor to establish matches between fracture points.
- Preliminary results indicate that registration baselines yield poses close to random guesses, underscoring the relevance of their approach.

Weaknesses:
- Results presented may be cherry-picked, as large angular errors (up to 52.4 degrees) raise concerns about representativeness.
- The manuscript lacks clarity in several areas, including the motivation for the primal-dual descriptor and the details of the global alignment method.
- The experiments are limited to a single dataset, and comparisons with more recent baselines are insufficient.
- The lack of real data evaluation limits the demonstration of the method's effectiveness.
- Concerns remain regarding the smooth fracture issue and the impact of the one precise match assumption when violated.
- Notation inconsistencies and unclear experimental settings may hinder understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction by refining the discussion of furniture assembly, as it diverges from the main focus on fractures. Additionally, please include a broader range of recent baselines in the experiments, such as GeoTransformer and CoFiNet, to strengthen the comparative analysis. We suggest enhancing the figures for better readability and providing detailed statistics on the number of pieces in the dataset to ensure fair comparisons. Clarifying the training and inference times, as well as the scale of the point clouds, would also be beneficial. Furthermore, we recommend including a comparison with registration methods on real data benchmarks to better demonstrate the value of their approach. Enhancing the fracture segmentation module to address the smooth fracture issue more effectively is also suggested. Lastly, the authors should clarify the implications of the one precise match assumption and how it can be managed when not strictly satisfied, while addressing the ambiguity in notation and providing a more thorough justification for the rigidity loss to enhance the manuscript's rigor.
