Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the security vulnerabilities introduced by quantizing LLMs, revealing that models appearing benign in full precision can exhibit harmful behaviors when quantized. The authors propose a three-staged attack framework that includes fine-tuning on adversarial tasks, quantizing the model while preserving malicious behaviors, and removing adversarial traits from the full-precision model. The study emphasizes the need for rigorous security assessments of both full-precision and quantized LLMs, demonstrating the practicality and severity of these threats through various experimental scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and organized, addressing a pertinent concern regarding LLM security.
- It raises awareness about the need to evaluate both full-precision and quantized models.
- The study demonstrates the feasibility of the attack across multiple tasks, highlighting its real-world importance.

Weaknesses:
- The title may be too broad; more specific terms could enhance clarity.
- The threat model lacks clear explanation, particularly regarding whether the attack modifies only the full-precision model or both versions.
- The novelty of the attack is limited, as it builds on established concepts and existing attacks.
- The evaluation is narrow, focusing on specific quantization methods without exploring others that may mitigate the attacks.
- The experiments could benefit from a broader dataset and model diversity, as well as a more comprehensive analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the threat model, explicitly stating whether the attack affects both full-precision and quantized models. Additionally, including larger, widely employed LLMs in evaluations, such as the Mixtral-8x7B model, would strengthen the paper. Incorporating various quantization methods, like GPTQ and AWQ, could enhance the robustness of the findings. Furthermore, we suggest expanding the diversity of datasets and models used in experiments and providing clearer definitions of metrics in the experimental details. Finally, addressing the limitations of the attack's applicability in real-world scenarios would improve the paper's overall impact.
