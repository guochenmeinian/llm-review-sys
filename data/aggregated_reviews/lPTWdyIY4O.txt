Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel invariant layer for group-convolution networks (GCNNs) based on the selective G-Bispectrum, which reduces computational complexity from \(O(|G|^2)\) to \(O(|G|)\) in space and \(O(|G| \log |G|)\) in time when an FFT is available. The authors provide preliminary experiments demonstrating comparable runtime and performance to traditional max-pooling. Theoretical contributions include proofs of the selective G-Bispectrum's properties for specific groups, enhancing its applicability in deep learning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The manuscript is well-written, presenting original and interesting ideas.  
- The theoretical results are novel and could benefit a broader audience.  
- Preliminary empirical validation shows promising results, indicating potential for practical applications.  

Weaknesses:  
- The empirical evaluation is limited to MNIST and EMNIST datasets, which may not sufficiently demonstrate the method's effectiveness or expressiveness.  
- The current experimental setup does not provide conclusive comparisons between max-pooling and the selective G-Bispectrum, particularly regarding computational costs.  
- The term "selective G-bispectrum" lacks a clear definition, and the dependence on the hyperparameter \(\rho_1\) complicates claims of completeness.  
- The paper does not address the limitations of applying the method to continuous groups, which could be a significant area for future research.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical evaluation by including experiments on more complex and diverse datasets, such as CIFAR-10 or ModelNet10, to better assess the method's effectiveness. Additionally, we suggest conducting a comprehensive comparison of computational costs and performance metrics to clarify the trade-offs between the selective G-Bispectrum and max-pooling. 

Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide a clearer definition of the selective G-bispectrum and discuss the implications of the hyperparameter \(\rho_1\) on completeness. Addressing the applicability of the method to continuous groups and exploring this as a potential direction for future research would also strengthen the paper. Lastly, we advise clarifying the motivations for using the spectral domain in the introduction to enhance the reader's understanding.
