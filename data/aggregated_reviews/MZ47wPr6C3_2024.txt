Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an efficient Mixed-Integer Semi-Definite Programming (MISDP) algorithm for Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (SCCA). The authors propose several algorithms, including an exact semidefinite programming representation of classic CCA, a polynomial time algorithm for low-rank cases, and a tailored branch-and-cut algorithm for global optimality. The effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated through numerical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses an important problem in sparse CCA and provides useful theoretical analysis.  
- It presents several new algorithms and proves the equivalence of reformulations, showing applicability to various datasets.  
- The organization and clarity of the paper are commendable.

Weaknesses:  
- Limitations of the proposed methods are not fully addressed, and the experimental comparison with state-of-the-art methods is missing.  
- There are minor typographical errors, such as "optimiality" instead of "optimality."  
- The experiments primarily show running times of exactly 1 second without more decimal precision, which could enhance clarity.  
- The covariance structure of the matrices is treated too simplistically, lacking deeper discussion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including a comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for sparse CCA, such as those by Witten et al. and Parkhomenko et al. Additionally, we suggest expanding the discussion on the limitations of the proposed methods and clarifying the discrepancies in the buzz dataset dimensions. It would also be beneficial to provide more detailed discussions on the covariance structure of the matrices and to correct the identified typographical errors.
