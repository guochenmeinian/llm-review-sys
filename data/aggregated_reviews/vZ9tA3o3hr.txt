Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
The paper introduces SustainGym, a suite of five reinforcement learning (RL) environments designed for benchmarking RL algorithms in sustainable energy systems. These environments simulate real-world scenarios, such as electric vehicle (EV) charging and carbon-aware data center scheduling, while addressing distribution shifts and multi-agent settings. The authors evaluate standard RL algorithms and acknowledge the need for broader evaluations, planning to expand their experiments once API support is available. The manuscript has been revised based on reviewer feedback, particularly regarding the clarity of figures and the organization of content. Limitations of SustainGym, including representativeness and sustainability dimensions, have been addressed in the conclusion and appendix.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
- SustainGym addresses the need for realistic RL environments focused on sustainability, providing insights into RL algorithm performance under distribution shifts and multi-agent scenarios.
- The authors have made significant revisions to improve clarity and organization, particularly in figures and the main text.
- The introduction of a limitations section enhances the manuscript's depth, and the environments are designed with real-world relevance, supported by expert consultation.

**Weaknesses:**
- Justifications for design decisions are insufficiently detailed, and the discussion on multi-agent settings and physical constraints is perceived as lacking.
- The experiments utilize a limited subset of RL algorithms, restricting broader applicability conclusions about their performance in sustainable energy tasks.
- Some figures remain unclear, with issues related to font size and data visualization methods, and key discussions on experiments and limitations are relegated to the appendix, potentially diminishing the paper's impact.

### Suggestions for Improvement
The authors should improve justifications for their design decisions regarding the environments and consider discussing additional sustainability dimensions beyond energy and CO2 emissions. They are encouraged to expand the scope of experiments to include a wider variety of RL algorithms to enhance the benchmark's utility. A more detailed discussion of multi-agent settings and physical constraints should be included in the main body of the paper for greater visibility. Additionally, the authors should enhance figure readability by adjusting font sizes and ensuring clarity in visual representations. Finally, a more thorough discussion of the limitations of SustainGym, including the representativeness of the environments and the implications of unmodeled distribution shifts, is necessary.
