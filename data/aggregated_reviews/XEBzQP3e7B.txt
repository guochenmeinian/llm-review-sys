Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in deep neural networks by analyzing the uncertainty in gradient-based attribution methods. The authors introduce two forms of abnormalities—zero-deflation abnormality and channel-wise average abnormality—and propose GAIA (Gradient Abnormality Inspection and Aggregation), which can be applied to pre-trained models without additional training. The empirical results demonstrate that GAIA outperforms existing methods on benchmarks like CIFAR and ImageNet, significantly reducing the average FPR95. Additionally, the authors propose a method for utilizing model-explained prediction uncertainty for OOD detection through signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) analysis, which quantifies the uncertainty of model attribution explanations. This analysis suggests that useful features (foreground) should exhibit high pixel values while background noise should show low values. The authors also explore adapting their approach for transformer-based models, focusing on attribution gradients on the attention matrix and the potential of the attention mechanism for enhancing visual explanations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper offers an innovative perspective on quantifying disparities between in-distribution (ID) and OOD data through gradient-based attribution analysis.
2. GAIA is simple and effective, achieving superior performance on standard benchmarks without requiring further fine-tuning.
3. The proposed SNR analysis provides a novel approach to quantifying model uncertainty and demonstrates adaptability for both transformer-based and CNN-based architectures.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a comprehensive comparison with other gradient-based methods, such as ASH and GradNorm, which diminishes the clarity of its contributions.
2. The theoretical justification for the relationship between gradient attribution and uncertainty is insufficiently developed.
3. The organization and clarity of the presentation need improvement, particularly in the mathematical derivations and ablation studies, which are currently difficult to follow.
4. There is a lack of discussion regarding the computational efficiency and scalability of the proposed method.
5. The challenges in defining the signal scope and handling out-of-distribution scenarios may complicate implementation.
6. The performance of traditional CAM methods on transformer architectures may be suboptimal, necessitating further research.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and organization of the paper, particularly in the mathematical sections and ablation studies, by providing an overview before delving into details. Additionally, we encourage the authors to include comparisons with more advanced methods like ASH and to clarify the theoretical underpinnings of their claims regarding uncertainty. It would also be beneficial to discuss the computational efficiency and scalability of GAIA, as well as to explore its performance on diverse datasets beyond CIFAR and ImageNet. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology for defining the signal scope in the SNR analysis and explore more robust algorithms for distinguishing foreground from background in attribution maps. Lastly, providing more detailed comparisons of the proposed method's performance against traditional CAM methods in transformer contexts would enhance the paper's overall impact.
