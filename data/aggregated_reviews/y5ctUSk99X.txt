### Key Points
This paper presents an evaluation of ChatGPT, BloomZ, and GPT-4 across a wide range of NLU and NLG tasks in Arabic, including both Dialectal and Modern Standard Arabic. The findings indicate that these LLMs consistently underperform compared to their fine-tuned counterparts, with GPT-4 emerging as the leader, while BloomZ struggles. The authors employ both automated benchmarks and a limited set of human evaluations for certain NLG tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The work provides baseline results for Arabic NLP tasks, aiding future research comparisons.  
- It evaluates both open-source and leading closed-source models, offering practical insights for researchers.  
- The paper addresses a significant gap in NLP research by assessing ChatGPT's performance in Arabic and its dialects, establishing a benchmark for future studies.

Weaknesses:  
- The use of a static prompt template across tasks may lead to misleading results due to high variance in LLM prompting.  
- The analysis remains high-level, lacking deeper insights into how findings should influence existing research directions in Arabic NLP.  
- The paper is condensed, making it challenging to digest the extensive evaluation across 44 tasks and 60 datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by incorporating multiple prompt variations per task to mitigate the risk of misleading conclusions. Additionally, a more in-depth analysis of the differences in capabilities between ChatGPT and fine-tuned models should be included, particularly highlighting specific tasks where ChatGPT underperforms. Clarification on the sampling process for training datasets is necessary, and the authors should provide sufficient references to support claims regarding model performance. We also suggest expanding the discussion on the interpretability of ChatGPT's outputs, particularly regarding the challenges posed by Arabic features. Finally, increasing the depth of analysis in the paper or appendix would enhance the overall presentation and understanding of the results.
