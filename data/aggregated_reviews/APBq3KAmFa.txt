Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of multi-task training objectives using a two-layer ReLU network that interpolates training data while minimizing the l2 norm of the weights. It establishes that in the univariate case, under weak task diversity conditions, the multi-task solution is unique and corresponds to the "connect-the-dots" interpolator, aligning with a specific kernel optimization problem. In contrast, single-task solutions are shown to be non-unique and potentially complex. The authors clarify that they focus on interpolating solutions that pass through data points exactly, without the need for extraneous knots. They assert that multitask training typically leads to unique interpolants that minimize representation cost, while single-task networks yield solutions that behave differently, specifically as ℓ1 minimization versus ℓ2 minimization in the multivariate case. The authors also initiate an extension of these findings to the multivariate setting, suggesting preliminary evidence of uniqueness in multi-task solutions. However, they emphasize that multi-task solutions are not always superior but are distinct.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The writing is mostly clear, and the univariate results provide a significant distinction between single-task and multi-task learning, which is a notable contribution to the literature.
- The study of nonlinear models is a valuable addition, as most existing work focuses on linear models.
- The paper offers a clear distinction between single-task and multi-task solutions, supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results.
- The authors provide a detailed explanation of their experimental setup and the implications of their findings, enhancing the understanding of neural network behavior in different contexts.
- The intuitions in the multivariate case are sound, supported by experiments that validate the approximations and uniqueness of solutions.

Weaknesses:
- The most compelling results are confined to the univariate case, with the multivariate analysis lacking rigor.
- The conclusion that multi-tasking behaves like a kernel method is underwhelming due to the unknown nature of the kernel, complicating the characterization of the multivariate problem.
- The focus on overparameterized networks trained to fit training data exactly, with identical input data across tasks, may not reflect practical scenarios.
- Some reviewers express concerns regarding the generalization of results, particularly in relation to the single-task solutions and their representation.
- The impact of task alignment and high dimensionality on the conclusions remains unclear, suggesting a need for further exploration.
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion on the implications of multi-task learning behaving like a kernel method and its significance for generalization.
- The optimization algorithm used in experiments is not detailed, raising questions about the convexity of the multi-task augmented loss compared to the single-task loss.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the rigor of the multivariate analysis to match the clarity of the univariate results. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed discussion on the importance of the kernel method analogy and its implications for generalization. Clarifying the optimization algorithm used in experiments is essential; if it is gradient descent on the Lagrangian, this could indicate important differences in convexity that should be highlighted. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors explore empirical evaluations in more varied settings to assess the practical implications of their findings, particularly regarding task alignment and signal strength. It would also be beneficial to address the concerns regarding the generalization of single-task solutions, possibly by providing more comparative analysis with respect to Figure 1. Finally, addressing the typographical errors and ensuring proper citation formatting will enhance the overall presentation of the paper.
