Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a multi-objective decision-making framework that learns user preferences through policy comparisons, modeled as a finite horizon Markov decision process. The authors propose an algorithm for finding near-optimal policies, with the number of comparison queries scaling quasi-linearly with the number of objectives. The framework also explores eliciting unknown linear weights for aggregating multi-objective valuations, considering both direct policy comparisons and approximations using weighted trajectories.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a significant problem in decision-making under uncertainty, with broad potential applications.  
- It investigates a novel approach for preference elicitation and provides upper bounds on the number of queries needed to obtain near-optimal policies.  
- The proposed algorithms and theoretical analysis are innovative and well-motivated, with clear descriptions of assumptions and results.  

Weaknesses:  
- The presentation lacks a running example, making it challenging to follow the technical details.  
- The paper ends abruptly without a conclusion or discussion, giving an impression of being rushed.  
- There is a lack of empirical evidence to assess the practicality of the approach, particularly in complex state/action spaces.  
- The writing appears somewhat rushed, and the theoretical results may be of limited practical interest due to the nature of the queries considered.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation by including a small running example to clarify the technical details of the proposed approach. Additionally, we suggest providing a concluding section that summarizes the main findings and discusses the potential practical implications of the research. It would also be beneficial to include empirical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, particularly in real-world settings. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify how the weighted trajectory sets can be presented to users in an interpretable manner, as this is crucial for practical application.
