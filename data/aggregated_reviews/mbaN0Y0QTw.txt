Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method to adaptively determine inference time steps in spiking neural networks (SNNs) to enhance the accuracy-efficiency tradeoff. The authors propose two approaches: the first utilizes confidence score thresholding, while the second employs a reinforcement learning-based policy network to predict the number of timesteps. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods for both direct SNN training and ANN-SNN conversion.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses the early-exit mechanism in SNNs, which can significantly enhance SNN efficiency.
2. Extensive experiments on both static and neuromorphic datasets, along with qualitative assessments, are conducted.

Weaknesses:
1. The concept of dynamic inference time steps based on confidence scores has been explored in recent works, which should be discussed.
2. The deployment of the policy network raises compatibility concerns, as it is an ANN rather than an SNN, complicating hardware implementation.
3. The energy consumption estimation for SEENN-II lacks clarity regarding the policy network's impact, particularly in terms of additional energy costs.
4. There is insufficient empirical evidence demonstrating that confidence scores increase with the number of timesteps.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the novelty of their approach by addressing the concurrent works on dynamic inference time steps. Additionally, clarify how the policy network can be effectively integrated into the SNN framework for hardware deployment. It is essential to provide a detailed analysis of energy consumption, including the policy network's contribution. Furthermore, we suggest adding empirical evidence to illustrate the relationship between confidence scores and timesteps, potentially through visual representation.
