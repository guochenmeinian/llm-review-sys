### Key Points
This paper presents GARD, a graph autoencoder method for rumor detection that incorporates semantic evolvement learning to enhance detection accuracy. The authors demonstrate that GARD outperforms competitive baselines across three rumor datasets and is effective for early detection. The paper includes ablation experiments that highlight the contributions of various components, although the analysis lacks depth regarding the concept of semantic evolvement, particularly in the context of rapidly evolving rumors.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of self-supervised semantic evolvement learning into the GARD model is a significant contribution.
- The model effectively captures both local and global semantic changes, demonstrating strong performance in experiments.
- The paper is well-structured and presents technical concepts clearly, supported by effective diagrams and tables.

Weaknesses:
- The discussion on semantic evolvement is insufficient, lacking specific examples and clarity on its relevance in the context of fast-paced rumor propagation.
- The writing quality needs improvement, with several grammatical errors and unclear notations that hinder understanding.
- The paper does not thoroughly address the model's computational efficiency or scalability, which are critical for real-world applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on semantic evolvement by providing specific examples from the dataset to illustrate its occurrence and relevance. Additionally, the authors should clarify the impact of the uniformity regularizer and provide detailed explanations and examples to support their claims. The writing should be revised to correct grammatical errors and improve clarity, particularly in technical notations. Furthermore, we suggest including comprehensive details on hyperparameter tuning, architecture design choices, and computational requirements to enhance reproducibility and practical implementation. Lastly, a thorough investigation of the model's efficiency and scalability in real-world scenarios is essential for assessing its practical deployment.
