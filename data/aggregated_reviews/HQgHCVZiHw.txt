### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the application of score matching (SM) for inference in Poisson point processes and Hawkes processes. The authors identify a fundamental limitation in using SM due to the necessity of modifying the objective with integration by parts, which often fails for these processes. To address this, they propose a random weighted version of SM (WSM) and an analog for Autoregressive Score Matching (ASM) called WASM, which allows for valid integration by parts. The authors argue that their new estimators are consistent and demonstrate through empirical analyses that these estimators outperform non-weighted variants while matching the performance of maximum likelihood estimators (MLE). They also suggest a method for selecting a weighting function based on certain assumptions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively highlights a critical issue with SM in Poisson and Hawkes processes and proposes a reasonable solution through a weighting scheme.
- The empirical analysis is thorough, showing that the new estimator aligns well with MLE.
- The theoretical framework is well-structured, demonstrating the consistency of the weighted estimator under appropriate conditions.

Weaknesses:
- The concept of using a weighting function to enable integration by parts is not entirely novel, as it has been previously explored in other fields.
- The optimization of the weighting function $C_h$ without considering $\Gamma(h, A, B)$ raises questions about the optimality of the proposed weighting function.
- The paper does not address existing approaches that utilize denoising score matching, which could provide necessary baselines for comparison.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their theoretical contributions, particularly regarding the assumptions related to the weight function in Equation 9, and how they relate to the proofs in Proposition 3.3. Additionally, including comparisons with existing denoising score matching methods would strengthen the empirical validation of their approach. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors explore alternative weighting functions to demonstrate the robustness of their proposed method.
