Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents PRB (PageRank Bandits), a novel algorithm that integrates contextual bandits with PageRank to enhance link prediction in graph learning. The authors frame link prediction as a sequential decision-making process, providing a new reward formulation and theoretical performance guarantees. The effectiveness of PRB is validated through empirical evaluations, demonstrating superior performance over traditional methods in both online and offline settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of PageRank with contextual bandits is a compelling concept, with a clear motivation for the proposed algorithm.
- Regret analysis supports the efficacy of PRB, showing sublinear growth in cumulative regret.
- The paper is well-structured, facilitating comprehension, and comprehensive experiments validate the model's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- Clarity of descriptions is sometimes overly dense, particularly in Section 4, which could benefit from additional subsections and examples.
- The paper lacks detailed descriptions of experimental settings, including hyperparameter configurations and optimizer choices.
- The complexity analysis of PRB, including time and space complexity, is insufficiently discussed.
- The advantage of using a bandit approach for link prediction is not convincingly articulated, and the experimental result analysis is brief.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by dividing Section 4 into subsections that distinguish exploration, exploitation, and graph connectivity principles. Additionally, providing a diagram to illustrate the relationship between super nodes and PRB in both node classification and link prediction tasks would enhance understanding. The authors should include detailed descriptions of experimental settings, including hyperparameter configurations and optimizer choices, to support reproducibility. Furthermore, a more thorough discussion on the complexity analysis of PRB is necessary. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the unique advantages of applying bandit methods to link prediction and to expand the experimental result analysis for better insight.
