### Key Points
This paper presents a new dataset and benchmark for text-conditional image editing, focusing on general image editing tasks such as modifying object attributes, style, and actions. The authors propose a new evaluation metric, DiscEdit, which addresses shortcomings in previous metrics by requiring additional annotations for better interpretability. The dataset is well-motivated and demonstrates significant performance improvements over prior state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its utility for diverse editing tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset yields strong performance across various editing tasks and is well-motivated with both qualitative and quantitative results.
- The new evaluation metric, DiscEdit, effectively addresses issues with previous metrics, leading to more reliable assessments of image edits.
- The paper provides a comprehensive benchmark that enhances the evaluation of image editing tasks.

Weaknesses:
- Table 2 may present an unfair comparison to prior work without sufficient context regarding the training datasets used.
- Some edits lack granularity, as seen in examples where prompts do not accurately reflect the intended changes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Table 2 by providing context for the training datasets used by prior methods, possibly through an asterisk or similar notation. Additionally, we suggest including more detailed explanations of the human judgment process for the 0-100 scale and clarifying the calculation of participant compensation. It would also be beneficial to address the minor spelling and grammar issues throughout the paper to enhance readability. Finally, consider including more diverse data and prompt types to strengthen the dataset's applicability.
