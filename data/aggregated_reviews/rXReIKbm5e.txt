### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative approach to defending large language models (LLMs) against jailbreak attacks while minimizing over-refusal of benign prompts. The authors propose self-improvement and external-improvement strategies, offering a classification-inspired framework for assessing harmful and harmless prompts. The study contributes valuable insights into balancing safety and usability in LLMs, demonstrating a substantial decrease in over-refusal rates while maintaining instruction-following performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
* Relevance: The paper addresses a significant issue in LLM deployment, ensuring robust defense against jailbreak attacks while maintaining utility, making a timely contribution to AI safety.
* Innovation: The self-improvement and external-improvement mechanisms are novel, showing promise in reducing Attack Success Rates (ASR) to zero in some instances.
* Evaluation Framework: A clear and methodologically sound evaluation framework is proposed, revealing key insights into over-refusal issues.
* Experimental Rigor: The use of the Llama-2 family of models and state-of-the-art attack techniques enhances the credibility of the findings.

Weaknesses:
* Over-Refusal Mitigation: The proposed strategies exhibit high over-refusal rates in certain contexts, particularly in in-context learning, without concrete solutions for reduction.
* Lack of Generalization Across Models: Experiments are limited to the Llama-2 family, raising questions about the generalizability of the methods to other LLM architectures.
* Keyword-Based Heuristic for ASR: The reliance on a keyword-based heuristic may not fully capture the complexity of model responses, suggesting a need for more robust evaluation methods.
* Impact on Instruction-Following: The evaluation metrics used have limitations, particularly concerning false positives, indicating a need for more robust metrics or qualitative analysis.
* Clarity in Methodology: The description of the experimental setup lacks clarity, particularly regarding prompt structuring, which could benefit from detailed examples.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the exploration of reducing over-refusal rates without sacrificing jailbreak defense effectiveness. Additionally, broader applicability to different LLM architectures should be tested or discussed. We suggest exploring more robust methods for determining ASR beyond the keyword-based heuristic. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to adopt more robust evaluation metrics or conduct deeper qualitative analyses to strengthen evidence of the method's impact on real-world tasks. Finally, enhancing clarity in the methodology by providing detailed examples of prompts and model responses would benefit reader understanding.
