Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for computing high-order interactions using the Möbius transformation, specifically aimed at enhancing explainability in machine learning models. The authors propose the Sparse Möbius Transformer (SMT), which significantly reduces the computational cost associated with the Möbius Transform from an exponential scale to linear or logarithmic under certain assumptions. The method is theoretically supported and demonstrates efficiency and high faithfulness through numerical experiments. Additionally, the authors detail a post-processing step that utilizes $K$ coefficients, which can be further sparsified to achieve a desired level of sparsity. This involves a two-step process that includes selecting a proxy $b$ for $K$ and applying regression and LASSO techniques to refine the coefficients.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces an efficient computational method for the Möbius Transform, addressing a critical challenge in explainable AI.
- The theoretical foundation of the proposed method is robust, and the writing is generally clear despite the dense theoretical content.
- The experimental results validate the efficiency and effectiveness of the SMT.
- The proposed method effectively combines SMT with regression and LASSO to enhance sparsity in coefficient representation.
- The empirical observations regarding the impact of regularization on coefficient values are insightful and contribute to the understanding of the method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a clear narrative, making it difficult to follow, particularly regarding how significant interactions are identified after sampling.
- The assumption of having only K non-zero interactions limits the method's applicability in real-world scenarios, where K is often large.
- The singleton detection algorithm's claim is flawed, as it cannot guarantee accurate identification of singletons, which undermines the method's reliability.
- The literature review is insufficient, failing to adequately discuss prior works on the sparsity of the Möbius Transform.
- The clarity of the proposed solution may not be sufficiently emphasized in the manuscript, potentially leading to misunderstandings regarding its implementation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper's narrative to enhance readability and explicitly outline how significant interactions are derived from the sampling process. Additionally, addressing the limitations of the assumption regarding K non-zero interactions would strengthen the practical applicability of the method. We suggest revising the claim and proof related to the singleton detection algorithm to reflect its limitations or provide a probabilistic discussion of failure cases. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the prominence of the post-processing step in the manuscript, particularly the discussion surrounding the regression and LASSO techniques. Including a clearer explanation of how these methods contribute to the sparsification process will enhance the paper's clarity and impact. Finally, incorporating a more comprehensive literature review on the sparsity of the Möbius Transform would provide necessary context and support for the proposed method.
