Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the integration of LLMs and GNNs for task planning, utilizing LLMs for request decomposition and GNNs for task retrieval. Experimental results indicate improvements across various datasets and LLMs. The authors propose that GNNs can mitigate issues such as hallucinations in LLMs when addressing graph planning problems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The intersection of LLMs and graphs is an interesting area of research.
- The approach shows improvements in task planning performance across benchmarks.
- The theoretical analysis of LLMs' limitations with graph-structured inputs is well-articulated.

Weaknesses:
- The integration of LLMs and GNNs lacks clarity, particularly in how they are combined in the task planning process.
- The definition of task planning is vague and not well-defined, leading to confusion regarding the methodology.
- The related work discussion is inadequate, missing significant prior research on GNNs in task planning.
- The paper does not sufficiently justify claims regarding the novelty of the proposed approach.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the problem statement and methodology, particularly by providing a clear definition of "task planning" and detailing how GNNs enhance performance in this context. Additionally, we suggest including a figure or description in Section 4 that illustrates the integration of LLMs and GNNs. The authors should also expand the related work section to include relevant literature on GNNs in task planning, such as the works cited in the reviews. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to empirically demonstrate the advantages of their approach over existing methods. Lastly, addressing the clarity of Figure 2 and ensuring all terminology is well-defined will enhance the overall presentation of the paper.
