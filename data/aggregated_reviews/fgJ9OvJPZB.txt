### Key Points
This paper presents the RePAIR dataset, a large-scale benchmark for reconstructing archaeological artifacts, specifically featuring over one thousand real-life fragments from the Pompeii archaeological park. The dataset includes realistic fractures and erosion, accompanied by high-resolution images, detailed 3D scans, and annotated metadata provided by archaeologists. The authors propose two novel approaches for irregular 2D puzzle-solving: genetic algorithm reconstruction and greedy geometric matching, and benchmark these methods against existing approaches, highlighting the ongoing challenges in shape reassembly.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset offers a unique collection of real-world fragments with archaeological significance, enhancing its value for both research and practical applications.
- It includes comprehensive metadata and ground truth assembled by archaeologists, ensuring high accuracy and reliability for benchmarking.
- The proposed methods achieve competitive results, contributing novel solutions to the field of puzzle-solving.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset size is relatively small compared to existing datasets, raising questions about its generalizability to unseen data.
- There is a lack of discussion on the sufficiency of the dataset for solving puzzle problems and whether multiple assembly solutions exist for given fractures.
- The paper does not adequately address potential ethical concerns related to the misuse of the proposed techniques, such as forgery.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the dataset's limitations, particularly regarding the sufficiency of the information provided for puzzle-solving tasks. Additionally, the authors should explore whether the dataset could include fragments not yet reassembled by archaeologists to facilitate open discovery. It would be beneficial to discuss the possibility of using methods like DeepJoin for 3D shape repair and to conduct further experiments on the artificially created test frescoes to compare their reassembly difficulty with real fragments. Lastly, we suggest expanding the ethical considerations section to address potential misuse of the technology in artifact forgery.
