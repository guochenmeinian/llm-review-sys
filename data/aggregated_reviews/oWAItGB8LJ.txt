Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents BiDM, a method for fully binarizing both weights and activations of diffusion models (DMs) to enhance storage efficiency and inference speed. The authors propose a cross-timestep feature connection to improve noise prediction accuracy and introduce space-patched distillation (SPD) to align spatial locality during training. The experimental results on benchmarks like LSUN and FFHQ demonstrate BiDM's effectiveness compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- BiDM is the first comprehensive approach to binarizing diffusion models, showing potential for generative model compression.
- The enhancement of the XNOR method is significant, influencing both DM compression and broader binarization practices.
- The cross-time step connection is innovative and well-integrated into the inference structure of DMs.
- The design of the timestep-friendly binary structure (TBS) and SPD is coherent and effectively addresses the generation task.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental results lack robustness, primarily comparing BiDM with discriminative model quantization methods rather than diffusion-specific baselines, which diminishes evaluation comprehensiveness.
- The impact of the cross-time step connection during training is unclear, and the idealized scenario in Figure 3 may not accurately reflect practical conditions.
- BiDM increases training time compared to traditional methods, necessitating a breakdown of the complexity of its components.
- There remains a notable performance gap between BiDM and full-precision models, which could limit practical applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental comparisons by including quantization methods specifically designed for diffusion models, such as EfficientDM, to provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Additionally, clarify the training dynamics of the cross-time step connection and address the idealized assumptions in Figure 3. It is also essential to quantify the increased training time and identify which components contribute to this increase. Lastly, the authors should discuss strategies to bridge the performance gap between BiDM and full-precision models to enhance practical applicability.
