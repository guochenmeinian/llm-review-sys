Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Coral, a Collaborative Cognitive Diagnosis model that integrates disentangled representation learning with collaborative signals among learners. The authors propose that learners with similar cognitive states demonstrate comparable problem-solving performances, and understanding these collaborative connections can significantly improve the diagnosis of individual cognitive states. Key contributions include: 
1. **Disentangled Representation Learning**: Coral introduces a disentangled state encoder to separate learners' cognitive states, allowing clearer interpretations of individual knowledge proficiencies.
2. **Collaborative Graph Construction**: The model employs a context-aware collaborative representation learning mechanism to dynamically construct a graph of learners based on their cognitive states.
3. **Co-disentanglement Process**: Coral aligns initial cognitive states with collaborative states through a decoding process, enhancing the model's ability to reconstruct practice performance.
4. **Empirical Validation**: Extensive experiments demonstrate that Coral outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various real-world datasets—ASSIST, Junyi, and NIPS2020EC—indicating its effectiveness in diagnosing cognitive states through collaborative learning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Coral's integration of collaborative signals with disentangled representation learning addresses a significant gap in cognitive diagnosis methods.
2. The model shows robust performance improvements over existing methods across various datasets and scenarios, enhancing diagnostic accuracy.
3. A comprehensive framework is presented, supported by extensive empirical validation and detailed mathematical formulations, enhancing reproducibility.
4. The paper is well-structured, with clear diagrams and figures that facilitate understanding of complex concepts.

Weaknesses:
1. The approach lacks innovation, and the motivation for integrating collaborative signals into disentangled representations is not convincingly articulated.
2. The choice of datasets may restrict the findings' applicability to diverse educational contexts.
3. The heavy use of theoretical notations and the crowded experimental section detract from readability.
4. The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison with a wider range of baseline models, particularly collaborative filtering methods.
5. There is a lack of analysis regarding how hyper-parameters impact model performance, and the evaluation of disentanglement quality is simplistic.
6. The model's complexity raises concerns about overfitting, which is not adequately addressed, and the paper does not discuss potential ethical implications, such as data privacy and algorithmic bias.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for integrating collaborative signals by providing clearer explanations of their significance compared to traditional methods. Additionally, we suggest simplifying the theoretical notations to enhance readability and restructuring the experimental section for clarity. To improve generalizability, we encourage the authors to test the model on a wider variety of datasets, including different educational domains and learner demographics. Including a more diverse set of baseline models in their experiments would provide a clearer picture of Coral's performance and allow for a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of these models. Conducting a sensitivity analysis on key hyper-parameters would help identify optimal settings and provide insights into the model's robustness. Furthermore, including case studies or examples demonstrating how the model’s outputs can be interpreted in real educational settings would enhance its practical applicability. To address potential overfitting, we suggest providing validation metrics to strengthen claims regarding the model's generalization capabilities. Lastly, including a section on ethical considerations would enhance the paper's comprehensiveness, discussing data privacy, algorithmic bias, and learner agency in personalized educational interventions.
