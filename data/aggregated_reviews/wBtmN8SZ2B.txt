Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents HypStructure, a novel regularization method leveraging hyperbolic geometry to enhance the embedding of hierarchical relationships in feature representations. The approach aims to reduce distortion and improve generalization, particularly in low-dimensional contexts, and demonstrates superior performance in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection through extensive empirical evaluation. The authors provide an eigenvalue analysis that correlates structured representations with improved OOD detection performance, extending structured representation learning to hyperbolic spaces. Additionally, the paper includes an extensive evaluation of the proposed method, incorporating hyperbolic settings and various evaluation metrics. The authors perform statistical significance testing using t-tests, highlighting performance improvements only when p-values are below 0.05. The results indicate that their method, particularly with the integration of HypStructure, achieves statistically significant enhancements in classification accuracies and OOD detection across multiple datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is the first to formally characterize hierarchy-informed features through an eigenvalue analysis, linking it to OOD detection.
2. It is well-organized and accessible, with clear definitions and structured methodology that aid in understanding the theoretical and practical implications of HypStructure.
3. The work has significant potential impact on applications requiring hierarchical relationship modeling, such as image recognition and OOD detection.
4. The paper provides a comprehensive set of results demonstrating consistent performance improvements in classification and OOD detection metrics.
5. The theoretical contributions, including mathematical proofs, are valuable to the community.
6. The rebuttal effectively addresses reviewer concerns, enhancing understanding of the work.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the proposed method is questionable, as similar approaches have been explored in prior works, such as "Hyperbolic Image Embeddings" and "Hyperbolic Contrastive Learning for Visual Representations beyond Objects."
2. The writing quality needs improvement; some examples and repetitive expressions detract from clarity.
3. The technical contribution may not be substantial enough for acceptance, and the limitations regarding the novelty and applicability of the method are not adequately addressed.
4. Improvements on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 are perceived as not obvious by some reviewers.
5. The novelty and technical contribution may be considered somewhat limited.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty by exploring additional application scenarios for hyperbolic structured representations in vision or language tasks that have not been previously investigated. Further theoretical work to establish error bounds for CPCC-style structured regularization objectives would also be beneficial. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the writing quality by removing repetitive expressions and relocating examples to supplementary materials. We also recommend improving the clarity of the performance enhancements on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 to better highlight their significance. Lastly, a more thorough discussion of the limitations and broader societal impacts of the work should be included in the revised manuscript.
