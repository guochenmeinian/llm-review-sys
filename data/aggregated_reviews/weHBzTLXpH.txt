Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
The paper introduces T2I-CompBench, a benchmark for evaluating open-world compositional text-to-image generation, categorizing compositionality into three main areas: attributes, object relationships, and complex compositions, with 6000 text prompts. It proposes three new evaluation metrics—disentangled BLIP-VQA, UniDet-based spatial relationship evaluation, and miniGPT-4 with Chain-of-Thoughts—and a baseline method for finetuning using these metrics. Experiments indicate that the new metrics align with human evaluations and that the baseline outperforms previous methods. The authors have established a systematic benchmark that addresses various challenges in compositional text-to-image generation, and they have conducted extensive ablation studies and provided visualizations of success and failure cases. However, concerns are raised regarding the reliability of MiniGPT-4 and the challenges of evaluating 2D versus 3D spatial relationships.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
1. The benchmark is comprehensive, addressing three categories of compositionality, which broadens the impact on open-world generation.
2. The proposed metrics are reasonable and tackle challenges in automated evaluation, contributing to the field's understanding of compositionality.
3. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with extensive experimental results and visualizations of success and failure cases.

**Weaknesses:**
1. The proposed baseline method may overfit the evaluation metrics, as highlighted by Goodhart’s law, potentially skewing results.
2. There is uncertainty regarding the reliability of MiniGPT-4 as an evaluation metric, with limitations in understanding images and hallucination issues.
3. The evaluation metrics lack algorithmic innovation, primarily utilizing existing models without significant integration.
4. Some reviewers question the claim that 2D spatial relationships are more challenging than 3D relationships.
5. The scalability experiments show only minor improvements with increased prompts, raising concerns about the robustness of the model.

### Suggestions for Improvement
The authors should consider removing the proposed baseline method to focus on the benchmark and metrics, which are solid contributions on their own. They need to address the reliability of the evaluation metrics, particularly concerning MiniGPT-4's tendency to hallucinate. The authors are encouraged to generate 1,000 random examples and visualize them using HTML or another tool to inspect failure cases and success/failure ratios. Additionally, they should conduct further experiments with fewer prompts (e.g., 275, 200, 125, 50, 25, 10, 5) to assess the robustness of the proposed model. The authors should clarify the limitations of MiniGPT-4 and explore the incorporation of depth maps to evaluate 3D spatial relationships in future work. Finally, enhancing the dataset documentation and accessibility would facilitate user engagement and experimentation.
