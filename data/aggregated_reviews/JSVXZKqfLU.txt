Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel exploration method in reinforcement learning (RL) that incorporates time- and actuator-correlated noise into the last linear layer of the policy network. The authors propose adding noise to the full covariance matrix of the multivariate Gaussian used for exploration, enhancing the correlation between action components. The method is evaluated on various locomotion tasks and musculoskeletal environments, demonstrating improved reward learning in many cases compared to existing baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to read, making the proposed method accessible.
- The approach can be integrated into any RL algorithm, generalizing previous work on exploration noise.
- Extensive experimental validation on both classical RL benchmarks and high-dimensional muscle control tasks is provided.

Weaknesses:
- The rationale behind the energy-saving policies compared to time-correlated baselines is unclear, and comparisons with gSDE are missing.
- There is a lack of exploration algorithm comparisons and ablation studies to justify the choice of noise magnitude and clipping parameters.
- Some experimental results are mixed, with the proposed method not consistently outperforming existing methods, raising questions about its effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the exposition, particularly in the motivating examples and the description of figures. Additionally, the authors should conduct comparisons with other exploration techniques mentioned in the related work and implement their method across a wider range of RL algorithms. It would also be beneficial to include ablation studies to clarify the contributions of the noise components and to investigate the mixed performance results observed in the experiments.
