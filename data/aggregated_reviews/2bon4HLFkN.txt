Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents IR-CM, a fast and universal image restoration method utilizing consistency models. Key innovations include a novel linear-nonlinear decoupling training strategy and an origin-estimated consistency function to enhance training effectiveness and inference performance. The proposed method is evaluated across various image restoration tasks, such as deraining, deblurring, denoising, and low-light image enhancement, demonstrating competitive results with minimal inference steps.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The original-estimated consistency function (OECF) provides a more stable initial state and reduces the solution space.
2. The origin-guided loss stabilizes training and prevents pattern collapse.
3. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method across multiple tasks.

Weaknesses:
1. An error in Eq. (8) where $v_t$ should be $\sqrt{v_t}$ needs correction.
2. Inconsistency in Theorem 1, where "$c_{out}(\eta)=0, c_{out}(\eta)=1$" should be reviewed.
3. Recent diffusion-based methods, such as DiffIR, should be included for comparison.
4. Experiments for deraining and denoising rely solely on synthetic data; real-world datasets should be incorporated for better validation.
5. A comparison of model complexity and runtime is necessary.
6. The performance comparison with other methods may be unfair due to resolution discrepancies.
7. The meaning of universal image restoration needs clarification, as it refers to training on different degradation types simultaneously.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the accuracy of equations and theorems by correcting the identified errors. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with recent diffusion-based methods and incorporating real-world datasets to validate practical applications. It would also be beneficial to provide a comprehensive analysis of model complexity and runtime, as well as to clarify the definition of universal image restoration. Lastly, addressing the resolution discrepancies in performance comparisons will enhance the credibility of the results.
