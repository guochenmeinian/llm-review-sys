Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a unified multi-task learning approach to address hidden confounders in recommendation systems, which existing methods struggle to handle effectively. The authors propose calibrating nominal propensities and error imputations using a consistency loss based on a small set of unbiased ratings. The method is validated through extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets, demonstrating its efficacy in mitigating selection bias and enhancing theoretical understanding of bias in recommendation systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-organized and presents a clear analysis of existing methods and their limitations regarding hidden confounding.
2. Each loss function is technically solid, and the proposed end-to-end multi-task learning framework effectively addresses selection bias, data sparsity, and hidden confounding.
3. The method shows significant improvements over strong baselines and is validated through comprehensive experiments, including a large-scale industrial dataset.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation for the study is weak, lacking theoretical or experimental evidence for the existence of hidden confounders.
2. The proposed framework is not novel, as similar end-to-end multi-task learning approaches already exist, and the unique contribution relies heavily on the challenging acquisition of unbiased data.
3. The theoretical analysis, particularly regarding the consistency loss, is insufficiently rigorous, and the proofs presented are naive.
4. Notations are confusing, with missing explicit loss forms and disorganized arguments for loss functions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation section by providing theoretical or experimental evidence for the existence of hidden confounders. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the novelty of their approach in comparison to existing frameworks and addressing the theoretical weaknesses in their proofs. It would be beneficial to include missing related work and ensure that notations are clear and well-defined. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to conduct a statistical significance analysis and provide clearer definitions for the loss functions, particularly for \(L_{CVR}^{B&U}\). Lastly, we recommend discussing the tuning of hyperparameters and how they relate to validation sets used in the experiments.
