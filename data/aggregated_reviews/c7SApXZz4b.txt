Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents BoxWRENCH, a benchmark that extends previous weak supervision benchmarks like WRENCH to accommodate larger label classes, higher label imbalance, and domain knowledge requirements. The authors argue that while weak supervision (WS) methods may underperform in simpler scenarios, they remain competitive when supported by well-curated labeling functions (LFs). The paper also emphasizes the ease of extending these LFs to multilingual contexts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel benchmark that reflects real-world challenges in weak supervision, including higher class cardinality and class imbalance.
- It provides valuable empirical insights into the usability of WS methods and includes a comprehensive evaluation of various label models.

Weaknesses:
- The paper primarily focuses on text classification, neglecting other tasks like named entity recognition, which could strengthen its claims.
- There is insufficient discussion on the construction and performance of LFs, lacking detailed ablation studies and comparisons of development time versus manual labeling.
- The limitations section is unclear and should be integrated into the main body for better clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on labeling functions by dedicating a section to their construction, performance metrics, and the time required for development compared to manual labeling. Additionally, including experiments on named entity recognition would enhance the paper's claims. The authors should clarify the limitations section and consider integrating it into the main text. Reporting accuracy and F1 scores (micro, weighted, macro) for all datasets is essential, given the claim of high imbalance. Lastly, we suggest organizing the code repository more clearly to facilitate navigation and understanding of LF construction functions.
