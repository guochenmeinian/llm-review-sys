### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for automated label unification across multiple datasets in semantic segmentation using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The method aims to create a unified label space that allows for simultaneous training on multiple datasets without manual re-annotation. The authors demonstrate significant performance improvements, achieving state-of-the-art results on the WildDash 2 (WD2) benchmark. The training process alternates between the GNN and a multi-head segmentation network, optimizing label mappings and segmentation tasks concurrently. However, there is skepticism regarding the validity of these improvements when more complex backbones, such as Transformers, are utilized. The authors propose replacing HRNet with state-of-the-art (SOTA) backbones like Transformers to validate their method's generalization and effectiveness. While the proposed method enhances individual benchmark results, it compromises relation discovery quality, which is crucial for label unification. Concerns are raised about whether the observed improvements in WD2 performance stem from methodological contributions or the choice of training data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The use of GNNs for automatic label space construction is innovative and addresses conflicting label spaces in multi-dataset training.  
2. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WD2 benchmark, showcasing its effectiveness.  
3. The approach enhances training efficiency by eliminating the need for manual re-annotation.  
4. The authors acknowledge the importance of evaluating relation discovery quality and express a commitment to addressing this in future work.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The paper primarily emphasizes benchmark performance rather than the quality of the unified taxonomy, which is crucial for practical applications.  
2. The method relies on textual descriptions generated by GPT, which may introduce inaccuracies, as it does not incorporate visual information for label matching.  
3. There is a lack of comparison with the latest methods in the multi-dataset semantic segmentation community, limiting the evaluation of the proposed approach.  
4. Improvements in benchmark performance may not accurately reflect the task of label unification.  
5. The WD2 performance may be influenced more by dataset bias than by the proposed methodological contributions.  
6. There is a lack of dedicated benchmarks and metrics for assessing taxonomy quality, limiting the evaluation scope.  
7. The initialization of the adjacency matrix is not adequately discussed, despite its importance for model performance.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the quality of the created taxonomy and its comparison to manual taxonomies. Clarifying how unseen datasets are mapped to the unified taxonomy and addressing the potential inaccuracies from GPT-generated descriptions would enhance the robustness of the methodology. Additionally, we encourage the authors to include comparisons with recent state-of-the-art methods from the multi-dataset semantic segmentation community and to explore the scalability of their approach on transformer-based networks. We also recommend that the authors improve their validation by incorporating Transformer-based models to assess the generalization and effectiveness of their proposed method. Furthermore, exploring ways to better evaluate relation discovery quality, as this is a critical aspect of their research, would strengthen the paper's contributions. Finally, providing more details on the initialization of the adjacency matrix and its impact on performance would further enhance the paper.
