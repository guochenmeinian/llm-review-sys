Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical analysis on the expressiveness of transformer-based models, specifically proving that log-precision transformers can be expressed as first-order logic with majority votes (FO(M)). This result generalizes previous findings regarding finite-precision transformers and establishes the tightest known upper bound for log-precision transformers. The authors also demonstrate that finite-precision transformers can only uniformly attend to bounded-length windows, motivating the consideration of log-precision transformers for unbounded ranges.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a novel bound for the expressive power of transformers, contributing significantly to the NeurIPS community.
- It is well-written, with clear explanations of transformer formalization and FO(M), supported by examples and intuition paragraphs.
- The approach to demonstrate FO(M) expressibility is technically sound and draws on existing results, making it valuable for future research.

Weaknesses:
- The most important lemma, Lemma 2, is relegated to the appendix and lacks sufficient intuition, which may hinder understanding.
- There is a missed opportunity for empirical analysis to visualize the authors' claims, which could enhance the theoretical work.
- The role of positional encoding is not discussed, and the implications of fixed and log-precision on this aspect remain unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the accessibility of Lemma 2 by moving it to the main text and providing more intuitive explanations. Additionally, conducting experimental results to visualize and empirically analyze the claims would strengthen the paper. Clarifying the implications of positional encoding in relation to fixed and log-precision would also enhance the analysis. Finally, including a high-level overview figure and a figure illustrating the contiguous circuit construction algorithm would aid in comprehension.
