Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a training data attribution (TDA) method called SOURCE, which combines implicit differentiation and unrolling techniques to estimate the impact of modifying training examples on model parameters. The method approximates changes in final parameters $\boldsymbol\theta_T$ by computing $\partial \boldsymbol\theta_T/\partial\epsilon$ through a series of Jacobians derived from the Hessian of the loss. SOURCE is designed to be computationally efficient and is particularly effective in scenarios involving non-converged models and multi-stage training pipelines. Experimental results demonstrate that SOURCE outperforms existing TDA methods in counterfactual evaluations across various tasks and data modalities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and structured, providing a clear analysis and novel insights.
- SOURCE demonstrates superior performance in counterfactual evaluations compared to other TDA methods.
- The contextualization of SOURCE within the TDA community is effectively articulated.
- The experiments conducted across different training settings are convincing.

Weaknesses:
- There are several minor errors in the text that need correction.
- The distinction between the proposed segmentation method and existing methods like TracIN is unclear.
- The paper lacks a direct comparison of performance degradation due to segmentation against SGD-influence.
- The contribution regarding attribution at different training stages is not unique, as previous works have achieved similar results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- We recommend that the authors clarify the Implicit Function Theorem and its proof more precisely.
- We suggest that the authors provide a more detailed discussion on the properties of the approximation in Eq. (11).
- We recommend improving the explanation of FastSOURCE with references to relevant equations.
- An overview of computation time for different TDA and evaluation methods would enhance the paper's clarity.
- We suggest including a comparison of performance degradation due to segmentation directly with SGD-influence.
- We recommend addressing the minor errors identified in the text for improved readability.
