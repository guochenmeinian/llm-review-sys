Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents PLATO, a novel machine learning approach designed for high-dimensional tabular data where the number of features significantly exceeds the number of samples. The authors propose integrating a knowledge graph (KG) into the learning process to enhance the model's understanding of feature relationships, thereby improving prediction accuracy. PLATO demonstrates superior performance on six biomedical datasets, outperforming 13 state-of-the-art baselines by up to 10.19%. The authors conduct a comprehensive ablation study to validate the necessity of each model component.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The approach is innovative and effectively combines knowledge graph embedding with tabular deep learning, addressing the 'curse of dimensionality' in high-dimensional datasets.  
- The paper is well-written, with clear explanations and thorough experimental validation, showcasing the method's potential for various biomedical applications.  
- The ablation study convincingly demonstrates the importance of each component in achieving optimal performance.  

Weaknesses:  
- The claim that PLATO is robust to missing edges in the knowledge graph is questionable, as performance drops significantly when 50% of edges are removed, particularly on the BRCA dataset.  
- The paper lacks a robust comparison against suitable graph neural network baselines, as PLATO appears to function more as a graph model than a traditional tabular architecture.  
- There is insufficient discussion on the scalability of the method and how performance varies with the complexity of the knowledge graph.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the robustness of their claims regarding the model's performance with missing edges by providing comparative data across all datasets. Additionally, we encourage the authors to conduct experiments comparing PLATO against suitable graph neural network baselines for subgraph classification/regression tasks. It would also be beneficial to explore the scalability of PLATO with varying knowledge graph complexities and to clarify the limitations of using a single type of knowledge graph. Lastly, addressing the handling of categorical features within PLATO would enhance the paper's comprehensiveness.
