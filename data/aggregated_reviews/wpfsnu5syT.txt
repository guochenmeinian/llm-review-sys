Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a general auto-regression model for multi-fidelity fusion, simplifying the ODEs over the fidelity indicator to derive close-form solutions. The authors propose a Gaussian process (GP) based model that incorporates fidelity indicators, enhancing computational efficiency and performance in high-dimensional problems. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over competing techniques, both in synthetic and real-world data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors propose a general linear fidelity differential equation, serving as a simplified version of IFC and a generalized version of IMC.
- Close-form solutions facilitate efficient multi-fidelity fusion, particularly for high-dimensional problems.
- The effectiveness of the approach is validated through experiments on both simulated and real-world data.
- The paper is well-structured and comprehensible.

Weaknesses:
- Baseline methods in the experiments appear to be tested with default settings without fine-tuning, leading to potentially unfair comparisons.
- The paper lacks discussion on the benefits of extrapolation using the ODE formulation, which captures dynamics between different fidelities.
- The choice of \(\eta\) values (0.5 and 0.75) in all experiments may be excessively high.
- The presentation is dense and at times difficult to follow, with strong similarities to existing literature, raising concerns about originality.
- Limitations of the proposed method are inadequately addressed, and the paper lacks sufficient ablation studies or synthetic examples to illustrate scenarios where the models may underperform.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by highlighting key takeaways and deferring detailed derivations to supplementary materials. Additionally, we suggest providing fidelity interpolation and extrapolation results, as well as results with fewer high-fidelity samples. The authors should also clarify the relationship between the IFC method and its representation in figures and tables, and ensure that limitations are discussed more thoroughly throughout the paper. Finally, we encourage the authors to address the writing similarities with existing literature to enhance the originality of their work.
