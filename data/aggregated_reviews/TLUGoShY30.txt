Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive inverse rendering method that incorporates indirect illumination to improve the decomposition quality of environment lighting and BRDF materials. The authors propose using multi-time Monte Carlo integration to model light transport, along with algorithms that accelerate computation by precomputing the diffuse term and utilizing SDF-based geometry for initialization. The results demonstrate realistic shadows on glossy surfaces and improved PSNR values. Additionally, the authors introduce a novel approach to capturing the geometry of reflective objects using Gaussian Directional Encoding, which utilizes spherical Gaussians, contrasting with SpecNeRF's 3D Gaussians. The paper reports quantitative results for relighting datasets generated from two environment lights, Golden Bay and Limpopo Golf Course, demonstrating superior PSNR values compared to existing methods. However, the novelty of the method is questioned, as multi-bounce Monte Carlo integration has been previously employed in other works.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The results exhibit high quality, achieving a notable degree of photorealism in modeling shadows and glossy surfaces through indirect illumination.
2. The underlying theory is sound, with the GGX appearance model being widely accepted in the industry.
3. The presentation is clear and easy to follow, making the content accessible.
4. The authors provide a clear distinction between their spherical Gaussian encoding and the Gaussian Directional Encoding used in SpecNeRF.
5. The reported PSNR results indicate a significant improvement over existing methods, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
6. Comprehensive quantitative metrics are presented, including evaluations of albedo, $k_{orm}$, and reconstructed geometry.

Weaknesses:
1. The optimization time is longer compared to other methods, and the number of bounces is limited, restricting the modeling of shiny surfaces.
2. There is an overclaim of novelty, as multi-bounce MC integration has been used in prior works, and the use of a pre-computed diffuse map may hinder accurate modeling of diffuse shadows.
3. The evaluation is weak, with insufficient quantitative comparisons and a lack of testing on real-world datasets.
4. The authors initially overlooked comments regarding quantitative results, which may have affected the clarity of their findings.
5. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion on the implications of the results and how they compare to other state-of-the-art methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the optimization of geometry obtained from Section 3.3, as no experiments address this. Additionally, the implementation details of material editing in Section 4.5 should be elaborated, particularly how material properties represented as MLP can be intuitively edited. The authors should also clarify the term "orm" in $k_{orm}$. To enhance the evaluation, we suggest including more standard datasets such as NeRFactor and TensoIR, as well as conducting quantitative comparisons on relighting results and intrinsic properties like albedo and normal error. Finally, addressing the confusion around the "pre-compute" term in relation to the diffuse light MLP would improve the paper's clarity. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the quantitative results to address the initial oversight and enhance clarity, and provide a more thorough comparison with other state-of-the-art methods to strengthen the paper's contributions and implications in the field.
