Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive study of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) through a vision-centric lens, introducing Cambrian-1 and the Spatial Vision Aggregator (SVA) to enhance the integration of vision and language models. The authors investigate the limitations of existing MLLM benchmarks and propose a new vision-centric benchmark, CV-Bench, to better evaluate visual capabilities. The study also emphasizes the importance of high-quality visual instruction-tuning data, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a clear motivation for exploring visual aspects of MLLMs.
- It provides valuable insights into the limitations of current MLLM benchmarks and the effectiveness of different visual encoders.
- The release of model weights, code, tools, and datasets contributes significantly to the field.

Weaknesses:
- The technical novelty is limited, as combining vision experts into MLLMs and dynamic token fusion are not new concepts.
- Several findings overlap with existing literature, making it challenging to attribute high value to them.
- The ablation studies for SVA lack depth, particularly regarding the importance of specific tokens across datasets and the effects of increasing instruction tuning data size.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their contributions by discussing the relationship between their proposed SVA and existing works like C/D-Abstractor. Additionally, the authors should provide a more thorough analysis of their findings, particularly regarding the performance of different vision encoders and the implications of their results. Expanding the ablation studies to explore which tokens are more important in specific datasets and the impact of instruction tuning data size would enhance the rigor of the analysis. Finally, addressing potential data privacy issues related to the web-sourced dataset and including a broader range of related works in the discussion would strengthen the paper.
