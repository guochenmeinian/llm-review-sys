### Key Points
This paper presents models for predicting stance and policy for Wikipedia content moderation in three languages. The authors propose a dataset for action/policy detection and stance detection during Wikipedia editor discussions, motivated by the infrequent explicit mention of suggested actions in non-English Wikipedia. The study aims to enhance transparency in moderation decisions, potentially boosting user engagement.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- Addresses the critical issue of content moderation with a focus on transparency.  
- Successful application to multilingual Wikipedia editor discussions, highlighting potential for broader applicability.  
- The release of the multilingual dataset and joint prediction models could stimulate further research in content moderation.

Weaknesses:  
- Limited applicability due to the focus on Wikipedia, raising concerns about generalizability to other platforms.  
- Lack of exploration regarding the linguistic aspects of stance expressions, which could enhance understanding and feature engineering.  
- Uncertainty regarding the real-world impact of F1 scores between 0.6 - 0.8.  
- Insufficient analysis of the test set quality and expert agreement, which could contextualize performance metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by exploring applications beyond Wikipedia. Additionally, addressing the linguistic aspects of stance by incorporating relevant literature could enhance the study's depth. We suggest including an analysis of the test set quality and expert agreement to provide context for performance metrics. Finally, incorporating error analysis from baseline systems would help future researchers understand areas for improvement.
