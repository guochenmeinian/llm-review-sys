Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel technique for compressing local differential privacy (LDP) reports using Poisson functional representations, achieving optimal and lossless compression rates while maintaining differential privacy guarantees. The authors propose Poisson *private* representations (PPR), which generalize previous methods by preserving the original distribution of decoded values, thus ensuring unbiasedness. The utility of PPR is explored through case studies in distributed mean estimation and metric privacy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Originality: The technique leverages insights from information theory that have not been previously applied in differential privacy or federated learning.
- Quality and clarity: The paper is well-written, providing extensive analysis and proofs to support its claims.
- Universality: The method's applicability across various DP mechanisms enhances its significance in practical settings.

Weaknesses:
- The paper is dense and assumes familiarity with advanced mathematical concepts, making it difficult to read. A more accessible version focusing on specific cases could improve clarity.
- The assumption of shared randomness between clients and the server may introduce significant overhead in practice.
- PPR results in a privacy parameter overhead greater than a factor of 2, and its running time is exponential in ùú∫, potentially limiting its applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the accessibility of the paper by providing a more self-contained exposition, possibly focusing on a special case and relegating generalizations to appendices. Additionally, clarifying the implications of shared randomness on communication costs and privacy guarantees would strengthen the analysis. A more detailed comparison with existing techniques, particularly regarding the trade-offs between compression, accuracy, and privacy, is essential to illustrate the advantages of the proposed method. Finally, addressing the limitations related to the privacy analysis for large client numbers would enhance the robustness of the findings.
