Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Hopfield Boosting, a novel approach for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection that utilizes modern Hopfield energy and auxiliary outlier data to refine the decision boundary between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. The algorithm trains a model with two heads—one for classification and another for OOD scoring—by focusing on hard-to-distinguish samples near the decision boundary. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1k, achieving state-of-the-art results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is original and theoretically sound, demonstrating significant improvements in OOD detection metrics.
- The paper includes a large-scale experiment on ImageNet and presents results clearly, allowing for potential implementation without referencing the code.
- The incorporation of modern Hopfield energy and auxiliary outlier data is innovative and enhances the model's ability to differentiate between ID and OOD data.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks conclusive evidence that the method does not lead to overfitting, particularly regarding the classification performance and the implications of sharpening decision boundaries.
- There is ambiguity regarding the contributions of individual components to the performance gains, necessitating more detailed ablation studies.
- The experimental results show limited significance from weighted sampling, and the hyperparameter selection process for $\beta$ is inadequately explained.
- The method's impact on ID accuracy is not sufficiently addressed, raising concerns about its overall utility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the relationship between the auxiliary OOD data and the test datasets, particularly regarding shared classes. Additionally, please provide detailed augmentation techniques for both ID and OOD data, as well as examples of in-distribution images post-augmentation. It is crucial to report the accuracy of the classification head and the rationale behind using 32x32 images for ImageNet-1k, considering the common practice of using 224x224 images. Lastly, we suggest including F1 scores for the ID classification task in the appendix to substantiate claims regarding model performance and generalization.
