Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Multi-Group Proportional Representation (MPR) metric, aimed at ensuring fair representation across intersectional groups in image retrieval tasks. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for MPR's effectiveness and develop a practical algorithm that outperforms existing methods. They also conduct a comparative analysis of MPR and the Proportional Balancing Method (PBM), clarifying that while PBM ensures equal representation within a single group, MPR achieves proportional representation across multiple intersectional groups. The authors note that PBM performs comparably to MPR only at high MPR levels, as it is limited to a single binary attribute and cannot achieve low MPR values. Experimental results demonstrate that the MPR-aware retrieval algorithm significantly improves proportional representation compared to baseline methods. The authors acknowledge limitations, particularly regarding computational complexity, the need for adaptation to other domains, and the validity of statistical tests used in their findings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of the MPR metric addresses representational harms in image retrieval, marking a significant advancement over traditional methods.
- The paper combines theoretical foundations with a practical algorithm, showcasing originality and effectiveness.
- The authors provide detailed explanations of the differences between MPR and PBM, enhancing clarity.
- The experimental methodology is rigorous, with comprehensive evaluations demonstrating the proposed approach's superiority.
- The authors acknowledge limitations in their hypothesis testing and commit to improving transparency regarding statistical significance.

Weaknesses:
- The computational complexity of the algorithm may limit its practical applicability, particularly in high-dimensional feature spaces.
- The evaluation primarily focuses on image retrieval, with limited exploration of the MPR metric's generalizability to other domains.
- Concerns were raised about the validity of the statistical tests used, particularly the interpretation of not rejecting the null hypothesis.
- The reliance on a single dataset for testing raises questions about the generalizability of the results.
- The complexity of achieving perfect balance in representation across multiple intersectional groups is acknowledged but not fully addressed.
- The clarity of some figures and tables could be improved for better understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the computational requirements of the proposed algorithm, including time complexity analysis and potential optimizations. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments across multiple datasets to enhance the generalizability of their findings. We also recommend that the authors improve the framing of their hypothesis tests to clarify the distinction between failing to reject and accepting the null hypothesis. Elaborating on the challenges and approaches for adapting the MPR metric to other domains, such as ranking systems and recommendation engines, would strengthen the paper. Furthermore, a more detailed analysis of how dataset biases affect the MPR metric's performance, along with strategies for mitigation, would enhance the robustness of the findings. Lastly, providing comprehensive supplementary materials, including code and detailed documentation, would significantly improve the reproducibility of the research, and expanding the discussion on ethical implications, including potential unintended consequences and mitigation strategies, would provide a more thorough examination of the societal impact of the work.
