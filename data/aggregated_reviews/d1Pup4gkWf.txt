Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for extracting competitive sports actions from videos and converting them into humanoid motion, utilizing a dataset of various sports represented uniformly. The authors propose SMPLOlympics as a collection of sports simulation environments compatible with human demonstrations in SMPL(X). They implement baseline results using PULSE and AMP, demonstrating strong motion priors and effective performance across different sports tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper establishes a general benchmark for various competitive sports tasks.
2. The baseline methods provided are simple and effective.
3. The framework for simulating multiple Olympic sports is significant, with realistic motion results for dynamic movements.

Weaknesses:
1. The dataset lacks detailed descriptions of acquisition methods and parameters, undermining its main contribution.
2. The technical contribution is limited, as no novel policy is proposed.
3. The model's realism is questioned due to the absence of joint position and velocity limitations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset descriptions by providing detailed acquisition methods, parameters, and a comparison table with existing datasets. Additionally, clarifying the fixed bone length of the humanoid and its impact on realism, especially for multi-person interactions, is essential. We suggest including quantitative metrics for competitive sports and conducting extensive ablation studies on the significance of human demonstrations. Furthermore, addressing the realism of the model by considering motor constraints and providing a detailed analysis of the reward function components would enhance the paper's applicability.
