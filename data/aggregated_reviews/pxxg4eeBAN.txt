### Key Points
This paper presents the Invariant Graph Learning (IGL) framework for treatment effect estimation from networked observational data. The framework generates multiple networked data to simulate diverse environments, promoting the learning of environment-invariant representations for confounders and spillover effects. The IGL model shows superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of invariance principles enhances treatment effect estimation on networked data, enabling extrapolation beyond a single observed environment.
2. The IGL framework demonstrates superior performance in extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, validating its effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. The time complexity is significant, with quadratic complexity in generating new graph structures, which is problematic for large graphs.
2. Important details are lacking, such as how the GNN encoder $\Psi$ receives no gradients during training due to sampling operations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the invariant properties across different environments through additional explanations or visualizations. The authors should also provide theoretical justifications for the variance term in Eq. (13) and address the missing details regarding the GNN encoder $\Psi$. Furthermore, the authors should consider including graph invariant learning methods in the baselines, such as GraphCL and DGCL, and expand the main experiments to include relevant downstream tasks like node classification and link prediction. Lastly, we suggest revisiting the framework's name to avoid confusion with existing methods like GIL and clarifying the time and space complexity of IGL in comparison to baselines.
