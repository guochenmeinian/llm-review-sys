### Key Points
This paper presents Preference-Utility-Balanced MOBO (PUB-MOBO), a novel approach to Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) that incorporates user preferences into the optimization process. Unlike traditional methods that treat all optimal solutions as equally desirable, PUB-MOBO begins with a global search to identify user-preferred regions and follows with a local search using gradient descent to find dominating solutions near the Pareto front. The authors introduce the Preference-Dominated Utility Function (PDUF) to effectively model user preferences. Experimental results indicate that PUB-MOBO consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of utility regret and proximity to the Pareto front across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper extends existing methods by adding a stage based on local multi-gradient descent, enhancing the optimization process.
2. It rigorously derives the GI function in conjunction with the algorithm flow.
3. The introduction of the Preference-Dominated Utility Function (PDUF) effectively models user preferences in MOBO.
4. The paper is logically structured, with clear symbol definitions and strong readability.

Weaknesses:
1. The combination of global and local searches, along with multi-gradient descent, may increase the computational complexity, leading to high costs for high-dimensional problems or large datasets.
2. PUB-MOBO involves multiple parameters that require adjustment, and the paper may not provide sufficient guidance on their optimal selection.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the computational complexity of PUB-MOBO, particularly in relation to high-dimensional problems and large datasets. Additionally, we suggest providing clearer guidance on parameter selection to enhance algorithm performance.
