Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a high-fidelity dataset derived from large eddy simulations (LES) of 355 geometric variants of the Windsor automotive body, aimed at optimizing car aerodynamics through machine learning (ML). The dataset includes time-averaged volume and boundary data, along with geometry and force coefficients, validated against PIV experimental data. While the dataset is a significant advancement for ML applications in automotive aerodynamics, it is limited by its single inflow condition and the use of an idealized car geometry, which may introduce errors in ML models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is high-fidelity and comprehensive, featuring 355 geometric variants.
- Rigorous validation against experimental data enhances reliability.
- The paper is well-organized, with clear explanations of methods and processes.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset is limited to geometric variations without changes in boundary conditions.
- The Windsor geometry is outdated compared to more modern designs, potentially affecting applicability.
- The absence of benchmark cases for ML model testing limits the dataset's utility for research purposes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset by including temporal outputs, which would greatly benefit the research community. Additionally, providing benchmark cases for ML applications would showcase the dataset's potential. The authors should also consider converting the dataset from VTK files to more commonly used formats in ML, such as NumPy arrays or HDF5, to enhance usability. Furthermore, integrating additional inflow conditions and discussing the dataset's intended use in the main manuscript would clarify its strengths and limitations. Lastly, exploring the inclusion of velocity or pressure data at specific locations could further enhance the dataset's utility for various ML tasks.
