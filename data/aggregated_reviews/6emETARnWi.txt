Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Transfer Guided Diffusion Process (TGDP), a framework for transferring a pre-trained diffusion model from a source domain to a target domain, particularly under conditions of limited data. The authors connect the score functions of both domains through a guidance term based on the density ratio, utilizing a classifier for density estimation. The framework is extended to a conditional version, incorporating Cycle Regularization and Consistency Regularization terms to enhance performance. Experimental results indicate that TGDP outperforms traditional fine-tuning methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a novel and efficient training paradigm for transferring pre-trained diffusion models, with a guidance term that merits further exploration.
2. The theoretical analysis is well-constructed and contributes to understanding the robustness of the proposed techniques.
3. The paper is well-organized and presents clear experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of TGDP.

Weaknesses:
1. The extension to the conditional version lacks detail, particularly regarding Lemma 3.2.
2. There is insufficient comparison with existing literature on transfer learning for diffusion models; experiments are limited to comparisons with vanilla diffusion models and fine-tuned generators.
3. The experimental evaluation is narrow, primarily focusing on Gaussian mixture simulations and ECG data, with a need for results from additional datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the detail in the section on the conditional version, specifically discussing Lemma 3.2. Additionally, the authors should include comparisons with other articles related to transfer learning for diffusion models to provide a broader context for their findings. Expanding the experimental results to include a variety of datasets would strengthen the validation of TGDP's effectiveness. Furthermore, clarifying the optimization process for the gradient term in consistency regularization and providing more comprehensive ablation studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets would enhance the paper's rigor.
