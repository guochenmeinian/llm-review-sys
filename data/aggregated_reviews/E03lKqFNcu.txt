### Key Points
This paper presents a semi-supervised training paradigm aimed at learning machine learning proxies for optimization problems under budget constraints related to training time and minimal labeled data. The authors propose replacing constrained optimization algorithms with Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) and introduce a feasibility-based data augmentation scheme to enhance learning from unlabeled data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The feasibility-based data augmentation scheme is novel and interesting.
- Compelling results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.
- The authors effectively identify and address limitations of their approach.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation is weak and could benefit from improvement, potentially due to the constraints of the 4-page format.
- Several parts of the paper, particularly the description of the unsupervised step and the significance of numerical errors, lack clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the unsupervised step description, specifically regarding the labeling of the feasibility dataset. Additionally, we suggest revising the paragraph discussing numerical errors to ensure its relevance and coherence with the subsequent comparisons of semi-supervised BNN performance.
