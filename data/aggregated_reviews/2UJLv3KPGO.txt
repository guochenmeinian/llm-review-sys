Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the dynamics of machine learning models during retraining with model-annotated and human-annotated samples, particularly in the context of strategic human agents. The authors find that while retraining increases the likelihood of positive decisions, the actual proportion of individuals with positive labels may decline. They propose a refined retraining process to stabilize these dynamics and examine the implications for algorithmic fairness, revealing that enforcing fairness constraints may not always benefit disadvantaged groups in the long term. Additionally, the paper presents a detailed analysis of Theorem 3.5, addressing its applicability from 1-dimensional to high-dimensional settings. The authors clarify that while the theorem is precise for high-dimensional distributions, the convexity of individual cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) does not guarantee the convexity of the joint CDF. They provide a mathematical derivation of the Hessian for independent 2-dimensional distributions and discuss the implications of dependent features and the practical use of dimension-reduction methods. The FICO score example illustrates the relationship between score thresholds and qualification rates, highlighting a significant finding in the context of strategic classification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a thorough analysis of the interactions between strategic human agents and ML systems, offering a theoretical foundation for understanding these dynamics.
- It identifies risks associated with retraining ML models using model-annotated data and proposes an innovative retraining method with a probabilistic sampler to enhance sample quality and reduce classifier bias.
- The combination of theoretical analysis and empirical validation through experiments strengthens the credibility of the findings.
- The paper offers a comprehensive analysis of Theorem 3.5 across various dimensions and introduces a novel perspective on the implications of score thresholds in the FICO score example, contributing to the literature on strategic classification.
- The authors demonstrate a willingness to revise the manuscript based on reviewer feedback.

Weaknesses:
- Many conclusions drawn are somewhat intuitive, lacking deeper exploration of underlying mechanisms or complex interactions that could enhance the research's impact.
- The datasets used in experiments are relatively small, potentially failing to capture the complexities of larger-scale data environments.
- The focus on linear models and specific distributions may limit the applicability of the conclusions to non-linear models and diverse data distributions.
- The theoretical results have limitations that need clearer articulation, and the discussion on the model's applicability and limitations requires further elaboration to guide future research.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the depth of their analysis by exploring more complex interactions and mechanisms underlying the observed phenomena. Additionally, expanding the scale and diversity of the datasets used in experiments would enhance the generalizability of the findings. We suggest investigating the applicability of their methodologies to non-linear models and multi-class classification tasks to broaden the scope of their research. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the limitations and applicability of the model in the revised draft. It would also be beneficial to incorporate the convexity condition with respect to each coordinate \(X_i\) in Theorem 3.5, include the FICO example in the appendix for practical illustration, and provide more detailed discussions on the satisfaction of Theorem 3.5 by different distributions in high-dimensional space.
