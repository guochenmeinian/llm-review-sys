### Key Points
This paper presents the Idiomatic Expression Knowledge Graph (IEKG), which extends the ATOMIC knowledge graph by incorporating 1,229 idiomatic events derived from idiomatic expressions in MAGPIE. The authors detail the annotation process, including the creation of idiomatic events, selection of relation types, and assessment of annotations. The dataset demonstrates significant improvements in performance on downstream tasks when used to enhance various Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), such as BART, GPT2, and T5. The paper also adapts a masking task for "small frame" LLMs, showing state-of-the-art results in natural language inference and context continuation tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of IEKG provides a valuable resource for English NLP, capturing non-compositional readings of idiomatic expressions.
- The paper offers a thorough description of the annotation process and quality control measures, ensuring the dataset's reliability.
- Experimental results indicate that models fine-tuned on IEKG outperform baselines, demonstrating the resource's effectiveness.
- Clear writing and comprehensive discussions of evaluation results and limitations enhance the paper's quality.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation of the dataset is limited to a small number of downstream tasks, raising questions about its broader applicability.
- Some minor points in the study require additional support or detail, as noted by reviewers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including a greater number of downstream tasks and datasets, such as SNLI and MNLI, to better assess the dataset's effectiveness. Additionally, please clarify the idiomatic reading of examples for non-native readers and ensure that all references are complete and correctly formatted. Finally, consider addressing the handling of non-idiomatic readings of idiomatic expressions more explicitly in the current version of the paper.
