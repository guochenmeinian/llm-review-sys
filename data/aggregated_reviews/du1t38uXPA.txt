### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of debasing strategies for semi-supervised crisis tweet classification, proposing a memory banking and adaptive sampling approach to mitigate biases in existing methods like logits adjustment and self-adaptive thresholding. The authors ensure equal sampling from crisis classes using memory banking, which is effective when labeled data per class is limited. The method is evaluated on Hurricane and three crisis events, demonstrating its potential in addressing class imbalance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles the significant issue of bias in semi-supervised classifiers, particularly in crisis detection.
- The proposed MemoryBank method shows competitive performance against various baselines and is straightforward to implement.
- A comprehensive set of experiments supports the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the MemoryBank method is limited, resembling standard under-sampling techniques with minor modifications.
- The dataset used is balanced, which contradicts the motivation to address biases in imbalanced scenarios, raising questions about the generalizability of the findings.
- The comparative analysis lacks depth, as it does not sufficiently explore other relevant approaches for imbalanced data and semi-supervised learning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and correctness of Eqn. 2, as it appears to be incorrect. Additionally, they should provide a detailed analysis of the contribution of adaptive sampling to model performance, as results indicate that most benefits arise from the memory bank. Reporting results for individual event types in Table 3 would enhance understanding of the method's performance across different crises. The authors should also ensure that improvements are statistically significant, particularly in the context of the out-of-domain setup shown in Table 5. Furthermore, providing details about the learning rate and optimizer would enhance reproducibility. Lastly, we suggest that the authors consider using a more imbalanced dataset to better support their claims and motivations regarding bias in semi-supervised models.
