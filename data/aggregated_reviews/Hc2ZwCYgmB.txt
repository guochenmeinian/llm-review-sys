Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents AdaFace, a method for personalizing text-to-image diffusion models for human faces by mapping facial features from image space to text space through a prompt inverter. The authors propose several techniques, including Random Gaussian Face Embeddings, Multi-Timestep Distillation, Dynamic Model Expansion, Composition Distillation, and Elastic Face Preserving Loss, to enhance performance and preserve subject identity. However, the experimental validation is insufficient, with limited qualitative and quantitative evidence demonstrating superiority over state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- The proposed method requires fewer training resources.
- The Compositional Distillation Loss is an interesting approach to mitigate the overwhelming effect of subject information.

Weaknesses:
- The lack of intuition behind multi-timestep distillation raises concerns about accumulated errors, with no evidence supporting its benefits.
- The dynamic model expansion section is unclear, lacking specifics on model components and empirical validation.
- The qualitative comparisons do not convincingly demonstrate advantages over baselines like PuLID, and the quantitative metrics show limited improvement in facial identity preservation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental validation by conducting a comprehensive ablation study of the proposed components, including justifications for the placement of the conditioning module and the effectiveness of facial preservation loss, multi-timestep distillation, and dynamic model expansion. Additionally, design experiments that are more relevant to the proposed methods, avoiding irrelevant visualizations and focusing on essential comparisons. Finally, polish the language and improve readability, ensuring that all content adheres to formal paper standards.
