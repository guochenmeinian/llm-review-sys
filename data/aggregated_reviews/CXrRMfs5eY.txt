Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a neural network architecture aimed at solving inverse problems through a neural adjoint paradigm, incorporating a physics-based forward model and a latent space in the optimization stage. The authors propose a method for simulating physical systems via a generalized weighted combination of linearizations around reference state and measurement pairs, achieving smaller RMSE in ocean acoustic tomography compared to other forward models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is clearly written and well-motivated, providing comprehensive background and alternative methodologies.
- It features clear mathematical notation and is benchmarked on a realistic simulated system, specifically the sound speeds in the Gulf of Mexico.
- The authors conduct ablation studies to elucidate the effects of various architectural components.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks discussion on the hyper-parameters of the networks and their impact on results.
- The performance comparison with the MLP is unclear, as the specifics of the MLP used are not detailed, and its close performance raises questions about the advantages of the PETAL algorithm.
- Validation metrics lack replicates, confidence intervals, and comparisons with more expressive models, limiting the robustness of the claims.
- The contribution relative to previous studies is not sufficiently articulated, and the assumption regarding the Jacobian of the forward operator is questionable.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on hyper-parameters of the PETAL network and clarify the specifics of the MLP used in benchmarking. Additionally, we suggest providing insights into the MLP's performance with embedded physics and further evidence supporting claims of robustness to initialization. Expanding benchmarking to include multiple simulations of the Gulf of Mexico or other inverse problems would enhance the validation of the proposed method. Finally, a clearer explanation of the differences from previous studies and the role of parameters in the proposed model would strengthen the paper's contribution.
