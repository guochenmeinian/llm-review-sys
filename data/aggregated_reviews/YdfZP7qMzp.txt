Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework called GenRec that unifies video generation and recognition using video diffusion models. The authors propose a random-frame conditioning process to learn generalized spatial-temporal representations, demonstrating that GenRec excels in both tasks even with limited visual inputs. The experiments validate the effectiveness of GenRec across various video tasks, including action prediction and video generation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of masked finetuning with diffusion models is innovative and effectively unifies video generation and recognition tasks.
- Comprehensive experiments show strong performance across video generation, prediction, and recognition tasks, providing critical evidence of mutual enhancement between the two objectives.

Weaknesses:
- Notations in the Preliminary Section are inconsistent, requiring clarification for better understanding.
- The claim regarding the stochastic sampler in EDM lacks justification, as the second-order correction appears omitted.
- Derivations, particularly from Equations 14 to 16, lack clarity and require more detailed explanations.
- Missing generative performance data for Baseline I in Table 1, along with parameter counts and computational overhead, limits the analysis of model efficiency.
- Minor typographical errors, such as "mensioned" and "interatively," need correction.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the consistency of notations in the Preliminary Section for clarity. Additionally, justifications for the omission of the second-order correction in the stochastic sampler should be provided. The authors should enhance the clarity of the derivations from Equations 14 to 16 with more detailed explanations. Including the generative performance of Baseline I, along with parameter counts and computational overhead in Table 1, would strengthen the analysis. Lastly, correcting typographical errors will improve the overall presentation of the paper.
