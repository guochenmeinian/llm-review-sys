### Key Points
This paper presents the "Image Recognition of Figurative Language" dataset to evaluate figurative language understanding in vision and language models. The authors introduce two novel tasks as benchmarks for multimodal figurative understanding, leveraging human annotation and an automatic pipeline. The study highlights the challenges faced by generative models, such as Dall-E and Stable Diffusion, in producing figurative images, indicating that they often generate literal representations instead. The paper emphasizes the need for further research to enhance models' comprehension of figurative language.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper accurately distinguishes between metaphor, simile, and idiom, providing a clear problem description.  
- The dataset and benchmark tasks are expected to drive advancements in multimodal models' understanding of figurative language.  
- The experiments reveal significant weaknesses in existing visual language models, contributing to the field's knowledge base.

Weaknesses:  
- The proposed dataset may not fully capture the complexity and diversity of real-world multimodal figurative language scenarios.  
- The lack of contextualization in figurative expressions limits the dataset's applicability, as figurative language often requires context for accurate interpretation.  
- There are no suggestions or solutions provided for improving figurative language understanding in models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset by incorporating more complex contexts for figurative expressions to enhance its applicability. Additionally, consider testing more multimodal large language models, such as LLaVA and InstructBLIP, to explore their capabilities in figurative language understanding. Finally, we suggest providing clearer information regarding the training data used in the study to enhance transparency and reproducibility.
