### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of the relationship between relevance and opinion conflict in online social media link recommendations, utilizing the Friedkin-Johnsen model to demonstrate how link additions influence online conflicts. The authors derive a closed-form expression for quantifying changes in conflict and propose a metric termed "conflict-awareness" to evaluate the effectiveness of various link recommendation algorithms on real-world datasets from Twitter and Reddit. The findings indicate that more accurate algorithms can better reduce conflict.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant and timely issue related to online polarization.
- It provides comprehensive background information and justifies the design choices made in the analysis.
- The evaluation across multiple social networks and recommendation algorithms enhances the robustness of the findings.

Weaknesses:
- The use of an undirected graph to model social networks may not accurately reflect the dynamics of platforms like Twitter, raising questions about the implications of this choice.
- The paper does not adequately consider the impact of AI recommendation systems, which have become prevalent in content delivery on social media, potentially limiting the applicability of the proposed approach.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the implications of modeling social networks as undirected graphs and explore how results might differ if directed graphs were used. Additionally, we suggest that the authors address the influence of AI recommendation algorithms on content delivery and clarify whether their approach can be adapted to this context. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to strengthen the justification of their main claims by referencing relevant literature, such as the 2021 PNAS paper on polarization and link recommendation algorithms.
