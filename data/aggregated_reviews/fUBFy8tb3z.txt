Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a trajectory prediction approach for multi-agent configurations, utilizing spatio-temporal interaction features (STIF) and scene-agent interaction features (SAIF) encoded with a transformer based on Fourier transform. The historical and future trajectory encoders share architecture but differ in parameters. The encoded features are summed and passed to a generative model for trajectory space representation, with a transformer predicting the next position. The approach is evaluated on ETH-UCY, SDD, and SNU datasets, demonstrating promising results compared to related methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well written and easy to follow, with a clearly described evaluation.
- The proposed approach achieves convincing results on standard benchmarks.
- A wealth of ablation studies is provided, and the adaptation of CLIP from image-text pairs to the historical-future trajectory feature space is novel.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a novel idea, limiting its overall contribution.
- The related work section would benefit from more direct comparisons with existing methods.
- The rationale for choosing an idempotent generative network over other generative models, such as GANs, is insufficiently explained.
- Comparisons should include all state-of-the-art methods, as some reported results differ significantly from existing literature.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section by providing a more direct comparison of their method with existing approaches. Additionally, clarify the motivation for using an idempotent generative network over other models. It is essential to include a discussion of the computational complexity and inference speed, as well as to provide details on hyper-parameters and the experimental setup. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors include an error analysis to identify failure cases and limitations of the proposed method.
