### Key Points
This paper presents a study on causal imitation learning through the lens of partial identification. The authors demonstrate that when both transitions and rewards are confounded, it is impossible to imitate or improve upon the expert policy. They propose a new imitation learning objective that leverages the partial identification bound of non-identifiable unknowns, proving that optimizing this objective under $0$ guarantees an improvement over the expert policy. The paper introduces two novel algorithms for imitation learning in partially identifiable settings and validates their effectiveness through experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- **Originality and Significance:** The concept of partial identification in causal imitation learning is novel, and the theoretical results are sound.
- **Quality and Clarity:** The paper is well-written, with clear presentation of conclusions and findings.
- **Interesting Problem:** The study addresses the challenges posed by unobserved confounders in imitation learning, which is significant for practical applications.
- **Systematic Theoretical Investigations:** The paper systematically investigates the partial identification problem across various cases, demonstrating both infeasibility in fully identifiable settings and feasibility in partially identifiable ones.

Weaknesses:  
- The proposed methods appear to be direct extensions of existing algorithms like GAIL, raising questions about their novelty.
- The conditions under which the imitator can outperform the expert remain unclear, particularly in cases of reward or transition confounding.
- The derivation of the partial identification bound is missing, which is crucial for the proposed method's validity.
- The assumptions regarding partial identifiability may not hold in practice, limiting generalizability.
- The complexity of the optimization problems involved may hinder practical implementation, especially with neural networks.
- Experimental evaluations lack detail, making reproducibility difficult.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the derivation of the partial identification bound by including it in the appendix to strengthen their argument. Additionally, they should specify how to define the (observational) reward function class $\mathcal{R}$ under unobserved confounding, considering the unknown underlying SCM. It would be beneficial to evaluate the performance of their algorithms in non-confounded MDPs and compare them with existing methods. Furthermore, addressing the assumption that all observational probabilities $P(X,S,Y)$ are positive is essential; the authors should explore the implications of relaxing this assumption. Lastly, including additional experimental details and baselines would enhance the robustness and reproducibility of their findings.
