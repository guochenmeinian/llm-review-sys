### Key Points
This paper presents a methodical approach to synthetic face recognition dataset creation using the hypersphere concept, reinforced by comparisons with state-of-the-art datasets and ablation studies. The authors propose generating synthetic face datasets as a packing problem in the embedding space, incorporating a regularization term that offers a fresh perspective while maintaining data conformity. The paper systematically outlines the problem formulation, methodology, and experimental results, supported by illustrations. It addresses practical applications and ethical concerns related to privacy in face recognition.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The distinctive approach to synthetic face dataset generation as a hypersphere packing problem.  
2. The focus on solving ethical and privacy concerns in models trained on real-world data.  
3. Strong experimental validation and benchmarking of synthetic face dataset generation with desired accuracy.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The use of pretrained models in experimental evaluations, which may introduce bias from the original training data.  
2. Insufficient consideration of demographic bias in the created synthetic face dataset.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comprehensiveness of sections containing mathematical equations related to the regularization term. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explore potential biases in the synthetic datasets as part of future work to enhance the robustness of their findings.
