Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents BEACON, a comprehensive benchmark for RNA-related tasks, encompassing 13 tasks in structural analysis, functional studies, and engineering applications. The authors evaluate various models, including traditional deep learning approaches and advanced RNA language models, and analyze key components such as tokenization methods and positional encodings. They propose BEACON-B, an efficient baseline model that incorporates single nucleotide tokenization and Attention with Linear Biases.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- BEACON provides a holistic evaluation framework covering a wide range of RNA-related tasks.
- The evaluation of various models yields valuable insights into RNA language model components.
- The proposed BEACON-B model serves as a practical and efficient baseline for future RNA modeling research.

Weaknesses:
- The selection criteria for the chosen language models are not justified, raising questions about their applicability.
- The introduction to the baseline RNA language model is missing, which may hinder understanding for those new to the field.
- Limited baseline comparisons, particularly in RNA secondary structure prediction, could weaken the findings.
- The paper lacks detailed ablation studies for BEACON-B, limiting insights into component contributions.
- There is insufficient discussion on dataset preprocessing and balancing, which could impact model performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- We recommend that the authors provide an introduction to the baseline RNA language model to enhance clarity.
- Justify the selection of language models to clarify their relevance and applicability.
- Include additional testing on other datasets to bolster the credibility of BEACON-B.
- Provide detailed explanations for "P@L" and "ACC@K" in Table 3, despite their presence in Section 3.
- Improve the text color for "first", "second", "third", and "fourth" for better readability.
- Ensure consistency in the abbreviation of "Table" throughout the paper.
- Discuss the limitations highlighted in the conclusion, particularly regarding aspects of biology that may be missing from the benchmark.
