### Key Points
This paper presents an algorithm aimed at enhancing the core resilience of graphs, defined as the number of nodes whose core number increases with a new set of anchors. It introduces the follower maximization problem, which seeks to increase the coreness of network vertices within a budget, a task that is NP-hard and W[2]-hard. The authors employ an advanced greedy algorithm and a time-dependent framework, validating their approach through experiments on real-life datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of the follower maximization problem addresses a critical aspect of network resilience that has not been extensively explored.
- The findings are supported by experiments using real-life datasets, demonstrating practical applicability.
- The paper is well-written and easy to understand.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for the objective function lacks empirical or theoretical justification, and the framework appears similar to previous research [35], which may reduce novelty.
- There are questions regarding the algorithm's design, such as the choice to search for followers only within the Shell Component and the updating process of 'g' in Algorithm 4.
- The time complexity of the AdvGreedy algorithm itself has not been analyzed, and comparisons with other methods capable of finding optimal solutions are lacking.
- Some results are presented as Theorems without clear justification, and the novelty of the theoretical results is questionable given existing literature.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the objective function to clarify its advantages over similar functions in the literature. Additionally, a more detailed discussion on the novelty of the approach compared to previous works is necessary. The authors should consider expanding the algorithm to search for followers beyond the Shell Component and clarify the updating process of 'g' in Algorithm 4. An analysis of the overall time complexity of AdvGreedy should be included, along with comparisons to traditional influence maximization methods and other optimal solution techniques. Finally, the authors should ensure that all results presented as Theorems are adequately justified and that the implementation details of the SV method are clearly explained.
