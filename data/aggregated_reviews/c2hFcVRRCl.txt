### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to personalize Large Language Models (LLMs) for web search by constructing lightweight, user-specific entity-centric knowledge stores based on users' search and browsing histories. The authors propose using these knowledge stores to augment LLM prompts, thereby improving search experiences through contextually relevant query suggestions. The evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method, K-LaMP, consistently outperforms other LLM-powered models in terms of relevance and usefulness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach is well-motivated and grounded in user data, demonstrating effectiveness in personalizing LLM outputs.
- The paper is well-structured, clearly organized, and includes new datasets, metrics, and human evaluations that contribute significantly to the field.
- K-LaMP is recognized as an effective lightweight method for enhancing personalized contextual query generation.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks detailed descriptions of key methods, particularly in entity extraction, which is oversimplified.
- Important concepts, such as "k-anonymization," are insufficiently explained, leading to potential confusion.
- The assumption that all entities in search logs reflect user interests is unreasonable, and the baseline configuration for comparisons is flawed, introducing bias.
- The evaluation process raises concerns regarding fairness and effectiveness, particularly in how assessors were provided with user data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the description of the entity extraction method, providing more detailed explanations to clarify its implementation. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on concepts like "k-anonymization" to enhance understanding. To address the uncertainty in manual evaluation, we suggest including more details on the accuracy of this process. Furthermore, the authors should consider mechanisms for exploration within K-LaMP to prevent filter bubbles and user fatigue as search interests evolve. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore alternative evaluation methods that ensure fairness and consistency among assessors.
