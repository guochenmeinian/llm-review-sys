Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method called CRID for Disentangled Representation Learning in non-Markovian causal settings, addressing the disentanglement of latent variables in the presence of unobserved confounders. The authors propose a relaxed notion of disentanglement, allowing for the identification of target variables from others based on causal structure and interventional distributions. The method is theoretically grounded and aims to provide a graphical criterion for disentanglement, validated through simulation experiments. Additionally, the authors propose a framework that enhances the generalizability of causal inference by integrating heterogeneous data distributions, discussing its relationship with existing methods such as CCA.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The problem addressed is significant within the causal representation learning community, particularly regarding non-Markovian systems and partial disentanglement.  
- The theoretical analysis is rigorous, supported by informative examples and a comprehensive background that enhances readability.  
- The CRID algorithm is novel and potentially applicable to various scenarios without requiring strong assumptions.  
- The authors provide a comprehensive theoretical foundation for their model, which is well-supported by relevant literature.  
- The rebuttal effectively addresses reviewer concerns, demonstrating a commitment to clarity and engagement with feedback.  
- The paper's approach to disentanglement is innovative and has potential implications for causal discovery.

Weaknesses:  
- The practicality of the proposed method is questionable due to its reliance on structural knowledge across different domains and interventions.  
- Experiments are limited to synthetic datasets with simple causal graphs, lacking real-world applicability.  
- The presentation is dense with technical jargon, making it difficult to follow, and the organization could be improved to clarify the contributions.  
- Some reviewers express concerns about the suitability of a conference format for the depth of the content, suggesting that a journal article may be more appropriate.  
- There are lingering questions regarding specific technical aspects, such as the treatment of interventions versus domain changes, which remain inadequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by reducing technical density and enhancing discussions around the implications of their theoretical results. Additionally, we suggest expanding the experimental section to include real-world data applications, particularly addressing the gap between the inspiring examples mentioned and the simulation results. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the significance of the relaxed disentanglement notion and its practical implications, as well as to provide a more detailed discussion of the limitations and assumptions underlying their method. We also recommend considering a longer journal article format, which would allow for a more thorough introduction of background and theory. Lastly, we suggest that the authors provide clearer explanations regarding the distinction between interventions and domain changes, ensuring that all updated sections, particularly concerning W3, are easily identifiable in the manuscript.
