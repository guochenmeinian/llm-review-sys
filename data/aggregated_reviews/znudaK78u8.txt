Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an active learning framework for semantic segmentation that utilizes multi-class label queries instead of dominant class labeling. The authors propose a novel query design that employs a multi-hot vector for class representation within a region, alongside two innovative loss functions and an acquisition function that addresses class uncertainty. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showing a significant reduction in annotation costs while maintaining high segmentation performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation for the work is clear, and the proposed multi-class labeling query effectively addresses the limitations of traditional dominant class labeling.
2. Impressive quantitative results indicate that only 4% of clicks can achieve 95% mIoU compared to fully-supervised models.
3. The paper is well-written, with clear figures that aid in understanding the methodology.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the proposed loss functions and acquisition function is questionable, as they appear to be minor modifications of existing techniques.
2. Some details in the manuscript require double-checking for accuracy, particularly regarding the claims about pixel annotation diversity and cost.
3. The experimental comparisons lack a thorough evaluation against classic acquisition strategies, which is critical for validating the proposed method's effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions by explicitly highlighting the novel aspects of their methodology in relation to existing works. Additionally, conducting a sensitivity analysis on the importance of each loss term and providing insights into the performance of the acquisition function with varying hyperparameters would enhance the paper's rigor. Finally, including comparisons with classic acquisition strategies in the experiments would strengthen the validation of the proposed approach.
