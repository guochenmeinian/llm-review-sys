### Key Points
This paper presents a system that utilizes ChatGPT for aspect term extraction (ATE) by generating domain-specific paraphrases of input sentences, which aids in aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). The authors propose a method called ChatGPT-based Edition Fictionalization (CHEF) to enhance the performance of existing PLM-based tools. The empirical evaluation covers two domains, Laptops and Restaurants, using SemEval datasets, demonstrating some improvements in performance metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach is novel and leverages ChatGPT effectively for ATE, potentially inspiring further research.
- The writing is clear, and the examples provided enhance understanding.
- The method shows promise in improving model performance through controlled prompting.

Weaknesses:
- The reported improvements are marginal and may be influenced by model bias introduced by ChatGPT, potentially skewing training data distribution.
- The empirical validation is limited to a narrow set of domains, and the sensitivity of hyperparameters, particularly in the voting mechanism, is not adequately addressed.
- The paper lacks a comprehensive analysis of the time and financial costs associated with using ChatGPT.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and interpretation of the ablation study results to better integrate them into the paper. Additionally, the authors should conduct a more extensive comparison with end-to-end systems and provide qualitative examples to illustrate the claimed improvements with domain-specific models. It would also be beneficial to include a detailed error analysis and address the potential biases introduced by ChatGPT in the generated data. Finally, we suggest that the authors report statistical significance for the observed improvements to strengthen their claims.
