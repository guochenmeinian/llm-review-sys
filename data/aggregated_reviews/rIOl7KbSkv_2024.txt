Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of vulnerabilities in large language model (LLM) watermarking schemes, highlighting significant trade-offs among robustness, utility, and usability. The authors rigorously examine various attacks, including spoofing and removal, that exploit common design choices in existing watermarking methods. They propose defenses based on differential privacy to enhance security against these attacks. The study empirically evaluates state-of-the-art watermarking techniques, demonstrating how typical design choices can inadvertently increase susceptibility to attacks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides novel attack schemes and empirical evidence that deepen the understanding of trade-offs in watermarking systems.
- It rigorously explores the vulnerabilities of common watermarking design choices, contributing valuable insights to the field.
- The proposed defense strategies, particularly those leveraging differential privacy, are innovative and relevant for practitioners.

Weaknesses:
- The attacks primarily critique existing literature, with some trade-offs tied to specific algorithms rather than the watermarking problem itself.
- The robustness definition in Section 4 relies on editing distance, which may not adequately capture semantic changes in text.
- The paper lacks thorough discussions on the applicability of findings to other watermarking types and does not sufficiently address the limitations of the proposed attack methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the robustness definition by considering semantic similarity rather than solely editing distance. This could involve conducting additional experiments on semantics-based watermarking to assess the effectiveness of their attacks. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to expand the discussion on the implications of their findings for various watermarking techniques, including those not covered in the study. Clarifying the differences between "piggyback" and "general" spoofing attacks, as well as providing more context on the adversary's capabilities in detection API attacks, would enhance clarity. Lastly, addressing the limitations of the attack methods and potential drawbacks of implementing differential privacy in real-world systems would strengthen the paper's contributions.
