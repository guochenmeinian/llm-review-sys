Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to online recommendation for clustered users within a multi-armed bandit framework, introducing the B-LATTICE algorithm. The algorithm operates under the constraint that each user can consume at most \( B = O(\log T) \) instances of the same item, aiming to minimize regret while leveraging the structure of user clusters. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for the algorithm's performance and discuss implications related to low-rank matrix completion, introducing a new lower bound on regret using Fano's inequality. Additionally, the authors present an algorithm for Multi-Armed Bandits that operates without knowledge of gap parameters, similar to phased elimination algorithms. They clarify that their phased algorithm treats users as a single cluster until sufficient phases have passed, at which point regret decreases. A detailed regret analysis is provided, emphasizing the importance of dependencies on large quantities like users, items, and rounds, while acknowledging that improving dependence on the small constant \( C \) is a future goal.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a new scheme for factorized recommendations in bandit settings.
- The algorithm effectively addresses optimal regret without requiring gap knowledge.
- The authors provide a thorough regret analysis and clarify the theoretical foundations of their approach.
- Clear exposition of the algorithm and its theoretical underpinnings, making it relatively easy to follow.
- Acknowledgment of limitations and proposals for future work to improve dependence on \( C \).

Weaknesses:
- The budget constraint of recommending top \( T/B \) items is somewhat artificial and lacks clear theoretical justification.
- Key algorithmic components are relegated to the appendix, which may hinder understanding.
- The algorithm's dependence on parameters \( B \) and \( C \) is problematic, as these are difficult to ascertain beforehand.
- The complexity of the algorithm may hinder understanding, and empirical evaluations are limited, primarily based on synthetic datasets, lacking robustness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the problem setup by explicitly defining what constitutes an arm and who pulls the arms in the context of their algorithm. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed explanation of the algorithm's complexity and implementation to enhance clarity. We also recommend improving the theoretical justification for the budget constraint of \( O(\log T) \). Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include more empirical evaluations, particularly on larger datasets, to demonstrate the algorithm's performance against greedy baselines and other relevant methods. Clarifying the assumptions regarding the number of clusters \( C \) and the implications of these assumptions on the algorithm's robustness would also strengthen the paper. Finally, we urge the authors to simplify the algorithm where possible and to ensure that all relevant algorithmic details are included in the main text rather than the appendix.
