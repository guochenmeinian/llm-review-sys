### Key Points
This paper presents a new Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) surrogate for Bayesian optimization, utilizing last-layer variational approximation. The network acts as a nonlinear feature extractor, serving as covariates for a generalized linear model (GLM) with Gaussian priors, allowing for analytical solutions and Gaussian predictions. The authors conduct thorough testing against various baselines, including Gaussian Processes (GPs) and other BNNs, across synthetic and high-dimensional problems. The work introduces a probabilistic model that enhances computational efficiency through variational lower bound optimization, demonstrating competitive performance in numerical experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well-written, technically sound, and presents interesting results that contribute significantly to the community. The execution is clear, with a broad set of experimental tests and comprehensive ablation studies.

Weaknesses:  
The novelty of the work appears limited, primarily differing from Snoek et al. (2015) by using variational lower bound optimization instead of direct log-likelihood optimization. Additionally, the authors could better address the limitations of their approach, particularly regarding the retraining costs compared to GPs, and the ambiguity surrounding the term "analytical" in the context of Thompson sampling optimization.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the limitations of their work, particularly the cost of retraining the network versus updating a GP, especially with a small number of data points. Clarifying the meaning of "analytical" in relation to the optimization of the sampled network for Thompson sampling would also enhance understanding. Furthermore, including a comparison with the method of Snoek et al. (2015) would help assess the benefits of the proposed modifications.
