### Key Points
This paper presents scMAE, a masked autoencoder designed for processing high-throughput single-cell cytometry data, particularly for immune cells. The authors propose a pre-training fine-tuning strategy using a Transformer-based model to derive informative embeddings from protein marker expressions, which can be utilized for downstream tasks like cell type prediction and marker expression imputation. The method demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional techniques, achieving high accuracy in rare cell types and showing good generalization across experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The innovative BERT-like pre-training fine-tuning strategy effectively leverages large-scale unlabeled data, enhancing performance in cell cytometry and potentially in higher-dimensional scRNA-seq data.
- The experimental design for cell type prediction is robust, with scMAE showing high performance in cross-dataset evaluations, indicating its capability to manage batch effects and experimental biases.
- The model extracts biologically reasonable relationships, despite limited interpretability from attention scores.

Weaknesses:
- The source of scMAE's superior performance remains unclear, as it is uncertain whether it stems from the pre-training fine-tuning strategy or the Transformer architecture. A comparison with a method using a Transformer encoder and cell type classifier trained solely on the internal dataset is necessary.
- The evaluation of cell-type prediction assumes consistent marker protein profiles across datasets, which may not reflect real-world scenarios. Systematic evaluations with varying marker groups would be beneficial.
- The model's performance on distinct cell types, such as pDC, was subpar compared to off-the-shelf classifiers, and this discrepancy was not addressed.
- The lack of uncertainty quantification in predictions raises concerns about their reliability for practitioners.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the model description, particularly in Figure 1a and the mathematical notations, to enhance understanding. Additionally, the authors should discuss the performance of scMAE on distinct cell types and provide insights into uncertainty quantification for predictions. A more thorough exploration of the novelty of their approach and potential applications of pre-trained models in mass cytometry data processing would strengthen the paper. Finally, we suggest that the authors include discussions on the model's performance in real-world settings, especially when different groups of marker proteins are involved.
