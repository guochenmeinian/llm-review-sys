Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Elliptical Attention, a novel self-attention mechanism utilizing the Mahalanobis distance metric to define hyper-ellipsoidal attention regions around queries. This approach aims to enhance model robustness and mitigate representation collapse, demonstrating effectiveness across various tasks such as language modeling, image classification, and segmentation. The authors provide a theoretical framework and extensive experimental results that validate the proposed method's superiority over traditional attention mechanisms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper offers a compelling blend of theoretical foundations and robust experimental evidence supporting Elliptical Attention's efficacy.
2. The shift to hyper-ellipsoidal attention regions enhances sensitivity to contextually relevant features and robustness against noise.
3. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate improvements over traditional transformers in both clean and noisy conditions.

Weaknesses:
1. The experimental framework lacks detailed setups, making it difficult for other researchers to replicate the work.
2. The formulation of Elliptical Attention is unclear, and the inclusion of pseudo codes for core algorithms would be beneficial.
3. Figures 3 and 4 are of low resolution, and Figure 2 lacks sufficient explanation, leading to confusion regarding its insights.
4. The paper's organization is disconnected, and it contains numerous abbreviations that hinder readability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental framework by providing a more meticulous comparative analysis, particularly juxtaposing Elliptical Attention with standard Euclidean distance-based self-attention across various model sizes and image resolutions. Additionally, we suggest including detailed results such as memory usage, number of model parameters, FLOPs, and throughputs for a clearer comparison. The authors should also clarify the formulation of Elliptical Attention and consider including pseudo codes for core algorithms. Furthermore, enhancing the resolution of figures and improving the overall organization of the manuscript would significantly benefit reader comprehension.
