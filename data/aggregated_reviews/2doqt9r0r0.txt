Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an online learning framework for the $k$-median clustering problem, incorporating movement costs associated with relocating facilities. The algorithm must place $k$ centers before observing the client set, incurring both connection and movement costs. The authors achieve an $O(\log n)$ multiplicative regret and an additive term of $O(\beta \sqrt{T})$, where $\beta$ is dependent on various parameters. The main contribution is the development of efficient algorithms for hierarchically separated trees (HSTs) and a novel rounding technique that preserves costs. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a well-motivated model that incorporates moving costs, enhancing the realism of the problem.
- It achieves an $O(\log n)$ multiplicative regret, improving upon previous results.

Weaknesses:
- The additive term $\beta$ is excessively large, which may limit practical applicability.
- Many ideas are standard and lack novelty, particularly in the fractional to integral conversion process.
- The reliance on HSTs raises questions about the generalizability of the results to other metric spaces.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the novel contributions by providing a more detailed comparison with the work of Fotakis et al., particularly regarding the differences in techniques. Additionally, we suggest addressing the concerns about the large additive term by exploring potential optimizations. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the implications of relying on HSTs and to consider extending their results to broader metric spaces.
