### Key Points
This paper presents an image selection method aimed at incrementally enriching an observation set with informative images from a large unknown set, focusing on maximizing information gain with a limited number of images. The authors propose a methodology that integrates Multi-Viewpoint Slot Attention for object-centric representations, facilitating the identification of the most informative images through comparative analysis. Additionally, the approach employs a diffusion model alongside slot attention and viewpoint encoding for image prediction and validation of new viewpoints. Experimental results indicate improvements in segmentation and reconstruction tasks, highlighting the method's effectiveness. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel method that effectively disentangles content and viewpoint information using Multi-Viewpoint Slot Attention, offering a fresh perspective in the field.
- Validation across four task scenarios provides a comprehensive evaluation of the method's advantages for various downstream multi-view applications.
- The active viewpoint selection strategy enhances performance in segmentation and reconstruction tasks compared to traditional methods.

Weaknesses:
- The method may be time-consuming due to its two-loop selection strategy; a detailed analysis of the trade-off between processing time and performance gains is recommended.
- The exact benefit of the viewpoint selection strategy in predicting images from unknown viewpoints remains unclear, and it is questioned whether S_view can be obtained in image prediction tasks.
- The necessity of the Prediction Set within the framework is ambiguous; a comparative experiment where the Prediction Set equals the Unknown Set could yield valuable insights.
- Presentation issues exist, particularly in Section 3.1.2, where clarity on terms like $h_m$ and $v$ is lacking, and figures are too small to interpret effectively.
- Limited evaluation on synthetic datasets raises concerns about generalization to real-world scenarios, and the rationale for re-rendering datasets instead of using existing ones is unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation, particularly in Section 3.1.2, by providing more detailed explanations of key terms and ensuring figures are adequately sized for visibility. Additionally, conducting a detailed analysis of the trade-off between processing time and performance gains is essential. We suggest exploring the necessity of the Prediction Set by conducting a comparative experiment where it matches the Unknown Set. Furthermore, the authors should address the generalization capabilities of their model to real-world datasets and clarify the computational complexity of the active viewpoint selection process. Finally, we encourage the authors to consider releasing the code and datasets used in their experiments to enhance reproducibility and facilitate further research.
