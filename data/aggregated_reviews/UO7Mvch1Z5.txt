### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for reconstructing 3D models from a single image, structured in two stages: (1) generating multi-view RGB images and normal maps through fine-tuning diffusion models, and (2) optimizing a mesh using a multi-view normal-based reconstruction module called ISOMER. The authors claim significant improvements in both visual and geometric quality compared to existing methods, validated through extensive experiments on the Google Scanned Objects (GSO) dataset. Additionally, the paper discusses a multi-view image generation method that integrates various techniques to enhance mesh quality and representation, proposing operations such as edge collapse, edge split, and edge flip to improve mesh quality by addressing defects. The dual-model strategy of 256-to-512 and 512-to-2048 is designed to balance computational load with multi-view consistency and detail refinement. The authors also propose a weighting strategy for different views during the ExplicitTarget calculation to mitigate artifacts, particularly in the front view, while acknowledging the strengths of existing methods like CLAY in handling unseen features.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- **Novelty:** The introduction of the ISOMER module effectively optimizes 3D geometry using multi-view normal information.  
- **High-Resolution Output:** The approach achieves high-resolution textures and improved geometry, particularly in frontal views, leveraging advanced diffusion models for super-resolution.  
- **Extensive Experiments:** The authors conduct thorough qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.  
- **Mesh Quality Improvement:** Proposed operations (edge collapse, edge split, edge flip) effectively address mesh quality and defect management.  
- **Dual-Model Strategy:** This strategy enhances both computational efficiency and output quality.  
- **Weighting Strategy:** The thoughtful weighting strategy for different views enhances visual quality and addresses multi-view inconsistency.

Weaknesses:  
- **Technical Presentation Issues:** Certain equations lack clarity and rigor, leading to potential misunderstandings (e.g., Eq (1) and Eq (5) need revisions for coherence).  
- **Limited Evaluation Scope:** The evaluation is based on only 30 objects, which is insufficient for robust conclusions, especially given the complexity of real-world objects.  
- **Artifact Issues:** The method struggles with non-frontal views, leading to visible artifacts and inconsistencies, particularly due to the initialization process using only front and back views.  
- **Lack of Comprehensive Ablation Studies:** The paper does not sufficiently explore the impact of various components, such as the image-to-multiview stage and super-resolution techniques.  
- **Performance Gap Concerns:** The performance gap between Wonder3D+ISOMER and Unique3D raises questions about the contributions of multi-view generation versus reconstruction methods.  
- **Limited Qualitative Examples:** The qualitative examples provided in the rebuttal are limited, reducing their persuasive power.  
- **Failure Case Analysis:** There is a lack of discussion on failure cases, which could provide valuable insights into method performance. Concerns about distortion in non-zero elevation input views remain, as some reviewers noted noticeable distortion in specific examples.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and rigor of the technical presentation, particularly in equations such as Eq (1) and Eq (5). Additionally, we suggest conducting a more extensive evaluation on a larger dataset to strengthen the quantitative results and include diverse real-world objects. To address artifact issues, consider refining the initialization process to accommodate non-frontal views. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to perform more comprehensive ablation studies to assess the contributions of different components, such as the image-to-multiview stage and the super-resolution network. We also recommend improving the clarity of the introduction by explicitly delineating their approach in relation to existing methods. Including more comprehensive experimental data to quantitatively measure multi-view inconsistency and support claims of enhanced generation speed would be beneficial. The authors should provide a detailed quantitative evaluation of the ISOMER module in the revised version and include more qualitative examples, ideally at least six for each experiment. Lastly, we recommend including a comprehensive analysis of failure cases, covering inconsistent predictions across views, generation of geometric structures in unseen areas, and inaccuracies in predicted normal maps, as well as clarifying the handling of input views regarding elevation and rotation to address concerns about distortion in non-zero elevation scenarios.
