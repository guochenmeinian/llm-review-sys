Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) framework based on Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) distance. The authors establish strong duality results for a Lagrangian penalty variation of the proposed problem under specific conditions. The algorithm is tested on linear and logistic regression, as well as linear classification tasks, demonstrating increased robustness to outliers compared to baseline methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces an original approach to the DRO problem using UOT distance to define the ambiguity set.
- Theoretical justifications for the dual form and convergence analysis of the algorithm are provided.
- Empirical results show that the proposed method enhances robustness to outliers compared to chosen baselines.

Weaknesses:
- Some assumptions regarding the ‘outlier-robustness’ property are inadequately explained, particularly the dependence on the parameter $\beta$ in the UOT framework.
- The explanations regarding the function $h$ and its effect on outlier robustness lack clarity, especially for the chosen $\lambda$ in experiments.
- The empirical evaluation is limited, missing comparisons with other outlier-robust DRO approaches and lacking an ablation study of key parameters.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the assumptions related to the ‘outlier-robustness’ property, particularly the role of the parameter $\beta$. Additionally, the authors should provide a more thorough explanation of the function $h$ and its implications for different values of $\lambda$. We suggest including a comprehensive comparison with other outlier-robust DRO methods and conducting an ablation study on parameters $\beta$ and $\lambda$. Furthermore, a theoretical analysis of the excess risk associated with the UOT-DRO would enhance the paper's contributions. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the choice of cost function and hyperparameters in their experiments.
