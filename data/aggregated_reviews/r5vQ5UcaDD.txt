### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical framework for approximating node opinion metrics, such as polarization and disagreement, in the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) model, achieving sublinear time complexity relative to network size. The authors propose algorithms that connect FJ opinion dynamics with personalized PageRank, demonstrating faster empirical performance while maintaining low approximation errors. The paper includes experiments on real-world graphs to evaluate the proposed algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The problem addressed is significant and relevant to the community.
2. The technical aspects are robust, integrating various approximation techniques effectively.
3. The paper is well-organized and clearly presented.

Weaknesses:
1. The relationship between the FJ model and PageRank is not novel and should acknowledge prior work.
2. The results are sometimes overstated, particularly in comparisons of runtimes for estimating node opinions versus direct computation.
3. Experimental results do not convincingly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approximations, particularly for larger networks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the results by providing a more accurate comparison against existing methods, particularly the baseline presented in [31]. Additionally, conducting multiple trials for time measurements and reporting averages and standard deviations would enhance the reliability of the experimental findings. We also suggest that the authors provide a more comprehensive analysis of the practical implications of their theoretical results to better connect with the web research community. Finally, clarifying the assumptions regarding the complexity of operations on the graph and addressing the lack of a formal name for the algorithm would improve the paper's readability and accessibility.
