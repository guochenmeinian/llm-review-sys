Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a dynamic subgroup identification strategy within covariate-adjusted response-adaptive randomization (CARA) for clinical trials. The authors propose an adaptive method that dynamically adjusts treatment allocation to the best-performing subgroups based on ongoing trial data, extending traditional fixed-design trials to an online setup. Additionally, the paper introduces a bootstrap procedure for selecting hyperparameter pairs \((c_{\texttt{L}}, c_{\texttt{R}})\), which determines the neighborhood for merging subgroups. The authors clarify that the dynamic subgroup identification algorithm involves a resampling step at each stage, generating bootstrap samples from a Gaussian distribution. They also assert that the final tie set selection is independent of the parameters \(\Delta\) and \(\gamma\), while acknowledging a typo in the reported range of \(\gamma\) in Table 1. The paper contributes theoretically by demonstrating the validity, asymptotic normality, and efficiency of the estimator for the best subgroup treatment effect.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel dynamic subgroup identification strategy that addresses inefficiencies in traditional fixed-design trials, making a significant original contribution to the field.
- High-quality research is evidenced by rigorous theoretical results and empirical validation using a synthetic clinical trial on cirrhosis data.
- The authors provide a clear explanation of their bootstrap procedure and the algorithms involved in subgroup identification and hyperparameter selection.
- The inclusion of additional simulation results demonstrates the method's robustness and insensitivity to the choice of \(\gamma\).
- The paper is clearly written and well-structured, with complex definitions and algorithms effectively demonstrated.

Weaknesses:
- Clarity can be improved, as some sentences and equations are confusing. Specific issues are noted in the question section.
- The formulation of the problem requires further justification, particularly regarding the focus on maximizing the probability of correctly identifying the best subgroup rather than addressing the overall welfare of patients in personalized medicine.
- The related literature is insufficiently discussed, and a more comprehensive comparison with existing methods is needed to justify the proposed approach.
- The tie set selection process is perceived to be dependent on \(\Delta\) and \(\gamma\), which raises concerns about the rigor of the methodology.
- The upper bound of \(\Delta\) set at 0.99 appears arbitrary and lacks sufficient justification.
- There is a noted typo in the reported range of \(\gamma\), which complicates verification of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by addressing confusing sentences and equations identified in the question section. Additionally, the authors should provide further justification for their problem formulation, particularly in relation to the practical considerations of personalized medicine. A more in-depth literature review should be included in the Appendix to compare their method with existing approaches in subgroup identification. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors elaborate on the role of patient covariates in their design and clarify the contribution of these covariates to the proposed algorithms. We also recommend improving the clarity of the tie set selection process to explicitly demonstrate its independence from \(\Delta\) and \(\gamma\). Additionally, we suggest providing a more rigorous justification for the upper bound of \(\Delta\) to enhance methodological robustness. Lastly, we encourage the authors to correct the typo in Table 1 and consider providing the code for the simulation to facilitate verification of the reported results.
