Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to gradual domain adaptation using distributionally robust optimization (DRO), focusing on adapting models across successive datasets by controlling the Wasserstein distance between distributions on a favorable manifold. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for generalization error and validate their findings through experiments. The study emphasizes the robustness of the model in mitigating distribution shifts across multiple target domains.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The theoretical contributions are substantial, offering rigorous guarantees on model adaptation and generalization errors across domains.
- The algorithm ensures bounded error regardless of $T$, with the potential for linear error reduction under appropriately constrained distributions.
- The paper is well-structured, effectively communicating complex theoretical concepts with rigorous mathematical formalism.

Weaknesses:
- The proof of theoretical results relies on stringent conditions, such as the assumption of expandable distributions, which may limit generalization to real-world data.
- The use of Gaussian mixture model data distributions and "expandable" distributions is somewhat disconnected from practical applications.
- The error of $\theta^*$ in previous domains remains uncertain, and the computation of the WDRO problem under the manifold constraint requires further clarification.
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion of the implications of its assumptions and the relationship to existing work in gradual domain adaptation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by revising the statement of Theorem 3.1 and Definition 4.1, ensuring that the implications of the assumptions are explicitly discussed. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the discussion of the relationship to existing work on gradual domain adaptation and providing justifications for the DRO algorithm presented in Algorithm 1. A thorough proofreading to address typos and missing references would also be beneficial.
