Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents LB-GP-UCB, a Bayesian optimization algorithm addressing the problem of unknown kernel length scales. The authors propose a method that adaptively selects length scales from a candidate set and provides both empirical and theoretical validation of the algorithm's performance. Notably, LB-GP-UCB demonstrates a logarithmic improvement in regret compared to the A-GP-UCB algorithm, which is a significant advancement in the field.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for the study is well-articulated, particularly regarding the limitations of the A-GP-UCB algorithm.
- The comparison with A-GP-UCB in terms of regret optimality is both interesting and novel.
- The paper includes sufficient numerical evaluations and provides anonymized code for reproducibility.
- The introduction of a regret balancing scheme is a clever contribution that enhances the algorithm's performance.

Weaknesses:
- The analysis is limited to cases where length scale parameters are uniform across coordinates, which restricts practical applicability.
- The method for calculating the quantity $R^{\theta}$ is ambiguous and lacks clarity regarding its exact upper bound.
- The paper does not adequately compare LB-GP-UCB against other empirical algorithms, potentially overlooking important benchmarks.
- The dimensionality of the objective function is not specified, which may impact the algorithm's performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the calculation method for $R^{\theta}$, specifying its exact upper bound. Additionally, the authors should discuss the limitations of their analysis regarding uniform length scale parameters and consider extending the algorithm to accommodate varying length scales across coordinates. We suggest including comparisons with other empirical algorithms and additional benchmarks to strengthen the experimental evaluation. Finally, providing insights into the impact of dimensionality on LB-GP-UCB's performance would enhance the paper's comprehensiveness.
