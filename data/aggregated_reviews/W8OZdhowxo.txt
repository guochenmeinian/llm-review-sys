Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the LIG-MM benchmark for loop invariant generation, specifically targeting programs that manipulate complex data structures and memory. The authors propose a novel approach, LLM-SE, which integrates large language models (LLMs) with symbolic execution, fine-tuned through self-supervised learning to automate loop invariant generation. The benchmark includes a variety of data structures and evaluates multiple baselines, including GPT-4, to assess existing methods' capabilities. However, the paper lacks detailed statistics on sample distributions across different data structures and does not provide a comprehensive analysis of current methods or ablation experiments to demonstrate the performance improvements offered by the LLM-SE framework.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Creation of the LIG-MM benchmark addresses a significant gap in generating loop invariants for complex data structures.
- The evaluation of multiple baselines on LIG-MM offers insights into existing approaches' effectiveness.
- The introduction of the LLM-SE framework effectively combines LLMs with symbolic execution for loop invariant generation.

Weaknesses:
- The paper does not provide statistics on the number of samples for different data structures, raising concerns about potential uneven distribution.
- There is a lack of fine-grained experimental analysis of current methods on LIG-MM, limiting insights into their performance across various data structures.
- The absence of ablation experiments for LLM-SE fails to clarify the performance improvements when integrated with the baseline (CodeGen).

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including detailed statistics on the sample distribution across different data structures to address concerns about uneven representation. Additionally, conducting a fine-grained experimental analysis of current methods on LIG-MM would provide valuable insights into their performance and weaknesses. We also suggest incorporating ablation experiments to quantify the performance improvements achieved by the LLM-SE framework compared to the baseline (CodeGen). Lastly, enhancing the clarity of the benchmark details and the selection criteria for the collected programs would strengthen the overall contribution of the paper.
