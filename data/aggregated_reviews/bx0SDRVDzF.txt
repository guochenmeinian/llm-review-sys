### Key Points
This paper presents TALAR, a method for learning a vector representation of instructions through a referential game. TALAR generates a task vector from (state, next-state) pairs, which is back-translated into natural language by a receiver. A translation from natural language to task vectors is learned, and during policy learning, the instruction is translated into task language for the policy. The results indicate that TALAR outperforms other task embedding methods. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The emergence of task representation through a referential game is original and contributes to policy learning.  
- Experiments demonstrate TALAR's superior performance compared to standard methods in the RL community.  
- The finding that a more linearly separable task representation enhances instruction-following performance is significant.  

Weaknesses:  
- The rationale for preferring the emergent representation over a predefined structured representation is unclear.  
- The method's ability to handle out-of-distribution (OOD) natural language is questionable, given the complexity of natural language.  
- Some sections, particularly in the methods, are difficult to understand, and certain baseline comparisons are missing.  
- A separate training dataset is required, which may be costly and sensitive to the type of natural language instructions collected.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity in the methods section and consider including a predicate representation in the title. Additionally, we suggest comparing TALAR against a handcrafted structured representation baseline to clarify the necessity of the referential game. The authors should also address how the method will manage OOD natural language and elaborate on the rationale for learning the task language independently from the translator. Including a detailed explanation of the instruction generation process using ChatGPT would enhance understanding.
