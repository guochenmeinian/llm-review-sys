### Key Points
This paper presents a novel active learning framework that integrates Bayesian optimization with the RBFE method for optimizing antibody affinity. The authors propose a method that iteratively suggests promising sequences for simulators to evaluate, aiming to enhance the search for improved binders while reducing reliance on costly wetlab experiments. The visual representation in Figure 1 effectively aids in understanding the framework.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1) The affinity prediction of antibodies is an intriguing area, and the experiments utilize solid pre-computed data pools within a realistic full-loop setting.
2) The proposed active learning framework has the potential to decrease the need for time-consuming wetlab experiments.

Weaknesses:
1) Key parameters for the Gaussian Process (GP) kernel, such as the value of gamma in the RBF kernel, are not provided (Page 3, line 90).
2) The AbLang2 encoding method is noted to consume excessive resources (Page 4, line 143), and the BLOSUM encoding did not terminate in validation mode due to large embedding sizes (Page 4, line 131). The authors should consider exploring dimensionality reduction techniques (UMAP, Autoencoder, Random Projection) to enhance computational efficiency.
3) The paper lacks a detailed explanation of traditional RBFE methods, leaving it unclear whether they involve random sampling. A direct comparison between traditional methods and the proposed active learning framework would be beneficial.
4) The justification for using a genetic algorithm to optimize the acquisition function is insufficiently discussed, particularly regarding its advantages over alternatives like random search or gradient-based methods.
5) The expected improvement acquisition function may not be optimal for high-dimensional contexts; the authors should discuss alternative acquisition functions or techniques better suited for such scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of key parameters for the Gaussian Process kernel, particularly the gamma value in the RBF kernel. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of traditional RBFE methods and include a comparison with the proposed framework. Justifying the choice of the genetic algorithm for optimizing the acquisition function and discussing its advantages over other methods would strengthen the paper. Finally, we suggest that the authors explore alternative acquisition functions or techniques that are more effective in high-dimensional settings.
