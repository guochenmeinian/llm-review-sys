Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
The paper introduces Geom3D, a framework designed for comparing geometric machine learning models in protein modeling, utilizing a collection of datasets and tasks. It aims to provide insights into model performance and engineering tricks. The manuscript presents a benchmarking study on geometric representation learning for molecules, proteins, and crystalline materials, employing 16 models and 14 pretraining methods across 46 datasets. The authors classify symmetry-informed geometric models into three categories and conduct extensive experiments, including ablation studies on training tricks. We appreciate the acknowledgment of our work as a unified framework beneficial for the research community, particularly in addressing diverse tasks. We have clarified our development efforts, emphasizing reproducibility, data preprocessing, and optimization analysis. Our platform supports various datasets and models, facilitating user customization, while addressing concerns regarding computational costs for error bars and the complexities of dataset-specific preprocessing.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
1. The framework offers valuable insights into heuristics employed in geometric models, enhancing our understanding of model utility.
2. It provides a comprehensive platform for consistently comparing various geometric models.
3. The extensive experimentation across multiple tasks and models strengthens the paper's credibility and relevance to the community.
4. We have developed a unified dataloader class and provided extensive tutorials to aid users in utilizing Geom3D effectively.

**Weaknesses:**
1. The name "Geom3D" is generic and could be more descriptive, as it overlaps with existing software; we recognize the need for more specific naming conventions.
2. The paper's primary audience appears to be researchers in geometric modeling rather than scientists leveraging AI, which should be clarified.
3. The initial sections are heavily focused on background material, limiting space for discussing contributions.
4. Documentation lacks clarity on software architecture, usage, and extension of the framework, and some terminologies may be challenging for non-experts.
5. We face limitations regarding computational resources, which hinder our ability to benchmark multiple random seeds extensively.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We suggest renaming the framework to something more informative, such as `Symmetric3D`, that reflects its purpose.
2. The paper should clarify its target audience and emphasize its relevance to geometric machine learners.
3. We recommend trimming background content to allow for a more in-depth discussion of the framework and its contributions.
4. Improving figure font sizes and enhancing the clarity of experimental settings would benefit readability.
5. Additional documentation on the software architecture, usage, and extension methods should be prioritized to assist users in navigating the framework effectively.
6. We suggest including all random seeds for dataset splitting and reporting the mean and standard deviation for each model to avoid bias.
7. We will release detailed hyperparameter information for all tasks and emphasize our commitment to reproducibility by sharing all hyperparameters and checkpoints on Hugging Face. We plan to incorporate these points in our revised manuscript, understanding that changes may affect responses to other reviewers.
