Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Stochastic Optimal Control Matching (SOCM), a novel learning algorithm designed to numerically solve general formulations of Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC) problems involving affined-controlled diffusion processes. The authors build on the Iterative Diffusion Optimization (IDO) framework, proposing a least-squares regression loss with multiplicative importance weights to fit a parametric control to a vector field influenced by optimized reparameterization matrices. The design incorporates a path-wise reparameterization trick for gradient computation, leading to a bias-variance decomposition of the SOCM loss. Empirical evaluations demonstrate SOCM's superior performance on multiple benchmarks compared to existing IDO losses, although the method is currently limited to linear Gaussian models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with clear definitions, intuitive explanations, and a solid theoretical foundation, including detailed proofs and a novel reparameterization trick.
- The relationship to prior work is well-established, particularly in comparing SOCM loss with previous IDO losses.
- The introduction of the path-wise reparameterization trick is a significant contribution that may have broader applications beyond the current framework.

Weaknesses:
- A major weakness is the lack of additional numerical experiments in realistic settings, such as scenarios where the control expression is unknown. This limits the impact of SOCM, as comparisons with other methods on challenging distributions are not provided.
- The complexity/accuracy tradeoff of IDO losses, including SOCM, is not adequately highlighted, as the authors only present results for one setting.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical evaluation by including additional numerical experiments in more realistic settings, such as sampling tasks from complex distributions. This would enhance the assessment of SOCM's practical utility. Additionally, we suggest providing a comprehensive analysis of the complexity/accuracy tradeoff across all settings to give a clearer picture of SOCM's performance. Furthermore, addressing the scalability of SOCM and exploring its application to nonlinear or non-Gaussian systems would significantly broaden its applicability.
