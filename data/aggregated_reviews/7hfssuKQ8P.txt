### Key Points
This paper presents a method for zero-shot multi-label attribute-value extraction using inductive inference in heterogeneous hypergraphs. The approach aims to address the challenges of extracting unseen attributes from new products without labeled data. By leveraging complex high-order relations and inductive link prediction, the authors propose a feasible solution that enhances traditional knowledge graphs with consumer behavior insights.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method effectively addresses the important problem of zero-shot multi-label attribute-value extraction.
2. The method section is detailed and well-organized, providing clarity on the approach.
3. Experiments are validated across diverse datasets, showcasing solid and rich results.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper does not clearly articulate the specific challenges associated with zero-shot multi-label attribute-value extraction.
2. The related work section lacks highly relevant references, particularly regarding hypergraphs in zero-shot contexts.
3. The multi-label problem remains inadequately resolved within the proposed framework.
4. The authors do not sufficiently explain how their method achieves minimum time and space complexity and which factors contribute to this efficiency.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the challenges specific to zero-shot multi-label attribute-value extraction. Additionally, it is crucial to enhance the related work section by including pertinent references that discuss hypergraphs in zero-shot scenarios. The authors should also provide a more comprehensive resolution to the multi-label problem. Furthermore, we suggest elaborating on the mechanisms that enable the proposed method to achieve its claimed time and space efficiency, detailing the key contributing factors.
