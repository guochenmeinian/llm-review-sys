Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents MUN, a novel goal-directed exploration algorithm for model-based reinforcement learning aimed at enhancing learning in sparse-reward environments. The authors propose a bidirectional world model that predicts state transitions between arbitrary subgoal states, improving generalization and exploration efficiency. Additionally, the method includes DAD (Distinct Action Discovery) for identifying key subgoals, which are essential for complex tasks. The paper demonstrates that MUN outperforms baseline methods in various challenging environments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-organized and provides a clear explanation of the proposed method and its components.  
- MUN addresses limitations of traditional world models through bidirectional learning and effective subgoal identification.  
- Strong empirical results show significant improvements over baseline methods in complex environments.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks a comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art model-based RL methods and does not adequately discuss hyperparameter sensitivity.  
- There is no theoretical analysis of the method's convergence or optimality guarantees.  
- The distinction from the Go-Explore approach is unclear, and the evaluation of the world model quality is insufficient.  
- The assumptions regarding the symmetry of problem setups and the heuristic for subgoal discovery require further discussion and validation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Algorithm 1 by introducing clear markers to differentiate between steps in the world model and those in the real environment. Additionally, a more thorough evaluation of the world model's quality is necessary, including a detailed analysis of the ablation study comparing MUN with MUN-noDAD. We suggest that the authors address the limitations of their approach by discussing the implications of the assumptions made, particularly regarding the symmetry of problem setups. Finally, a clearer distinction from the Go-Explore approach, possibly through a pictorial explanation, would enhance the paper's clarity.
