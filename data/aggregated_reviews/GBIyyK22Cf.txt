### Key Points
This paper presents a recommendation system method for federated learning, introducing the Correlated Low-rank Structure Update (CoLR) framework to enhance communication efficiency and privacy protection. The authors detail the model architecture, loss function, and parameter updates, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the method. The work is notable for its originality in applying low-rank updates within federated learning and for proposing two communication frameworks, CoLR and Subsampling CoLR (SCoLR), aimed at reducing communication overhead. The significance of this research lies in its potential applications in privacy-sensitive areas, such as recommendation systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with clear language and thorough explanations of key concepts, enabling readers to grasp the mathematical expressions and algorithmic steps.
- The experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in efficiency, validating the proposed method against various baselines and datasets.
- The integration of low-rank structure updates within federated learning is a novel approach that contributes to the field.

Weaknesses:
- The limitations of the method and its applicability in practical scenarios are not adequately addressed.
- The innovation appears limited, as the proposed mechanism mainly combines existing methodologies without substantial advancement.
- The security optimization is underexplored, primarily focusing on efficiency rather than comprehensive security measures.
- The paper lacks a detailed review of recent relevant research and contains errors that need correction.
- The experimental setup and results require further clarification, particularly regarding the algorithms used and the interpretation of experimental charts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the limitations and practical applicability of their method, addressing questions about performance in real-world scenarios and scalability with large datasets. Additionally, the authors should clarify the rationale behind randomly initializing the B matrix and provide more theoretical underpinning and experimental validation for this choice. A more comprehensive review of recent literature is necessary, including relevant works that were not cited. The authors should also rectify textual errors and enhance the explanations of the experimental setup and results, ensuring that all figures and tables are referenced and clearly explained. Finally, we suggest including comparisons of SCoLR with other algorithms to strengthen the experimental findings.
