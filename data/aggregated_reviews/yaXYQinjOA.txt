**Key Points:**
This paper presents a novel method for generating additional training data in autonomous driving scenarios by utilizing existing LDM and VLM. The method aims to create diverse and challenging samples without human intervention, with its effectiveness demonstrated through experiments in semantic segmentation and end-to-end autonomous driving tasks.

**Strengths and Weaknesses:**
We find the study of using generative models for creating diverse training data to be intriguing and beneficial for training perception models. The paper is well-structured, and the experiments are conducted thoroughly, yielding comprehensive quantitative results and convincing qualitative outcomes. However, we note that conditioning on semantic segmentation sometimes fails to guide the LDM effectively, resulting in unrealistic and physically inconsistent samples. Additionally, the scope of selected tasks is limited, and validation on more challenging tasks, such as 3D object detection, would enhance the study. Furthermore, the absence of an ablation study on the ratio of synthesized to real data limits our understanding of how to utilize the synthesized data effectively.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
We suggest improving the method by addressing the conditioning issues to enhance the realism and physical consistency of generated samples. Expanding the range of tasks to include more challenging scenarios, such as 3D object detection, would strengthen the findings. Lastly, incorporating an ablation study on the ratio of synthesized data to real data would provide valuable insights into the effective use of the generated data.
