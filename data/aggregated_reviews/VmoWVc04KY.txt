### Key Points
This paper discusses extreme summarization, focusing on single-sentence summaries, and compares automatic summarization systems to features of quality human summarization. It provides human evaluations of automatic summarization and examines correlations between observed features and human ratings. The authors analyze over a million article summary pairs from various genres, using regression models to classify sentences and correlate summary features with reader preferences. The study reveals that single-sentence summaries exhibit higher lexical diversity and longer words compared to source texts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper presents a well-motivated problem statement and replicable experiments on large, accessible datasets.  
- It offers valuable theoretical insights that could enhance summarization systems and contribute to reference-independent metrics for evaluating AI-generated summaries.  
- The findings deepen understanding of linguistic features in summarization.

Weaknesses:  
- The focus on extreme summarization limits the applicability of the findings to more common summarization tasks involving longer texts.  
- Some correlations between reader preferences and linguistic features are difficult to apply in practice, and the reader preferences study is weak due to a limited sample size.  
- The contribution to linguistics and cognition is not immediately clear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the scope of their analysis to address how findings may extend to longer summaries. Additionally, we suggest elaborating on the claim that extreme summarization amplifies linguistic compression patterns. The authors should clarify their choice of morphological features and consider including metrics such as the number of stop words, content words, and function words. To enhance readability, we advise placing figures and tables on the same page as their corresponding references. Lastly, please provide an appropriate citation for the claim regarding the correlation between human syntactic processing and dependency length stated on line 345.
