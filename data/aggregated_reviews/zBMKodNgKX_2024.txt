Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach, FEDNE, to collaboratively visualize high-dimensional data in a federated learning (FL) environment while preserving data privacy. The authors propose integrating the FEDAVG framework with contrastive neighbor embedding (NE) techniques, utilizing a surrogate loss function and an intra-client data mixing strategy to enhance neighborhood structure preservation in the global embedding space. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FEDNE outperforms several baseline methods in terms of neighborhood data structure preservation and clustering. Additionally, the authors acknowledge potential privacy risks associated with their method and propose to address these concerns by discussing them in detail and suggesting a robust comparison protocol for future work that incorporates various privacy considerations. However, further experiments with Differential Privacy (DP) are requested to thoroughly address these concerns.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. FEDNE introduces a novel integration of FEDAVG with contrastive NE techniques, effectively addressing pairwise data relationships in federated learning without requiring data sharing.
2. The intra-client data mixing strategy enhances local data diversity, improving neighborhood representation and mitigating biases in local kNN graphs.
3. The paper provides thorough evaluations using various datasets and metrics, showcasing superior performance in preserving neighborhood structures and clustering.
4. The authors demonstrate a willingness to engage with reviewer feedback and improve their work by addressing privacy risks and proposing a comparison protocol.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper does not fully address the overall complexity and scalability of FEDNE in larger, real-world settings, particularly with a significantly larger number of clients and complex datasets.
2. The proposed intra-client data mixing may not completely resolve issues of incorrect neighbor connections, especially in highly imbalanced datasets, necessitating more detailed comparisons with alternative methods.
3. The focus is primarily on dimensionality reduction, with validation results limited to vision classification tasks; extending analyses to other domains could enhance the paper's applicability.
4. The paper currently lacks sufficient experimental evidence with Differential Privacy to fully satisfy the reviewers' concerns regarding privacy implications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the scalability of FEDNE in larger systems and provide a more detailed analysis of how it handles complex datasets. Additionally, we suggest conducting further comparisons with alternative methods to strengthen the robustness of the intra-client data mixing strategy. Expanding the validation results to include applications in various domains beyond vision classification would also be beneficial. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors conduct and include experiments with Differential Privacy to comprehensively address the privacy risks associated with their method, as well as addressing privacy concerns more explicitly, including theoretical arguments and experiments demonstrating privacy management, to enhance the paper's credibility.
