Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SpatialPIN, a framework aimed at enhancing the spatial reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by integrating 3D priors from multiple foundation models in a zero-shot, training-free manner. The authors argue that existing spatial reasoning-enhanced VLMs may not generalize well to complex 3D-aware tasks. SpatialPIN seeks to address this limitation through explicit 3D scene understanding and is evaluated on various spatial reasoning tasks, including spatial Visual Question Answering (VQA) and robotics applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The integration of VLMs with 3D foundation models for spatial reasoning is novel and addresses limitations of current methods reliant on spatial VQA datasets.  
2. The method is plug-and-play, enhancing VLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities without additional training.  
3. Comprehensive experiments validate the approach across spatial VQA and robotic tasks.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The writing in the methodology section is unclear, particularly in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, which mix method descriptions with prompts and corner cases.  
2. The motivation for the paper is ambiguous, as prior work exists in the field of high-level 3D-aware tasks.  
3. The reliance on multiple 3D foundation models may introduce complexities that are not fully addressed regarding scalability and robustness.  
4. The use of proprietary VLMs complicates the analysis of the proposed pipeline's effectiveness.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology section to enhance reader understanding. Additionally, refining the motivation behind SpatialPIN to clearly distinguish it from existing research would strengthen the paper. The authors should also articulate the unique contributions of operating without fine-tuning, as this aspect may not be particularly innovative. Furthermore, addressing the complexities introduced by the reliance on multiple 3D foundation models and providing insights into the performance sensitivity to 3D reconstruction quality would be beneficial. Lastly, improving the overall writing quality, including the presentation of figures and main contributions, is advised.
