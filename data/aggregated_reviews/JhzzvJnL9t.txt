### Key Points
This paper presents a context-aware OOD intent detection framework, Caro, designed for multi-turn dialogue contexts. It addresses two main challenges: learning robust representations while alleviating long-distance obstacles and effectively utilizing unlabeled data. Caro employs a multi-view information bottleneck loss and a two-stage self-training scheme to mine OOD samples from unlabeled data. The authors demonstrate that Caro outperforms existing models on variants of the STAR dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Caro introduces a novel approach to OOD intent detection, effectively addressing a challenging problem in multi-turn dialogues.
- The framework utilizes a multi-view approach to enhance intent detection by optimizing an unsupervised multi-view loss.
- Extensive experiments show significant improvements in performance, particularly a notable increase in the F1-OOD score compared to previous methods.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical analysis of the information bottleneck principle's applicability to OOD intent detection is lacking, particularly regarding its suitability for longer dialogue turns.
- The evaluation is limited to a single dataset (STAR), raising questions about the generalizability of the results across different datasets.
- The paper does not provide sufficient details on the number of IND/OOD data points or the methodology behind generating pseudo OOD samples.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis of the information bottleneck principle in the context of OOD intent detection, especially its effectiveness for longer dialogues. Additionally, we suggest that the authors validate their method on other datasets to demonstrate its universality. It would also be beneficial to include statistics on the IND/OOD data and clarify the process of generating pseudo OOD samples, possibly by exploring various ratios of IND and OOD data to assess robustness.
