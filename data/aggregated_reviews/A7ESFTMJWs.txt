Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents new methods for approximating the entropy of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and cross-entropy between mixtures of Gaussians. The authors propose deterministic approximations using power series and orthogonal polynomial expansions, achieving results comparable to MCMC methods with significantly reduced computation time. They demonstrate that another deterministic approach, the Huber method, diverges under certain conditions. The results are applied to Nonparametric Variational Inference, showing improved convergence behavior compared to the Huber approximation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written, with clearly presented experiments and solid theoretical claims that provide valuable insights into approximating entropy of GMMs.  
- The convergence criteria effectively highlight the limitations of the Huber method, supported by empirical evidence.  
- The methods of Taylor approximation and Legendre polynomials perform well in practice, outperforming the Huber method in some scenarios.  

Weaknesses:  
- A presentation of Nonparametric Variational Inference (NPV) from the start would enhance motivation.  
- The absence of convergence rates or error estimates is a significant oversight, despite being challenging to investigate.  
- The computational complexity of the proposed methods is not clearly stated, and the experiments are primarily synthetic, lacking real-world applications.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for NPV by presenting it earlier in the paper. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion on convergence rates or error estimates, as this is crucial for understanding the method's performance. Clarifying the computational complexity of all methods involved would also be beneficial. Finally, we encourage the authors to demonstrate the approximation's benefits in real-life problems to strengthen their contributions.
