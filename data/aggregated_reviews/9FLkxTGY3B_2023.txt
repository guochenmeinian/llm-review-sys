Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new dataset, EFO-k, aimed at enhancing complex query answering (CQA) over knowledge graphs. EFO-k incorporates k existentially quantified variables and expands upon existing benchmarks by including 741 query types, which introduce queries with multiple answer nodes. The authors propose a comprehensive framework for query generation, answer sampling, model training, and evaluation, addressing the limitations of previous datasets that primarily focused on single-answer queries. While the authors acknowledge the importance of inductive reasoning and numeric literals, they maintain that their framework is versatile enough to accommodate more complex queries. They argue that the traditional transductive task remains relevant and foundational for advanced settings, despite the emergence of new research topics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed dataset significantly increases the variety of query patterns available for evaluation, adding to the standard suite of 14 patterns in the literature.  
- The authors provide a detailed methodology for dataset generation and evaluation metrics, contributing to a systematic approach in assessing CQA models.  
- The framework is formally defined and grounded in first-order logic, enhancing its theoretical robustness.  
- Significant modifications have been made to the paper, including new discussions and analyses that clarify the dataset's utility.

Weaknesses:  
- The focus on transductive, conjunctive, entity-centric queries on triple-based graphs is seen as outdated, raising questions about the value of evaluating models on 700+ patterns when fewer could suffice.  
- Limitations on query patterns appear artificial and may hinder the dataset's ability to challenge existing systems effectively.  
- The paper lacks a discussion on real-world applications and practical motivations for the proposed queries, relying solely on synthetic constructions.  
- Concerns exist regarding the relevance of evaluating over 700 query patterns when performance is reported as an average, and the limitations on query patterns may undermine the dataset's challenge and applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the dataset's limitations, particularly regarding the outdated focus on entity-centric queries and the artificial constraints on query patterns. Additionally, including a section on real-world applications and practical motivations for the dataset would enhance its relevance. We suggest that the authors clarify the rationale behind the choice of metrics and the performance of different query types to benefit the paper's coherence. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to improve the clarity of the captions in Tables 1 and 2 to explicitly state that they report query performance on queries with one and two free variables, respectively. Lastly, addressing the notation issue in Section 2.1 and providing clearer explanations for complex concepts would improve clarity and understanding.
