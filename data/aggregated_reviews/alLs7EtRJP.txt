Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents two significant contributions: FactorCL, a novel method for learning multimodal representations that captures both shared and unique task-relevant information, and a method for estimating Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) using Conditional InfoNCE and Conditional InfoNCE-CLUB, which provide lower and upper bounds for CMI, respectively. The authors propose a new contrastive learning objective and augmentation strategy based on an information-theoretic perspective, addressing the limitations of traditional methods that focus solely on shared information. They clarify implementation details, including the sampling of positive and negative pairs and the structure of their critic function, while discussing the challenges of conditional sampling and the trade-offs involved in approximating CMI estimation. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FactorCL outperforms existing contrastive learning approaches in multimodal settings, and the empirical results show that their CMI estimators yield valid bounds and perform competitively against existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The work is timely and addresses the important question of applying contrastive learning methods to multimodal scenarios.
2. The paper is clearly written and easy to follow.
3. The proposed method generalizes traditional contrastive learning approaches, effectively extending their applicability.
4. Section 2 offers an intuitive information-theoretic analysis of multimodal contrastive learning, with Figure 2 providing a clear overview of the bounds involved.
5. The authors provide a clear framework for estimating CMI, supported by empirical results that show competitive performance.
6. The implementation details are well-articulated, particularly regarding the sampling strategies and critic function design.
7. The paper acknowledges the limitations of exact CMI estimation while proposing scalable methods for representation learning.
8. Experimental results indicate significant improvements with FactorCL over existing methods.

Weaknesses:
1. There is a question regarding whether unique task-relevant information should be included in the shared task-relevant partition, as standard methods optimize for shared information.
2. The reasons for the failure of standard contrastive learning methods remain unclear; it is uncertain if this is solely due to sub-optimal augmentation.
3. The performance gains observed in Table 2 may largely stem from improved augmentation, raising questions about the contributions of the proposed method.
4. The relationship between low shared information and high unique information needs clarification, as it may not require separate definitions.
5. The validity of the CMI estimation remains uncertain, which may undermine the theoretical foundation of the work.
6. The reliance on approximations and the complexity of conditional sampling could affect the robustness of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the unique augmentation strategy, possibly by designing a method that automatically selects appropriate data augmentations based on task-relevant information. Additionally, we suggest providing more detailed discussions on the performance discrepancies observed in FactorCL-SSL and FactorCL-SUP, particularly in relation to the results shown in Table 2. It would also be beneficial to include a section addressing the limitations of the proposed method, elaborating on scenarios where substantial improvements may not be achieved. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their sampling strategy, particularly in how batches are constructed around single outcomes of the conditioning variable. Addressing the concerns regarding the relevance of Sordoni's boosted critic for CMI estimation would strengthen the theoretical justification of their approach. Finally, we suggest that the authors explore the impact of increasing the number of augmentations on performance more thoroughly, as this could enhance the empirical results presented in the paper.
