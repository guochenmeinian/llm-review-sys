Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents FedICON, a federated learning (FL) approach that addresses the test-time shift problem by leveraging inter-client heterogeneity through contrastive learning. The authors propose a method that extracts invariant class-conditional information during training and adapts the feature extractor during testing. They provide a comprehensive examination of inter-client heterogeneity's role in mitigating intra-client heterogeneity, demonstrating through extensive experiments that inter-client heterogeneity enhances clients' abilities to manage test-time shifts, particularly in IID and non-IID data settings. The authors also discuss the impact of data augmentation on performance, indicating that while it contributes to improvements, it is not the sole factor.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper tackles a valuable research problem related to feature-level test-time shifts in FL, providing insights into inter- and intra-client heterogeneity.
2. FedICON introduces an innovative method that combines supervised and unsupervised contrastive learning to enhance the robustness of local models.
3. The authors effectively clarify the distinctions between test-time shifts and intra-client heterogeneity, as well as label-level and feature-level shifts.
4. Experimental results support the claim that inter-client heterogeneity can improve performance in handling test-time shifts.
5. The authors conduct extensive experiments, validating the proposed method's effectiveness across multiple scenarios and demonstrating a commitment to addressing reviewer feedback.

Weaknesses:
1. The concepts of test-time shift and intra-client heterogeneity are not clearly differentiated in some parts of the text, leading to potential confusion.
2. The rationale for using contrastive learning over other objectives is insufficiently explained, leaving the design motivation unclear.
3. The paper lacks a thorough discussion of the underlying reasons for the positive impact of inter-client heterogeneity on test-time shifts.
4. Important baselines for comparison are missing, particularly those that combine domain generalization methods with test-time adaptation.
5. The experimental results for FedICON under both IID and non-IID partitions were initially omitted, raising concerns about the method's effectiveness in different data settings.
6. The lack of an independent ablation study specifically isolating the effects of data augmentation may leave some questions unanswered.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the distinctions between test-time shift and intra-client heterogeneity in the main text. Additionally, a more detailed justification for the choice of contrastive learning over other methods should be included. We suggest that the authors provide a deeper discussion on the implications of inter-client heterogeneity and its role in the proposed method. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include comprehensive comparisons with relevant baselines that incorporate domain generalization and test-time adaptation techniques to validate the novelty and effectiveness of FedICON. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their experimental results by including the omitted data for FedICON under both IID and non-IID partitions in a bar chart format. Lastly, we encourage the authors to conduct an independent ablation study to explicitly assess the contribution of the data augmentation module to the overall performance, thereby providing a clearer understanding of its impact.
