Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a physics-informed unrolled deep learning framework for off-resonance correction in MRI, addressing the challenges posed by off-resonance effects that degrade image quality, particularly in non-Cartesian trajectories. The authors propose a multi-frequency forward model trained on synthetic data, demonstrating its effectiveness through empirical evaluations on both phantom and in-vivo data. The framework aims to improve image quality and reduce acquisition times, potentially benefiting clinical practices.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Excellent presentation with supportive figures.
- The use of physically understandable models with synthetic data leads to high image quality and potentially shorter acquisition times, minimizing motion artifacts.
- The approach shows promise for significant clinical impact and generalizability to various non-Cartesian sampling patterns.

Weaknesses:
- The writing lacks clarity, with inconsistent notation leading to confusion about signal representation.
- The distinction between non-uniform and standard fast Fourier transforms is inadequately explained, requiring further justification for the chosen method.
- Experimental results are primarily visual, lacking comprehensive numerical evaluations across the entire dataset and clinical studies to assess robustness and efficacy.
- The uniqueness of the proposed solutions is not sufficiently discussed, raising concerns about the potential for generative hallucinations in critical medical imaging contexts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing and ensure consistent notation throughout the manuscript. Additionally, we suggest providing comprehensive numerical results demonstrating the model's performance across the entire dataset and conducting a full clinical study to validate the approach's robustness and impact on patient care. To address concerns about the uniqueness of the reconstructions, consider employing adversarial training to quantify variations and enhance the model's robustness against hallucinations.
