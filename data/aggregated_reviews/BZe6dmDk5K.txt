Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel application of Action Quality Assessment (AQA) to evaluate the quality of AI-generated videos, introducing a comprehensive dataset (GAIA) comprising 9,180 videos from 18 text-to-video (T2V) models, rated on three dimensions: subject quality, action completeness, and action-scene interaction. The authors argue that existing AQA methods, primarily trained on real-world datasets, inadequately address the unique characteristics of AI-generated content, thus highlighting the need for specialized assessment tools.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of GAIA fills a critical gap in evaluating AI-generated videos.
- The dataset is large and well-curated, supported by a robust human annotation process.
- The use of a causal reasoning framework for action quality assessment is innovative.
- The paper provides a thorough evaluation of existing AQA and VQA methods, revealing their limitations in the context of AI-generated videos.

Weaknesses:
- The writing quality requires improvement, particularly in clarity and focus, with several typos and grammatical errors noted.
- The paper lacks a discussion on the impact of prompts on video quality and the interchangeability of completeness and interaction scores.
- The motivation for the decomposition of action quality is insufficiently articulated, and the correlation among the three perspectives raises questions about their distinctiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and focus of the writing, particularly in the opening paragraph and throughout the paper, addressing identified typos and grammatical errors. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion on the impact of prompts on video quality and investigating the similarity between completeness and interaction scores to determine their necessity. The authors should clarify the motivation behind the action quality decomposition and explore the potential for combining existing metrics to create more holistic assessment methods. Lastly, we encourage the inclusion of a more comprehensive related works section to contextualize the study within existing literature.
