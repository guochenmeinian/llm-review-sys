Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new contrastive learning scheme called tri-contrastive learning (triCL), which incorporates a learnable diagonal matrix to capture feature importance. The authors claim that this method enhances interpretability and identifiability of learned features while maintaining comparable performance in downstream tasks. Theoretical analyses and experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets are provided to support these claims.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The idea is simple and addresses the important problem of identifiability in contrastive learning.
- The proposed method is elegant and does not introduce significant computational overhead.
- The ability to discover feature importance can enhance inference efficiency by allowing the exclusion of less important features.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the method is questionable, as it resembles existing approaches, particularly in its reliance on pair-wise contrastive learning.
- The experimental results show only marginal improvements on benchmark datasets, raising concerns about the method's effectiveness.
- The generalization bound is unclear, particularly regarding the dependence on data augmentation and its impact on the term \(\alpha\).
- The visualization in Figure 1 lacks clarity, making it difficult to understand the relationship between feature space and image space.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the visualization in Figure 1 to better illustrate the connection between feature space and image space. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis comparing their method with existing approaches, particularly regarding generalization capabilities. An ablation study is needed to verify the importance of the \(L_{dec}\) term in the triCL objective. Furthermore, we suggest expanding the experimental evaluation to include larger datasets like ImageNet to strengthen the empirical findings. Finally, a discussion on the limitations of the proposed method should be added to clarify its scope of application.
