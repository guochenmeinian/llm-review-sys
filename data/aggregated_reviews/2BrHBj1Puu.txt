Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for draping multi-layered garments on SMPL-based human bodies, utilizing a sewing pattern-inspired approach to map 2D garment panels to 3D surfaces. The authors deform single-layer garments using the SMPL skinning function and correct interpenetrations between garment layers. They propose a formulation that employs a combination of 2D signed distance fields (SDF) and a 2D-to-3D mapping function, enabling straightforward draping of multiple garments in arbitrary poses. The method is fully end-to-end differentiable and demonstrates effectiveness and efficiency through qualitative results and potential applications, including garment reconstruction and editing.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- An efficient method that maps 2D sewing patterns to 3D garments with good performance.
- The proposed method effectively overcomes the limitations of ULNeF by allowing for arbitrary poses and minimizing interpenetration through a physics-based loss approach.
- Qualitative results show reduced interpenetration in multi-layered garments.
- The use of 2D SDF and a 2D-to-3D mapping function is a novel contribution that enhances the representation of garments.
- The differentiable nature of the method allows application to inverse problems and facilitates efficient training for both single-layer and multi-layer cases.

Weaknesses:
1. The experiments lack quantitative results to support effectiveness, such as interpenetration rates between garments and the human body, and how these rates vary with garment types and layer counts.
2. Efficiency comparisons during testing, such as reconstruction and forward model times, are not provided.
3. The dataset's human parameter distribution is unclear, including the number of sampled bodies and gender distribution.
4. Overlap between training and test sets is not addressed, nor is the inclusion of unseen garments.
5. Comparisons in T-pose with previous methods, including ULNeF, are needed to substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
6. Clarity in writing and descriptions can be improved.
7. The tone of certain sentences requires adjustment for consistency.
8. The layering network appears as a post-processing step, which may undermine the contribution to multi-layered garment draping.
9. The need for a formal comparison with ULNeF has been questioned, as the authors believe it is unnecessary given their method's advantages.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including quantitative results regarding interpenetration rates and the dataset's characteristics. Additionally, provide comparisons of reconstruction and forward model times during testing. Clarifying the distribution of human parameters in the dataset and addressing potential overlaps between training and test sets is essential. We also suggest including T-pose comparisons with previous methods, including ULNeF, to validate the proposed approach's effectiveness. Enhancing the clarity of writing and adjusting the tone of specific sentences will strengthen the presentation. Lastly, consider re-evaluating the layering network's role to emphasize its contribution rather than presenting it as a mere post-processing step, and clarify the necessity of comparing your method with ULNeF to address reviewer concerns.
