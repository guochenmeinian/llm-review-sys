### Key Points
This paper presents a method called MULTIVERSE to investigate alignment vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors propose a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) that defines various contexts, termed "worlds," enabling systematic generation of diverse conversational settings. By embedding malicious questions within these worlds, the paper illustrates how LLMs can be misled into bypassing safety mechanisms, exposing latent alignment issues. The authors conduct large-scale experiments, revealing that LLMs are particularly susceptible in contexts distant from real-world scenarios, especially in nested and programming-related worlds. The paper asserts that current LLM alignment training is inadequate for addressing virtual contexts, raising significant security concerns.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- **Innovative Approach:** The introduction of a structured format (DSL) to automate the generation of jailbreaking prompts offers a novel perspective on LLM vulnerabilities.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The extensive experiments conducted on both open-source and closed-source LLMs provide strong empirical support for the MULTIVERSE method.
- **Scalable Methodology:** The approach is cost-effective and scalable, allowing for the generation of a large number of worlds to identify LLM vulnerabilities.

Weaknesses:
- **Limited Focus on Defense Mechanisms:** The paper highlights significant vulnerabilities but lacks an in-depth exploration of how to mitigate these issues or propose robust defense mechanisms.
- **Clarification Needed on Cost-Effectiveness:** The claim of cost-effectiveness requires further elaboration, particularly regarding the costs associated with the DSL and its comparison to automatic LLM-based jailbreaking methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- We recommend that the authors add a discussion section addressing the defense approach to the jailbreak method.
- We suggest splitting the appendix into various sections for clarity rather than merging them into one.
- We encourage the authors to improve the writing quality, particularly addressing typos and inconsistencies in quotation marks, such as the mixture of " and ' in Line 239.
- We recommend clarifying the use of non-English languages in nested worlds, as mentioned around Line 177.
- We suggest the authors clarify whether the models mentioned (e.g., ChatGLM, Gemini) are actual models used or illustrative examples, as indicated around Line 170.
- We recommend fixing the broken link to jailbreakchat.com noted in the reviews.
