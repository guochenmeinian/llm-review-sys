Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SpreadsheetBench, a benchmark dataset comprising 912 instructions and 2,729 test cases designed to evaluate LLMs' effectiveness in spreadsheet manipulation. The dataset includes real-world questions from online Excel forums and covers various manipulation categories, highlighting the challenges LLMs face with complex spreadsheet tasks. The authors demonstrate that existing LLMs are inadequate for these tasks and suggest that multi-round prompting could enhance performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The benchmark significantly improves upon prior work by utilizing real-world instructions and diverse spreadsheet formats.
- The dataset construction is thorough, and the experimental section effectively illustrates the limitations of current LLMs in spreadsheet manipulation.
- The paper is well-written and presents a novel benchmark that is more challenging than existing ones.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity on whether the dataset is software-agnostic, as it appears to be tested primarily on Excel.
- Insufficient detail is provided regarding the role of human annotators and the interface used for LLM interaction with spreadsheets.
- Limitations and societal impacts of the work are not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by explicitly stating whether the dataset is software-agnostic or Excel-specific. Additionally, expanding the experimental section to include more details on how LLMs interface with the benchmark and their handling of spreadsheet-specific features would be beneficial. The authors should also provide more information about the annotators, including their number and preparation. Furthermore, addressing the limitations and societal impacts of the work in the main text, rather than solely in the appendix, would enhance reader understanding. Lastly, including examples of LLM outputs and clarifying how LLMs interact with spreadsheets through a code interface would improve the paper's comprehensibility.
