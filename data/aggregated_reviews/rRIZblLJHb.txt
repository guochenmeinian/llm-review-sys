### Key Points
This paper presents a simple HDC hardware-algorithm co-design based on analog IMC for on-chip computing. The authors propose an application mapped onto a SoC from TetraMem, demonstrating a novel use of intrinsic noise from memristor programming to generate random bases. However, the authors' claim that there have been no previous analog/memristive demonstrations of HDC is disputed. The paper lacks clarity in explaining how on-chip peripheral circuits mitigate noise impacts on classification accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The analog implementation of HDC applications is a promising direction, with practical benefits for hardware implementation.
- The mapping of a simple HDC problem onto a SoC and maintaining relatively high task performance is commendable.
- The novel principle of using intrinsic noise from memristor programming is a significant contribution.

Weaknesses:
- The writing and structure of the paper require significant improvement, making it difficult to follow design decisions.
- The proposed system's capability appears limited, suitable only for tasks with a small number of symbols and low HDC dimensionality.
- There is little novelty in the proposed algorithms, as N-gram based encoding has been extensively studied in HDC contexts.
- The use of a perceptron instead of traditional HDC retraining steps lacks clarity, particularly regarding the necessity of pretraining.
- The paper does not include comparisons to other designs in the hardware-algorithm co-design field.
- The evaluation section fails to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed design, and the accuracy degradation is significant.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the writing and structure of the paper to enhance clarity and coherence. The authors should provide more motivation for the choice of analog versus digital design and clarify the limitations of the proposed system regarding its applicability to more challenging tasks. We suggest that the authors elaborate on the novelty of their algorithms and the rationale behind using a perceptron, including the necessity of pretraining. Additionally, including comparisons to other designs in the field would strengthen the paper. Finally, we recommend that the authors enhance the evaluation section to clearly demonstrate the efficiency and benefits of their design, addressing the significant accuracy degradation observed.
