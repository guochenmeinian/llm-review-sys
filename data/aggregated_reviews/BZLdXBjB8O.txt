Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CausalDiff, an adversarial defense method that integrates a causal model of robustness with a diffusion model to learn label-relevant causative representations. The authors demonstrate CausalDiff's effectiveness against unseen attacks, outperforming existing adversarial defense baselines across several image classification datasets. The approach emphasizes disentanglement of target-causative and target-non-causative factors using a causal information bottleneck.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel framework that effectively extracts essential features from images through a well-motivated causal diffusion model.
- The pilot study is clear and convincingly demonstrates the proposed method's effectiveness.
- Comprehensive comparisons with baseline adversarial defense methods, particularly those utilizing diffusion models, enhance the credibility of the results.

Weaknesses:
- There is limited discussion on related works, particularly how CausalDiff differs from CausalAdv and DICE in terms of causal modeling.
- The writing lacks clarity, especially in articulating the challenges solved by the proposed method rather than merely describing its implementation.
- The empirical results are convincing, but the extraction process of desired features (i.e., S, Z) remains unclear.
- The paper does not adequately address adaptive attacks, which diminishes its contribution.
- The computational cost and training time associated with diffusion models are not sufficiently discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on related works, specifically addressing how CausalDiff differentiates itself from CausalAdv and DICE. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the clarity of the writing, particularly in the challenges section, by focusing on the problems solved by the method. Further elaboration on the extraction of features S and Z is necessary. To strengthen the contribution, we advise including evaluations against adaptive attacks and a detailed analysis of computational costs and training time. Finally, we encourage the authors to conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of individual components and to compare their method with a broader range of baselines in adversarial defense.
