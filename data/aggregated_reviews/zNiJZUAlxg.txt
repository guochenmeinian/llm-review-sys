Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework, ResAD, for class-generalizable anomaly detection that leverages residual feature learning and a hypersphere constraint. The authors propose a method that learns the distribution of residual features to minimize variations, enabling effective anomaly detection even in new classes without retraining. Experimental results on multiple datasets, including VisA, MVTec3D, BraTS, and ShanghaiTech, demonstrate ResAD's superior performance compared to existing methods like InCTRL and WinCLIP, particularly in pixel-level anomaly localization. The authors emphasize the importance of evaluating methods on various datasets to validate their generalization capabilities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper provides an original and clear approach to class-generalizable anomaly detection, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
2. The use of residual feature learning to enhance generalizability is both novel and effective.
3. ResAD shows superior performance across various datasets, including medical and video data, highlighting its cross-domain generalization ability.
4. The paper's logic is clear, and the discussion is thorough, indicating a strong grasp of experimental design.
5. The authors' responses to reviewer concerns are satisfactory, and they plan to include additional discussions and code release in the revised paper.

Weaknesses:
1. The proposed residual learning approach is similar to existing methods, particularly InCTRL, which raises questions about its novelty.
2. The experiments primarily focus on industrial datasets, limiting the exploration of the method's applicability to other domains like medical imaging.
3. Some reviewers express concerns about the sensitivity of ResAD to specific datasets, particularly regarding the BrainMRI and HeadCT datasets.
4. The selection of few-shot reference samples may not adequately represent class attributes, potentially impacting performance.
5. There are unresolved questions about the necessity of both the OCC and NF components in the method, which could benefit from further validation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their approach by clearly distinguishing how ResAD differs from InCTRL and other existing methods. Additionally, we suggest expanding the experimental evaluation to include datasets from diverse domains to better demonstrate the generalization capabilities of ResAD. It would be beneficial to conduct multiple independent runs with different random seeds to ensure robustness in the results. We also recommend that the authors improve the validation of ResAD's performance on the BrainMRI and HeadCT datasets to address concerns about dataset sensitivity. Furthermore, we suggest including an ablation study that isolates the effects of the OCC and NF components to clarify their necessity and interactions. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide a more detailed discussion on the limitations of their method, particularly regarding the representativeness of few-shot normal samples and its implications for performance, as well as discussions on sample selection strategies to enhance the paper's contribution to community research.
