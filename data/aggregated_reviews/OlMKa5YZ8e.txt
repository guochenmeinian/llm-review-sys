Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents KD-Zero, an innovative framework that employs evolutionary search to automatically identify optimal distillation strategies for various teacher-student pairs. The authors propose a comprehensive search space that includes transformation operations, distance functions, and loss calibration techniques. The effectiveness of KD-Zero is demonstrated through extensive experiments across multiple datasets and tasks, showing superior performance compared to existing knowledge distillation (KD) methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The introduction of an auto-search framework for distillation is a significant contribution to the field.  
- The paper includes thorough experimental evaluations across diverse tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art results.  
- The presentation is clear and well-organized, enhancing the overall readability of the work.  

Weaknesses:  
- Some experimental results, particularly in Table 4, raise questions about the performance of transformer-based students compared to their teacher models, suggesting potential issues with the training process.  
- The limited ablation studies do not adequately clarify the contributions of the sharpness-gap and CKA-gap criteria, with results indicating their minimal impact.  
- The novelty of the approach is questioned, as it appears to closely resemble existing KD methods, and the efficiency of the search process remains unaddressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental results, particularly regarding the performance discrepancies noted in Table 4. Additionally, we suggest conducting more comprehensive ablation studies to better understand the contributions of the sharpness-gap and CKA-gap criteria. To enhance the novelty of the work, consider exploring a broader range of architectures and including comparisons with state-of-the-art detection-based KD methods. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide an efficiency analysis of the KD-Zero framework compared to traditional KD methods to address concerns about its practicality.
