### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for estimating the covariance matrix of financial assets, addressing the challenges posed by high dimensionality. The authors propose leveraging semantic similarity from textual descriptions or knowledge graphs as a shrinkage target, rather than a direct estimator, thereby combining semantic information with recent price history. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through experiments using historical S&P 500 data, showing improvements over traditional covariance shrinkage methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces an innovative methodology for covariance matrix estimation that incorporates semantic similarity, enhancing portfolio optimization.
- Experimental results indicate that the proposed semantic methods, such as DistilBERT and W5m KD, improve covariance matrix estimation.
- The approach effectively highlights the limitations of using semantic similarity directly as a covariance estimator.

Weaknesses:  
- The exposition and clarity of the paper require improvement, particularly in sections detailing the derivation of shrinkage factor estimators.
- The experimental evaluation relies heavily on historical S&P 500 data, lacking broader validation across other stock indexes or regions.
- The paper does not adequately address the dynamic components of semantic information, such as recent news data, which could enhance the methodology.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and exposition of the paper, particularly in the derivation of shrinkage factor estimators, by providing more detailed explanations and examples. Additionally, the authors should consider expanding their experimental evaluation to include other stock indexes and regions to validate their approach further. Incorporating dynamic components, such as recent news data, into the semantic similarity targets would also strengthen the methodology. Furthermore, a detailed hyperparameter analysis should be included, and the authors should clarify the reasons for any redacted information in the paper.
