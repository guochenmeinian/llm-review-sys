Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Mobile-Agent-v2, a multi-agent architecture designed for mobile device operation, comprising a planning agent, decision agent, reflection agent, and a memory unit. The framework aims to enhance task completion rates and operational efficiency by addressing navigation challenges inherent in single-agent systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mobile-Agent-v2 achieves over a 30% improvement in task completion compared to single-agent architectures, showcasing its effectiveness across various operating systems and applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a multi-agent system is a novel approach that effectively distributes workload, likely contributing to improved performance.
- Comprehensive experimental evaluations provide robust evidence of the system's effectiveness.
- The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with promising experimental results on real-world mobile applications.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks sufficient baseline comparisons with more powerful frameworks like AppAgent and CogAgent, making it difficult to evaluate overall effectiveness.
- The evaluation benchmark is relatively small and lacks clarity on how evaluations are conducted, raising questions about the reliability of success judgments.
- There is limited discussion on the scalability of the system and potential computational overhead introduced by coordinating multiple agents.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with stronger baselines such as AppAgent and CogAgent to better contextualize the performance of Mobile-Agent-v2. Additionally, the authors should provide a clearer description of how the decision agent retrieves information from the memory unit and include details on the content and format of memory storage. It would also be beneficial to conduct ablation studies to explore the impact of sequence length and type on task completion accuracy. Furthermore, addressing the potential overhead of multi-agent coordination and discussing the implications of relying on commercial models like GPT-4V, including time and token costs, would enhance the paper's depth. Lastly, clarifying how the framework handles ambiguous tasks and error resolution would significantly improve user experience insights.
