Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a neural implicit representation for efficiently computing geodesic distances and paths on 3D surfaces. The authors propose a framework that overfits a neural network to a specific mesh, enabling the estimation of geodesic lengths and paths between query points. The network architecture includes branches for predicting geodesic distances, paths, and a signed distance function (SDF) for surface reconstruction. The approach is trained using strong supervision based on pre-computed geodesics from mesh vertices, demonstrating high accuracy on well-known graphics models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses an important problem in graphics, providing a clear and intuitive description of the method.  
- The proposed solution is original, well-structured, and significantly faster than traditional methods, achieving competitive accuracy in geodesic distance and path estimation.

Weaknesses:  
- The technical contribution is limited, primarily relying on overfitting, which may not generalize well to unseen shapes.  
- The method's reliance on a shared MLP for feature extraction from arbitrary points raises concerns about its applicability, as it does not guarantee that predicted paths lie on the surface.  
- The diversity of mesh shapes used in experiments is insufficient, lacking realistic scenarios, and the training time for each mesh is not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the diversity of mesh shapes in their experiments to include realistic scenarios. Additionally, the authors should provide detailed information regarding the training time required for their method, including preprocessing time. We suggest exploring alternative approaches for path prediction that ensure points remain on the surface, such as using a transformer model. Furthermore, conducting ablation studies on input point embeddings and learning objectives could enhance the robustness of the findings. Lastly, clarifying the role of the SDF and its contribution to the overall method would strengthen the paper's technical depth.
