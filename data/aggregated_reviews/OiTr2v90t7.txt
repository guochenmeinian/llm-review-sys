### Key Points
This paper presents the adaptation of the combinatorial concept of the “Pemutree” into a machine learning context, linking it with Bayesian nonparametrics and demonstrating its relevance to data-driven approaches. The authors propose a theoretical framework and apply it to phylogenetic analysis, showcasing how permutrees can model complex data involving coalescence and recombination.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper ambitiously connects recent combinatorial research with machine learning, aiming for a unifying theory of discrete Bayesian nonparametrics.  
- The review of discrete Bayesian nonparametrics is thorough, and the theoretical aspects are explained clearly with effective figures and notation.  
- Sections 1-4 are concise and articulate complex concepts well, with practical applications highlighted.

Weaknesses:  
- The developments in theory and applications do not fully realize the grand vision, particularly in representing the Dirichlet Process within the permutree framework.  
- The presentation of experimental results is overly brief, with significant material relegated to the appendix, leading to a lack of rigor in the analysis.  
- Some figures are poorly designed, and certain language choices are awkward, which detracts from clarity. The writing is also verbose, making it challenging to follow without extensive reading.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the representation of the Dirichlet Process within the permutree framework to align with their claims of generality. The authors should expand the presentation of experimental results beyond the half-page “Demonstration” section to enhance clarity and rigor. We suggest redesigning figures for better readability, particularly making Figure 1 larger, and revising confusing greenscale representations in Figures 8 and 14. Additionally, we encourage the authors to clarify the notation used, especially where established meanings exist in machine learning. The authors should also address the disconnect between the theoretical framework and the practical applications, particularly in Section 5, by providing a more detailed explanation of the likelihood function and the inference tasks involved.
