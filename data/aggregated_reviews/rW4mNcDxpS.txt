Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to adapt robot motion policies by leveraging Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and formulating policy optimization as an optimal transport problem. The authors propose using the L2-Wasserstein distance between GMMs to constrain policy updates, enhancing optimization stability. They also aim to enhance the understanding of natural gradients (NG) in the context of policy optimization, addressing limitations of existing methods like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The authors utilize Bures-Wasserstein manifold geometry for optimizing GMM parameters through Riemannian optimization and empirically validate their method across various robotic tasks, demonstrating superior performance in task success rates and low-variance solutions compared to traditional policy optimization baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- **Novel Approach**: The paper introduces a unique perspective on adapting robot motion policies, potentially improving adaptability and performance.
- **Utilization of GMMs**: By focusing on GMMs, the method provides a tailored solution for effective policy optimization.
- **Consideration of Stability**: The use of L2-Wasserstein distance as a constraint enhances optimization stability, addressing a common challenge in policy optimization.
- **Riemannian Optimization**: The application of Bures-Wasserstein geometry showcases a sophisticated mathematical framework for refining policy parameters.
- **Experimental Evaluation**: The method is thoroughly evaluated in various robotic scenarios, reinforcing its credibility and practical relevance.
- **Versatility**: The authors demonstrate the method's applicability across multiple robotic tasks, showcasing its versatility.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks a discussion of existing GMM-based methods, such as PMOE, which would enhance its comprehensiveness. 
- The experimental tasks are relatively simple, lacking generalization to higher-dimensional tasks with multimodal solutions.
- There is insufficient qualitative analysis comparing policy distributions between the proposed approach and baselines, limiting insights into performance differences.
- The omission of natural gradient methods in reinforcement learning (RL) and their relation to the proposed method diminishes the paper's contribution.
- The use of PPO as a baseline is questioned due to its reliance on objective clipping rather than KL regularization, which may not provide a fair comparison.
- The paper lacks clarity on the training of richer policies and the initialization of GMR policies from random states.
- The GMM baselines do not align with the proposed methodology, raising concerns about the validity of comparisons.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of existing GMM-based methods, particularly including comparisons with PMOE to enhance the paper's comprehensiveness. Additionally, conducting experiments on higher-dimensional tasks would demonstrate the proposed approach's generalizability. We suggest including a qualitative analysis of policy distributions to provide deeper insights into the performance advantages of the proposed method. Furthermore, we recommend clarifying the relationship between their method and existing NG-based approaches, potentially by developing new algorithms for comparison. The authors should explicitly discuss the differences in hyperparameter tuning for the alternative updates in the appendix and clarify the initialization process for GMR policies. Ensuring that the GMM baselines are consistent with the proposed methodology would strengthen the validity of their comparisons. Lastly, including a table of PMOE hyperparameters in the appendix would enhance the completeness of the paper.
