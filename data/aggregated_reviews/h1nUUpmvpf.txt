### Key Points
This paper presents a cross-cultural study analyzing human values, morals, and gender biases in folk tales from 27 cultures, utilizing a dataset of 1,925 tales. The authors employ lexicon-based approaches to assess human values and morals, revealing that social values are predominant across cultures, while male characters are significantly overrepresented. The study aims to fill a gap in the literature, as existing research primarily focuses on European tales.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a novel computational approach to analyzing folk tales, contributing valuable insights into human values and biases.
- The dataset is extensive and well-curated, offering a significant resource for future research.
- The findings are engaging and present a comprehensive analysis of the subject matter.

Weaknesses:
- The cultural representation is uneven, with Africa treated as a single culture and limited representation from Latin America and the Middle East.
- The methods lack technical novelty, relying heavily on lexicon-based approaches, which may not fully capture the complexity of the concepts studied.
- There is insufficient discussion on the interrelation of human values, morals, and biases, and a lack of engagement with relevant prior literature.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the cultural representation in the dataset by including tales from underrepresented regions, even if the number of tales is limited. Additionally, consider incorporating contextualized representations of text to enhance the analysis of human values, morals, and gender biases. A qualitative assessment of the lexicon-based approach's effectiveness compared to human evaluations would strengthen the paper. Finally, we suggest expanding the discussion on the relationship between human values, morals, and biases, and engaging more thoroughly with existing literature in this area.
