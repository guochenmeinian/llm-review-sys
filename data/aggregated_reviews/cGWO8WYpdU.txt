### Key Points
This paper presents EdgeThemis, a novel framework designed to ensure the runtime integrity of machine learning models deployed on edge devices. The system incorporates a sentinel backdoor and a verification module, enabling covert challenge-response verification to detect model corruption from both accidental and malicious alterations. EdgeThemis achieves 100% verification accuracy across various models and demonstrates robustness against multiple attack vectors, including replay, theft, and replacement attacks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The innovative design of embedding a sentinel backdoor with a verification module effectively merges covert detection with robust security.
- EdgeThemis provides comprehensive protection against a wide range of attacks, addressing critical vulnerabilities in edge deployments.
- The system demonstrates high accuracy and minimal performance impact, making it practical for real-world applications.
- The paper is well-organized, with extensive experimental setups that enhance the credibility of its findings.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation is limited to a narrow range of edge-friendly models, raising concerns about generalizability to larger or unsupervised models.
- The dependency on the sentinel backdoor may introduce risks if sophisticated attackers detect its patterns.
- The implementation complexity, including the need for significant pre-deployment fine-tuning, may hinder scalability.
- The evaluation does not sufficiently explore the system's robustness against evolving attack vectors or real-world scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors expand the experimental setup to include a broader range of machine learning models, such as transformers and reinforcement learning architectures, to demonstrate EdgeThemis' versatility. Additionally, consider optimizing the hash computation process or providing strategies to mitigate performance impacts for larger models, as the throughput reduction for models like Tiny BERT may hinder adoption in latency-sensitive applications. 

To enhance the adaptive timer's robustness, we suggest introducing adjustments for heterogeneous environments or proposing alternative adaptive techniques. Discussing optimization strategies for the fine-tuning process of the sentinel backdoor, such as incremental fine-tuning or leveraging pre-trained embeddings, would also improve practicality. Finally, including countermeasures against adaptive adversaries, such as dynamic sentinel datasets or randomized triggers, would strengthen the system's defenses.
