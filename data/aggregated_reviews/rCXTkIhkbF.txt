Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Constrained Parameter Regularization (CPR) as a novel regularization technique that dynamically tailors regularization strength based on the L2-norm of individual parameter matrices. The authors frame learning as a constraint optimization problem, which can be seamlessly integrated with gradient-based optimizers. CPR aims to reduce the need for hyperparameter tuning and demonstrates effectiveness across various tasks, outperforming traditional weight decay methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is straightforward to implement and integrates well with existing optimization techniques.
- Empirical results indicate CPR's robustness to hyperparameter selection and its superior performance in multiple tasks.
- The paper is well-written, providing clear explanations and a solid theoretical foundation.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of adaptive regularization is questioned, as the general idea is not particularly new.
- The optimization algorithm lacks rigorous theoretical analysis regarding convergence and initialization.
- Experiments are primarily conducted on smaller datasets like CIFAR100, which may not convincingly demonstrate the method's superiority over traditional approaches.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the statement on L123-124 regarding the suitability of $F(x)$ for gradient-based optimization. Additionally, it would be beneficial to conduct experiments to assess CPR's robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs and noise, possibly using datasets like CIFAR100-C and AdvSQUAD. We also suggest that the authors clarify the runtime overhead, as a 5-6% increase should be explicitly stated in the main text. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide theoretical analysis on convergence and to test CPR on larger datasets such as ImageNet to strengthen their empirical claims.
