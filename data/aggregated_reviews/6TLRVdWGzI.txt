### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to depth estimation in Bayesian neural networks by introducing a discrete truncated normal distribution, which allows for independent learning of the mean and variance of network depth. The authors utilize variational inference to infer posterior distributions, balancing model complexity and accuracy through the minimization of variational free energy. The introduction of this method significantly improves test accuracy and reduces variance in posterior depth estimates, marking a meaningful advancement in the field.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- Innovative Approach: The use of a discrete truncated normal distribution is a unique contribution to the field.  
- Improved Accuracy: The method demonstrates enhanced test accuracy and reduced variance in posterior estimates, critical for practical applications.  
- Solid Methodology: The application of variational inference and the Adam optimizer indicates a robust methodological framework.  

Weaknesses:  
- Clarity Issues: Some sections lack clarity, particularly regarding the implications of the results and the methodology.  
- Limited Scope: The evaluation is primarily focused on a single dataset (spiral dataset), which may limit the generalizability of the findings.  
- Insufficient Analysis: The authors do not provide a thorough analysis of the proposed method's computational efficiency or a detailed discussion of its limitations.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by elaborating on the implications of the results and the significance of variational free energy in practical applications. Additionally, we suggest expanding the experimental validation beyond the spiral dataset to enhance the generalizability of the findings. Finally, we encourage the authors to include a thorough analysis of the computational efficiency of their proposed method and a detailed discussion of its limitations.
