Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Deep Contractive Drift Calculator (DCDC), a novel sample-based algorithm for bounding the convergence rates of general state-space Markov chains to stationarity in Wasserstein distance. The authors propose a theoretical framework utilizing an auxiliary function to bound convergence, complemented by deep neural networks for approximation. The paper includes a thorough theoretical analysis, sample complexity considerations, and empirical validation on realistic Markov chains.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written, providing a clear overview of its contributions and the significance of the addressed problem.
2. The innovative use of deep learning to solve the Contractive Drift Equation (CDE) bridges traditional mathematical analysis and modern computational methods.
3. The authors offer statistical guarantees on the approximation, enhancing the theoretical rigor of their approach.
4. The empirical validation demonstrates practical applicability to problems in operations research and machine learning.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper is somewhat intricate and may be difficult to follow; additional background and related work should be included for improved readability.
2. The experimental results are limited to the authors' algorithms without direct simulations of the Markov chain to compute Wasserstein distance.
3. The experiments are confined to 2D scenarios, lacking high-dimensional examples.
4. There is insufficient discussion on the computational complexity and scalability of the DCDC algorithm, particularly for high-dimensional state spaces.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper's readability by providing more detailed background and discussing previous methods, including theoretical or numerical comparisons. Additionally, the authors should include direct simulations of the Markov chain to validate the convergence rate through Wasserstein distance calculations. Expanding the experimental validation to include high-dimensional examples would strengthen the findings. Furthermore, a more thorough discussion on the computational complexity of the DCDC algorithm and practical guidelines for choosing sample sizes in various scenarios would enhance the utility of the method.
