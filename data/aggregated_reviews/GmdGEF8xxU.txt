### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of graph homophily, distinguishing three types: label, structural, and feature homophily. The authors propose a Contextual Stochastic Block Model (CSBM-3H) to theoretically analyze these types and introduce a new combined measure, Tri-Hom. The relationship between GNN performance and the three homophily types is empirically evaluated using CSBM-3H across various datasets, demonstrating that Tri-Hom correlates better with GNN performance than existing measures. Additionally, the paper provides a detailed analysis of feature homophily in graph structures, specifically addressing the invariance of feature homophily estimation to transformations such as shifts, scaling, and variance changes. The authors rigorously demonstrate that the estimation of feature homophily remains consistent across these transformations. The performance measurement methodology is clarified, indicating that it reflects the Pearson correlation between homophily metrics and model performance across 31 datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The CSBM-3H model is flexible, capturing complex relationships between graph structure, node features, and labels, making it a valuable synthetic benchmark.
2. The theoretical analysis elucidates how different homophily aspects influence the distinguishability of node features.
3. The extensive experimental validation across 31 datasets yields promising results, showcasing the robustness of the proposed method.
4. The authors provide a comprehensive mathematical proof of the invariance of feature homophily estimation to various transformations, enhancing the robustness of their claims.
5. The clarification regarding performance measurement effectively elucidates the correlation methodology used, contributing to the paper's transparency.

Weaknesses:
1. There is a terminological inconsistency regarding the definition of structural homophily, which may confuse readers.
2. The motivation for the specific form of structural and feature homophily is insufficiently explained, leaving questions about their effectiveness.
3. The assumption of balanced class sizes throughout the paper is a significant limitation, as previous research indicates that class imbalance critically affects homophily measures.
4. The discussion on the class-balanced assumption and its implications on results, particularly in Theorem 2.2, lacks depth and may leave readers questioning the robustness of conclusions drawn from imbalanced datasets.
5. Some reviewers expressed a need for further clarification on the original definition of homophily and its estimation, indicating potential gaps in the explanation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of terminology, particularly regarding structural homophily, to avoid confusion. Additionally, providing more motivation for the specific forms of structural and feature homophily would enhance the paper's rigor. It would be beneficial to address the implications of class imbalance on homophily measures, perhaps by including discussions or analyses that consider unbalanced datasets. We also suggest that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the class-balanced assumption, particularly in relation to Theorem 2.2, to provide clearer insights into its impact on results. Furthermore, enhancing the explanation of the original definition of homophily and its estimation process would address reviewer concerns regarding its complexity and the challenges in proving invariance. Lastly, we suggest that the authors include guidelines for model design based on their findings, which would aid practitioners in applying their metrics effectively.
