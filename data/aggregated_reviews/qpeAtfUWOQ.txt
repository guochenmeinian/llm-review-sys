Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for estimating uncertainty in the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model using variational calculus. The authors propose a hierarchical structure with a "Base" level resembling vanilla 3DGS and a "Finer" level where Gaussians are defined by parameters $\{ \mu_i, \sigma_i\}$. The Finer Gaussians are integrated into the 3DGS inference pipeline, utilizing the re-parametrization trick and the ELBO. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms other uncertainty estimation techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The method builds on the simplicity of 3DGS and is straightforward to implement, particularly for those familiar with ELBO-based methods.  
- Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in uncertainty estimation, showing improvements over existing methods.

Weaknesses:  
- The positioning of the method relative to previous works, such as FisherRF and latentSplat, is inadequate; comparisons are lacking despite available results and public code.  
- Certain design choices are unclear, such as the limitations on $\mu_n$ in eq(6) and the differences in the spawning method from vanilla 3DGS.  
- The paper does not explicitly discuss the limitations of the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the positioning of their method by including comparisons with FisherRF and latentSplat, particularly adding results from [42] to Table 1. Additionally, a deeper discussion on the similarities to FisherRF is necessary. Clarifying the rationale for the design choices, such as the range limitation of $\mu_n$ and the differences in the spawning method, would enhance understanding. We also suggest including a discussion on the limitations of the method in the paper. More ablation studies should be conducted to assess the impact of the multi-scale prior and the quantity of spawned Gaussians on performance. Finally, improving the overall writing quality and addressing the identified typos would strengthen the presentation.
