Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on best arm identification (BAI) with a fixed budget in the K-arm bandit problem, employing large deviation principles to analyze algorithms. The authors propose two new algorithms and derive sharper asymptotic bounds on the error probability, demonstrating that one algorithm outperforms existing methods. The paper includes extensive numerical simulations to illustrate the performance of these algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The article is well-written, with a complete literature review and clear presentation of methods and results. The sketches of proofs are insightful, and the self-contained nature of the article is commendable.  
- It introduces significant new methodological tools and theoretical results, supported by rigorous proofs.  
- The analysis of the successive rejects algorithm improves upon previous results, and the empirical performance of the algorithms is strong.  

Weaknesses:  
- The theoretical guarantees of the two proposed algorithms are not compared, which limits understanding of their relative performance.  
- Some bounds presented are difficult to read, particularly in Section 4, and the theorem statements lack clarity regarding assumptions.  
- The paper's contributions may seem incremental, focusing primarily on specific algorithms rather than addressing the broader fixed budget BAI problem.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the theoretical guarantees of the two algorithms, including scenarios where one may outperform the other. Additionally, consider adding an introduction to the Appendix to clarify its content and the aspects of the problem that are addressed there. Furthermore, we suggest enhancing the clarity of the bounds presented, especially in Section 4, and ensuring that theorem statements explicitly state their assumptions.
