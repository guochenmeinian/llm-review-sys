Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents two innovative methods: Time Series Editing (TSE) and TAP. TSE is a method for generating time series data with controlled attributes by modifying existing samples while preserving others. It utilizes a multi-resolution diffusion-based model trained with a bootstrapped learning algorithm, addressing challenges related to biased data distribution and varying attribute influences. The authors demonstrate TSE's effectiveness through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. TAP, on the other hand, is designed to align time series $\mathbf{x}$ and attributes $\mathbf{a}$ in the embedding space, employing a training approach that distinguishes positive and negative ($\mathbf{x}$, $\mathbf{a}$) pairs. TAP features two encoders: a time series encoder based on PatchTST and an attribute encoder implemented as an MLP. The model achieves notable accuracy across various datasets, with top1/top2 accuracy averaging 0.9145/0.9797 for the Synthetic dataset, 0.9397/0.9746 for Air, and 0.9258/0.9682 for Motor. The architecture details, including hyper-parameters and processing modules, are elaborated in the appendices.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The task of editing specific attributes in TSE is novel and has significant potential applications across various domains.
- The proposed multi-resolution diffusion model effectively addresses the varying impact of attributes in time series data.
- TAP demonstrates strong performance metrics across multiple datasets, indicating its effectiveness in aligning time series and attributes.
- The architecture of TAP is well-documented, with clear references to model configurations and hyper-parameters.
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it accessible to a broad audience.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental results for TSE focus on a specific set of edited attributes, lacking clarity on the selection rationale; a broader evaluation across all combinations or averages is necessary.
- Confidence intervals should be added to performance metrics for both TSE and TAP to assess significance better.
- The estimation method for $p(a_k^{tgt}|x)$ in calculating the RaTS performance score for TSE is unclear.
- The ground truth for edited time series in real datasets is often ambiguous, necessitating additional metrics like MSE/MAE for a more realistic assessment.
- The paper does not adequately address the potential issues arising from correlated attributes in real-world applications.
- The discussion on TAP lacks sufficient insights into potential applications and future directions, which could enhance its impact.
- Some aspects of the TAP model architecture and hyper-parameter settings may require further clarification for better understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section of TSE by including results for all possible combinations of edited attributes or at least their averages. Additionally, incorporating confidence intervals in all reported performance metrics for both TSE and TAP would enhance the robustness of the findings. Clarifying the estimation method for $p(a_k^{tgt}|x)$ and providing MSE/MAE evaluations for real datasets in TSE would also strengthen the paper. Furthermore, discussing the implications of correlated attributes and how they might affect the model's performance would be beneficial. For TAP, we suggest that the authors enhance the discussion section to include more insights on applications and future research directions. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide further clarification on certain model architecture details and hyper-parameter settings to enhance reader comprehension.
