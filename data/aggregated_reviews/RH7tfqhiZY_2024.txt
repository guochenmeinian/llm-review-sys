Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents YouDream, a framework for text-to-3D animal generation that utilizes a tetra-pose ControlNet and a multi-agent LLM system. The ControlNet synthesizes animals based on text prompts and 2D tetrapod poses, while the LLM modifies 3D keypoint templates to generate diverse animal poses. The method aims to optimize Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) for improved geometry and appearance, addressing common issues in previous text-to-3D approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach effectively generates 3D poses and skeletons for various animals, showcasing creativity in LLM utilization.
- The framework produces 3D animal assets with enhanced geometry, mitigating the multi-face problem prevalent in many SDS-based methods.
- YouDream provides controllability over animal poses, making it a valuable tool for 3D artists.

Weaknesses:
- The implementation details regarding LLM usage for pose generation are vague, lacking clarity on the specific LLM used, its fine-tuning, and pose representation.
- No results on failure cases or success rates of generation are reported, leading to concerns about the quality of generated outputs.
- Artifacts such as color saturation and extra limbs persist, indicating the need for a more detailed skeleton with additional landmarks/keypoints.
- The method's performance is limited to 16 animal categories, which may restrict its applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the LLM implementation in Section 3.2 by providing specific details on the LLM used, its fine-tuning on pose data, and how poses are represented in natural language. Additionally, we suggest that the authors report metrics on the success rate of generation, including the proportion of outputs that are not considered failure cases. Addressing the identified artifacts and expanding the range of animal categories would also enhance the robustness of the framework.
