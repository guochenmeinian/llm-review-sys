Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel data distillation technique called Fair Wasserstein Coresets, aimed at creating a synthetic core set with sample weights to represent a larger dataset. The authors minimize the Wasserstein distance between the core set and the dataset while ensuring a fairness constraint is satisfied. They develop a majority minimization algorithm for this problem and validate their approach empirically across various datasets, demonstrating a competitive fairness utility trade-off.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The Wasserstein problem is well-formulated with theoretical guarantees.  
- The connections with k-medoids are intuitive.  
- The paper is generally well-structured and clear, making the high-level ideas accessible.  
- The theoretical results appear sound, and the experiments on real and synthetic datasets support the proposed method effectively.  

Weaknesses:  
- There is a potential error in Proposition 2.1 regarding the inputs and outputs defined in the functions, which may affect subsequent theoretical results.  
- The empirical analysis in Figure 1 is difficult to interpret, particularly regarding the Pareto frontier and the dominance of FWC.  
- The trade-offs between accuracy and disparity in the LLM experiments in Table 1 are not clearly articulated, and the reported changes do not seem statistically significant.  
- The paper borrows heavily from existing works, raising questions about the novelty of the contributions.  
- The explainability of the synthetic data is limited, and it is unclear how the features in the generated synthetic data correspond to those in the original data.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Proposition 2.1 and address the potential error, detailing its implications for the theoretical results. Additionally, please clarify the statement in Lemma 3.1 regarding the coreset's performance relative to the best fair Wasserstein coreset. To enhance the empirical analysis, we suggest measuring the Pareto frontier from all observations and demonstrating the dominance of FWC more clearly. Furthermore, we advise providing a more detailed explanation of the trade-offs between accuracy and disparity in the LLM experiments, including statistical significance. Lastly, we encourage the authors to highlight the non-trivial modifications to existing techniques to strengthen the novelty of their work.
