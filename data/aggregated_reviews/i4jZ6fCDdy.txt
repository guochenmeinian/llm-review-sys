Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method utilizing operator network theory to predict steady-state vibrational patterns on a beaded flat plate under various external excitations. The authors generate a benchmark dataset using numerical structural engineering software based on Mindlin plate theory, which includes velocity fields and frequency response functions (FRF). They propose a bespoke deep operator network to derive input-output relationships within a functional operator framework. Additionally, the work introduces a dataset of 12,000 rectangular plate geometries and their vibrational responses, alongside evaluation metrics for prediction accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The development of a benchmark framework based on 2D flat plate theory is a significant contribution, especially given the scarcity of publicly available datasets in structural and mechanical engineering.
- The inclusion of multiple methodologies on the benchmark dataset and the well-organized code enhances the study's credibility.
- The introduction of a novel dataset and neural network architecture is commendable.

Weaknesses:
- The numerical plate simulations lack complexity, as they do not account for high-frequency noise in FRFs or closely spaced modes, which are critical in real-life scenarios.
- The proposed FQO-UNet architecture does not appear to be a strong original contribution, relying heavily on existing neural network components.
- The model's interpolation requirement for FRF plots may limit its adaptability in real-world applications, potentially missing closely spaced modes and introducing spurious results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the complexity of the numerical simulations by incorporating high-frequency noise and investigating closely spaced modes to enhance realism. Additionally, consider extending the dataset to include different plate geometries and the effects of damage, such as punched holes, to broaden the range of tasks for the benchmark. Enhancing the transfer learning section could also be beneficial; demonstrating the application of pre-trained models on different structures would strengthen the contribution. Finally, addressing the minimal amount of training data necessary for effective model transferability and providing commentary on the challenges of domain shift would significantly enhance the paper's depth.
