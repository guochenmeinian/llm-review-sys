### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of Mean-Field Langevin Dynamics (MFLD) for convex optimization over signed measures, utilizing lifting and bilevel approaches. The authors demonstrate that the bilevel approach offers superior convergence properties across a broader range of hyperparameters and achieves improved convergence rates with an enhanced temperature annealing schedule. The analysis includes a local convergence rate for single index models, which depends polynomially on the dimension and inverse temperature.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The rigorous comparison between lifting and bilevel approaches reveals surprising results, particularly the stronger guarantees provided by the bilevel method in low temperature regimes.  
- The paper is well-written, detailed, and employs novel techniques, such as local LSI bounds, enhancing the analysis beyond standard MFLD results.  
- The focus on signed measures is relevant to various machine learning and data science applications, and the theoretical contributions are convincing.

Weaknesses:  
- The scope of the lifting and bilevel ideas needs clarification, especially regarding the projection representation of signed measures.  
- The assumption of a compact manifold for the parameter space $\mathcal{W}$ raises questions about its applicability to certain optimization problems, suggesting a need for further exploration of alternatives like confinement terms.  
- The experimental investigation is limited, with the main experiment appearing overly academic; a discussion of existing literature on practical applications would be beneficial.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the lifting and bilevel approaches by providing more insights into their transition from signed measures to probability measures, potentially including citations of relevant literature. Additionally, addressing the assumption of compact manifolds and exploring alternatives would enhance the paper's applicability. We also suggest that the authors consider revising the experimental section to either include more relevant experiments or discuss existing literature that supports the practicality of their approach. Finally, clarifying the time complexity in Theorem 4.2 in terms of $\Delta$ and providing intuitive insights into why the bilevel approach outperforms the lifting strategy would strengthen the paper.
