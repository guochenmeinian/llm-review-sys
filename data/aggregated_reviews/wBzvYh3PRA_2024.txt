Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents FACTORSIM, a framework that converts language specifications into complete simulations for training reinforcement learning (RL) agents. FACTORSIM decomposes input prompts into steps and employs a factored Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) to minimize context requirements during generation. The authors propose a method for benchmarking generative simulations, demonstrating FACTORSIM's applicability in robotics settings. The paper also introduces a prompting method for generating simulation code based on text descriptions, modularizing the process into controller, model, and view components.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Develops a robust pipeline for constructing game environments from language descriptions, enhancing scalability for training generalist agents.
- Formalizes the framework as a POMDP, improving generation outcomes by reducing context needs.
- Comprehensive evaluation on game and robot benchmarks, showing superior results against other LLM prompting baselines.

Weaknesses:
- Limited evidence for generalization to embodied scenarios; the success rate in key evaluations is low.
- The major contribution appears to be a prompting technique rather than a novel framework, with concerns about its fundamental novelty.
- The paper is poorly written, making it difficult to understand key concepts and implementation details.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by starting with intuitive explanations before delving into abstract terms like POMDP and factorization. Enhancing the figures to better illustrate the unique aspects of the "Factored POMDP" compared to prior methods would also be beneficial. Additionally, we suggest including more examples throughout the paper to clarify instructions and improve the reproducibility of the method. Further discussion on the challenges and approaches related to robotics applications would strengthen the paper, as well as conducting additional experiments to demonstrate the pipeline's usage in robotics or embodied AI.
