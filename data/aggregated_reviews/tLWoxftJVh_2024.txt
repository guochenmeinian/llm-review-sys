Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative approach to image purification called Consistency Purification, which utilizes diffusion models to achieve efficient and effective purification while ensuring that purified images lie on the data manifold. The authors propose a consistency model distilled from the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) and refine it through Consistency Fine-tuning with LPIPS loss, enhancing semantic alignment between purified and original images. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that this framework achieves state-of-the-art certified robustness and efficiency compared to baseline methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of the consistency model to the purification domain is a compelling idea, leveraging its ability to map noised images back to their origin, with experimental results indicating significant improvements in classification efficiency.
2. The writing is clear, and the logical flow is well-structured.
3. The paper achieves a trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness, realizing Consistency Purification in a one-step manner.

Weaknesses:
1. There is no comparison with multi-step DDPM methods, which would strengthen the work.
2. The impact of noise intensity on experimental results is not addressed; this should be included in the rebuttal phase.
3. The model's performance with non-Gaussian noise is unclear; results for different noise distributions would enhance robustness.
4. Visualizations of purified images before and after the process would make results more intuitive.
5. The innovation appears limited, relying on existing Consistency Models and LPIPS loss to form the diffpure framework.
6. Some descriptions are difficult to understand; a brief explanation of "transport" in the Introduction is recommended, and clarification on whether Remark 3.4 needs to be bolded is needed.
7. The validation set on ImageNet-64 is too small, with only 100 images failing to accurately reflect validity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with multi-step DDPM methods to solidify their findings. Additionally, please address the impact of noise intensity on results and include this information in the rebuttal. Providing results for various noise distributions would enhance the robustness of the model. Including visualizations of the purification process would also make the results more compelling. Furthermore, we suggest clarifying difficult descriptions, particularly regarding "transport," and considering the adequacy of the validation set size on ImageNet-64 to align with the paper's objectives.
