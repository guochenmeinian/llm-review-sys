Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of object recognition in humans and neural networks through the lens of critical band masking, revealing that humans utilize similar spatial frequency channels for recognizing objects, letters, and gratings, while neural networks employ much wider channels. The study correlates channel properties with adversarial robustness and shape bias, indicating a divergence in frequency sensitivity between humans and models. Additionally, the authors emphasize the implications of their findings for future improvements in network design and provide a robust evaluation of their methods, addressing previous concerns regarding experimental design with updated plots and clarifications. However, the scope of their findings, particularly regarding generalization beyond ImageNet, requires clearer articulation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study employs a novel approach by applying critical band masking, traditionally used in neuroscience, to analyze neural network responses.
- The paper is well-structured, clearly written, and presents significant findings that may interest the NeurIPS community.
- The experimental design is sound, utilizing a diverse set of 76 ImageNet models and 16 human participants, with clear evidence supporting the claims made.
- The authors corrected the alpha level for multiple comparisons and provided updated plots, enhancing the clarity of their experimental methods.
- The rebuttal effectively addressed most reviewer concerns, demonstrating a strong understanding of the implications of their work.
- The analysis in the new Fig2 is valuable for understanding model accuracy across different conditions.

Weaknesses:
- The significance of the findings for deep learning practitioners is unclear, and the practical implications of the results are not explicitly discussed.
- The evaluation is limited to ImageNet, raising concerns about the generalizability of the findings to other datasets.
- The paper lacks a dedicated section on limitations, and the methodology details, such as the treatment of magnitude and phase in frequency analysis, are insufficiently addressed.
- Some experimental weaknesses remain, particularly in monitor calibration, which are inherent to the online study design.
- The conclusion regarding the applicability of findings to general object detection is insufficiently supported, as multiple sections suggest broader implications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the significance discussion to clarify the implications of their findings for future research in deep learning. Additionally, addressing the limitations of using only ImageNet and discussing the potential impact of training data and augmentation on frequency sensitivity would strengthen the paper. We encourage the authors to include a related work section to contextualize their findings within existing literature on spatial frequency sensitivity and adversarial robustness. Furthermore, clarifying the methodology regarding the use of magnitude and phase in the analysis would enhance the rigor of the study. Lastly, we suggest expanding the evaluation of adversarially-trained networks beyond ResNet50 to include other architectures, such as ViT, to validate the findings further. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the scope of their results by explicitly stating in the Introduction that their findings apply specifically to ImageNet and not to real-world vision. Additionally, we look forward to the updated robustness results and encourage the authors to ensure that the new attack parameters are thoroughly discussed in the supplementary material and referenced in the results section of the main paper.
