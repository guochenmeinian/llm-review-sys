Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for representing permutation matrices through low-rank matrix factorization, utilizing Kissing number theory to determine the minimum rank necessary for accurate representation. The authors propose a method that combines this theoretical framework with non-linear mappings, such as ReLU and SoftMax, to achieve significant memory savings while maintaining the ability to recover the full permutation matrix. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through various applications, including point cloud alignment and shape matching.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The core idea of low-rank representation of permutations is innovative and has broad applicability in matching problems.
- The writing is clear and well-structured, effectively explaining the theoretical background and practical implications.
- The proposed method shows strong memory reduction and effective optimization for recovering permutations across multiple applications.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental section lacks comprehensive comparisons to state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms, which raises concerns about the accuracy and applicability of the proposed method.
- The reliance on supervised learning limits the method's applicability, as it may not generalize well to unsupervised scenarios.
- Specific experimental results do not clarify whether the recovered permutations are indeed correct, and the performance metrics compared to conceptual baselines are insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including a thorough comparison to SOTA algorithms for finding permutation matrices, detailing run-time, memory usage, and error rates. Additionally, clarifying the accuracy of the recovered transformations in relation to the problem size and providing insights into the breaking point of the exact algorithm would enhance the analysis. To broaden the method's applicability, consider exploring adaptations for unsupervised learning scenarios. Finally, addressing the clarity of experimental results and ensuring that the correct permutations are highlighted would strengthen the overall presentation.
