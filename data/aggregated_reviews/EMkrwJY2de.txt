Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents several variations of a graph pruning/rewiring algorithm aimed at optimizing the spectral gap through edge deletions, inspired by Eldan's proof related to the Braess paradox. The authors claim that maximizing the spectral gap helps combat over-squashing and oversmoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). They provide theoretical insights on a toy example and empirical results demonstrating improvements in training GNNs on pruned graphs, particularly in heterophilic contexts, while also exploring connections to the lottery ticket hypothesis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively connects various important literatures, contributing to the understanding of graph theory in machine learning.
- It is well-written and articulated, making complex ideas accessible.
- The experimental results are comprehensive, with additional data provided in the appendix.

Weaknesses:
- Some claimed connections, such as those to graph lottery tickets, appear tenuous and lack motivation.
- The assertion that deleting edges can simultaneously reduce over-squashing and oversmoothing is questionable, as Cheeger's constant, a more reliable measure, decreases with edge deletion.
- The reliance on ring graphs for theoretical analysis may limit generalizability, and the conditions for the inequalities presented are overly specific.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and motivation behind the connections to graph lottery tickets, as well as provide a more robust theoretical analysis that extends beyond the ring example. Additionally, addressing the inconsistencies in experimental results across different graph types would strengthen the claims. Clarifying the implications of Lemma 3.1 and exploring the broader spectral implications beyond the smallest eigenvalue could enhance the theoretical foundation of the work. Finally, we suggest including a comparison of the proposed method with established random edge-dropping baselines to contextualize its performance.
