### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into causal discovery using heteroscedastic location-scale noise functional models (LSNMs), comparing maximum likelihood model selection with causal model selection through residual independence testing. The authors highlight the sensitivity of maximum likelihood approaches to noise distribution misspecification, which can lead to poor performance in determining causal direction. They propose an independence testing approach that demonstrates robustness even under unfavorable conditions, supported by extensive empirical results and theoretical explanations. Additionally, the paper provides a detailed data generation process for LSNM structural causal models (SCMs) in Section 6.1, including specific equations and noise distributions utilized. The authors clarify that datasets in Sections 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 differ in their ground-truth models, with LSNMs used in Section 6.1 and non-LSNMs in the latter sections, justifying the inclusion of non-LSNMs by their relevance to established benchmarks in the field. They also address a misconception regarding the Tübingen cause-effect benchmark, asserting it is consistently labeled as "real-world" in the paper, and differentiate their work from previous studies, emphasizing their focus on LSNMs, unlike the ANMs discussed in reference [23].

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents a clear contribution, with extensive simulations and empirical evidence supporting the use of independence testing for causal discovery.
- The theoretical results provide compelling explanations for the observed phenomena, particularly regarding the limitations of maximum likelihood methods under noise misspecification.
- The proposed method, CAREFL-H, shows promising performance across various datasets.
- The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the data generation process, including specific equations and noise distributions.
- The justification for using non-LSNMs in evaluation is well-articulated, linking to established benchmarks.
- Clear differentiation from previous works enhances the understanding of the paper's unique contributions.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the work appears limited, as the implications of model misspecification are not surprising, and the use of independence tests is relatively common.
- There is insufficient discussion regarding the work by Strobl et al., particularly their approach that does not rely on likelihood maximization or prior knowledge about noise distribution.
- The paper lacks a comprehensive analysis of the pitfalls associated with independence testing methods, which could provide a more balanced view of the comparison between the two approaches.
- The potential confusion regarding the classification of the Tübingen benchmark as "synthetic" may detract from clarity.
- The distinction between LSNMs and ANMs could be elaborated further to strengthen the theoretical framework.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the work of Strobl et al. to clarify the distinctions between their approach and the proposed methods. Additionally, we suggest providing a more thorough theoretical advocacy for the robustness of the independence testing method, including proofs for results like Proposition 5.1. It would also be beneficial to include a dedicated section addressing the limitations and pitfalls of independence testing methods, supported by empirical simulations. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding the classification of the Tübingen cause-effect benchmark to avoid misconceptions. Lastly, we suggest that the authors provide a more detailed discussion on the implications of using LSNMs versus ANMs to enhance the theoretical contributions of their work.
