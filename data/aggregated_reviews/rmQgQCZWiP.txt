Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the impact of time discretization on estimating cost functions for continuous-time stochastic optimal control problems and reinforcement learning (RL) settings. The authors propose a discrete-time Monte Carlo estimator based on the left-rule formula for numerical integration, deriving closed-form results for the mean square error (MSE) under the LQG assumption, which depend on sample size and integration step size. Theoretical results are obtained for the optimal sampling rate to balance approximation and statistical estimation errors, verified through numerical evaluations in both linear and nonlinear environments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses an important problem in continuous-time systems, demonstrating how time discretization impacts cost function estimation.  
- It provides a clear theoretical framework and extensive numerical studies, particularly in Section 4, which effectively illustrate the bias-variance tradeoff.  
- The writing is clear and structured, making complex concepts accessible.  

Weaknesses:  
- The significance of the contribution is questioned, as closed-form results for MSE under the LQG assumption may not be surprising.  
- The practical implementation may be limited due to the assumption of fixed step sizes and the fidelity of results in real-world scenarios, where simplifying assumptions may not hold.  
- The numerical evaluation for nonlinear systems lacks robustness, raising concerns about the transferability of results from linear to nonlinear regimes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the practical relevance of their findings by illustrating realistic scenarios where their methods can be applied effectively. Additionally, exploring alternative discretization plans beyond uniform discretization could enhance the depth of the analysis. Clarifying the conditions under which the proposed methods should be used, particularly regarding the estimation horizon and the variability of episode lengths in RL settings, would strengthen the paper. Finally, addressing the limitations of the theoretical results when applied to more complex systems would provide a clearer understanding of their applicability in real-world contexts.
