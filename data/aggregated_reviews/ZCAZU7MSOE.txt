### Key Points
This paper presents SymLearn, a novel framework that integrates human and AI intelligence for assessing healthcare policy adherence using social media imagery. It proposes a symbiotic approach that leverages crowdsourcing and AI models to address the Web-based Healthcare Policy Adherence (WebHA) problem. The framework comprises two modules: Symbiotic Crowd-AI Collaboration Space Design (SCSD) and Active Integrated Crowd-AI Co-Learning (AICC), which enhance human label quality and optimize AI model selection, respectively. The research demonstrates significant implications for healthcare policy adherence assessment, particularly in leveraging social media data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The innovative integration of human and AI intelligence addresses complex tasks in healthcare policy adherence assessment.
2. The framework's design improves accuracy by balancing human judgment and AI capabilities.
3. Empirical validation on real-world datasets showcases the framework's practicality and effectiveness.
4. The paper is well-structured, providing clear explanations and illustrative examples.

Weaknesses:
1. Potential limitations in scalability and generalizability across diverse social media platforms and health crisis contexts.
2. Insufficient reproducibility due to the lack of provided codes and datasets.
3. The experimental comparisons and evaluation metrics lack comprehensiveness, particularly regarding imbalanced datasets.
4. Ethical considerations regarding privacy and the use of social media data are not extensively discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the scalability and generalizability of the SymLearn framework by discussing how it might be adapted to various social media platforms and health crisis contexts. Additionally, we suggest providing a rationale for the chosen evaluation metrics and incorporating more diverse comparison methods, such as AUROC and AUPRC, to enhance insights, especially for imbalanced datasets. Expanding the comparative analyses to include more recent state-of-the-art baseline methods, such as 'DaViT: Dual Attention Vision Transformers (2022)' and 'Beyond Labels: Empowering Human with Natural Language Explanations through a Novel Active-Learning Architecture (2023)', could significantly enrich the study's evaluation. Finally, we encourage a more in-depth discussion of the ethical considerations surrounding the use of social media data to ensure privacy and compliance.
