Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method called 1-PAGER (or 1P), which utilizes a single language model for both document retrieval and answer generation in open-domain QA. The authors propose generating keywords through constrained decoding with an FM-index, allowing for a gradual narrowing of the document corpus until a final answer is produced. While the method shows competitive performance against state-of-the-art retrieval-augmented models, it underperforms compared to systems that retrieve multiple documents.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel technique of generating a sequence of keywords for corpus partitioning, contributing to generative retrieval.
- The constrained decoding method is clever and enhances interpretability through keyword generation.
- The paper is well-written and presents its ideas clearly, making it accessible to readers.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on a single model for both retrieval and answer generation appears counterproductive, as separate models yield better performance.
- Evaluations are limited to a single dataset (Open-NQ), raising concerns about the generalizability of the results.
- The complexity of training data generation and the potential for the model to learn heuristics rather than robust patterns are significant limitations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including additional datasets to validate the robustness of their approach. Additionally, addressing the limitations of relying solely on a single document for answer generation is crucial; exploring the integration of a reader could enhance performance. Clarifying the runtime for inference and providing a more detailed explanation of the constrained decoding with FM-index would also strengthen the paper's reproducibility and technical clarity.
