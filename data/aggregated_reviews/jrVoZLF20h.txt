Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Local-Global SIRENs, which partition the space into regions and fit each with smaller local INRs, enabling croppable INRs by cropping weights relative to these regions. The authors propose using local and global feature extraction to enhance fitting performance, demonstrating their method's applicability across Image, Audio, Video, and CT through experiments. Additionally, the paper introduces a patchwise INR method integrated with a global INR, allowing for post-training cropping that reduces model weight and storage requirements.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The novel idea of partition-based INRs for croppable INRs is compelling, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow.
2. The method shows improved fitting performance compared to SIREN, particularly due to global feature extraction.
3. The experiments are thorough, showcasing flexibility across multiple models and domains.

Weaknesses:
1. The contribution of cropping INRs appears minor as it is a natural property of partition-based INRs.
2. The authors do not provide detailed implementation for automatic partitioning, which is mentioned but not demonstrated.
3. The range of experimented partition factors is insufficient; a broader range is recommended.
4. Cropping based on simple grids may not be practical; semantic segmentation-based cropping is suggested for improvement.
5. The conclusion regarding partition factors affecting training speed and reconstruction accuracy lacks clarity and requires further explanation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by providing a detailed discussion on how to automatically partition the region with their method. Additionally, the authors should explore whether their method can be extended to semantic segmentation-based cropping. It is also essential to clarify the relationship between partition factors and performance, particularly why increasing partition factors enhances training speed while decreasing them improves reconstruction accuracy. Finally, an explicit comparison with similar methods should be included to better highlight the contributions of this work.
