### Key Points
This paper presents WeInfer, a framework designed to optimize large language model (LLM) inference in web browsers by leveraging WebGPU. It addresses inefficiencies in existing frameworks through buffer reuse strategies and an asynchronous pipeline design. The authors provide extensive evaluations across various models and hardware, demonstrating significant speed improvements over state-of-the-art systems like WebLLM.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The identification and targeted optimization of inefficiencies in WebGPU utilization through buffer reuse and asynchronous pipelines are commendable.  
2. The comprehensive evaluation across multiple models and devices showcases the framework's general applicability.  
3. The relevance of the work aligns with the increasing interest in browser-based LLM inference for enhanced privacy and reduced latency.  
4. The empirical performance improvements are notable, and the writing is clear.

Weaknesses:  
1. The novelty is limited due to insufficient ablation studies to isolate the contributions of the core innovations, primarily attributing improvements to buffer reuse.  
2. The comparison against other frameworks, such as MediaPipe LLM, is inadequate, which raises questions about the claimed advancements.  
3. The discussion of practical challenges, including compatibility issues and memory constraints, is incomplete.  
4. Experiment settings lack clarity, particularly regarding GPU specifications and the fluctuation of inference times with increasing I.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experiment settings, specifically by detailing the GPU used in Table 3 and considering the inclusion of the two largest models in Table 4. Additionally, we suggest discussing the reasons behind the fluctuations in inference time observed in Table 6 when increasing I. A comparison of GPU utilization between WeInfer and WebLLM should also be included. Furthermore, addressing the necessity of LLMs in the framework, evaluating WeInfer's performance against other frameworks, and discussing broader metrics such as memory consumption and energy efficiency would enhance the paper's depth. Lastly, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the synergy between buffer reuse and the asynchronous pipeline, as well as the framework's robustness and potential for further development, particularly for larger models.
