Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents FlaMBé, a human-curated dataset of procedural knowledge about experimental methods in single-cell research, derived from 55 full-text papers and 1,195 abstracts. FlaMBé includes annotations for tissue and cell types, software tools, and workflows, making it the largest dataset for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Named Entity Disambiguation (NED) in this domain. The authors propose multiple use cases for FlaMBé, including training NER models, predicting tool contexts, and visualizing workflows. Additionally, the paper explores NER and related tasks, emphasizing the importance of proper data splits for training, development, and testing. The authors report NER performance metrics per IOB tag but acknowledge the need for clearer span-level performance reporting. They also address the characterization of language models, opting for "pre-trained language models" instead of "large language models" for precision, and correct citation practices for better reference accessibility.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- FlaMBé is a unique resource for NLP tasks, particularly in procedural knowledge extraction, addressing a gap in existing datasets.
- The dataset is well-curated, with sound annotation guidelines and extensive documentation, ensuring high quality and relevance.
- The authors have made significant revisions based on reviewer feedback, enhancing clarity and usability.
- The proposal to integrate FlaMBé into BigBIO is seen as beneficial for the research community.
- The manuscript now includes more detailed plans for maintaining FlaMBé with ML-guided predictions and manual checks.

Weaknesses:
- FlaMBé contains relatively few examples of complex annotations, limiting its applicability.
- The dataset's focus on single-cell research may restrict its relevance to broader biomedical contexts.
- The experiments lack baseline comparisons for workflow extraction, and the reporting of NER performance metrics is unconventional.
- The initial claim regarding LLMs driving advances in information extraction tasks was deemed imprecise.
- The limited scope of experiments remains a concern for some reviewers.
- There was an oversight in citation practices that required correction.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset by including a proper development and test set to ensure comparability in evaluations. Additionally, consider adding FlaMBé to BigBIO to enhance its usability within the research community. We suggest that the authors report span-level metrics for NER performance instead of separate metrics for B- and I-tags, as this would provide clearer insights. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide baseline results for workflow extraction and explore the potential for automatic generation of visualizations in future work. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their claims regarding the role of language models in NER by ensuring precise terminology is used throughout the manuscript. Lastly, we suggest that the authors provide further details on the scope of their experiments to address ongoing concerns.
