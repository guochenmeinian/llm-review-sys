Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for generating expressive human avatars from monocular RGB videos, focusing on enhancing fine-grained hand and facial expressions through 3D Gaussian Splatting and the SMPL-X model. The authors propose three main contributions: a plug-and-play module for improved SMPL-X alignment, a context-aware adaptive density control strategy, and a feedback mechanism for optimizing 3D Gaussian learning. The method is validated through extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing detailed expressiveness compared to previous approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is clearly written and organized, making it easy to follow.
- It addresses a critical task in human digitization, showcasing fine-grained generation details.
- The optimized SMPL-X model significantly improves alignment with RGB frames.
- Comprehensive ablation studies and visualizations effectively demonstrate the method's components and performance.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of using and optimizing SMPL-X for expressive avatars is limited, as it has been explored in prior works.
- The paper lacks comparisons to recent methods like Splatting Avatar, which could clarify its improvements.
- Inconsistent ablation studies across datasets and insufficient metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) from diverse views hinder robustness assessments.
- The impact of the confidence-aware loss is unclear, as it shows marginal improvement; more qualitative visualizations are needed to illustrate its effectiveness.
- Writing issues, such as a brief related work section and inconsistent formula definitions, detract from clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty discussion by addressing the limitations of previous works in relation to their contributions. Including comparisons with recent methods like Splatting Avatar in Table 1 would help clarify the proposed approach's advancements. The authors should ensure consistent ablation studies across datasets, particularly in Tables 2 and 3, to illustrate the effects of CADC, CL, and alignment. Additionally, calculating PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS from four novel views is essential for robustness. We suggest providing more qualitative visualizations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the confidence-aware loss and clarifying its role in the framework. Lastly, addressing writing issues and expanding the related work section would enhance the paper's overall presentation.
