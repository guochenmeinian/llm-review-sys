Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on static experiment planning under function approximation in contextual bandit problems, proposing two strategies: (1) EluderPlanner based on Eluder Dimension and (2) a Naive uniform sampler. The authors analyze their regret, achieving results comparable to OLS and SquareCB algorithms in adaptive settings. They also construct a tree-structured function class to illustrate the gap between static planning algorithms and the lower bound of adaptive learning regarding regret, while addressing model selection and the potential for constructing an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured, with clear motivation and explanations of problem setups and related literature.
- The combination of Eluder dimension and static experiment planning is a novel approach, and the lower bound construction in Section 5 is informative.
- The writing is clear, and the theoretical results are sound.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a detailed comparison with existing experiment planning algorithms, particularly in function approximation contexts.
- Proof intuition is insufficient, and a clear proof sketch is needed to highlight key points.
- There is no tight lower bound provided to guarantee the optimality of the proposed algorithms, and a discussion of limitations is missing.
- The writing style could be improved for clarity, particularly in the introduction and technical sections.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with existing experiment planning algorithms to demonstrate the advantages of their approach. A detailed proof sketch should be included to enhance understanding of the main results. Additionally, we suggest providing a tight lower bound to ensure the optimality of the proposed algorithms and including a discussion of the limitations of the approach. Improving the clarity of the writing, especially in the introduction and technical sections, would also benefit the paper. Finally, we encourage the authors to include numerical results to showcase the performance of their algorithms.
