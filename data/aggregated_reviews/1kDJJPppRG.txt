### Key Points
This paper presents an approach to automating the generation of hospital discharge summaries using large language models (LLMs) guided by clinical guidelines. The authors propose leveraging few-shot prompting with LLMs, specifically tested with GPT-4-turbo and MIMIC-III physician notes, achieving a micro accuracy of 0.81. The methodology does not require extensive training datasets, making it adaptable across various hospital systems. The evaluation involved clinicians, ensuring the automated summaries align with clinical standards.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper demonstrates a novel application of LLMs in automating discharge summaries, addressing a significant clinical challenge.
- It employs a secure Azure instance in compliance with Physionet DUA and includes rigorous clinician evaluations with clear labeling criteria.
- The methodology is adaptable, as it does not rely on extensive datasets, and the reporting of inference time and costs is commendable.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on a single dataset (MIMIC-III) may limit the generalizability of the findings.
- The evaluation sample size of 53 summaries is small, raising concerns about the robustness of the conclusions and inter-rater agreement at 60%.
- The performance metrics could benefit from a more precise definition, such as using an atomic-fact approach to evaluate accuracy, which may address potential inflation of false positives and negatives.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation framework by incorporating a comparison with baseline models, such as fine-tuned encoder-decoder models from supervised training. Additionally, we suggest expanding the dataset and including a more diverse range of clinical scenarios to enhance generalizability. To address the small sample size, increasing the number of summaries evaluated and clarifying how multiple clinician reviews are aggregated would strengthen the findings. Finally, we advise refining the performance metrics to include fact precision and recall for a more accurate assessment of summary quality.
