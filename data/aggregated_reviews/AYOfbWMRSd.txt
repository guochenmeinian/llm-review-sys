### Key Points
This paper presents a sociological study of the NLP field as perceived by its practitioners, based on long-form interviews with 26 researchers and qualitative longitudinal analysis of citation, terminology, and authorship patterns in the ACL Anthology. The authors provide a qualitative analysis of interview topics, discussing the history of the field, recurrent cycles of exploration and exploitation, the emergence of a "deep learning monoculture," and the shift from symbolic to statistical methods. They highlight methodological and cultural changes, including the rise of "benchmarking culture," centralization of tools, and the "software lottery" effect, which may hinder diversity and originality in research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The study employs a sound and rigorous methodology, with a clear and well-written qualitative analysis that addresses crucial topics in NLP.  
- The paper is timely, raising awareness of significant issues in the NLP community, particularly regarding the influence of large language models and the challenges of publishing original ideas.

Weaknesses:  
- The reliance on interviews from a small sample of 26 researchers may introduce bias, particularly as the discussions predominantly reflect perspectives from Western institutions.  
- The paper lacks a focus on practical methodologies beyond prompting, neglecting other strategies like zero-shot learning and fine-tuning.  
- There is a notable absence of novice voices and actionable steps for addressing the highlighted challenges, which limits the comprehensiveness and applicability of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the diversity of perspectives by including insights from novice researchers and practitioners actively engaged in NLP. Additionally, the authors should broaden the discussion of methodologies to encompass various strategies currently employed in the field. Finally, we suggest that the authors provide a concrete list of actionable steps for stakeholders to address the concerns raised in the paper, fostering a more constructive dialogue within the NLP community.
