Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for denoising and tomographic reconstruction in cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) using tensor density fields, which jointly addresses both challenges for the first time. The authors introduce an isotropic Fourier regularization term in their loss function to mitigate streaking artifacts. The method, **TensorDF**, combines implicit representation with a quadtree structure, allowing for automatic updates during training and incorporating three regularizers: total variation, boundary consistency, and a penalty in Fourier space. The authors validate their approach on synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in reconstruction quality and computational efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Originality: The authors present the first method that jointly solves reconstruction and denoising for cryoET, employing an innovative architecture that enhances computational speed for large datasets.
2. Quality: Significant improvements over existing methods are demonstrated, with efficient code implementation leading to better computational efficiency.
3. Clarity: The paper is well-written, providing extensive comparisons with existing methods and clear delineation of performance conditions.

Weaknesses:
1. Clarity: Some figures could be clearer, and the font sizes of axes in Figures 4 and 7 should be increased for better readability.
2. Quality: The authors do not demonstrate the effectiveness of their method across other tomographic modalities, despite claiming general applicability.
3. Limitations: The motivations behind the Coordinate-based representation (CBR) remain unclear, and the lack of access to code affects reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of figures, particularly by increasing font sizes and adjusting line colors for better visibility. Additionally, the authors should conduct ablation studies to explore the individual contributions of the quadtree structure and regularization terms to the overall performance. It would be beneficial to provide access to the code and more diverse examples to enhance reproducibility and generalizability. Finally, addressing the missing-wedge problem and providing benchmarks for optimization speed compared to existing methods would strengthen the claims made in the paper.
