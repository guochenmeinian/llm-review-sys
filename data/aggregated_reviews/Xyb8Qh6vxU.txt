### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in the legal domain, specifically focusing on legal judgment prediction (LJP) using the CAIL dataset. The authors propose a benchmark that includes various prompting methods and compares LLMs, such as GPT-4, against an information retrieval (IR) system. The evaluation reveals that well-performing IR can outperform LLMs combined with IR in certain scenarios. The paper also investigates the effects of different tokenizers on model performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a detailed and rigorous comparative analysis of multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, showcasing their performance on legal judgment prediction tasks.
- The experimental design is clear, allowing for straightforward comparisons between different models.
- The inclusion of various prompting methods and the analysis of the interplay between LLMs and IR models are commendable.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a comparison to existing state-of-the-art supervised LJP methods, which would strengthen the evaluation.
- There is insufficient discussion on critical issues such as fairness, expert evaluation, explainability, and the risks of hallucinations in LLMs.
- The practical significance of the charge labeling task as a legal application remains unclear, raising questions about its relevance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by incorporating comparisons to existing state-of-the-art supervised LJP methods to provide a more compelling evaluation. Additionally, addressing the implications of the "paradox" finding more clearly would enhance the paper's contributions. We also suggest that the authors discuss fairness and under-represented groups in their results, as well as the acceptability of the findings to legal experts. Finally, a thorough exploration of the hallucination risks and the explainability of the models would significantly strengthen the paper.
