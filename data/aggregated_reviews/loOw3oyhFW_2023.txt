Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a large-scale traffic forecasting benchmark dataset, LargeST, derived from the California Department of Transportation Performance Measurement system. The dataset includes data from 8600 sensors over five years and is enriched with node metadata. The authors validate the dataset's utility by conducting experiments with 11 baseline models, showcasing its potential for advancing traffic forecasting research. Additionally, the authors propose to enhance the baseline by incorporating Transformer-based methods, specifically STTN, while acknowledging the limitations of LargeST in comparison to larger datasets like OGB. Unique aspects of LargeST include its temporal dimension and the inclusion of previously unavailable features that contribute to a deeper understanding of traffic patterns.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
- The dataset is significantly larger than previous benchmarks, providing a valuable resource for researchers.
- Comprehensive analysis aids in understanding the dataset's structure and potential applications.
- Extensive experiments validate the dataset's usability across various models.
- The paper is well-organized, clearly written, and includes visually appealing figures.
- The introduction of a novel dataset expands the scope of traffic forecasting research.
- The authors demonstrate responsiveness to reviewer feedback, leading to improvements in the manuscript.

**Weaknesses:**
- The paper lacks a clear definition of "traffic forecasting," which could confuse readers.
- The baseline implementation requires refinement, and the authors should discuss the rationale behind certain methodological choices, such as the filter threshold of 0.01.
- The dataset's limitations and potential societal impacts are not adequately addressed.
- The dataset's scale is limited relative to other spatio-temporal datasets, and the metadata provided is insufficient.
- Certain influential factors, such as weather conditions and holidays, are not included in the dataset.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by providing a clear definition of "traffic forecasting" in the introduction. Additionally, the authors should discuss the implications of using older records in the dataset and justify the choice of the filter threshold. It would also be beneficial to include the storage format and access methods for the dataset, as well as solutions for handling missing traffic flow data. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors enhance the richness of the metadata by considering the integration of additional factors such as weather conditions and holidays. Clarifying the selection criteria for nodes in the dataset would also enhance understanding of the methodology. Finally, we encourage the authors to further discuss the implications of dataset size in relation to other spatio-temporal prediction tasks to strengthen their argument regarding the significance of LargeST. Addressing any typos or spelling errors would also enhance the overall quality of the paper.
