Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new pruning approach called SUBP, which trains a uniform 1Ã—N sparse structured network from scratch. The method employs a periodic block pruning and regrowing technique based on angular redundancy, allowing for multithreading acceleration. Experiments across various CNN architectures demonstrate the superiority of SUBP, particularly in achieving significant accuracy improvements under similar FLOPs constraints.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with a reasonable motivation for the proposed method.
- The SUBP method shows competitive performance against existing methods and effectively handles load imbalance through uniform pruning.
- The authors validate their approach with real inference speed results on both ARM and x86 platforms.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the approach is questionable, as similar prune-and-grow techniques have been extensively studied in prior works.
- Performance improvements over methods like CHEX and DMCP are marginal, and comparisons with non-uniform block pruning methods are lacking.
- The paper suffers from poor presentation, with unclear organization and formatting issues that hinder readability.
- Insufficient experiments are conducted, focusing solely on classification tasks without exploring generalization to other tasks or architectures.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and organization of the paper, particularly in Sections 1 and 3, and address formatting issues in tables and figures. Additionally, the authors should conduct experiments on a wider range of tasks beyond classification, including comparisons with other block pruning methods. Reporting training time alongside FLOPs would provide a more comprehensive evaluation. An ablation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of each component of SUBP is also necessary. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore the method's performance on GPU platforms and provide error bars for accuracy improvements to better illustrate the method's effectiveness.
