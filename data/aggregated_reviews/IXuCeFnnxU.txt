### Key Points
This paper presents a method called Noisy Pair Corrector (NPC) aimed at addressing the issue of mismatched-pair noise during the fine-tuning of dense retrieval models. The NPC framework includes a noise detection module that estimates mismatched pairs by calculating perplexity and a noise correction module that provides rectified soft labels. The authors validate their approach through experiments on various benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both synthetic and realistic noise.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles the significant problem of mismatched-pair noise, which is prevalent yet challenging in dense retrieval.
- The proposed method exhibits good mathematical intuition and is straightforward to understand.
- Experimental results indicate strong performance across multiple benchmarks, showcasing the method's applicability.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the work is questioned, as similar ideas have been explored in cross-modal retrieval tasks.
- The assumption regarding dense retrievers learning to distinguish matched pairs from easy negatives requires more empirical support.
- The experimental section lacks comparisons with other state-of-the-art models and datasets, limiting the validation of the model's performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization of the paper to ensure that all sections are closely linked and clearly defined. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with other state-of-the-art models such as RocketQAv2, LED, and Unifier, as well as conducting experiments on the MSMARCO, TREC DL 2019, and TREC DL 2020 datasets. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide a more detailed explanation of the assumption in section 3.1 and to clarify the definition of a simple negative sample. Lastly, we advise refining the definition of perplexity to align with established standards in the language modeling field.
