Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a principled Adversarial InfoNCE loss (AdvInfoNCE) aimed at enhancing the generalization ability of top-K recommendation models in collaborative filtering (CF). The authors identify challenges in existing contrastive learning methods, such as the treatment of unobserved user-item pairs and the lack of tailored inductive bias. The AdvInfoNCE loss adaptively assigns hardness to negative instances, providing theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence of its effectiveness across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation for adaptively assigning hardness to negative instances is well-justified and enhances generalization ability.
2. The theoretical framework demonstrates the relationship between hardness scores and out-of-distribution challenges, contributing to the understanding of generalization in recommenders.
3. Comprehensive experiments on unbiased and out-of-distribution datasets validate the proposed method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks intuitive examples to illustrate the adaptive learning process for hard negatives and false negatives.
2. There is insufficient baseline comparison with methods focused on mining hard negatives or false negatives.
3. The discussion on out-of-distribution generalization could benefit from additional baseline comparisons, particularly regarding the differences between OOD experiments and debiasing scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the adaptive learning process by including an intuitive example that illustrates the handling of hard negatives and false negatives. Additionally, the authors should consider incorporating baselines that specifically focus on mining hard negatives or false negatives to strengthen their claims. Furthermore, we suggest adding more baselines that address out-of-distribution generalization to enhance the robustness of their findings. Lastly, clarifying the role of the adversarial variables and addressing the terminology around "hard negatives" would improve the paper's overall readability and precision.
