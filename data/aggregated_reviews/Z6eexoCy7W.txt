Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework that employs a probabilistic approach to extract structure-wise uncertainty estimates in segmentation tasks, extending discrete Morse theory (DMT) to model structures as samples from probability distributions. The method captures both intra-structural and inter-structural uncertainties using a regression network and a Graph Neural Network (GNN), generating a structure-wise uncertainty heatmap that enhances segmentation quality. The authors validate their method across multiple datasets, demonstrating its backbone-agnostic capabilities and significant implications for medical image analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method shows versatility by applying to various segmentation network backbones and datasets, improving segmentation quality and producing high-fidelity uncertainty maps.
- The introduction of a probabilistic DMT and GNN for inter-structural uncertainty is a notable advancement in the field.
- The ability to quantify structure-wise uncertainty has significant implications for medical applications, potentially enhancing decision-making processes.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset sizes are small, with the DRIVE dataset containing 40 images, ROSE 39 images, and PARSE 100 volumes; larger datasets are needed for thorough evaluation.
- The paper lacks a detailed discussion on hyperparameters, including their influence on performance and the determination of optimal values.
- The technical contribution appears marginally based on prior work, necessitating clearer distinctions and insights.
- The title may overstate the contribution; a more suitable title could be "Topology-Aware Uncertainty for Curvilinear Object Segmentation."
- The paper does not evaluate results using popular topology-related metrics, such as Betti number errors, which would enhance the experimentation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset size by incorporating larger datasets for evaluation. Additionally, a more comprehensive discussion of hyperparameters, including their impact on performance and the rationale for optimal values, should be included. Clarifying the distinctions between this work and prior contributions will strengthen the paper's technical foundation. We also suggest evaluating the method against topology-related metrics, such as Betti number errors, to enhance interpretability. Lastly, consider revising the title to better reflect the contributions of the work.
