### Key Points
This paper presents a novel objective for training flow matching models without pre-specifying a probability path, parameterizing both the forward and reverse paths. The authors propose the DFM method, which is theoretically grounded and shows consistent improved performance in empirical experiments compared to baseline methods. The writing is clear, with well-organized related works, making the paper easy to follow.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- Strong theoretical foundation with a clear mathematical introduction.  
- The novel objective function enforcing bijectivity is straightforward.  
- Empirical evidence demonstrates improved performance of DFM.  
- Clear writing and organization enhance readability.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper is solid for the extended abstract track but lacks significant weaknesses.  
- Parameterizing both paths introduces computational overhead.  
- Uncertainty exists regarding performance in complex cases, such as high-dimensional generative modeling tasks.  
- The learned probability paths and the advantages of using cosine distance over L2 distance require further clarification.  
- Reproducibility and fairness of comparisons could be improved with additional experimental settings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by providing visualizations of the flow in an appendix. Additionally, a more detailed discussion on the advantages of cosine distance versus L2 distance should be included. To enhance reproducibility, the authors should present more experimental settings, such as comparing DFM with baselines using the L2 metric. Finally, exploring more datasets could help ensure the method's generality and increase its significance.
