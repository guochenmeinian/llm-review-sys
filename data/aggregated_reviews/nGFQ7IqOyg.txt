### Key Points
This paper presents a method for math word problem-solving that utilizes a goal-driven approach, decoding an expression tree layer by layer from the root to the leaf nodes. It enhances this method by predicting all child nodes in parallel and employing cross-attention to ensure that these predictions are inter-aware. Additionally, the authors introduce a partial-tree evaluation metric to assess the capabilities of an MWP solver. Experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is both interesting and sound, effectively integrating goal-driving, MTree representation, and cross-attention techniques.
- The evaluation methods introduced are more fine-grained than traditional expression and result accuracy metrics.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity on the order of predictions in sub-goals, which is crucial for outcomes.
- Performance evaluations on other datasets (e.g., Math, SVAMP, ASDIV) are missing, and comparisons with LLMs are not provided.
- Qualitative analysis of the unified tree structure is insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding the order of predictions in sub-goals, particularly in Figure 2. Additionally, the authors should include performance evaluations on publicly challenging MWP datasets and provide comparisons with LLMs. A more thorough qualitative analysis of the unified tree structure, including visualizations, would also enhance the paper. Furthermore, we suggest revising Sections 3.3 and 3.4 for better clarity and coherence, and addressing the unclear details regarding the special token Nb and the implications of the proposed IoU formula in distinguishing paths with duplicated numbers.
