### Key Points
This paper investigates "symbiotic bias" in A/B testing for recommendation systems and proposes three experimental designs—cluster-randomized, data-diverted, and user-corpus co-diverted experiments—to mitigate this bias. The authors identify the impact of symbiotic bias on Total Treatment Effect (TTE) estimates, violating the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA). The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated through theoretical modeling, simulations, and validation with real-world data. However, the level of innovation remains somewhat unclear, and the models and experiments require further refinement.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The identification and analysis of symbiosis bias address a significant issue in A/B testing.
- The introduction of three experimental methods expands the toolkit for practitioners.
- The combination of theoretical insights with empirical validation strengthens the study's conclusions.

Weaknesses:
- The computational and operational feasibility of the proposed designs in large-scale settings is underexplored.
- Limited guidance is provided on mitigating trade-offs, such as reduced training data.
- Certain theoretical assumptions may oversimplify real-world complexities, limiting applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical comparison of the cluster randomized design with existing methods to clarify its advantages and disadvantages. Additionally, the authors should provide experiments on real-world data for the data-diversion and user-corpus co-diversion designs to enhance validation. Clarifying the technical details regarding experimental parameters and the robustness of key choices would improve reproducibility. Finally, we suggest that the authors analyze the sensitivity of bias to network weights and cluster quality more deeply to strengthen the applicability of their conclusions.
