Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new metric, Task Attribute Distance (TAD), designed to quantify the link between training and novel tasks in few-shot learning (FSL). TAD is based on pre-defined attributes and calculates the distance between tasks using a bipartite matching approach. The authors provide theoretical results linking TAD to generalization error and empirical evaluations demonstrating its correlation with model performance across datasets. The paper also discusses a method for automatically generating attributes using a pretrained CLIP model.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- *Originality:* The metric is novel, measuring task difficulty through attributes rather than model outputs.
- *Quality:* Claims are well-supported, with theoretical proofs linking TAD to generalization bounds and empirical results showing performance correlation.
- *Clarity:* The writing is clear and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The analysis of automatically obtained attributes lacks significance and quality evaluation, with unclear correlations in some datasets.
- The metric's reliance on attributes, which may not always be available, limits its impact.
- The paper does not adequately demonstrate practical applications of TAD beyond performance correlation, and the last experiment on training with fewer tasks is not convincingly representative.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation of the quality of automatically obtained attributes, particularly for mini-Imagenet, and provide more qualitative examples. Additionally, we suggest including preliminary results demonstrating potential applications of TAD to assess its significance. Clarifying how TAD can inform expectations in few-shot learning settings would enhance its impact. Finally, addressing the limitations of the metric's reliance on attributes and exploring learnable attribute representations could strengthen the work.
