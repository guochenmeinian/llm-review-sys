Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on offline imitation learning (IL) using supplementary data, addressing the challenges posed by imperfect datasets. The authors analyze the performance gap between expert and learner policies in behavior cloning (BC) and propose a novel method, Importance-sampling weighted BC (ISW-BC), which utilizes importance sampling to correct for non-expert data. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that ISW-BC can mitigate the imitation gap associated with traditional BC methods. Empirical results indicate that ISW-BC outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across various environments, including MuJoCo and Atari.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper provides a clear and systematic theoretical analysis of offline IL, effectively bridging theory and practice.
2. ISW-BC is a simple yet effective method that addresses distribution shift issues, validated through robust empirical results.
3. The writing is accessible, with complex theoretical results summarized well, enhancing reader comprehension.

Weaknesses:
1. ISW-BC may lack robustness in stochastic environments, as illustrated by a specific tabular MDP example where the method struggles with non-expert states.
2. The justification for using importance sampling with imperfect data relies heavily on theoretical analysis, which may seem unintuitive compared to empirical observations.
3. Minor issues include inconsistent color usage in figures and a lack of discussion on alternative methods for learning from imperfect data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors address the non-robustness of ISW-BC in stochastic environments by providing a more detailed discussion in the limitations section.
2. The authors should clarify the relationship between ISW-BC and reward-weighted regression (RWR) in the paper, as this connection could enhance understanding.
3. We encourage the authors to open-source their code and datasets to facilitate replication and further exploration of their contributions.
4. It would be beneficial for the authors to discuss recent theoretical advances in offline IL, such as MAHALO and ReCOIL, in the related work section to provide a broader context.
