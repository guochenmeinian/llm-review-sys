Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a non-asymptotic bound (Theorem 3.3) on the test error of random feature ridge regression (RFRR) using dimension-free deterministic equivalents, derived under a concentration assumption (Assumption 3.1). The authors recover results on kernel ridge regression (KRR) and establish the decay rate of the neural scaling law (Corollary 4.1). The work improves upon previous literature by providing non-asymptotic bounds and a novel phase diagram (Figure 2) that offers insights into RFRR's test error.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper rigorously addresses an important problem in random features regression, with Theorem 3.3 being of independent interest.
- It generalizes and refines previous results into a single deterministic equivalent, revealing interesting conclusions about the minimal number of features needed for optimal performance.
- The authors provide empirical simulations that support their theoretical findings, enhancing the generality of the results.

Weaknesses:
- The significance of the theoretical contribution is questioned, as it appears to extend previous work with similar techniques. 
- The reliance on the strong concentration Assumption 3.1 limits the applicability of the results, and a relaxation of this assumption would enhance the paper's impact.
- The paper's format is dense and may be better suited for a journal rather than a conference, as it lacks key details and proofs that are spread across 50 pages.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding Assumption 3.1 by providing detailed examples of its applicability. Additionally, clarifying the notations and conditions in Theorem 3.3 would enhance reader comprehension. The authors should also consider revising the paper's structure to include key proofs or outlines within the main text, making it more accessible for conference reviewers. Lastly, addressing the potential typos and ensuring a consistent bibliography format will improve the overall presentation.
