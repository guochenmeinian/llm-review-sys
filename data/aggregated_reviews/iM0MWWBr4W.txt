Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for interactive estimation, where a learner queries an oracle to receive stochastic feedback indicating the similarity between the query and an unknown target. The authors introduce the concept of "dissimilarity dimension," a combinatorial measure that captures learnability within this model. They demonstrate that the dissimilarity dimension implies learnability and propose an algorithm based on the least-squares method that achieves sublinear regret when the dissimilarity dimension is finite. The framework connects to established models, including SQ learning and structured bandits, and provides tighter regret bounds compared to existing dimensions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The contributions are novel and relevant, particularly the introduction of the dissimilarity dimension, which offers a more localized perspective than the eluder dimension. The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of key ideas and connections to existing frameworks. The results tighten existing bounds in specific bandit settings and provide an algorithmic template that can be instantiated with various existing algorithms.

Weaknesses:  
A primary concern is the reliance on the decaying estimation assumption for Algorithm 1, which may limit the generality of the results. The unification of different learning settings under the proposed framework feels somewhat forced, particularly regarding the definition of the dissimilarity measure. Additionally, the presentation could be improved, as some sections are abstract and difficult to follow.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion around the decaying estimation assumption and explore potential relaxations or connections to the boundedness of the dissimilarity dimension. Clarifying the computational complexity of the proposed algorithms, particularly regarding conditions for the similarity measure $\rho$, would enhance the paper. We also suggest providing more practical examples and empirical experiments to validate the framework's universality and improve the overall clarity of the writing, especially in the introduction and algorithm sections.
