### Key Points
This paper presents OpenMathInstruct, a high-quality math instruction-tuning dataset containing 1.8 million problem-solution pairs, generated using the Mixtral model. The authors propose a code-augmented math instruction generation process that effectively pairs problems from MATH and GSM8K with diverse solutions, achieving a high coverage rate. Experimental results indicate that models fine-tuned on this dataset show significant improvements in math problem-solving tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors designed a cost-effective math code instruction generation process using an open-source model.
- The masking of text to prevent shortcut generation in code is both reasonable and novel.
- The dataset achieves a high coverage rate on MATH and GSM8K, with promising experimental results.

Weaknesses:
- There is a lack of detailed analysis on model behavior post-fine-tuning, particularly through case studies.
- The static finetuning prompt template may lead to prompt sensitivity in real-world applications.
- The generated dataset exhibits inconsistencies in performance across different models, suggesting superficial learning rather than deeper mathematical understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis by including case studies on the generated code before and after text masking, as well as on model behavior after fine-tuning on the proposed dataset. Additionally, we suggest conducting a more comprehensive ablation study to provide insights into the factors contributing to performance changes. Lastly, exploring the extension of their methods to other tasks or domains beyond mathematical reasoning could be a valuable direction for future work.
