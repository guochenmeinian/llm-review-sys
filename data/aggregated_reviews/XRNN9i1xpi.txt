Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CITRUS, a novel model utilizing Tensorial Partial Differential Equations (TPDEG) for multidomain data, specifically targeting spatiotemporal forecasting tasks. The authors analyze the stability and over-smoothing of the proposed model theoretically and experimentally, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods. The paper also discusses the advantages of using a separable continuous heat graph kernel in the context of Cartesian product graphs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a thorough theoretical analysis and detailed experiments.
- The proposed methods show improvements in prediction accuracy over existing techniques, backed by solid theoretical support.
- The evaluation includes a diverse set of baselines, and an ablation study is provided.

Weaknesses:
- The analysis of over-smoothing is problematic, particularly regarding the definition of the normalized product Laplacian, which may not accurately represent the smoothness on the product graph.
- The advantages of using a separable graph filter are not clearly articulated, and the relationship between separability and computational efficiency remains ambiguous.
- The notation used in the paper is inconsistent and can hinder comprehension, particularly in mathematical expressions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the over-smoothing analysis by revising the definition of the normalized product Laplacian and ensuring that the implications of Theorem 3.9 are clearly stated. Additionally, the authors should explicitly outline the advantages of the separable graph filter and clarify how it enhances computational efficiency. We also suggest providing comprehensive details on hyperparameters, including their ranges, to facilitate understanding of the computational efficiency. Lastly, we encourage the authors to refine the notation used throughout the paper for better readability.
