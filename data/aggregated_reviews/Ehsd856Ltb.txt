Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel tokenization method for DNA sequence foundation models, focusing on k-mer profiles for metagenomic binning. The authors claim their model demonstrates comparable performance to larger foundation models while exhibiting better scalability. The theoretical framework is grounded in empirical validation, providing insights into DNA fragment identifiability and computational efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Theoretical contributions enhance understanding of k-mer tokenization and provide valuable insights for future research.
- The model's scalability and computational efficiency address practical needs in genomic research, particularly in resource-limited contexts.
- Extensive empirical validation supports the theoretical claims, demonstrating comparable performance to state-of-the-art genome foundation models.

Weaknesses:
- The comparison of k-mer profiles against DNA language models is misleading; a more appropriate comparison would involve different tokenization strategies.
- The experimental setup lacks clarity, particularly regarding the integration of DNA foundation models, raising concerns about potential unfair comparisons.
- Several minor technical issues, such as unclear definitions and missing labels, could hinder understanding and reproducibility.
- Limited comparisons with existing methods and insufficient experimental results restrict the demonstration of k-mer effectiveness across various tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their experimental setup, ensuring that the integration of DNA foundation models is well-documented to avoid potential biases. Additionally, it would be beneficial to compare their method against other tokenization strategies, such as BPE, to provide a more comprehensive evaluation. We suggest including more diverse datasets in their experiments to strengthen the validation of their approach. Furthermore, addressing the minor technical issues, such as clarifying the loss function and providing labels for equations, will enhance the manuscript's clarity. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore scaling their method to larger models, which could yield significant insights into the capabilities of k-mer tokenization.
