Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) in linear Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), focusing on whether hybrid RL can surpass existing lower bounds established in purely offline and online settings without relying on the single-policy concentrability assumption. The authors propose computationally efficient algorithms that achieve improved error and regret bounds in both offline and online contexts. Specifically, they introduce two algorithms: an online-to-offline method that employs reward-agnostic online exploration followed by a pessimistic offline algorithm, and an offline-to-online approach that utilizes offline data to initialize an online algorithm. The authors demonstrate that both algorithms enhance sample complexity within the PAC framework and regret analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized, with a thorough literature review and clear problem formulation.
- The proposed methods improve upon previous hybrid RL approaches for linear MDPs, achieving no worse than optimal sample complexity.
- The theoretical results are sound, and the presentation is generally clear.

Weaknesses:
- The main technical novelties are not sufficiently highlighted, making it unclear what specific challenges are addressed.
- Algorithm 2 has a large minimum requirement for the offline dataset size, and its assumptions may impose constraints.
- There is a lack of experimental validation or code to assess the practical efficiency of the proposed algorithms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the main technical novelties and challenges in the paper, explicitly distinguishing their contributions from existing works. Additionally, it would be beneficial to discuss how Algorithm 1 compares with Algorithm 2 beyond their methodological differences. We suggest including an experimental plan to verify the algorithms' efficiency, as this would enhance the practical applicability of the theoretical results. Lastly, consider addressing the assumptions related to Full Rank Projected Covariates and clarifying the implications of the coverage terms in the context of the proposed algorithms.
