Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents GDABench, a comprehensive benchmark for Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA), which evaluates 16 state-of-the-art UGDA models across five diverse datasets, resulting in 74 adaptation tasks. The authors propose a standardized evaluation framework and introduce PyGDA, a library that facilitates training and evaluating UGDA methods, promoting reproducibility and standardized comparisons. The benchmark addresses significant real-world challenges, such as distribution shifts in node attributes, graph structures, and label proportions. Additionally, the authors provide a rebuttal to reviewer feedback, emphasizing their commitment to addressing concerns and improving the manuscript while expressing gratitude for the reviewers' time and effort.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. GDABench provides a thorough evaluation of UGDA models across multiple scenarios, essential for understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches.
2. The benchmark's focus on real-world challenges ensures its relevance and applicability to practical problems in UGDA.
3. The standardized evaluation procedures and the publicly available PyGDA library enhance transparency, reproducibility, and ease of use for researchers.
4. The authors demonstrate a proactive approach by requesting prompt feedback from reviewers, fostering a collaborative atmosphere.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper primarily focuses on homophily graphs, neglecting the discussion of heterophily graphs, which could provide a more comprehensive understanding of GNN design.
2. The feature shift, a significant source of domain gap, is questioned, particularly regarding the use of LLM as a feature encoder in text-attributed graphs.
3. While the paper discusses various distribution shifts, it lacks a clear evaluation method for these shifts, which is crucial for the community.
4. The requirement for the same label space in domain adaptation is a core limitation, and further discussion on practical applications of UGDA is warranted.
5. The categorization of UGDA scenarios could be expanded to include multi-domain and source-free UGDA discussions.
6. The urgency conveyed in the rebuttal may suggest a lack of thoroughness in addressing prior feedback, and the repeated requests for review may come across as overly reliant on the reviewers' input.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on heterophily graphs to complement their focus on homophily graphs. Additionally, the authors should consider conducting experiments with LLM embeddings or provide original text data for further investigation to address the feature shift concerns. It is also essential to include a clear evaluation method for the various distribution shifts discussed. We encourage the authors to explore the implications of different label spaces in UGDA and to expand their discussion on related UGDA scenarios, including multi-domain and source-free adaptations. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors improve the clarity of their responses in the rebuttal to ensure that all reviewer concerns are adequately addressed and consider reducing the frequency of requests for feedback to maintain a balance between urgency and thoroughness.
