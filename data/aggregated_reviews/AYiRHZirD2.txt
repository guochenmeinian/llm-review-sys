Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel cascaded hybrid optimization approach named VFL-CFOZO for Vertical Federated Learning (VFL), integrating zeroth-order (ZO) and first-order (FO) gradient optimization techniques. The critical output layer employs ZO gradients, while other layers utilize FO gradients, enhancing convergence while ensuring privacy protection. Experimental results indicate that VFL-CZOFO achieves comparable utility to the Gaussian Mechanism in differential privacy (DP) preservation while significantly reducing communication costs compared to existing frameworks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research introduces a novel idea with strong motivation, focusing on privacy in transmitted parameters and efficiency in other layers to achieve load balancing.
- Comprehensive analysis and proofs are provided, including clear demonstrations of DP privacy and sufficient convergence proofs.
- The method shows significant improvements in communication efficiency and training effectiveness, validated through extensive experiments.

Weaknesses:
- The scalability of the approach is limited, as experiments are conducted with only two clients, which is insufficient to evaluate performance in larger client scenarios.
- There is a potential risk associated with offline clients due to the need for high synchronization between the server and clients, suggesting that renegotiating the random seed may be necessary.
- Minor inconsistencies exist in the presentation, such as mislabeling symbols and inconsistent terminology throughout the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve scalability by conducting experiments with varying numbers of clients to better assess the performance of VFL-CZOFO in larger federated learning systems. Additionally, addressing the synchronization issue for offline clients by exploring renegotiation of the random seed could enhance robustness. We also suggest correcting minor mistakes in the presentation, such as the mislabeling of symbols and ensuring consistent terminology throughout the manuscript. Furthermore, providing a clearer analysis of the contribution of compression methods to the overall communication cost reduction would strengthen the paper.
