Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a deep learning-based method for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging reconstruction from under-scanning measurements (USM). The authors propose an end-to-end architecture comprising two main components: the transient recovery network (TRN) for feature extraction and high-resolution measurement production, and the volume reconstruction network (VRN) for hidden volume reconstruction and intensity image generation. The method demonstrates superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative aspects, achieving fast inference times compared to existing solutions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper significantly advances real-time NLOS imaging through a fast, end-to-end reconstruction algorithm.
2. Comprehensive ablation studies effectively quantify contributions of various components, including regularization loss terms.
3. Fair comparisons with baseline methods, including reimplementation for GPU acceleration, enhance credibility.
4. Clear writing and methodical explanation of results contribute to overall presentation quality.

Weaknesses:
1. The machine learning contribution is limited, lacking novel insights into the problem's nature, such as compressive sensing aspects.
2. Key modules are heavily based on existing work, raising questions about the originality of the proposed architecture.
3. The volume refinement module lacks clarity, and the loss function's complexity may affect generalizability.
4. The paper does not adequately address noise modeling or the tradeoff between sampling number and noise levels.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their contributions by exploring deeper insights into the compressive sensing aspects of their method. Additionally, clarifying the details of the volume refinement module and addressing the noise modeling in their experiments would strengthen the paper. Conducting further experiments on diverse datasets to demonstrate the model's generalizability is essential. Lastly, we suggest discussing the tradeoff between sampling grid and noise levels more thoroughly, as this could provide valuable insights into the method's performance under varying conditions.
