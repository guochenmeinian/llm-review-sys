Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) and introduces a primal-dual natural policy gradient algorithm that achieves an \(O(\epsilon^{-3})\) sample complexity. The authors claim that their algorithm yields an optimal policy with at most \(\epsilon\) constraint violations, improving upon the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) of \(O(\epsilon^{-4})\). The paper emphasizes the use of Fisher non-degenerate policies and discusses the implications of sample complexity in the context of relaxed feasibility.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
* The paper is the first to derive the \(O(\epsilon^{-3})\) sample complexity for CMDPs under a broader policy parameterization than the softmax.  
* The theoretical results are presented clearly, with a comprehensive proof flow in the main body.  
* The incorporation of momentum acceleration into the primal-dual algorithm is an interesting approach.  
* The improvement from \(O(\epsilon^{-4})\) to \(O(\epsilon^{-3})\) is a notable contribution, supported by a clever observation in lemma 3.  

Weaknesses:  
* The claim of achieving \(\epsilon\) global optimality and \(\epsilon\) constraint violation is misleading, as the actual bounds include constant terms involving \(\epsilon_{bias}\).  
* The sample complexity analysis lacks explicit mention of the Slater's constant \(c_{slater}\), which is crucial in CMDPs and should be incorporated into the big O-notations.  
* The paper does not adequately address the dependency of sample complexity on the discount factor \(\gamma\), which complicates comparisons with prior work.  
* The title's use of "sample efficient" may overstate the contribution, given the existing gap between the sample complexity of this work and the theoretical lower bound.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their claims regarding optimality and constraint violations by explicitly acknowledging the role of \(\epsilon_{bias}\) in their results. Additionally, we suggest that the authors incorporate the Slater's constant \(c_{slater}\) into their sample complexity analysis to reflect its impact accurately. This inclusion should be made visible in the main text rather than relegated to the appendix. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to update Table 1 to include the dependency on \(\gamma\) and provide justifications for the comparative performance of their algorithm relative to prior works. Lastly, we advise revising the title to avoid potential overclaims regarding sample efficiency.
