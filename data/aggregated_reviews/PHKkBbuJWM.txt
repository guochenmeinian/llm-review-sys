Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SLDG, a framework designed to address domain shifts in clinical event data through an innovative self-learning approach. The authors propose a two-step process: first, an unsupervised latent-domain clustering that utilizes the Silhouette score for optimal clustering, followed by the training of individual classifiers for each cluster. The final prediction is a weighted combination of predictions from these classifiers. The authors demonstrate that reinitializing clusters periodically allows their method to outperform existing domain adaptation techniques. Additionally, the paper introduces a clinical predictive model aimed at generalizability against domain shifts, utilizing only the first 12 hours post-ICU admission to enhance early clinical intervention. The authors justify their feature selection based on existing studies, asserting that their method can adapt to various real-world requirements.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is clearly communicated, providing a solid understanding of the underlying problem and demonstrating significant performance improvements over baseline methods, particularly in readmission prediction on eICU data.
- The proposed self-supervised clustering of latent features is unique and well-explained, with ablation studies showing the benefits of hierarchical clustering over traditional methods.
- The inclusion of detailed pseudocode enhances the understanding of the SLDG algorithm, making it accessible for implementation by other researchers.
- The authors have made significant revisions based on reviewer feedback, including additional metrics, comparisons with recent methods, and a detailed analysis of computational complexity.
- The inclusion of broader applications of SLDG on chest X-ray classification tasks demonstrates the model's versatility.

Weaknesses:
- The use of customized classifiers for each domain is inefficient for scaling to new domains, especially with varying latent dimensions, and lacks ablation studies on classifier size.
- The motivation behind the formulation of prototypical vectors is unclear, particularly regarding the averaging of predictions from all latent domains, which may introduce noise.
- The paper does not adequately compare the proposed method to baseline methods in terms of parameter counts and lacks clarity on the size of the transformer architecture relative to other approaches.
- Central concerns regarding the usability of the approach in applied domains remain unaddressed, particularly regarding the rationale for using data only up to 12 hours post-admission and the exclusion of certain tables like "Care Plans" and "Labs."
- The justification for design choices, such as the event sequence length and the robustness of the method against different settings, requires further clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the prototypical vector formulation and provide a rationale for averaging predictions across latent domains. Additionally, we suggest including a detailed analysis of parameter counts and computational complexity to contextualize the proposed method against baseline approaches. We also recommend improving the justification for using data only up to 12 hours post-ICU admission, particularly in relation to readmission prediction. Furthermore, we suggest providing a clearer rationale for the exclusion of "Care Plans" and "Labs" tables, as well as addressing the implications of these choices on out-of-distribution evaluation. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore the robustness of their method against various design choices and settings to strengthen their contributions and enhance the paper's impact.
