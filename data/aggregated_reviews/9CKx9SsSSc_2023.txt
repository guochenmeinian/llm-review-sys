Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ADGym, a design platform for deep anomaly detection (AD) methods, aimed at evaluating the impact of various design choices, such as loss functions and network architectures, on anomaly detection performance. The authors propose a meta-learning-based automatic model selection approach that consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across multiple large benchmark datasets. The paper emphasizes the significance of fine-grained analysis of design components and acknowledges the limitations of traditional machine learning methods. ADGym is designed to decouple and evaluate different AD design choices across 29 real-world datasets categorized into 14 domains, highlighting that no single design choice is universally superior. The authors also discuss the importance of weak supervision in AD and introduce meta-predictors that predict model performance based on learned embeddings and dataset meta-features, aiming to enhance efficiency in model selection.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel design platform for deep anomaly detection, facilitating a better understanding of the contributions of different design choices.
- Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed meta-predictor, demonstrating significant performance improvements over SOTA methods.
- The inclusion of diverse datasets and comprehensive evaluation across multiple domains enhances the practical relevance of the findings.
- The introduction of meta-predictors for model performance prediction is innovative and potentially improves efficiency in model selection.
- The authors have made significant revisions based on reviewer feedback, enhancing clarity and addressing inconsistencies in the text.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a discussion of various applications of anomaly detection, which may require different design choices, and the practical implications of design choices in various scenarios are not thoroughly explored.
- The significance of ADGym compared to hyper-parameter search (HPS) and neural architecture search (NAS) is not clearly articulated, necessitating a more robust comparison to establish its uniqueness.
- The focus on weakly-supervised scenarios limits the exploration of traditional unsupervised methods, which are not adequately represented.
- The clarity of certain technical aspects, such as the meta-predictor's role and the experimental settings, needs improvement, and some sections feel disjointed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the applicability of ADGym across different anomaly detection applications, addressing how design choices may vary by domain. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the relationship between ADGym and existing HPS/NAS frameworks, particularly regarding the integration of data handling stages. The authors should also provide a more detailed analysis of the meta-predictor's performance, including its trade-offs, and ensure that the experimental settings are clearly documented. Furthermore, addressing the unclear aspects of the meta-predictor's usage and the rationale behind dataset selection criteria would enhance the paper's clarity and comprehensiveness. We also recommend incorporating traditional machine learning models, particularly tree ensembles, to provide a more balanced perspective on AD methods. Lastly, we encourage the authors to further refine the writing for clarity and coherence, ensuring that the motivation and significance of ADGym are consistently conveyed throughout the paper.
