Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a risk control framework for early-exit neural networks (EENNs) aimed at balancing inference efficiency and model performance. The authors propose a method to determine exit points based on risk control, rather than manually setting confidence thresholds. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments across various tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, language modeling, and image generation. The authors also introduce risk functions to quantify performance drops due to early exits.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of risk control into EENNs is novel and addresses an important challenge in deploying early-exiting models.
- Extensive empirical validation across multiple domains supports the practical applicability of the proposed methods.
- The risk control framework is well-developed, providing both theoretical foundations and practical algorithms for determining exit thresholds.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on a single exiting threshold for all exits may hinder overall performance and does not account for the variability in predictive accuracy across different exits.
- The empirical validation is limited to specific vision and language tasks, and the paper lacks a discussion on the limitations or potential drawbacks of the proposed approach.
- The current x-axis labeling of "risk level" in accuracy-FLOPs curves may not be sufficiently clear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the applicability of the proposed approach to multi-exit models with varying thresholds, as this could enhance the exploration of the search space. Additionally, we suggest including more evaluation metrics, such as test accuracy for classification tasks and IOU for segmentation tasks, to better demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. It would also be beneficial to quantify the inefficiency imposed by using a static threshold and to discuss potential trade-offs or challenges in implementing the risk control framework in practice.
