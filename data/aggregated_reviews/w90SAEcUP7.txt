### Key Points
This paper presents a method called the Metaball Variational Autoencoder (MetaballVAE) for generating realistic 3D soil particle morphologies. The authors propose leveraging deep neural networks to generate 3D particles while preserving essential morphological features. The paper also discusses the potential applications of this model in various scientific problems, including molecule generation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The Metaball Variational Autoencoder has the potential for significant applications in real science problems, such as molecule generation.  
- The style-learner module offers promising insights into the research.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks a concise yet detailed explanation of the methodology.  
- There is insufficient detail regarding shape control through an arithmetic pattern and its implications for generating particles with specific shapes.  
- The practical relevance of simulating a large number of soil particles with varying shapes and behaviors is not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of how the Metaball Variational Autoencoder works, providing a concise but detailed overview of the methodology. Additionally, the authors need to elaborate on the details of shape control through an arithmetic pattern and clarify how this enables the generation of particles with specific shapes. Finally, we suggest that the authors discuss how simulating a large number of soil particles with varying shapes and behaviors can enhance our understanding of soil properties and behaviors.
