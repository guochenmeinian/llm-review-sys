### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of the generalization gap in refusal training for LLMs by reformulating queries in the past tense. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for jailbreaking LLMs, revealing limitations in current alignment techniques, including SFT, RLHF, and adversarial training when addressing harmful requests in the past tense. The authors also propose mitigation strategies through fine-tuning, highlighting gaps in current data curation strategies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper is easy to follow and well-organized.  
2. It provides a solid analysis of vulnerabilities in LLM safety mechanisms with past tense examples.  
3. The experiments are extensive across various harmful categories and LLMs.  
4. The idea of using past tense to jailbreak LLM models shows a significant success rate increase, exemplified by a change from 1% to 88% for GPT4-o.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The description of the approach from lines 144-157 lacks clarity and needs to be better defined. The authors should explain the motivation for using multiple attempts and temperature settings, and further elaborate on the claim of universality and transferability across multiple LLMs.  
2. There is insufficient depth in exploring why past tense reformulations are effective, necessitating a more robust theoretical explanation.  
3. The authors should be cautious with past tense reformulations, as they may introduce additional elements into the query. Conducting ablation studies would help identify the impact of different components in the past tense examples.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the approach described in lines 144-157 by providing a more detailed explanation of the motivation for using multiple attempts and temperature settings. Additionally, we suggest that the authors elaborate on the universality and transferability claims across multiple LLMs. To enhance the theoretical foundation, we encourage the authors to explore the reasons behind the effectiveness of past tense reformulations in greater depth. Finally, we advise the authors to conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of different components introduced by the past tense reformulations.
