Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a hybrid search method, referred to as HIPS-\epsilon, that integrates high-level planning with low-level search to ensure completeness in solving planning tasks. The authors argue that this approach balances the efficiency of learning-based algorithms with the completeness of traditional methods. Additionally, the paper introduces a novel approach termed Complete Subgoal Search (CSS/CSubS), which also integrates high-level search with low-level actions to enhance completeness and performance in planning tasks. The authors aim to clarify the relationship of their work to existing algorithms, particularly in the context of hierarchical planning. The method was evaluated across four tasks, demonstrating promising performance metrics, including success rates and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization properties. The authors acknowledge the need for a more rigorous experimental setup and a clearer literature review to better position their contributions within the field of learning-based planning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and presents a clear motivation for the proposed methods.
2. The introduction effectively formulates the problem and references relevant works in the field.
3. The evaluation is broad, covering success rates, hyperparameter analysis, and OOD generalization, with insightful figures.
4. The proposed methods demonstrate significant improvements in search performance and completeness.
5. The authors are receptive to feedback and willing to refine their work based on reviewer suggestions.
6. The integration of low-level actions with high-level search is a promising advancement in hierarchical planning.

Weaknesses:
1. The term "hybrid search" may not accurately represent the algorithm, as it has been overused in the literature.
2. The naming of the algorithm lacks clarity and elegance, with suggestions for improvement remaining unaddressed.
3. The problem statement lacks formal presentation, making it less accessible to non-experts.
4. The experimental settings may not be sufficiently challenging, as noted by multiple reviewers.
5. There is insufficient testing in larger simulated environments, and the related work section could be better structured to clarify connections to the proposed methods.
6. The related work section requires better organization and clarity to accurately reflect the contributions of the proposed methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the terminology used to describe their algorithm, as "hybrid search" may not be suitable. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the clarity of the algorithm's name, considering alternatives like Complete Subgoal Search with Low-level Actions (CSSLA). Presenting the problem in a formal manner, such as "Problem 1: (xxx) ...", would enhance clarity for a broader audience. Implementing classic algorithms for comparison would strengthen the paper, as it would highlight the quality of solutions generated by the proposed methods. We also suggest enhancing the experimental settings to ensure they are appropriately challenging and relevant. Testing in larger simulated environments is essential, and restructuring the related work section to clarify its relevance to the paper would be beneficial. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the OOD generalization results and provide additional data to support their claims, as well as include an analysis of the distribution of low-level expansions throughout the search process. Lastly, we suggest incorporating the proposed minor change to regain completeness guarantees into the paper, as it aligns well with their experimental findings.
