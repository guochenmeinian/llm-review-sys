Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into few-shot object detection (FSOD) benchmarks in the context of large pre-trained models, proposing a novel evaluation protocol termed Foundational FSOD. The authors highlight the challenges of evaluating few-shot learners, particularly in relation to the proprietary nature of training data for these models. They evaluate several vision-language models using the nuImages dataset and discuss significant performance improvements observed in the CVPR 2024 Foundational FSOD competition.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for exploring FSOD with pre-trained models is both interesting and relevant.
- The experiments are extensive, well-documented, and involve multiple models.
- The paper effectively raises important discussions regarding the evaluation of few-shot performance in the context of large-scale models.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed dataset's specifics are unclear, and the distinction from baseline setups is not well articulated.
- The evaluation pipeline lacks accompanying software or infrastructure, making it challenging for others to replicate the results.
- The writing requires refinement, with insufficient citations and undefined abbreviations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the proposed dataset by providing a structured textual description and an overview image. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the writing quality by including more citations, defining abbreviations, and refining LaTeX usage. It would also be beneficial to provide example code for the evaluation pipeline to facilitate reproducibility. Lastly, we encourage the authors to expand the discussion on the results of the CVPR 2024 competition or consider removing it if it cannot be adequately addressed.
