Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Approximate Nearest Neighbor Q-Learning (ANQ) framework, which aims to enhance explainability in reinforcement learning models. ANQ integrates neural networks for performance with memory-based structures for transparency, addressing the challenges of explainability in reinforcement learning. It employs Sim-Encoder contrastive learning for state representation and evaluates ANQ on MuJoCo continuous control tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in solving continuous tasks. The framework is positioned as suitable for real-world applications, including autonomous driving, quantitative trading, and healthcare.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Novelty: ANQ offers a unique approach by combining neural networks and memory-based structures, enhancing explainability in decision-making.
2. Explainability: The framework's "data is policy" design principle ensures model decisions are interpretable, crucial for real-world applications.
3. Sim-Encoder contrastive learning: This approach improves memory retrieval learning tasks, bolstering both performance and explainability.
4. Evaluations: ANQ's evaluations on MuJoCo tasks indicate it outperforms traditional methods while maintaining explainability.
5. Real-world applications: The potential applicability of ANQ in various domains is highlighted.

Weaknesses:
1. Performance: Despite its interpretability, ANQ's performance lags behind state-of-the-art (SOTA) reinforcement learning algorithms.
2. Lack of real-world case studies: The absence of specific case studies limits the demonstration of ANQ's practical effectiveness.
3. Comparisons: No comparisons with other interpretable reinforcement learning algorithms, such as Neuro-Symbolic Search methods, are provided.
4. Presentation: The clarity of figures, particularly Figure 3, could be improved for better understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the performance of the ANQ framework to align more closely with SOTA RL methods. Additionally, including specific real-world case studies would strengthen the paper's claims regarding ANQ's utility. We suggest making comparisons with other interpretable reinforcement learning algorithms to provide a broader context for ANQ's performance. Furthermore, enhancing the clarity of figures, particularly by enlarging Figure 3 and providing more informative captions, would improve the overall presentation. Lastly, exploring the application of ANQ in discrete action spaces and image-based tasks could broaden its impact and applicability.
