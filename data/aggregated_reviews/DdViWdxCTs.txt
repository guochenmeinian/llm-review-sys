Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for weakly open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (WOVSS) that addresses granularity inconsistency through non-learnable prototypical regularization (NPR). The authors propose using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to provide supervision for group tokens, enhancing segmentation performance characterized by improved compactness and richness. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PGSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The application of explicit supervision for each group token through prototype construction is novel.
- The use of prototypical knowledge to address performance bottlenecks is well-motivated and intriguing.
- Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, surpassing previous works.

Weaknesses:
- The performance of the baseline (GroupViT) significantly drops with different training datasets; the authors should report PGSeg's performance with CC12M+YFCC14M for a fair comparison.
- The impact of not updating prototype P during training on PGSeg's performance is unclear.
- The reliance on the EM algorithm for GMM parameter estimation may complicate training; the authors should clarify the training time cost compared to GroupViT.
- The term "granularity inconsistency" is initially unclear and should be better defined in the abstract or introduction.
- The experimental results lack sufficient explanations, particularly regarding baseline choices and their implications.
- Additional ablation studies are needed to evaluate the benefits of each NPR strategy.
- Figures 2 and 3 contain small text, making them difficult to read.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the term "granularity inconsistency" in the abstract or introduction. Additionally, the authors should provide more detailed explanations in the experimental results section, particularly regarding baseline selections and the implications of the findings. Conducting further ablation studies to assess the impact of each NPR strategy would enhance understanding of their effectiveness. Finally, the authors should ensure that text in figures is legible to facilitate comprehension of the proposed method.
