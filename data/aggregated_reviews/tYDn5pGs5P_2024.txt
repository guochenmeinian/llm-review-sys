### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of bias in large language models (LLMs) across various social domains, including race, gender, health, and religion. The authors conduct a large-scale study involving over 50 LLMs, revealing that even models with strong performance in explicit bias assessments may still exhibit implicit biases, which can increase with model size and complexity. The introduction of the Implicit Association Test (IAT) and decision bias assessment methods offers a novel perspective on bias analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The study provides extensive coverage of over 50 language models, analyzing bias performance across different sizes and ages, contributing valuable data to the field.  
- The introduction of IAT and decision bias assessment methods presents a novel approach to understanding bias in LLMs.  

Weaknesses:  
- The conclusion that newer or larger language models do not automatically exhibit reduced bias is limited to the specific biases studied; other biases, such as position bias and verbosity bias, should also be considered.  
- The inclusion of the self-attention mechanism formula lacks a clear correlation with bias examination, raising questions about its necessity.  
- The variance in experimental results is excessively large, and the number of datasets used is not specified, which may have contributed to significant result deviations.  
- The article does not detail experimental setting parameters, such as temperature, which can influence judgment outcomes in the presence of bias interference.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis by considering intrinsic biases, such as position bias, in addition to societal biases. Clarifying the necessity of including the self-attention mechanism formula and establishing its relevance to bias examination would strengthen the paper. Additionally, specifying the number of datasets used and detailing experimental setting parameters, including temperature, would enhance the robustness of the findings. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide compelling evidence regarding the relationship between synthetic data and bias to solidify the paper's contributions to the field.
