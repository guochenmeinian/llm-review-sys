### Key Points
This paper presents a study on incentivized exploration in two-sided matching markets, an important area with well-motivated objectives. The authors reduce the problem to combinatorial semi-bandits with a unique twist, providing an algorithm and a theorem for its success. They also introduce a technique to expedite exploration.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem addressed is significant, and the paper contributes meaningfully to this field.
- The theoretical problem tackled is non-trivial.

Weaknesses:
- The write-up is sloppy, lacking definitions that must be inferred from context.
- The reasonableness of the fighting chance assumption is unclear; motivating definitions and assumptions would enhance accessibility for non-experts.
- The empirical section is limited, with insufficient depth.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the write-up by providing necessary definitions and context. Additionally, addressing the ambiguity of the fighting chance assumption and motivating definitions would make the paper more approachable for non-experts. We suggest expanding the empirical section by testing the algorithm with larger numbers of agent and arm types, varying user profile dimensionality, and comparing against more baseline methods. Furthermore, we encourage a more detailed discussion of potential real-world applications beyond job markets to broaden the work's impact. Lastly, please correct the assumption in 2.2 to indicate that the "(agent, arm) pair do not have a match" and fix the typo in equation (8) in appendix C.
