Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an empirical study on generative models for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSP), which is well-established in the scheduling community due to its practical applications. The authors propose a self-labeling strategy that generates multiple solutions for each instance, selecting the best as a pseudo-label, and employs a Pointer Network architecture for decision-making. The experimental results demonstrate that their algorithms outperform baseline machine learning methods and classic heuristics on standard benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
The paper is well-motivated, highlighting the limitations of meta-heuristics in terms of computational expense while advocating for the potential of semi-supervised learning in combinatorial optimization. The empirical results indicate superior performance compared to existing methods, and the presentation is clear and well-structured.

Weaknesses:
The authors acknowledge that while their algorithms are effective, they do not match the quality of solutions produced by more computationally intensive techniques like Constraint Programming solvers. Additionally, the motivation for using JSP as a testbed for generative models is questioned, as simpler algorithms already perform well. The self-labeling strategy suffers from low sample utilization, requiring a large number of generated solutions for effective training.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve sample utilization in the self-labeling strategy to enhance training efficiency. Expanding the evaluation to include additional public benchmarks for JSP would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the proposed method. Furthermore, making the source code publicly available on platforms like GitHub would ensure reproducibility of the experimental results. Lastly, we suggest exploring the applicability of their approach to other combinatorial optimization problems, possibly including preliminary studies on variants like Flexible Job Shop Scheduling (FJSP).
