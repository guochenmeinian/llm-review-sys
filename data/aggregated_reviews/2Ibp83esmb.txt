Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Non-isotropic Gaussian Diffusion Model (NGDM) aimed at enhancing image-to-image translation and editing tasks by introducing independent Gaussian noises with varying variances to different pixels. The authors propose a sampling method that utilizes a pre-trained isotropic Gaussian diffusion model to initiate denoising at different times for various pixels, thereby allowing for controlled image manipulation. The effectiveness of the NGDM is demonstrated through experiments on multiple datasets, showing competitive performance against state-of-the-art score-based diffusion models (SBDMs) in terms of FID, SSIM, CLIPScore, and LPIPS metrics. The authors establish a relationship between the total diffusion time \(T_k\) and the noise scaling factor \(\lambda_k\), which is crucial for the effective application of the NGDM, and compare their method against heuristic designs, demonstrating superior performance in preserving background details and achieving desired edits.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The NGDM demonstrates originality by deviating from isotropic diffusion, enabling more controllable image translation and editing.
- The method effectively preserves irrelevant image details while allowing for targeted modifications.
- The paper provides a comprehensive explanation of the methodology and presents convincing experimental results that support the claims of improved performance.
- Empirical results show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments.
- The user study indicates a preference for the proposed method among participants, aligning with the qualitative results.
- The method allows for flexibility by leveraging existing isotropic models without requiring retraining.

Weaknesses:
- The connection between the parameters \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) and the quality of generated images is weakly established.
- The motivation for the choice of the relation between \(T_k\) and \(\lambda_k\) could be clearer, as the current formulation lacks sufficient explanation.
- The qualitative results do not consistently show a significant advantage over existing methods, lacking a "wow" effect.
- The paper does not sufficiently address the computational efficiency or potential limitations of the proposed model.
- A more extensive literature review and comparison with other models would enhance contextual understanding.
- The paper does not provide a strong theoretical foundation for the heuristic designs compared, which may leave some questions unanswered regarding their effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- We recommend that the authors improve the linkage between the parameters \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) and the quality of the generated images to strengthen their claims.
- We suggest improving the clarity of the motivation behind the relationship between \(T_k\) and \(\lambda_k\), providing a more robust theoretical justification.
- We encourage the authors to elaborate on the interpretability of the model, particularly regarding the assignment of noise variances to pixels.
- We recommend discussing potential limitations, including computational costs and conditions under which the model may underperform.
- We advise including a broader range of datasets for validation to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance across different scenarios.
- We suggest further exploration of the heuristic designs to enhance the understanding of their limitations and the advantages of the proposed method.
- We recommend including a user study to evaluate the perceived quality of the generated images, which could clarify the effectiveness of the proposed method.
