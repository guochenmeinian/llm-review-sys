### Key Points
This paper proposes applying Anderson extrapolation, a nonlinear fixed point iteration technique, to accelerate the computation workflow of implicit neural networks, specifically Deep Equilibrium Models. The results demonstrate a significant speedup in these networks while also improving accuracy, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- Accelerating AI applications is a crucial topic, and this paper presents a promising direction.  
- Unlike many deep learning acceleration techniques that involve a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, this method addresses efficiency while also enhancing accuracy.  
- The evaluation, although limited, is concise and effectively demonstrates the advantages of the proposed method.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper is generally well-structured but dense and somewhat difficult to read.  
- The authors should provide some intuition for the gain in accuracy; while it is logical that Anderson extrapolation leads to faster convergence and better efficiency, the source of the accuracy improvement needs clarification.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the readability of the paper by simplifying the presentation of dense content. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide insights into the mechanisms behind the accuracy gains associated with Anderson extrapolation to enhance understanding.
