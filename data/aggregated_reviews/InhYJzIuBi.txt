### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to the Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) task by proposing the ELCoM model, which utilizes a neural coherence framework to mine implicit aspect sentiments. The coherence is assessed at both sentence and document levels through hypergraphs and contrastive learning. The main contributions include: 1) the integration of coherence information for ABSA using contrastive learning and hypergraphs; 2) the introduction of a Cross-Category Enhancement (CCE) module to address anomalous nodes; and 3) comprehensive experiments validating the proposed model's effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The idea of leveraging document-level and sentence-level coherence for implicit sentiment detection is innovative.
- The paper is well-organized and clearly presented, making it easy to follow.
- Extensive experiments demonstrate the model's state-of-the-art performance and provide thorough analysis.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a comparison with recent models from 2023, which is essential for contextualizing the results.
- There is insufficient explanation regarding the choice of XLNET as the representation model, and comparisons with BERT or RoBERTa are not provided.
- The evaluation does not report the number and percentage of aspects with implicit sentiment in each dataset, which would justify the research purpose.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by presenting the number and percentage of aspects with implicit sentiment in each dataset to justify the research purpose. Additionally, the authors should compare the proposed ELCoM model with the most recent models from 2023 and provide results based on BERT or RoBERTa for a fairer comparison. Furthermore, the authors should clarify why ELCoM performs better on implicit sentence accuracy (IAC) than explicit sentence accuracy (EAC) on certain datasets and include aspect-level evaluation in their analysis.
