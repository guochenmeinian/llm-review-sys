### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of token merging in long-form video understanding and proposes a learnable Video Token Merging (VTM) algorithm that selects tokens based on saliency scores. The authors argue that their method, which merges tokens adaptively based on saliency scores, significantly impacts performance and outperforms conventional algorithms in long-video understanding across various datasets. They compare their approach with naive VTM and two heuristic variants—region VTM and motion VTM—demonstrating that learnable VTM predicts saliency scores for tokens, guiding the merging process, and employs an auxiliary network to address the non-differentiability of the partition operation. The evaluation on LVU, Breakfast, and COIN datasets shows that learnable VTM outperforms several baselines in most tasks while maintaining low GPU memory usage. Additionally, the authors provide a clear comparison of throughput metrics, noting that while training time is affected by multiple factors, the total training time does not double, and they differentiate their work from token reduction methods, asserting that their focus on token merging is crucial for long-form video understanding.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The learnable VTM's use of an auxiliary path to address the non-differentiable partitioning is innovative and effectively focuses saliency prediction on important tokens.
- The proposed algorithm effectively addresses long-contextual dependencies in long videos, demonstrating superior performance compared to conventional methods.
- The evaluation methodology is fair, utilizing the same backbone as prior works, ensuring consistency in comparisons.
- The authors provide a clear comparison of throughput metrics, enhancing the understanding of their method's efficiency.
- The decision to move explanations of different token merging methods to the Appendix is a positive organizational change.

Weaknesses:
- The exploration of region-based and motion-based VTM appears trivial, as the effectiveness of token selection is already demonstrated in learnable VTM, making Section 3.3 unnecessarily lengthy.
- The definition of "special design for video" remains unclear, potentially leading to misunderstandings regarding the algorithm's applicability.
- Section 3.4 lacks detail on the training process of learnable VTM, particularly regarding gradient flow with the non-differentiable partition function.
- The authors acknowledge that their method's training time is influenced by various factors, which may complicate the assessment of its efficiency.
- Some claims regarding performance comparisons are overstated; for instance, the assertion that center VTM outperforms naive VTM is not consistently supported by the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve Section 3.3 by reducing its length and focusing more on the contributions of learnable VTM. Additionally, we suggest providing more detailed explanations in Section 3.4 regarding the training architecture and gradient flow. Clarifying the claims made about performance in the results, particularly in relation to qualitative and quantitative data, would enhance the paper's credibility. We also recommend improving the clarity of the term "special design for video" to better convey the unique aspects of their algorithm. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to provide a more detailed discussion on how their method specifically addresses the challenges of long-form video understanding compared to token reduction methods. Lastly, we encourage the authors to ensure that the explanation of token merging methods in the Appendix is concise and directly relevant to the main findings of the paper, while addressing minor issues and clarifying the terminology around "saliency" to improve overall clarity.
