### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive study of the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs) in predicting neuronal responses from the macaque inferior temporal (IT) cortex. The authors introduce MacaqueITBench, a large-scale dataset comprising over 300,000 images and 8,233 unique natural images presented to seven monkeys across 109 sessions. They demonstrate that DNNs, while effective on in-distribution data, exhibit significant performance drops—up to 80%—on OOD data, highlighting the fragility of these models in the context of low-level image feature shifts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The MacaqueITBench dataset provides a substantial resource for studying neural responses across various visual cortex areas.
2. The paper systematically investigates the impact of multiple distribution shifts (contrast, hue, intensity, temperature, and saturation) on model performance.
3. The presentation is clear and easy to follow, with illustrative instructions on data curation and splitting.

Weaknesses:
1. The discussion lacks depth; common knowledge about performance drops due to stronger distribution shifts is not sufficiently insightful.
2. The benchmarking does not consider OOD generalization methods, and the OOD splits may not reflect natural conditions encountered in practical applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion by providing more specific insights related to the OOD issues in the Ventral Visual Cortex, rather than reiterating common conclusions. Additionally, including tables with specific experimental results would enhance clarity and precision, as figures alone may not convey sufficient detail. Lastly, we suggest investigating the potential reasons for the observed lack of OOD generalization, which could further strengthen the contributions of this work.
