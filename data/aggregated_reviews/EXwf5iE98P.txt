### Key Points
This paper presents the IKEA Video Manuals dataset, which combines 3D models of IKEA furniture parts, instructional manuals, and real-world assembly videos. It includes 98 assembly videos across six furniture categories, with approximately 34,441 annotated frames. The dataset aims to facilitate four tasks: assembly plan generation, part-conditioned segmentation, part-conditioned pose estimation, and shape assembly with instruction videos. The authors evaluate existing heuristic baselines and learned methods, highlighting the challenges in grounding instructional assembly videos.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset addresses a critical gap in existing shape assembly datasets by providing detailed spatio-temporal alignments between assembly instructions, 3D models, and real-world videos.
- It includes extensive annotations, such as 2D-3D part correspondences and temporal step alignments, which are valuable for various computer vision and robotics tasks.
- The integration of video-based cues with 3D part models enhances the understanding of real-world assembly tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset's collection process and application are not substantially novel, resulting in a small-scale benchmark that may not yield significant insights.
- The limited size and diversity of the dataset undermine its claim of being a large-scale resource, as it only includes 98 videos and lacks variability in assembly sequences.
- The experimental design is relatively simple, relying on pre-trained models without fully demonstrating the dataset's potential for training new models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset's scale by increasing the number of videos and annotated frames to enhance its practical value. Additionally, expanding the diversity of parts, tasks, and assembly sequences would better reflect the complexity of real-world furniture assembly. We suggest that the authors refine their experimental design to more closely mimic real-world applications, such as generating assembly plans directly from videos. Furthermore, we encourage a more thorough discussion of the dataset's limitations, including data size, modality, and model development. Lastly, we advise the authors to consider evaluating additional methods in their experiments to provide a more comprehensive benchmark and reveal the dataset's utility.
