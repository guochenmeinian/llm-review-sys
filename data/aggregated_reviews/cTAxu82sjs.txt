### Key Points
This paper presents a measurement study on low-level cybercrime actors in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, analyzing a dataset that includes 358k web defacement attacks, 1.7M reflected DDoS attacks, and discussions from various forums. The authors explore the dynamics of these actors' engagement before and after the invasion, concluding that while initial interest led to increased online activity, their involvement was short-lived compared to state-sponsored operations. The study spans six months, covering two months prior to and four months following the invasion.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper utilizes an extensive dataset, providing a robust foundation for its conclusions.
2. It employs rigorous statistical methods, including One-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests, to evaluate changes in cyberattack patterns.
3. The work offers valuable insights into the transient nature of low-level cybercrime activities during geopolitical conflicts.
4. The focus on low-level actors fills a gap in cyberwarfare research.

Weaknesses:
1. The narrow focus on low-level actors may overlook their interactions with more sophisticated, state-backed operations.
2. There is a lack of comparative analysis with other geopolitical situations involving low-level actors.
3. The reliance on publicly accessible data may introduce bias and limit the comprehensiveness of the findings.
4. The study predominantly uses quantitative data, lacking qualitative insights into the motivations and strategies of individual actors.
5. The six-month study period may not capture long-term trends in cybercrime activities.
6. The selection criteria for specific forums and volunteer groups may introduce bias.
7. The statistical methods employed may not fully account for the complexities of evolving cyberwarfare activities.
8. Incorporating time series analysis could enhance the understanding of trends over time.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the selection criteria for data sources, particularly the web defacement archives and online forums, to ensure a more representative analysis of cybercrime activities. Additionally, we suggest considering the use of time series analysis or other statistical methods that account for temporal dependencies in cyberwarfare activities. To address potential biases from relying on publicly accessible data, we encourage the authors to discuss measures taken to mitigate this issue. Expanding the study period could provide insights into how trends might evolve over time. Finally, integrating qualitative analyses would deepen the understanding of the motivations and strategies of low-level cybercrime actors, enhancing the paper's overall contribution to the field.
