Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an improvement on PAC-Bayesian bounds for robust generalization, addressing issues in previous works, particularly Farnia et al. (2018). The authors propose a bound that incorporates the Lipschitzness of feed-forward ReLU networks, asserting that coordinate-wise Lipschitzness is preserved under L-infinity perturbation. The work aims to characterize the generalization gap of adversarial robustness, building on existing theoretical frameworks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper tackles an important topic in adversarial robustness and provides a tighter bound with thorough theoretical analysis.  
2. The overall framework is clear, and the proofs are easy to read, contributing to the understanding of the results.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The definitions and assumptions are unclear, particularly regarding Eq. (4) and the conditions on $B$ and $\gamma$ before Theorem 1.  
2. The significance of the contribution may not be apparent to those unfamiliar with the field, necessitating clearer explanations of the main challenges and the importance of the proposed solutions.  
3. The empirical study lacks clarity, with poorly captioned tables and insufficient detail on model training and attack techniques.  
4. The technical novelty is limited as the work builds on prior research, and the implications of the tighter bounds for the robustness community are not adequately discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of definitions and assumptions, particularly in Eq. (4) and the conditions surrounding Theorem 1. Additionally, we suggest that the authors enhance the introduction by explicitly addressing the main issues with previous PAC-Bayes bounds, the challenges in addressing these issues, and the technical contributions of their work. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide more detailed explanations in the empirical study, including model architectures and training techniques, to substantiate the claims regarding the tightness of the bounds. Lastly, discussing the implications of the tighter bounds for the robustness community would strengthen the paper's contribution.
