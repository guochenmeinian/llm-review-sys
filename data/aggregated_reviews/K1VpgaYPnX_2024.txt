### Key Points
This paper introduces a simple reformulation of utilizing Gaussian VAE statistics for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. The authors propose an interesting approach to view VAE using fast and slow weights through the Likelihood Path (LPath) Principle. The paper is well-written, providing detailed theoretical insights and a clear motivation, and demonstrates good performance with smaller VAE models compared to existing approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper presents a novel approach to OOD detection using Gaussian VAE statistics.  
- It offers detailed theoretical insights and a clear motivation for the proposed method.  
- Empirical evidence supports the effectiveness of the LPath Principle.

Weaknesses:  
- The topic does not align well with the workshop theme.  
- There is limited theoretical grounding for the optimality of the chosen statistics for OOD detection across various settings.  
- The selection of sufficient statistics and the application of the LPath Principle involve heuristic decisions that may not generalize well across different datasets or other types of deep generative models (DGMs).

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical grounding for the chosen statistics to enhance their applicability in various OOD detection scenarios. Additionally, addressing the alignment of the topic with the workshop theme could strengthen the paper's relevance. Finally, providing more robust justifications for the heuristic decisions made in selecting sufficient statistics would improve generalizability across datasets and DGMs.
