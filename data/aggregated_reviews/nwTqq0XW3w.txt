### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into emotion dynamics—average emotion, variability, rise rate, and recovery rate—using a dataset of Twitter users who self-disclose various mental health conditions (MHCs). The authors propose that emotion dynamics, defined as valence, arousal, and dominance, differ between users with MHCs and those without. The study aims to establish emotion variability as a potential biosocial marker for mental health, highlighting its relevance to the research community.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors address an important and understudied question regarding the temporal dynamics of emotions in relation to mental health.
- The analysis provides novel insights into the correlation between emotion dynamics and MHCs, supported by robust statistical methods.
- The introduction is well-developed, and the study includes multiple mental disorders, enhancing its breadth.

Weaknesses:
- The implications of the findings are not fully fleshed out, particularly regarding the differential patterns of results based on metrics, emotions, and MHCs.
- Methodologically, the reliance on the VAD lexicon raises concerns about the meaningful differentiation between valence, arousal, and dominance.
- The contextualization of emotion dynamics in relation to culture and demographics is insufficiently addressed, and demographic controls are lacking in the analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the unpacking of their results to better relate them to psychopathology, possibly by including a table of expected associations based on existing literature. Additionally, the authors should clarify their methodology regarding the VAD lexicon and consider demonstrating that their model measures distinct constructs. It would be beneficial to control for demographic factors such as age, gender, and culture, potentially utilizing machine learning methods to predict user demographics. Furthermore, we suggest providing more details on text preprocessing methods, including tokenization and handling of emojis and punctuation. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore the implications of their findings more thoroughly, particularly in relation to the concept of "biosocial markers."
