Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for aligning unpaired samples from multimodal data by utilizing a propensity score to establish relationships between samples from different modalities. The authors propose that, under certain assumptions, a common latent space exists that can be leveraged to create a matching matrix through optimal transport matching with entropic regularization. The method is evaluated on multiple datasets, demonstrating improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of metrics like MSE.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method provides a straightforward approach to generate a matching matrix for multimodal data, requiring only the training of two classifiers and the application of Sinkhornâ€™s algorithm.
- Empirical results indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods, particularly in terms of MSE and other metrics.
- The paper is well-written and presents an important problem in multimodal representation learning.

Weaknesses:
- The method relies on strong assumptions that are only superficially discussed, particularly regarding the conditional independence and the shared latent space.
- The description of the perturbation method and the shared latent representation is vague, lacking necessary technical details.
- There is no discussion on the scalability of the approach, particularly concerning the computational challenges posed by large unpaired datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the assumptions underlying their method, particularly by providing a more detailed discussion of the conditional independence assumption and the shared latent space. Additionally, we suggest including a thorough analysis of the scalability of the proposed approach, especially in scenarios with imbalanced multimodal data. It would also be beneficial to elaborate on the baselines used for comparison, as well as to clarify the final purpose of the method, whether it is solely for alignment or also for downstream learning tasks. Finally, addressing the potential clustering effect based on labels in the matching process would enhance the understanding of the method's implications.
