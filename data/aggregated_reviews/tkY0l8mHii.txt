Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents QPMRC-NER, a modified machine reading comprehension (MRC) approach for named entity recognition (NER) that allows for the parallel issuance of multiple queries, enhancing efficiency during inference. The authors propose a model that extracts multiple entity types simultaneously using a BERT-based encoder and a query-conditioned biaffine predictor. Extensive experiments demonstrate competitive performance across various datasets, particularly excelling in low-resource settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed query-parallel approach is novel and effectively enhances MRC-based NER methods.
- Comprehensive evaluation across multiple datasets and settings showcases the model's effectiveness, especially in low-resource scenarios.

Weaknesses:
- Insufficient details on model and experimental setup hinder independent reproduction of results.
- Lack of clarity regarding the performance metrics reported and the absence of comparisons with recent works like PromptNER, COPNER, and LightNER.
- Minor writing issues and unclear terminology detract from readability and understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of model and experiment details to facilitate independent reproduction, including specifying performance metrics and ensuring all symbols are defined. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with recent works such as PromptNER, COPNER, and LightNER to strengthen the experimental validation. Furthermore, addressing the minor writing issues and clarifying ambiguous terms will enhance the overall readability of the paper.
