### Key Points
This paper presents a framework that combines partial annotation with self-training to reduce annotation costs for structured prediction using active learning. The authors propose an Adaptive Partial Selection method that adaptively determines the selection ratio for sub-structures to annotate, which is shown to improve upon existing full-annotation baselines. The evaluation includes considerations of both reading and labeling costs, providing a comprehensive analysis of the proposed method's performance across various structured prediction tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for the work is clear and meaningful, addressing real-world annotation challenges.
- The proposed Adaptive Partial Selection method is practical and offers a novel approach to active learning.
- The paper is well-organized and clearly written, facilitating understanding of complex ideas.

Weaknesses:
- The title "Data-efficient Active Learning" may be misleading, as data efficiency is inherent to active learning; the focus should be on the adaptive ratio.
- The method's reliance on a hyperparameter (confidence threshold) and a development set for training the error estimator raises concerns about feasibility and should be acknowledged in the Limitations section.
- The contribution of the self-training scheme appears limited, and the rationale for using estimated error rates over current uncertainty lacks strong motivation or empirical support.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the title to emphasize the adaptive ratio rather than data efficiency. Additionally, it would be beneficial to clarify the limitations regarding the hyperparameters and the necessity of a development set in the Limitations section. We suggest providing more detailed explanations of the design choices, particularly regarding the assumptions behind Adaptive Partial Selection and the optimization of the self-training objective. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the results of the Domain-transfer Experiments in the main text, as well as to clarify the terminology used, such as the distinction between "query set" and "sentence selection."
