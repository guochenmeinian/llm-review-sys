Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a trajectory-based method for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in mathematical reasoning tasks, introducing a new measurement called the TV score. The authors argue that the high-density output space in mathematical reasoning leads to a "pattern collapse," resulting in significant discrepancies in embedding shift trajectories. The proposed method leverages trajectory volatility to distinguish in-distribution (ID) from OOD samples, supported by experiments validating its performance against traditional algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- This work is the first to address OOD detection specifically in mathematical reasoning, a less explored area compared to text and image settings.  
- The authors provide clear examples to illustrate their motivation and key ideas, enhancing accessibility.  
- The manuscript is well-organized, and the methodology is simple yet effective.

Weaknesses:  
- The motivation for the proposed method lacks strength and convincing evidence; the claims regarding pattern collapse and early stabilization require more robust justification.  
- The writing quality needs improvement, with several grammatical errors and unclear notations.  
- The empirical study lacks clarity regarding the input data and does not sufficiently demonstrate that performance improvements are due to addressing the identified challenges.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and precision of the writing, addressing grammatical mistakes and ensuring all terms and notations are well-defined. Additionally, to strengthen the motivation for the proposed method, we suggest providing more evidence or data analysis to substantiate the claims about pattern collapse and early stabilization. Including additional metrics commonly used for OOD evaluation, such as AUPR and F1 scores, would enhance the evaluation of the method's performance. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the relationship between pattern collapse and early stabilization, as well as the computational complexity of the TV score method, should be included to improve interpretability and practical applicability.
