### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to mechanized theorem proving by leveraging large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 as intermediaries, utilizing natural language for user interactions with theorem provers. The authors introduce Pétanque, a lightweight environment designed for high-throughput interactions with the Coq theorem prover, and propose two interactive proof protocols: *tactic-by-tactic* and *hierarchical proof templating*. The evaluation on Logical Foundations and Busy Beaver proofs demonstrates a 46% and 50% success rate, respectively, highlighting the method's practical effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The innovative use of natural language as an intermediary enhances interpretability and flexibility in formal proof generation.
- Pétanque is a commendable tool for efficient interactions in theorem proving.
- The interactive proof protocols foster collaboration between machines and human mathematicians.
- The evaluation metrics are clearly presented, showcasing the method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a deeper theoretical explanation for the effectiveness of natural language as an intermediate representation.
- The evaluation is limited to two specific datasets, restricting insights into the approach's generalizability.
- There is an over-reliance on LLMs, with insufficient discussion on their limitations for complex mathematical problems.
- A lack of comparative analysis with alternative systems diminishes the contextual understanding of the proposed approach.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical discussion on why natural language is an effective intermediary in formal theorem proving.
- Expanding the evaluation to include a wider variety of complex theorems would better demonstrate the approach's robustness.
- Addressing the limitations of LLMs, particularly regarding scalability to more complex proofs, would strengthen the paper's validity.
- Incorporating a comparative analysis with other theorem proving systems could provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of this method.
