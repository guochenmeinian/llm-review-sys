Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Scalable Ensemble Diversification (SED), a method designed to enhance existing diversification techniques for large-scale datasets without requiring a separate out-of-distribution (OOD) dataset. SED identifies OOD-like samples from the in-distribution (ID) dataset and encourages diverse predictions among ensemble models. The authors also introduce the Predictive Diversity Score (PDS) as a measure of epistemic uncertainty and propose a stochastic approach to speed up pairwise disagreement computations. Additionally, the paper includes results for OOD detection methods, specifically Energy and Max Logit, and clarifies that the goal of handling covariate shift is to reject samples where the model is likely to be incorrect, regardless of the shift type. The authors argue that detecting covariate-shifted samples is a well-motivated and widely accepted practice in the OOD detection community.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- SED effectively scales existing ensemble methods and demonstrates good performance in OOD generalization and detection tasks.
- The method is intuitive, easy to understand, and can be applied to existing ensemble diversification algorithms.
- The empirical results indicate that SED-A2D outperforms other baselines in OOD generalization and achieves high AUROC for OOD detection.
- The authors provide comprehensive additional results and clarifications that enhance the paper's contributions.
- The argument for treating covariate shifts as part of the OOD detection task is well-supported by relevant literature.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset division for the OOD detection task is confusing, as the ID dataset (ImageNet-1K) overlaps with the OOD dataset (ImageNet-C), which contradicts OOD detection principles.
- The ablation studies are insufficient, particularly regarding the number of diversified layers, which should be explored to strengthen the paper.
- The experiments lack comprehensiveness, particularly in assessing performance on small-scale datasets and comparing with a wider range of existing OOD methods.
- The claim of speeding up pairwise divergence computation lacks empirical evidence demonstrating the extent of the speedup achieved.
- The connection between SED and PDS is weak, and the justification for using PDS over other measures like BMA is not adequately addressed.
- The authors do not address how to differentiate between covariate and semantic shifts in a manner that necessitates further classification, which may leave a gap in understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the dataset division for the OOD detection task to ensure it aligns with established OOD principles. Additionally, conducting more comprehensive ablation studies, particularly on the number of diversified layers, would enhance the robustness of the findings. The authors should also expand the comparative analysis to include a broader range of existing OOD generalization and detection methods, providing insights into SED's performance relative to these approaches. Furthermore, empirical results demonstrating the claimed speedup in pairwise divergence computation should be included. A more thorough justification for the choice of PDS over other diversity measures should be provided, along with a discussion of its limitations. Lastly, we recommend that the authors improve the discussion on how to determine which samples are covariate shift and require further classification by the model, and consider providing more clarity on the implications of rejecting covariate-shifted samples in practical applications.
