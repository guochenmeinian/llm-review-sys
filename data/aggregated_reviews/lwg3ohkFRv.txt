Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach called Context-attended Graph ODE (CARE) for modeling interacting dynamical systems under temporal distribution shift. The authors propose a seq-to-seq style graph neural net architecture that incorporates a context variable evolving over time, formalizing the problem of temporal distribution shift and providing a probabilistic framework to understand the relationships between trajectories and contexts. The paper reports extensive experimental results demonstrating the CARE model's superior performance in predicting long-term trajectories compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The CARE model introduces a novel methodology by integrating continuous context variations into a coupled ODE system.
- Extensive experiments validate the model's performance, showing consistent improvement over benchmarks, including an ablation study and parameter sensitivity analysis.
- The paper is well-written, with clear presentation and effective summarization of contributions.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed method, while intuitive, appears to combine existing tools in a straightforward manner, raising questions about its scientific novelty and contribution to the knowledge base.
- The paper claims to address out-of-distribution dynamics, yet the experiments primarily focus on in-distribution cases, lacking clarity on how out-of-distribution data is defined and tested.
- The deterministic nature of the model contradicts claims of providing a probabilistic view for out-of-distribution dynamics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the distinction between in-distribution and out-of-distribution data in their experiments, explicitly stating how out-of-distribution cases are defined and tested. Additionally, we suggest that the authors address the interpretability of the context variable and clarify its comparison to static context variables. It would also be beneficial to tone down claims regarding the probabilistic nature of the model, given its deterministic framework. Finally, we encourage the authors to better articulate the conceptual novelty of their approach in relation to existing methods like IGP-ODE.
