Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Continuous Temporal Domain Generalization (CTDG), which extends traditional Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) methods to address challenges posed by continuously evolving and irregularly spaced temporal domains. The authors propose a Koopman operator-driven framework (Koodos) to capture continuous dynamics in data and optimize generalization across these domains. The framework is supported by theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrating its effectiveness compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of the CTDG problem and the Koodos framework is a significant contribution, addressing a relevant and challenging setting.
- The methodology is well-supported by theoretical foundations and includes extensive experiments on various datasets, demonstrating improved performance over existing methods.

Weaknesses:
- The paper does not sufficiently discuss the limitations of the proposed approach, particularly regarding Assumption 1, which posits that conditional probability distributions follow an ODE, a potentially restrictive assumption.
- The evaluation is limited to small datasets and lacks comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, particularly those like AdaRNN and Diversify, which are relevant to the same issues.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the limitations of their approach, particularly the validity of Assumption 1 and its implications in real-world scenarios. Additionally, a more comprehensive evaluation involving larger and higher-dimensional datasets, as well as comparisons with other relevant methods, would strengthen the paper. Clarifying how the proposed method handles abrupt changes in data and providing detailed analysis on hyperparameter sensitivity would enhance practical applicability. Furthermore, addressing the clarity of how the method manages arbitrary temporal sampling and its implications on domain changes would be beneficial.
