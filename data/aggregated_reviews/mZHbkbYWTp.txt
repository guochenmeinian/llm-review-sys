Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper targets the stochastic optimal control problem with signal-dependent and internal noise, questioning an assumption made in Todorov's (2005) work regarding unbiased state estimation. The authors propose an approximate solution that does not rely on this assumption and demonstrate that high internal noise can lead to significantly different trajectories compared to Todorov's approach. The paper presents a gradient-descent based algorithm (GD) and an iterative variant (Iterative-GD) that outperform the original method in terms of cost reduction and qualitative behavior. Additionally, the authors present a framework for computing the expectation of the cost function in control theory without approximations, asserting that Eqs. (11) and (12) hold true regardless of the underlying distribution of the variables involved. They clarify that the first two moments of the state and state estimate are sufficient for their analysis, even in the presence of multiplicative noise, and address concerns regarding the ratio of noise influences and the need for clearer visualizations of internal beliefs under varying noise conditions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a relevant issue in stochastic optimal control, particularly in neuroscience and motor control.
- The proposed algorithms provide a valid alternative to existing methods, avoiding the assumption of unbiased state estimation.
- Empirical results indicate strong performance of the new algorithms compared to Todorov's method.
- The authors provide a robust framework that does not rely on Gaussian assumptions for moment propagation, enhancing the analytical rigor of their approach.
- The clarification of the sufficiency of the first two moments in computing expected costs is a significant contribution.
- The authors demonstrate transparency in their methodology by addressing reviewer concerns and committing to include additional visualizations in the revised version.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a discussion on the relative importance of the two reasons identified for the failure of unbiased state estimation.
- The moment propagation technique assumes a fixed time horizon without discussing its impact on the solution.
- The evaluation is based on simple toy problems, which may not fully capture the complexities of real-world applications.
- Some reviewers express concerns about the assumptions underlying Eqs. (11, 12, 14), questioning whether derivations for general distributions are adequately presented.
- The need for a more detailed discussion on the influence of higher-order moments in variance calculations remains unaddressed.
- Certain limitations and weaknesses identified in the initial reviews persist, which could affect the overall impact of the work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of variable definitions and notations to avoid confusion, particularly regarding random variables. Additionally, restructuring section 3 to first present the intuition behind the problem before introducing the solution would enhance understanding. The authors should also consider including a real simulated example that computes expectation values against true state values to illustrate the violation of assumptions more effectively. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors improve the clarity of their derivations for Eqs. (11, 12, 14) by including a comprehensive derivation for general distributions in the final version. A more thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithms, including their relationship to Todorov's approach, would strengthen the contribution. We encourage the authors to provide a detailed discussion on the implications of higher-order moments in variance calculations to address reviewer concerns. Including visualizations of internal beliefs for varying values of $\sigma_\eta$ will enhance the transparency of their results. Lastly, expanding the evaluation to include more complex systems and explicitly acknowledging and addressing the remaining limitations noted in the reviews would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the proposed methods and strengthen the overall impact of their work.
