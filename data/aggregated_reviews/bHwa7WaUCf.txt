### Key Points
This paper presents a novel multi-level negative sampling strategy for graph representation learning, specifically addressing the inefficiencies in existing negative sampling methods. The authors propose a diffusion model-based approach, DMNS, which generates negative samples with varying levels of hardness by leveraging the Markov chain property. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that DMNS adheres to the sub-linear positivity principle, and empirical results indicate significant performance improvements in link prediction tasks across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The multi-level negative sampling concept is innovative, and the implementation using the diffusion model is well-executed.
- The performance enhancement on link prediction tasks is substantial.
- The paper is well-structured and comprehensible.

Weaknesses:
- The focus on link prediction limits the method's applicability; the authors should validate its effectiveness on node classification tasks as well.
- The theoretical analysis diverges from the original claim in reference [47], raising questions about equivalence and the unexplained term $\Psi$.
- The experimental section requires enhancement, including an ablation study to assess the effectiveness of heuristic versus generated negative samples, empirical time analysis, and an expanded Figure 7 with more negative samples at different time steps.
- The dataset sizes are small, prompting questions about DMNS's scalability to larger graphs and the need for experimental analysis on time and space complexity.
- The paper overlooks relevant works, which undermines the fairness of the experimental comparisons.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the validation of their method by including tests on node classification tasks in the current version. Additionally, clarify the theoretical analysis to align with reference [47] and explain the term $\Psi$. The experimental section should be bolstered with an ablation study comparing heuristic and generated samples, as well as empirical analyses of time and space complexity. Furthermore, we suggest expanding the dataset evaluation to include larger graphs and addressing the omission of relevant literature to strengthen the comparative analysis. Lastly, consider providing qualitative analysis or toy examples to reinforce the motivation behind controlling the "hardness" of negative samples.
