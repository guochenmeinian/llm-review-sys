Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of NeuS to support the reconstruction of both transparent and opaque surfaces simultaneously, claiming unbiasedness for transparent surfaces. The authors propose a new surface extraction method and introduce a benchmark dataset for evaluation. The method is theoretically justified and evaluated on synthetic and real datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation, extending the unbiasedness proof of NeuS to various material opacities.
2. The proposed surface extraction technique effectively handles both transparent and opaque surfaces.
3. Comprehensive evaluation results demonstrate the method's effectiveness, supported by quantitative metrics.

Weaknesses:
1. The organization of the paper is poor, lacking a clear background section, which hinders reader comprehension.
2. Theorem 1 is ambiguously presented and lacks precise definitions, making it difficult to verify.
3. The evaluation set is relatively small, and comparisons with existing methods are limited.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper's organization by including a background or overview section to enhance accessibility for readers. Additionally, please present symbols and equations clearly before the theorem statement to eliminate ambiguities. Theorem 1 should be rigorously defined, following standard formats for clarity. Consider removing the theorem in favor of empirical discussions if necessary. Furthermore, we suggest conducting additional experiments to evaluate geometric accuracy against established datasets like DTU and including comparisons with other methods, such as NeUDF. Lastly, clarify the role of the temperature parameter $s$ in the optimization process and provide more details on the optimization methods used.
