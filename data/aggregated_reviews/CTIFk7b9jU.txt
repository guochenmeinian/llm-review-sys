Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents GPTrack, a novel unsupervised framework aimed at thoroughly investigating the temporal and spatial dynamics of cardiac motion. The authors propose employing sequential Gaussian Processes in the latent space and aggregating sequential data in a bidirectional recursive manner, enhancing motion tracking accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on 3D echocardiogram and 4D cardiac MRI datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The framework improves cardiac motion tracking accuracy through innovative use of bidirectional information flow.
2. The integration of Gaussian Processes effectively models variability and predictability in cardiac motion.
3. The methodology is robust, yielding competitive results across multiple datasets.
4. The implications of the findings are clearly articulated, showcasing practical relevance.

Weaknesses:
1. Some manuscript details are unclear, particularly regarding data processing and the application of the method to the complete cardiac cycle.
2. There is a lack of comparison with the latest registration methods, including denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM).
3. No statistical significance analysis is provided, and the discussion of results is somewhat superficial.
4. Terminology inconsistencies and unclear definitions, such as "motion consistency," detract from clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by providing more detailed explanations of data processing and the application of the proposed method to the complete cardiac cycle. Additionally, including comparisons with the latest registration methods and conducting a statistical significance analysis would strengthen the paper. We suggest enhancing the discussion of results to link findings back to the research questions and theoretical framework more effectively. Lastly, addressing terminology inconsistencies and providing clearer definitions would improve overall clarity.
