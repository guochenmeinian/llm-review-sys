### Key Points
This paper presents a novel methodology for measuring client-side dependencies in DNS infrastructure through the concept of ODNS clusters, revealing significant insights into security risks and failure points within the DNS ecosystem. The authors identify 81,636 ODNS clusters from 1.9 million open DNS servers, highlighting issues such as the concentration of public DNS providers and regional disparities in infrastructure. The methodology is well-structured, with clear explanations of the setup and results, although some claims regarding the implications of the findings require further justification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The methodology is intuitive and well-described, particularly in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, which detail the approach and its application in real-world settings.
- The use of transparent forwarders to enhance the physical vantage point is innovative and well-founded.
- The paper is well-organized, with clear sections and effective figures that complement the text.

Weaknesses:
- Some claims based on numerical results lack justification, such as the significance of finding 82k clusters among 1.9M servers.
- The motivations behind the measured ODNS servers are unclear, with implications that many may be poorly-configured ADNS servers.
- The paper does not compare the proposed ODNS clustering methodology with existing methods, and the server classification method does not account for transient caching states or TTL-based cache expirations.
- Inconsistencies in terminology and the introduction of abbreviations without initial definitions detract from clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for claims regarding the concentration of clusters and clarify the motivations behind the measured ODNS servers. Additionally, we suggest including a comparison of the ODNS clustering methodology with existing DNS clustering methods. The authors should refine the server classification method to account for transient caching states and provide clearer definitions for key terms and abbreviations. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore the socio-economic and policy implications of the identified regional disparities in DNS infrastructure. Lastly, consider addressing the limitations of relying on transparent forwarders by incorporating more diverse vantage points in future work.
