Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new approach called Model-enhanced Vector Index (MEVI), which integrates autoregressive sequence-to-sequence models for indexing with dense retrieval models, including Residual Quantization. The authors demonstrate that MEVI achieves significant performance improvements in recall accuracy and retrieval speed, particularly in real-world applications. The method is evaluated on the MSMARCO dataset and shows promising results in both offline and online settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method effectively combines dense retrieval and generative neural indexing, showcasing extensive evaluation in both offline and online scenarios, including commercial advertising.
- The paper is well-written and generally easy to follow, providing clear technical details for reproduction.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation is limited to the MSMARCO benchmark; broader dataset testing is necessary to validate the method's generalizability.
- Concerns arise regarding the quality of online A/B testing compared to controlled crowdsourcing methods.
- The authors' claims about the tree structure's impact on decoding time lack convincing evidence, and the hierarchical nature of embeddings requires further clarification.
- The paper could benefit from more fine-grained retrieval results and clearer mathematical notations.
- The introduction and related work sections need elaboration on the MEVI method and its differentiation from existing approaches.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by testing MEVI across additional datasets to establish its generalizability. Clarifying the quality assurance of online A/B testing compared to controlled methods would strengthen the findings. Additionally, we suggest providing more detailed explanations regarding the tree structure's decoding implications and enhancing the clarity of mathematical notations. The authors should also include fine-grained retrieval results and elaborate on the MEVI method in the introduction and related work sections. Finally, addressing formatting issues and providing standalone captions for tables would enhance the paper's presentation.
