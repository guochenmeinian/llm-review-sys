### Key Points
This paper presents a novel adaptive RAW frame offloading framework named ABO, which utilizes an autoencoder and a dynamic transmission algorithm to enhance performance and reduce resource consumption in downstream tasks. The framework features a configurable tile-wise RAW image neural codec and a dynamic transmission controller, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy, throughput, and latency through extensive evaluations. The authors assert that ABO is the first approach to decouple visual DNN offloading from image demosaicing.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides coherent observations and a well-structured layout, making it accessible.
- The novel pipeline design allows for parallel processing, significantly reducing latency with minimal resource increase.
- The framework effectively balances accuracy and efficiency, showcasing adaptability.
- The experimental results support the proposed framework's advantages.

Weaknesses:
- Insufficient technical details on existing baselines and how ABO differs from previous approaches.
- Lack of clarity on the motivation for using software preprocessing over ISP hardware, particularly regarding the NVIDIA Jetson Nano's relevance.
- Limited robustness evaluation, primarily focusing on low-light and fast-motion scenarios, with a need for more complex background assessments.
- The task-oriented compression requires further evaluation against other communication methods, particularly in relation to semantic communication.
- Downstream tasks are limited to object detection, raising concerns about codec generalizability for other tasks.
- The dataset used for evaluation is limited, necessitating further verification on more extensive datasets for better domain adaptation.
- The use of randomly generated bandwidth data in experiments lacks real-world relevance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section by providing more technical details on existing baselines and clarifying how ABO differs from them. Additionally, addressing the motivation for software preprocessing over ISP hardware would strengthen the paper. We suggest expanding the robustness evaluation to include complex background scenarios and explaining the connection between low-light conditions and the approach. It would be beneficial to evaluate task-oriented compression against other methods, particularly in relation to semantic communication. The authors should also consider the generalizability of codecs for multiple downstream tasks and provide clarity on the dataset used for evaluation. Finally, incorporating real-world dynamic data for bandwidth evaluation would enhance the paper's credibility.
