Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a semi-supervised imitation learning architecture, Elastic semi-supervised InfoGAIL (Ess-InfoGAIL), that addresses challenges such as multimodality, data imbalance, and expensive labeling processes in real-world demonstrations. The authors propose a method that adapts semi-supervised generative adversarial networks to the imitation learning context, utilizing a learnable prior to align generated and expert data distributions and employing a regularized information maximization approach to enhance performance. The proposed method demonstrates effectiveness in learning multimodal behaviors from imbalanced demonstrations, outperforming baseline methods in various MuJoCo environments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-motivated, addressing a practical problem in imitation learning.
- Empirical results show significant improvement over baseline methods, with effective visualizations demonstrating the method's efficiency.
- The experiments are well-designed, showcasing the method's capabilities across different levels of data imbalance and behavior modalities.

Weaknesses:
- Several points of confusion exist regarding the experimental settings, such as the clarity of expert trajectory imbalances and the specific labels used.
- The code is currently unavailable, limiting reproducibility.
- The evaluation metrics are limited, focusing primarily on NMI and ENT without presenting expected cumulative rewards or other performance measures.
- There are numerous typographical errors and unclear references, such as the definition of $D_\text{body}$ in Figure 2 and missing references in the text.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by providing more detailed explanations of the experimental setup, including how expert demonstrations are generated and the specific label classes considered. Additionally, we suggest including expected cumulative rewards in the results to better quantify task performance. The authors should also address the identified typographical errors and ensure that all figures and references are clearly defined and cited. Finally, we encourage the authors to make the implementation code available to enhance reproducibility.
