Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for inferring phylogenetic trees using variational Bayesian inference, introducing a differentiable distribution over tree topologies, \( Q(\tau) \), constructed from a continuous distribution \( Q(z) \) in hyperbolic space. The authors clarify that while their approach, GeoPhy, shares similarities with MCMC-based methods, it distinguishes itself through unique contributions, including the parameterization of \( Q(\tau) \), an explicit definition of topology distributions, and the introduction of a tractable lower bound \( \mathcal{L} \). The authors resolve issues related to the Jacobian determinant between \( B_\tau \) and \( z \) and benchmark model evidence estimations, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods, although they do not surpass the performance of established techniques like MrBayes and VBPI-GNN. The work addresses significant application problems in phylogenetics, emphasizing robustness and scalability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The originality lies in providing a robust solution to a critical application problem in Bayesian phylogenetics.
- The theoretical derivation of variational estimators is solid, and the paper is well-motivated with appropriate experimental benchmarking.
- The authors provide a clear distinction between their work and previous studies, emphasizing unique contributions.
- The introduction of a tractable lower bound \( \mathcal{L} \) and the exploration of variational distributions enhance the novelty of the approach.
- The language is fluent, and intuitive illustrations enhance clarity; conclusions and limitations are clearly stated.

Weaknesses:
- The treatment of benchmark datasets is limited, particularly the use of the DS1 dataset, which may not adequately support the analysis.
- The benefits of the proposed method compared to existing gold-standard techniques like MrBayes and VBPI-GNN are unclear.
- The paper lacks a discussion on the faster learning runtime of VCSMC and Vaiphy.
- There is no source code provided, and the assessment of societal implications is absent.
- Some figures, particularly Fig. R2, require more detailed explanations regarding the experimental setup and metrics used.
- The reported standard deviations in results may indicate limited representative power of \( Q(\tau) \).

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the treatment of benchmark datasets to better highlight the method's practical relevance, considering the use of datasets DS4 and higher for a more robust evaluation of \( Q(\tau) \). Additionally, a clearer demonstration of the benefits compared to existing methods, particularly in terms of computational efficiency and scalability, should be included. We suggest including an algorithm block summarizing the GeoPhy method for clarity and a detailed discussion regarding the low variance observed in results. Furthermore, we recommend improving the discussion on the trade-off of performance and runtimes between VCSMC and Vaiphy in the revised manuscript. Reporting runtime comparisons with MrBayes and other methods in the main text, rather than relegating it to the appendix, would enhance the paper's comprehensiveness. Lastly, including a more elaborate description of the experiments behind Fig. R2, clarifying what each dot represents, the meaning of 'dim', and the number of unique trees used for constructing the consensus tree, will enhance the clarity and comprehensibility of the results presented.
