### Key Points
This paper presents a method for finetuning smaller language models (SLMs) to enhance symbolic reasoning tasks, specifically through a dialogue format that decomposes problems into sub-questions. The authors propose using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to refine the reasoning path, demonstrating improved performance on various datasets, including GSM8K. The findings suggest that the dialogue format may rival traditional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods in certain contexts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and logically structured, making it easy to understand.
- The proposed dialogue format is innovative and leverages the instruction-tuning of recent language models, potentially enhancing their reasoning capabilities.
- The experimental results show a notable performance improvement with the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a rigorous explanation of why the dialogue format is beneficial, necessitating a side-by-side comparison with standard CoT formats to control for variables.
- The impact of PPO is not sufficiently disentangled from the dialogue format, leaving claims about its effectiveness unsubstantiated.
- The performance gains are relatively small, raising questions about the overall innovation and significance of the contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the advantages of the dialogue format by conducting a precise side-by-side comparison with standard CoT formats, ensuring that the only variable is the format used. Additionally, it would be beneficial to provide more detailed experiments that isolate the effects of PPO from the dialogue format, including model accuracy at different stages of sub-problem decomposition. We also suggest enhancing the clarity of figures, particularly Figure 2, and ensuring that Figure 3 is easily comparable to other methods. Finally, addressing the limitations of multi-round dialogue in terms of reasoning speed and complexity would strengthen the paper.
