Aggregated Review:
**Key Points:**
We recognize that this paper presents an innovative approach to medical image segmentation across diverse imaging modalities using limited computational resources. The authors introduce a class-prompt mechanism within a lightweight TinyVIT architecture, enhancing segmentation efficiency and accuracy tailored to specific modalities.

**Strengths and Weaknesses:**
We appreciate the paper's focus on a critical need in medical image analysis, enabling accurate segmentation on low-resource devices, which promotes adoption in constrained settings. The comprehensive evaluation, including quantitative and qualitative results, effectively demonstrates the method's efficacy. However, we note some weaknesses, such as the absence of explicit benchmarks for real-time processing and a lack of discussion on limitations and potential failure cases of the proposed method.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
We suggest that the authors provide explicit benchmarks or comparisons with existing real-time segmentation methods to emphasize computational efficiency. A more detailed discussion on the limitations and potential failure cases, along with strategies to address these issues, would enhance the paper. Additionally, exploring the generalization of their approach to other medical imaging tasks, such as detection or classification, could further demonstrate versatility. Finally, conducting additional ablation studies or sensitivity analyses to investigate the impact of different hyperparameters or architectural choices on performance and efficiency would be beneficial. We also note that the first author's ORCID is missing, equations on pages 6 and 7 are not numbered, strategies for improving CPU inference speed are not detailed, and a code link is not provided.
