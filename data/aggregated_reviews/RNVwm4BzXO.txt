Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the covariate shift problem in one-shot video editing, proposing two modules: Shift-restricted Temporal Attention Module (STAM) and Fine-coarse Frame Attention Module (FFAM) to enhance editing capabilities and improve temporal consistency. The authors conduct various quantitative and qualitative experiments to validate their approach, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The theoretical analysis of covariate shift is thorough and well-articulated, providing a solid foundation for the proposed methods.
2. The STAM effectively addresses style change issues, while the FFAM enhances temporal consistency.
3. The manuscript is well-organized and accessible, facilitating reader comprehension.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation for STAM relies on the assumption of significant covariate shift, which may not be adequately supported due to the initialization of the temporal attention output layer. A quantitative analysis of covariance is recommended.
2. The paper lacks a detailed explanation and analysis of spectral normalization, which is proposed alongside the IC layer.
3. Frame consistency is compromised as STAM and FFAM appear to conflict in their objectives, leading to inferior performance compared to other methods in terms of temporal consistency.
4. The scope of applications is limited, focusing primarily on style transfer without addressing other editing tasks like background changes.
5. The ablation studies lack comprehensiveness, with insufficient video frames provided to illustrate the impact on frame consistency.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the quantitative analysis of covariate shift to substantiate their claims. Additionally, a detailed explanation of spectral normalization should be included to clarify its role in the proposed methods. To address the frame consistency issue, the authors should explore how STAM and FFAM can be better aligned in their objectives. Expanding the range of editing applications considered in the paper would also enhance its relevance. Finally, we suggest providing more extensive ablation studies with additional video frames to better demonstrate the effects on frame consistency.
