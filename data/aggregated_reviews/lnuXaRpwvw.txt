### Key Points
This paper presents RedPajama, a family of datasets for large language model (LLM) pretraining, addressing limitations in transparency, scale, and versatility. RedPajama-V1 is an open reproduction of the LLaMA training dataset, while RedPajama-V2 is a massive web-only dataset containing over 100 trillion tokens. The authors detail their data preprocessing steps and quality signals, enabling flexible dataset creation for various downstream applications. The RedPajama-INCITE family includes pretrained models that demonstrate competitive performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The datasets are openly accessible, democratizing high-quality training data for the research community.
2. Comprehensive documentation enhances reproducibility and usability.
3. The inclusion of rigorous quality signals ensures high-quality data, facilitating effective model training.
4. The paper presents interesting findings from extensive experiments on data quality and filtering.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a deep dive analysis of the dataset, resembling an engineering report rather than a comprehensive study.
2. Some sections, such as related work, could be better organized for clarity.
3. Minor writing issues, including typos and colloquial expressions, detract from the overall professionalism of the manuscript.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of experiment results in Table 4 to enhance understanding of dataset performance and filtering methods.
2. We suggest conducting additional experiments to test hypotheses regarding performance gaps, particularly for the RedPajama-V1 dataset.
3. We encourage the authors to clarify the rationale behind discarding certain data segments and provide more detailed explanations of quality signal heuristics.
4. We recommend addressing open pull requests and issues on the project GitHub repository to enhance data quality and documentation.
5. We advise the authors to remove any unedited comments in the manuscript and ensure a formal tone throughout the paper.
