Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ScoreOpt, a dynamic defense mechanism that optimizes adversarial samples at test-time by minimizing the score-matching loss to enhance the likelihood of input images. The authors introduce Score Regularization Loss to regulate optimization by bounding the distance between denoised original and purified images. ScoreOpt is evaluated against various attacks, including weaker transfer-PGD and stronger BPDA+EOT and PGD+EOT attacks, with the authors arguing that evaluating defenses under weaker attacks is necessary due to their prevalence in real-world scenarios. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ScoreOpt outperforms existing defenses in robustness and inference speed across multiple datasets, including CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet, and shows strong empirical performance against both weak and strong adversarial methods. The introduction of a surrogate process for gradient approximation allows for effective robustness evaluation despite computational challenges, and the method exhibits good generalization capabilities to unseen threats.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper proposes a novel and efficient test-time defense that significantly improves upon previous diffusion-based purification methods.
2. The formulation of the adversarial defense as an optimization problem is well-articulated, particularly the score regularization loss.
3. ScoreOpt demonstrates strong empirical performance across multiple attack types, showing robustness against both weak and strong adversarial methods.
4. The introduction of a surrogate process for gradient approximation allows for effective robustness evaluation despite computational challenges.
5. The method exhibits good generalization capabilities to unseen threats, which is crucial for real-world applications.
6. The paper is well-written and presents a clear methodology.

Weaknesses:
1. The reported robustness of the baseline model, DiffPure with Wide-ResNet-28, appears overestimated compared to its original performance, raising concerns about the validity of the results.
2. The optimization process in the proposed method is challenging to evaluate due to its indifferentiability.
3. The evaluation lacks advanced methods for a comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art techniques, and the inference time for various methods is not reported.
4. The reported robustness against the PGD+EOT attack is lower than some state-of-the-art methods, raising concerns about its comparative effectiveness.
5. The complexity of the optimization steps in ScoreOpt may hinder comprehensive robustness evaluation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation of DiffPure and ScoreOpt by employing more advanced evaluation methods as suggested in [1], [2], and [3]. Additionally, please provide a detailed derivation of Equation (1) and clarify its relationship to the variational upper bound of -logp(x). It is also essential to report the iteration steps $M$ and $N$ for Ours(o) and Ours(n) in Tables 1, 2, and 4, along with the inference time for both Ours methods and other AT/AP baselines. Furthermore, we suggest testing the performance of ScoreOpt against advanced attack methods, such as score-based black-box attacks, to enhance the credibility of the findings. We also recommend improving the clarity of the definitions and distinctions between $q(x)$ and $q(x_a|x)$ in the context of variational inference. Conducting further experiments to validate the hypothesis regarding gradient stability would strengthen the paper's claims. The authors should consider providing a clearer explanation of the term $\Sigma_z$ as the covariance matrix in their equations. Finally, incorporating the new results from combining ScoreOpt with adversarially trained models like AT-EDM could enhance the overall conclusions of the paper.
