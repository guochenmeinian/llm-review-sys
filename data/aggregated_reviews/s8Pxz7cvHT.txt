Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel adversarial attack framework called Adversarial Attacks in Diffusion (AdvAD), which formulates the attack process as a non-parametric diffusion process. The authors propose that AdvAD crafts imperceptible adversarial examples by iteratively refining the original image using adversarial guidance based solely on the targeted deep neural network (DNN). The method includes two modules: Attacked Model Guidance (AMG) and Pixel-level Constraint (PC), and an enhanced version, AdvAD-X, is introduced for improved performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of both AdvAD and AdvAD-X.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
2. The innovative use of a non-parametric diffusion process for generating adversarial examples shows promising results.
3. The effectiveness of AdvAD is validated through comprehensive experiments, including ablation studies and comparisons with baseline methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a pseudo code to illustrate the algorithm's workings, which is essential for understanding the proposed method.
2. There are inconsistencies in performance metrics, particularly in Table 1, where FID results do not align with other similarity metrics like PSNR and SSIM.
3. The technical novelty is limited, as the concept of using diffusion models for adversarial attacks has been explored in prior works.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the AdvAD-X method by providing a detailed explanation of the steps involved in adopting original diffusion noise and defining non-critical image regions. Additionally, we suggest including comparative experiments to isolate the impact of the decayed learning rate strategy and to clarify the differences between AdvAD and existing diffusion-based attack methods. It would also be beneficial to address the computational complexity of AdvAD and its implications for practical applications, particularly in adversarial training contexts. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide a pseudo code for both AdvAD and AdvAD-X to enhance understanding.
