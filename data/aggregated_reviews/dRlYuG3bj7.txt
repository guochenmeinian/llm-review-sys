Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a streaming strategy for sentiment analysis of online reviews, proposing a self-correcting pipeline that combines a supervised classifier with a lexicon-based unsupervised classifier. The authors introduce SentiStream, detailing its architecture and evaluating it against three datasets and four baselines. The proposed co-training method includes an unsupervised module for updating a pre-trained language model and a semi-supervised module for refining predictions based on pseudo-labels.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research addresses an interesting topic in sentiment analysis of streaming data.
- The proposed framework is well-structured and detailed, with empirical results indicating promising performance improvements.
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation methodology lacks clarity, particularly regarding the ordering and time intervals of the reviews.
- The absence of competitive baselines and the reliance on static datasets undermine the robustness of the findings.
- The sentiment analysis approach may misclassify reviews due to context neglect, and the integration of the semi-supervised module does not convincingly enhance performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation methodology by clearly explaining the time ordering of reviews and the time intervals used. Additionally, incorporating competitive baselines from related fields, such as temporal recommender systems, would strengthen the paper. The authors should also consider using a more sophisticated language model to assess the necessity of the semi-supervised module. Furthermore, providing a running example to illustrate concept drift in sentiment streams would enhance understanding. Lastly, refining the method for adding sentiment words to seed words, considering context sensitivity, would improve the model's accuracy.
