Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for generating Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) tailored for few-shot learning (FSL) scenarios, addressing task and semantic shifts. The authors propose the use of proxy tasks and proxy protos to enhance UAP transferability across different FSL tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the method's effectiveness on datasets like CIFAR-FS, miniImageNet, and tieredImageNet.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The combination of universal adversarial perturbations and few-shot learning is novel.  
2. The authors tackle a practical problem of attacking FSL with UAP settings.  
3. The paper includes interesting empirical studies and comprehensive experiments evaluating the proposed method's performance.

Weaknesses:  
1. The overall writing quality is inadequate, with confusing terminology and unclear figures.  
2. The evaluation is limited to smaller datasets, raising questions about the method's applicability to larger datasets.  
3. The paper lacks sufficient discussion on how proposed proxy tasks differ from existing meta-learning UAPs.  
4. The motivation section is misleading and requires rewriting for clarity.  
5. The performance of the proposed proxy linear is not convincingly justified compared to base linear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the writing quality by ensuring clarity and consistency in terminology throughout the manuscript. Specifically, they should clarify the definitions of newly introduced terms immediately after use and provide clearer explanations for figures, particularly Fig. 4 and Fig. 6. Additionally, the authors should conduct evaluations on larger datasets to validate the robustness of their framework and include a more comprehensive comparison against recent UAP frameworks. We also suggest that the authors elaborate on the rationale behind their choices, such as the use of GAP and the selection of proxy datasets, to strengthen their argumentation. Finally, we encourage the authors to address the misleading aspects of the motivation section and provide a more thorough analysis of the performance degradation in diverged proxy tasks.
