### Key Points
This paper presents a novel music AI system that generates multi-track accompaniments from a lead sheet by leveraging disentangled style factors to enhance context coherence, creativity, and computational efficiency. The authors propose a two-stage process: first, generating a piano arrangement using piano texture styles, followed by orchestrating multiple tracks with orchestral function styles. The system employs vector quantization and a multi-stream Transformer for modeling orchestration styles, significantly improving arrangement quality and providing flexible control over various music genres and compositional levels.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper addresses the significant task of Multi-Track Accompaniment Arrangement, making notable improvements in the field.  
2. The authors have constructed a comprehensive framework in both experimental design and methodology, contributing valuable insights and data.  
3. The proposed model is evaluated through both objective and subjective measures, demonstrating promising results.  
4. The factorization of accompaniment generation allows for user control, enhancing the model's applicability.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The introduction lacks clarity, with key terms and relationships insufficiently defined, obscuring the motivation.  
2. The contributions appear incremental, primarily building upon existing work from AccoMontage.  
3. The description of the proposed model is poorly organized, making it difficult to understand.  
4. High-level choices, such as discrete embeddings versus continuous, are not well justified.  
5. The quality of the final orchestral accompaniment is dependent on the piano reduction, which requires further discussion.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction by defining key terms and relationships before introducing mathematical notations. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more detailed justification for their methodological choices, particularly regarding the use of discrete embeddings and the rationale behind the orchestration function. It would be beneficial to clarify the impact of piano reduction quality on the model's performance and to enhance the organization of the model description for better comprehension. Finally, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the significance of their results in layman's terms to improve accessibility for a broader audience.
