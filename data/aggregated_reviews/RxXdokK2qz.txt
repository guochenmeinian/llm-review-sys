Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies stochastic approximation with constant step-size and Markovian noise, characterizing the bias between the expectation of the iterate and the desired limit. The authors demonstrate that Polyak-Ruppert averaging reduces variance but not bias, and they numerically show that Richardson-Romberg extrapolation can help reduce bias. The work extends previous results to cases where the Markov chain's transition probability matrix depends on the stochastic iterate, making it applicable to reinforcement learning algorithms with time-varying behavior policies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The writing is mostly clear, and the proofs are of high quality. The characterization of bias for nonlinear stochastic approximation with parameter-dependent Markovian noise is novel and original. The problem setup, assumptions, and analysis approach are clearly stated, contributing significantly to the field.

Weaknesses:  
Assumption (A2) is strong and difficult to verify in practice. The claim regarding Assumption (A4) implying global exponential stability lacks a reference and formal justification. Additionally, the results are primarily asymptotic, and the analysis does not sufficiently address recent papers that achieve similar bias characterizations and higher-order error bounds.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on how their work enhances existing literature, particularly in relation to [R1] and [R2]. Including a deeper exploration of previous uses of Richardson-Romberg extrapolation would also strengthen the paper. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to consider relaxing the assumption that parameters remain within a compact set, possibly substituting it with a moment bound for greater realism. Clarifying the experimental results in Figure 1 by including sample paths for different values of $\alpha$ would enhance visualization and understanding. Lastly, providing non-asymptotic results would be beneficial for practical applications.
