Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents "RealHumanEval," a web-based tool designed to evaluate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in assisting programmers. The authors conducted a user study with 213 participants interacting with six different LLMs to assess the correlation between static benchmark performance and human productivity metrics. The study aims to determine if improvements in benchmark performance lead to increased programmer productivity, revealing that while benchmark improvements correlate with productivity gains, the relationship is not proportional.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors propose RealHumanEval, a novel web interface for human-centric evaluation.
- The user study is well-designed, providing valuable insights into LLMs' impact on programmer productivity.
- The paper clearly presents results supported by appropriate statistical analysis, challenging the reliance on static benchmarks.

Weaknesses:
- The results may not generalize beyond the specific population of participants in the user study.
- The study focuses on a limited set of coding tasks, primarily in Python, and lacks replication of existing products' functionalities.
- The design decisions regarding task completion metrics and generation methods may introduce biases.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the study by comparing their results with state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs, such as GPT-4 and Claude-3-opus. Additionally, consider expanding the dataset to include a larger variety of tasks beyond the current 17, and explore the inclusion of other programming languages like C++ and Java to enhance the study's relevance. Addressing the design decisions around task completion metrics and generation methods could also lead to more realistic evaluations. Lastly, tracking user interactions, such as deletions of code completions, may provide deeper insights into user behavior and model effectiveness.
