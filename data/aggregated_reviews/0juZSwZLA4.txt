### Key Points
This paper presents an approach for document-level named entity recognition (NER) that aims to ensure consistent predictions for entities across a document. The authors propose a two-stage model: the first stage employs a binary classifier to identify potential entity spans, while the second stage utilizes a key-value memory to aggregate span representations and predict NER tags. Experiments conducted on biomedical, scientific, and general domain datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to baseline models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is novel and effectively addresses the task of document-level NER.
- The experimental results consistently outperform baseline models across various domains.
- The paper is well-written and presents a clear methodology.

Weaknesses:
- Important analyses supporting the claims are relegated to the appendix, which limits the interpretability of results in the main text.
- The paper does not adequately discuss the computational cost associated with the span-based approach, which is inherently quadratic.
- Some details regarding the approach are missing, hindering reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the main text by incorporating critical analyses currently found in the appendix to enhance argumentation. Additionally, a discussion on the computational limitations of the span-based approach should be included. Clarifying how entity spans are determined and addressing potential prediction conflicts would strengthen the methodology. Finally, exploring the efficacy of a sentence-level classifier followed by a uniform labeling approach could provide valuable insights and serve as a useful baseline.
