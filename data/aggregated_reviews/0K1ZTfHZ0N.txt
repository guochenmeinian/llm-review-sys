Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of non-monotone submodular maximization under a cardinality constraint in a fully dynamic setting, maintaining a good solution as elements are inserted and deleted. The authors propose a $(1/8 - \varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm with amortized query complexity of $O(\varepsilon^{-3} k^3 \log^3 n \log k)$ per update, building on thresholding techniques from monotone submodular maximization. The work addresses an open question from Chen and Peng (STOC 2020) and includes empirical comparisons with the Simple-Streaming algorithm from Feldman-Karbasi-Kazemi (NeurIPS 2018).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a $(1/8 - \varepsilon)$-approximation for fully dynamic non-monotone submodular maximization, contributing significantly to the field.
- It effectively connects monotone and non-monotone submodular maximization through thresholding techniques.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments lack motivation and depth, primarily focusing on video frame summarization and a sliding window model, with limited comparisons to relevant literature.
- The randomness in the update algorithm necessitates averaging over multiple trials in experiments, which is not adequately addressed, leading to noisy results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including more motivating comparisons, particularly against the three papers mentioned in the abstract. Additionally, it is crucial to average the experimental results over several trials and include standard deviation error bars to enhance clarity. The authors should also clarify the relationship between parameter $\tau$ and the results in Theorem 1.2, as the current description is confusing. Furthermore, we suggest refining the presentation, particularly the clarity of the dynamic setting description and the removal of unnecessary elements in the text.
