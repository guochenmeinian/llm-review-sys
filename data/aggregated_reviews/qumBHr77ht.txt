Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on robust mechanism design, focusing on how approximation guarantees of incentive-compatible mechanisms are preserved when prior distributions are perturbed by small amounts in total variation distance. The authors prove that dominant strategy incentive-compatible (DSIC) mechanisms can be robustly converted into alpha-approximate mechanisms without losing approximation ratios, while Bayesian incentive-compatible (BIC) mechanisms incur a small loss. The paper also explores various applications of the proposed framework, generalizing results from existing literature.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a natural and important question in mechanism design, with powerful yet intuitive technical lemmas.  
- The structure and clarity of the writing enhance the presentation of complex material, making it accessible.  
- The proposed framework is applicable to a wide range of scenarios, demonstrating its versatility.  

Weaknesses:  
- Some technical lemmas may lack surprising elements, though their application is commendable.  
- The organization of applications could be improved, as a key application demonstrating the framework's power is missing.  
- The approximation results lack upper bounds, complicating the evaluation of their tightness.  
- Certain claims are not accompanied by necessary conditions or caveats, and some proofs lack detailed outlines.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization of applications to include a key example that clearly demonstrates the framework's effectiveness. Additionally, providing more intuition for Lemma 5 and clarifying the use of the "fundamental duality property of total variation distance" in proofs would enhance the paper's rigor. It would also be beneficial to discuss lower bounds for the robustness claims and ensure that all theorem statements include relevant quantifiers and conditions. Finally, we suggest exploring the potential for generalizing results beyond revenue and welfare to strengthen the contributions further.
