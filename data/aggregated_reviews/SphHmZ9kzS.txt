### Key Points
This paper, "Self-Assessment Tests are Unreliable Measures of LLM Personality," critically reviews the measurement of models' personalities using the Big-Five personality test with the IPIP-300 dataset. The authors demonstrate that LLMs exhibit inconsistency in their responses based on prompt rephrasing and answer ordering, contrasting with human consistency as noted in existing literature.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is clear and well-founded, with a clear motivation for the experiments.  
- The results are significant for raising awareness in the community regarding the reliability of personality assessments for LLMs.  
- It systematically disproves previous studies that assumed LLMs possess a stable personality.  

Weaknesses:  
- The study's scope is limited, and it lacks consideration of more complex scenarios, such as fixed personality prompts.  
- There is insufficient discussion on the concept of "LLM personality" and its validity, leading to overgeneralizations about the unreliability of self-assessment tests.  
- The paper does not adequately compare the absence of ground truth in LLM assessments to established methods for validating personality tests in humans.  
- The novelty of the findings is questioned, as similar phenomena have been studied in other contexts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on what constitutes "LLM personality" and clarify their stance on its validity. It would be beneficial to define how such a personality could be measured or to argue against its existence. Additionally, we suggest exploring more intricate testing methods beyond direct self-assessment, considering psychological tests that account for non-collaborative responses. The authors should also address the relevance of certain test questions that may not apply to LLMs. Finally, we advise reordering the presentation in section 3 to first explain the experiments before discussing the results for clarity.
