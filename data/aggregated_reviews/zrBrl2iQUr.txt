### Key Points
This paper presents a dataset of 206 news articles annotated for partisan and counter-partisan events, defined as events that either support or neutralize the article's stance. The authors propose a human annotation framework focusing on reported entities and sentiment, utilizing classifiers and ChatGPT for ideologies and partisanship identification. Qualitative analyses reveal trends, such as the placement of counter-partisan events in right-biased media. The work aims to contribute to the understanding of partisan media reporting.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The introduction of a novel dataset for analyzing partisan news media reporting.  
- The human annotation framework is well-described and replicable.  
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.  

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty of the work is questionable, as it appears conceptually similar to existing studies on information bias and subframes.  
- The dataset size is limited, making generalizability of findings difficult.  
- There is a lack of error and qualitative analysis of results, which is crucial for understanding model performance.  
- Missing details in the annotation process and definitions hinder clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty discussion by clearly differentiating their work from existing studies on information bias and subframes. Additionally, increasing the dataset size would enhance the generalizability of the findings. We suggest incorporating a section on error and qualitative analysis to identify challenging cases for the models and explore correlations between qualitative characteristics and model accuracy. Clarifying the annotation process, including details on inspectors and guidelines, is essential for reproducibility. Finally, addressing the omission of the neutral class in the results section would provide a more comprehensive view of the findings.
