Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Context-Aware PoseFormer, a method that utilizes intermediate visual representations from pre-trained 2D pose detectors to enhance 3D human pose estimation. The authors propose a framework that integrates a deformable context extraction module, a pose-context feature fusion module, and a spatial inter-joint modeling module. The method achieves state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks without relying on temporal information, demonstrating significant performance improvements over both single-frame and multi-frame methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well organized and presents a clear, novel idea.
2. It achieves new state-of-the-art results, showing significant improvements over existing multi-frame methods.
3. The experiments are thorough, with insightful ablation studies supporting the claims of contribution.

Weaknesses:
1. The use of 2D intermediate features is not novel, as prior works have explored similar approaches, leading to potential memory consumption issues that need to be addressed.
2. The comparison of methods lacks fairness, as different 2D pose detectors are used, which may skew results.
3. The paper does not adequately discuss the limitations of memory consumption and the impact of temporal information on performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the limitations of memory consumption associated with using 2D image features. Additionally, the authors should provide a more balanced comparison with other methods that utilize similar visual features. It would also be beneficial to explore the potential performance gains from incorporating temporal information, as this is a widely accepted practice in the field. Lastly, we suggest clarifying the contributions of the proposed method in relation to existing literature on context-aware features.
