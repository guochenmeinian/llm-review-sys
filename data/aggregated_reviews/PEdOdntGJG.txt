### Key Points
This paper presents a universal transformer architecture designed to address arithmetic problems through a looped transformer model. The authors demonstrate that this model can generalize to longer sequences during inference by adaptively increasing the number of iterations. The study focuses on n-RASP-L problems, showing that the looped transformer achieves superior length generalization compared to next token prediction (NTP) and other methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work is pioneering in achieving non-trivial length generalization on mathematical tasks without relying on positional embedding tricks.
- The results are impressive, indicating that the looped transformer can solve problems previously unsolvable by standard transformers.

Weaknesses:
- The documentation of experiments and results in the main text is insufficient, potentially leading to misunderstandings.
- The adaptive inference time methods may appear somewhat hacky, and there is a need for clarity on the stopping criterion.
- The length generalization results may not seem particularly impressive compared to state-of-the-art outcomes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the documentation of experiments and results in the main text, particularly clarifying that only binary cases are considered for addition and multiplication. Additionally, we suggest moving some discussions related to Rasp-L to the appendix to enhance focus on experimental results. It would be beneficial to explore combining the looped transformer with Chain of Thought (CoT) techniques for potentially higher performance on challenging problems. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the depth of the encoder block in the loop transformer and its implications for adaptive inference time. Lastly, investigating the performance of the method on problems without n-RASP-L solutions could provide valuable insights.
