Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an inverse Relative Entropic Optimal Transport (RE-OT) framework for classification problems, particularly addressing long-tailed classification. The authors propose using inverse RE-OT with a time-varying prior, demonstrating improvements over existing methods like vanilla softmax and balanced softmax through various evaluations. The connection between RE-OT and classification loss functions is established, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated via experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a solid theoretical foundation and novel framework for RE-OT, with clear visualizations and explanations that enhance understanding.
- The connection between RE-OT and existing classification methods is well-articulated, as summarized in Table 1.
- Experimental results indicate some performance advantages over existing methods in long-tailed classification tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The impact of the work is questioned, as the paper lacks clear methodological or practical benefits of the RE-OT framework for classification.
- The differences between the proposed method and Balanced-Softmax are not sufficiently motivated, and comparisons with epoch-varying losses or two-stage approaches are missing.
- Improvements shown in evaluations are relatively minor, and the absence of error bars raises questions about the significance of these results.
- The paper contains clarity issues, including inconsistent notation and misplaced propositions, which may hinder comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by addressing the notation inconsistencies, particularly using $n$ for both the number of iterations and the dimension of polytope $\Sigma_n$. Additionally, we suggest revising Proposition 1 and correcting the typos identified in the equations. To enhance the methodological impact, the authors should provide additional intuitions on the practical benefits of the RE-OT framework for classification and include comparisons with epoch-varying losses or two-stage approaches. Finally, we encourage the authors to report error bars in their experiments to clarify the significance of their findings.
