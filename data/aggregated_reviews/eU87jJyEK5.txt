Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the SpeAr method, which utilizes spectral analysis and learnable class prototypes to uncover implicit clustering structures in graphs, addressing the prediction bias in zero-shot node classification. The authors establish an approximate relationship between spectral contrastive loss and spectral decomposition, optimizing node representations through iterative updates of class prototypes. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of SpeAr in mitigating bias issues.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The integration of spectral contrastive learning with learnable class prototypes effectively uncovers implicit cluster information, addressing zero-shot node classification prediction bias.  
2. The two-stage training method significantly enhances the quality of prototype representations, improving zero-shot classification performance.  
3. The innovative use of spectral clustering and the design of a spectral contrast loss contribute meaningfully to the field.

Weaknesses:  
1. The choice of k in Subsection 3.2 is unclear, and its correlation with the algorithm's class discrimination ability requires further exploration.  
2. The unsupervised spectral contrast loss formula is not explicitly detailed, which could enhance clarity.  
3. The theoretical analysis, while robust, could benefit from a deeper explanation of why spectral contrast loss yields the observed results.  
4. High computational complexity and insufficient experimentation on non-pre-trained models are concerns.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the choice of k in Subsection 3.2 and discuss its impact on class discrimination. Additionally, including the unsupervised spectral contrast loss formula would provide a more intuitive understanding. We suggest elaborating on the theoretical framework to clarify the effectiveness of spectral contrast loss. Furthermore, addressing the computational complexity and conducting more extensive experiments on non-pre-trained models would strengthen the paper. Lastly, providing detailed hyperparameter settings and discussing the implications of pre-training would enhance reproducibility and understanding.
