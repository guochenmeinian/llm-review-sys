### Key Points
This paper presents DOMINO, an algorithm aimed at enhancing time-series forecasting for short-term electricity consumption in France, addressing challenges related to sparse data and high computational costs. The authors propose a novel integration of Gaussian Processes (GPs) with a random walk model, building on the existing MAGMA algorithm. The effectiveness of DOMINO is demonstrated through synthetic datasets, showing improved predictive results compared to MAGMA.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The topic of Electricity Consumption Prediction is significant, and the presentation is clear.
- The paper is well-structured, with a logical flow from problem motivation to methodology and results.
- The approach combines GPs with random walks, providing a potential solution to computational limitations in traditional GP-based forecasting.

Weaknesses:
- The introduction does not adequately summarize the technical innovation, leading to confusion about the paper's contributions.
- The experimental section lacks sufficient results to support the proposed method's effectiveness and relies solely on synthetic data.
- The paper does not provide theoretical guarantees or empirical validation of reduced computational costs, despite claims of improved efficiency.
- The comparison with existing methods is limited to MAGMA, and only one evaluation metric, Median Absolute Error (MAE), is used, which may not fully capture forecasting performance.
- The title and abstract are misleading, as they imply a focus on electricity consumption while primarily using general artificial data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction to clearly articulate the technical innovations and contributions of the paper. Strengthening the experimental section with more results and including real-world data would enhance the validation of the proposed method. Additionally, we suggest providing a schematic representation of the approach to improve readability and understanding. The authors should also consider using multiple evaluation metrics beyond MAE and expanding comparisons to include other state-of-the-art forecasting methods. Finally, addressing the inconsistencies in index notations and ensuring theoretical clarity would strengthen the overall rigor of the paper.
