Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on learning-augmented online algorithms, specifically addressing the brittleness of Pareto-optimal algorithms in the one-way trading problem. The authors define brittleness as the phenomenon where small prediction errors lead to a competitive ratio (CR) that matches the robustness guarantee. They introduce the concept of consistency by profile F, which specifies target CRs over different prediction errors, and propose a profile-based algorithm to determine feasibility and identify online strategies. Additionally, an adaptive algorithm is presented, although it also suffers from brittleness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively formalizes the brittleness issues in Pareto-optimal algorithms, enhancing understanding of their limitations in practical applications.
- The concept of consistency by profile is a valuable extension of classic consistency, and the proposed algorithm for feasibility determination is an interesting development.

Weaknesses:
- The focus on the one-way trading problem raises questions about the generalizability of brittleness and profile-based algorithms to other problems, with insufficient treatment of the contract scheduling problem mentioned in the appendix.
- The definition of consistency by profile is easier for single-value predictions, leading to concerns about its applicability for multiple predictions and the challenges in specifying profiles.
- The algorithmic techniques appear to closely resemble existing methods, limiting the novelty of the contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the exploration of brittleness in other online problems beyond the one-way trading context, particularly by providing a more formal treatment of the contract scheduling problem. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the connection between Section 5 and the central theme of overcoming brittleness, and addressing how to select profile-based algorithms in practice, as multiple algorithms may yield different performances. It would also be beneficial to generalize the definition of brittleness beyond the maximum rate prediction. Lastly, we advise revisiting the integral in line 216 on page 5 to confirm its accuracy.
