Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the concept of *memoroids*, a mathematical framework that formalizes the update rules of linear recurrent models, analogous to monoids. The authors propose a resettable memoroid that eliminates the need for segment-based batching in training recurrent reinforcement learning (RL) systems, addressing issues of information leakage across episodes of varying lengths. They demonstrate that segment-based batching inaccurately computes gradients, leading to performance degradation, and show that their tape-based batching method enhances gradient calculation accuracy, resulting in better convergence and sample efficiency in memory-requiring tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of the memoroid formalism and tape-based batching are novel contributions that are clearly explained.
- The empirical results demonstrate improved sample efficiency and performance across various linear recurrent models.
- The paper is well-written and presents a clear comparison between tape-based and segment-based batching.

Weaknesses:
- The introduction of the method lacks clarity, particularly regarding parallel scans, which are only briefly mentioned.
- The experimental evaluation is limited, focusing on a single environment (POPGym) and not exploring multiple truncation horizons or environments.
- Some experiments, particularly those assessing the impact of segment-based batching, are unclear and do not effectively contribute to the paper's flow.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method introduction, particularly regarding the role of parallel scans. Additionally, the authors should expand their experimental evaluation by investigating multiple environments and truncation horizons to provide a more comprehensive assessment of their method's performance. It would also be beneficial to clarify the experimental results related to segment-based batching, ensuring that the conclusions drawn are well-explained and supported by the data. Finally, consider addressing the tone regarding prior works to foster a more constructive dialogue with the existing literature.
