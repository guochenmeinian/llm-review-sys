Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel algorithm for estimating the rate-distortion function using Wasserstein Gradient Descent (WGD), establishing a connection between entropic optimal transport and rate-distortion theory. The authors detail prior methods, perform WGD on relevant objective functions, and provide numerical experiments demonstrating that WGD achieves competitive performance with lower computational costs compared to existing methods. The paper also discusses theoretical aspects, including finite-sample complexity bounds.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper articulates an elegant connection between rate-distortion functions and entropic optimal transport, which has not been previously highlighted.
- The proposed method is insightful and demonstrates good numerical performance, supported by rigorous experiments.
- The finite-sample complexity results are a significant contribution to the field.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks substantial technical novelty, as it primarily bridges existing concepts rather than introducing fundamentally new ideas.
- The references, particularly regarding the Wasserstein gradient, are insufficient, missing key recent works.
- The clarity of presentation is poor, with several definitions and equations inadequately explained, leading to confusion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and organization of the writing, particularly in defining the Wasserstein gradient and addressing the notation inconsistencies. Additionally, we suggest expanding the references to include recent relevant papers, such as [Rigollet2022Sample], [Pooladian2022Debiaser], and [Feydy2019Interpolating]. It would also be beneficial to analyze the "debiased" entropic OT dynamics and address the exponential scaling of the constant "$C$" in (15) with respect to the regularization parameter $\epsilon$. Furthermore, providing more theoretical guarantees and discussing the computational costs associated with the particle method would enhance the paper's robustness.
