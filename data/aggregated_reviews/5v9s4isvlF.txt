### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the Physical Trajectory Inference Attack (PITA) aimed at exposing usersâ€™ historical trajectories in decentralized collaborative learning for point-of-interest (POI) recommendations. The authors propose a defense mechanism called Adversarial Game Defense (AGD) to mitigate the risks associated with PITA. The effectiveness of both PITA and AGD is evaluated using real-world datasets, demonstrating significant privacy concerns and the potential for effective defense strategies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation to address privacy concerns in decentralized POI recommendations is both interesting and underexplored.
- The proposed attack and defense mechanisms are well-founded, with the finding that Local Differential Privacy (LDP) is ineffective against PITA being particularly noteworthy.
- Comprehensive experiments validate the performance of PITA and the effectiveness of AGD.

Weaknesses:
- Clarity issues exist in the methodology, particularly regarding the use of the elbow method to identify visited regions.
- The quality of visual representations, such as Figure 4, requires improvement, specifically in labeling metrics accurately.
- The paper lacks detailed background on collaborative learning paradigms, which may hinder understanding for readers unfamiliar with the topic.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology by explicitly detailing how to utilize the elbow method to identify visited regions. Additionally, the authors should enhance the quality of Figure 4 by labeling the y-axis with the appropriate metrics instead of model identifiers. Providing more background on the collaborative learning paradigms in the introduction would also benefit readers. Furthermore, we suggest including a more extensive analysis of experimental results, such as visualizing the relationship between the number of interactions and attack F1 after applying AGD, and plotting changes in HR@10 with varying shadow sequences. Lastly, a diagram illustrating the distinctions between model-sharing and knowledge-distillation collaborative learning would enhance understanding.
