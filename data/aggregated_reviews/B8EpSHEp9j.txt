### Key Points
This paper presents a convolution technique for modeling 3D physical systems, emphasizing the balance between maintaining equivariance and identifying symmetry-breaking factors in the data. The authors propose a method that has the potential to improve accuracy and efficiency in various applications, particularly in understanding symmetry-breaking elements in phase transitions and fluid super-resolution tasks. The introduction provides a clear motivation for the work, and the structure of the paper is well-organized.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear motivation for the proposed approach.  
- It has the potential to significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of deep learning models in 3D physical system modeling.  
- Empirical evidence supports the technique's effectiveness in specific tasks.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks detailed explanations of technical concepts, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the field.  
- There is a perceived lack of novelty compared to existing methods, as the proposed approach appears to generalize previous techniques.  
- The differentiation from baseline models is inadequate, particularly regarding super-resolution tasks.  
- Several abbreviations are used without proper descriptions, leading to potential confusion.  
- The discussion section is too brief to adequately address the paper's shortcomings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing more detailed explanations of technical concepts, especially for readers who may not be familiar with the field. Additionally, the authors should clarify how their approach differs from existing techniques, particularly in relation to the relaxed octahedral group convolution. It is essential to address the lack of significant improvement compared to baseline models and to expand the discussion section to provide a more robust defense of their findings. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors list all abbreviations used in the paper and explain their meanings to avoid confusion. Lastly, we advise against using unofficial expressions and recommend directly mentioning the authors of referenced papers in the text for clarity.
