### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the theoretical performance guarantees for agents learned through self-play in multiplayer games. The authors propose that self-play algorithms can be effectively analyzed by projecting general games into the space of constant-sum polymatrix games, allowing for performance guarantees against new opponents. They demonstrate that this projection can yield bounds on the vulnerability of strategies trained via no-regret self-play, validated through experiments on 3-player Leduc poker. The paper also explores the convergence of regret-minimizing algorithms to coarse correlated equilibria (CCE) and establishes conditions under which these guarantees hold.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The topic extends theoretical guarantees of self-play beyond two-player constant-sum games, which is significant for the multi-agent learning community.
- The novel method of projecting games into constant-sum polymatrix games is intriguing and broadens the applicability of the findings.
- The paper is well-written, with clear explanations and a strong motivation for the problem addressed.

Weaknesses:
- The technical sections may be challenging for non-experts to follow.
- The experimental section lacks clarity regarding the convergence of CFR to low-exploitability strategies and does not explore a range of common tractable games.
- The use of the term 'vulnerability' instead of 'exploitability' may cause confusion, and the implications of this terminology should be clarified.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the technical sections to make them more accessible to non-experts. Additionally, the authors should consider including a broader range of common tractable games in their experiments to provide insights into the applicability of their findings. It would be beneficial to explicitly list the assumptions and conditions required for the theoretical results and to clarify the practical applications of their theory, particularly in predicting the convergence of no-regret algorithms in new games. Lastly, we suggest justifying the use of 'vulnerability' over 'exploitability' and ensuring consistent terminology throughout the paper.
