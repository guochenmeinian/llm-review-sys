Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a blind image restoration method leveraging diffusion models, termed BIRD. The authors propose an iterative optimization process that alternates between optimizing a parameterized forward operator and the initial latent variable of a DDIM, ensuring that the restored images lie on the data manifold of the pretrained diffusion model. The authors claim that BIRD is the first to apply diffusion inversion for inverse restoration (IR), highlighting its unique optimization-based framework compared to existing sampling methods like GDP and open-set methods like TAO. The objective function \( J(\epsilon_\theta) \) aligns with the original training objective of the vanilla diffusion model, allowing for efficient sampling without retraining. Experiments conducted on various image restoration tasks demonstrate the method's effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method does not alter the reverse sampling process and generates images on the data manifold at every iteration.
- It is adaptable to multiple image restoration tasks, such as deblurring, super-resolution, and JPEG de-artifacting, without requiring model retraining or fine-tuning.
- The authors effectively combine well-known techniques, resulting in a noteworthy contribution to the field.
- The theoretical analysis, particularly in sections 3.2 - 3.2.2, is commendable, providing a solid foundation for the proposed method.
- BIRD represents a significant advancement in applying diffusion models to inverse imaging, providing a fresh perspective on inversion in inverse problems.

Weaknesses:
- The work does not sufficiently distinguish itself from existing methods, particularly in the context of GAN and diffusion models.
- Some reviewers reserve their opinions on the distinction between BIRD and existing inversion-based IR methods, lacking further justification.
- The optimizable degradation model has been previously presented in the GDP paper, and the iterative optimization approach has been adopted in the TAO paper, with insufficient differentiation from these existing approaches.
- Concerns remain regarding the differences between BIRD and other methods like GDP and TAO, which may not be fully addressed.
- The computational efficiency claims are not supported by the timing results in Table 2, and performance metrics in Table 4 do not substantiate the assertion of achieving state-of-the-art results.
- The theoretical analysis in section 3.1 requires thorough revision, and much of the theoretical content relies heavily on related work, limiting the perceived novelty.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the differentiation of their method from existing approaches, particularly addressing how it uniquely contributes to the field. Specifically, we suggest that the authors clarify the distinctions between BIRD and existing inversion-based IR methods by providing specific examples or references to prior work. Additionally, the authors should enhance the theoretical analysis in section 3.1, ensuring clarity and robustness in foundational aspects. Specific areas needing attention include clarifying ambiguous phrases, fixing notation issues, and ensuring that all relevant benchmarks and advanced methods are included in the experimental comparisons. Furthermore, we suggest including results for the version with \( \delta t=1 \) in Tables 1, 3, and 4, and correcting any inaccuracies in figures and captions. Finally, the authors should provide a more comprehensive discussion of the limitations and potential failure cases of their method, particularly in relation to non-blind methods.
