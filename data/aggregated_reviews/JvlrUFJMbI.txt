Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a large-scale routing dataset that includes diverse multi-objective navigation queries expressed in natural language, based on the annotated road networks of US cities. The authors propose an autoregressive baseline method utilizing a standard transformer network, demonstrating its effectiveness for the task. The dataset comprises 1 million queries, with a significant portion augmented by a language model, raising questions about the accuracy of this augmentation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The dataset includes both training and test sets, facilitating the development of learning-based algorithms, along with an automatic evaluation metric based on human-labeled interpretations.
2. The transformer-based baseline method shows promising performance, indicating the potential of learning-based approaches for this problem.
3. The task of using natural language for waypoint setting in route planning is practically relevant and the proposed autoregressive method represents a novel extension of multimodal large models.

Weaknesses:
1. Concerns exist regarding the accuracy of the language model's augmentation and rephrasing, which may impact the structured interpretation used for evaluation.
2. The evaluation metrics may not adequately reflect user requirements, as they do not consider the length difference between planned and optimal paths.
3. There is a lack of clarity on how annotated labels are utilized in the baseline method, and whether the poor performance is due to inadequate adaptation to the task.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the dataset composition by specifying the number of human-written versus language model-augmented queries, as well as the proportion of multi-objective queries. Additionally, we suggest revising the evaluation metrics to incorporate path length differences and planning delays. It would also be beneficial to provide a more detailed description of how the annotated labels are used in the baseline method. Lastly, addressing the biases in the proposed architecture related to candidate edge encoding could enhance the model's performance.
