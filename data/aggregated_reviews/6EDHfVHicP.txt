Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DDF-HO, a method for handheld object reconstruction utilizing Directed Distance Fields (DDF). Unlike previous approaches that rely on Signed Distance Fields (SDF), DDF-HO reconstructs objects from a single RGB image without templates or depth priors. The authors demonstrate the method's superiority through experiments on three datasets, showing significant improvements in reconstruction accuracy due to the use of DDF, a ray-based feature aggregation scheme, and a 3D intersection-aware hand pose embedding. The authors also propose a Ray-Based Feature Aggregation method that offers superior reconstruction results compared to previous SDF-based methods while maintaining real-time performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- DDF-HO achieves higher quality 3D reconstructions compared to recent methods, as evidenced by comprehensive experiments.
- The method is well-documented, allowing for reasonable reproduction, with code provided.
- Extensive evaluation on large-scale datasets and informative ablation studies enhance the understanding of the method's capabilities.
- The proposed method opens new avenues for hand-held object reconstruction and demonstrates better reconstruction results than SDF-based methods while achieving real-time performance.

Weaknesses:
- The complexity of DDF-HO, involving multiple steps such as ray sampling and feature aggregation, raises concerns about speed and efficiency. More analysis on the trade-offs between speed and accuracy is needed.
- The handling of symmetric objects lacks clarity, particularly regarding the discovery of reflective planes.
- Insufficient qualitative results and details on ray sampling strategies during testing are noted, which could enhance the understanding of the method's performance.
- No explicit weaknesses were mentioned in the second summary, but the concerns raised in the first summary remain relevant.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the symmetric object handling section, particularly how reflective planes are identified. Additionally, providing more detailed analysis on the training and inference times for DDF-HO compared to IHOI would be beneficial. Including qualitative results of the ablation studies, especially concerning the symmetry loss term, would strengthen the paper. Lastly, we suggest elaborating on the ray sampling strategies used during testing to clarify their impact on performance. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to engage with reviewers by addressing any remaining concerns and considering further discussions to enhance the quality of the work.
