Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Generalized Weighted PCZero (GW-PCZero), an extension of EfficientZero and PCZero aimed at generalizing path consistency (PC) from board games to Atari games. The authors introduce a weighting mechanism to enhance sample efficiency and prove that neural-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) can guarantee optimal solutions under PC constraints. GW-PCZero achieves a mean human normalized performance of 198% on the Atari 100k benchmark, surpassing EfficientZero's 194% while using only 25% of its computational resources. The paper includes extensive experimental data across various environments, demonstrating the method's generality. Additionally, the authors explore PC as a global constraint for optimal paths in reinforcement learning, showing its potential to enhance learning efficiency. Experimental results indicate that while SC loss can improve performance, PC loss is more effective, with the choice of hyperparameter λ varying based on game complexity and impacting performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. GW-PCZero achieves slightly higher performance on the Atari 100k benchmark than the state-of-the-art EfficientZero while consuming significantly less computational resources.
2. The paper effectively generalizes path consistency to environments with immediate rewards, enhancing its applicability.
3. The theoretical proof provided for neural-guided MCTS under PC constraints is a valuable contribution.
4. The experiments are comprehensive, covering multiple environments and including detailed analyses of hyperparameters.
5. The study provides a thorough examination of path consistency and its application in reinforcement learning, supported by experimental results across various Atari games.
6. The authors effectively demonstrate the theoretical foundations of PC and its relationship with temporal difference (TD) learning.

Weaknesses:
1. The proposed method largely combines existing concepts from PCZero and EfficientZero without introducing significantly novel ideas.
2. The novelty of GW-PCZero is questioned due to its similarity to the previously published SCZero, which employs a similar loss function.
3. Concerns are raised regarding the implementation of PC loss, particularly its effectiveness in off-policy settings and potential suboptimal training outcomes.
4. The sensitivity of results to hyperparameter choices, particularly the weighting factor and λ, raises concerns about the robustness of the method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors improve the novelty discussion by explicitly addressing the similarities and differences between GW-PCZero and SCZero, including a comparison of their effectiveness.
2. We suggest that the authors conduct additional experiments to demonstrate the robustness of GW-PCZero across various Atari environments and provide results with fixed hyperparameters to assess performance stability.
3. We recommend including a limitations section that explicitly outlines potential weaknesses, such as hyperparameter sensitivity and the implications of using an off-policy algorithm.
4. We encourage the authors to clarify the theoretical guarantees related to the weighting mechanism and provide further experimental validation of its effectiveness in reducing variance.
5. We suggest conducting further experiments to demonstrate the benefits of using PC loss as an auxiliary loss in model-free methods.
6. We advise the authors to clarify the distinctions between predicted and ground-truth rewards in their equations and to improve the labeling in their figures for better reader comprehension.
7. We recommend addressing the off-policy issues more robustly, perhaps by integrating PC loss with on-policy model-based algorithms, to enhance the clarity and effectiveness of the proposed approach.
8. We suggest appending pseudocode in the appendix to clarify the workings of GW-PCZero and highlight differences from prior work like PCZero.
