### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the impact of scaling and retrieval augmentation on the consistency of language models, specifically their ability to provide consistent answers to semantically equivalent questions. The authors utilize the ParaRel dataset, which consists of semantically equivalent cloze-style English query paraphrases, to conduct their experiments. The findings indicate that while up-scaling models improves consistency to some extent, retrieval augmentation using the RAG model Atlas yields significantly better results. The authors also explore various factors affecting consistency, including retrieval consistency and the relevance of retrieved text.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper introduces an improved benchmark (ParaRel) that emphasizes consistency.  
2. The approach is well formalized and structured.  
3. The experimentation is abundant and yields convincing results.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The improvement from retrieval augmentation is not surprising and does not extend significantly beyond existing knowledge.  
2. The study is limited to a single dataset, which may restrict the generalizability of the results.  
3. There is no exploration of the combined effects of higher parameter counts and retrieval-based enhancements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper's title to reflect the specific focus on the ParaRel dataset. Additionally, we suggest reorganizing the paper to present hypotheses and results in a more immediate manner, enhancing readability. Providing examples, particularly for the procedures discussed in lines 450 to 462, would also be beneficial. Finally, exploring other approaches, such as the use of knowledge graphs for achieving perfect consistency, could add depth to the discussion.
