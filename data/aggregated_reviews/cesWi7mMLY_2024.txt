Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach called normalized outlier distribution adaptation (AdaptOD) to address the distribution shift problem in long-tailed recognition (LTR) scenarios, where ID classes are heavily imbalanced. The authors propose two main components: Dynamic Outlier Distribution Adaptation (DODA), which dynamically aligns the outlier distribution with the true OOD distribution during inference, and dual-normalized energy (DNE) loss, which balances prediction energy across imbalanced ID samples. The effectiveness of AdaptOD is demonstrated through experiments on benchmark datasets, indicating its superiority in handling long-tailed OOD detection.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and easy to understand.
2. The studied problem is significant, and the proposed method is novel, showing improvements over existing techniques.
3. The empirical evaluation is comprehensive, with results outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The accuracy on ID data is not reported, which would enhance the comprehensiveness of the results.
2. The motivation and theoretical foundation for DODA are unclear, raising questions about its effectiveness and the implications of using true OOD samples during adaptation.
3. The overview of Figure 2 is difficult to understand due to excessive details, and the reliance on auxiliary outliers may limit practical applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Figure 2 by simplifying it and highlighting only essential information. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more detailed theoretical analysis of DODA to clarify its mechanism and motivation. It would also be beneficial to report accuracy on ID data to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the method's performance. Finally, we encourage the authors to discuss the implications of using true OOD samples during adaptation and how this might affect the generalizability of their approach.
