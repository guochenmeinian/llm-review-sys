### Key Points
This paper investigates stancetaking in nearly 1.8k Reddit communities, proposing a "stance context" vector representation that operationalizes stancetaking by masking intensifiers and generating Sentence BERT (SBERT) representations. The authors reduce these representations into vectors capturing dimensions of valence, arousal, dominance, formality, and politeness, aggregating them at the community level. The findings suggest that these representations are distinct from previous measures and more accurately predict user cross-posting behavior, revealing relationships between stancetaking and community characteristics like loyalty and activity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively bridges sociolinguistics and computational NLP, providing a strong motivation for the study of stancetaking.
- The qualitative analysis of community differences is informative, particularly in contrasting communities with low textual similarity but high stance context similarity.
- The prediction task demonstrates the utility of stance context in capturing community individuality.

Weaknesses:
- The rationale for selecting only 38 intensifiers from a larger pool is unclear, raising questions about generalizability.
- The focus on specific features (politeness, affect, formality) may limit the richness of the SBERT vectors, which could contain more informative data.
- The evaluation of the proposed stance context features lacks validation against human scores, and the investigation of cross-posting behavior is limited.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their methodology, particularly in explaining the selection process for stance intensifiers and the rationale for focusing solely on them. Including analyses of additional stance markers could enhance the soundness of the findings. We suggest emphasizing Section 6 more prominently to illustrate practical applications of stance context representations in future analyses. Additionally, validating the model-based scores against human judgments would strengthen the paper's contributions. Lastly, providing clearer definitions and examples of stance markers in the introduction would improve reader comprehension.
