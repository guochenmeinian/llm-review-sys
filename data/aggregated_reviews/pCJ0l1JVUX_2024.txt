Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Hamba, a novel technique for reconstructing 3D hand models from a single RGB image. The authors propose a Graph-guided State Space (GSS) block that combines graph learning with Mamba state space modeling, effectively addressing the limitations of previous transformer-based methods in handling occlusion, truncation, and the spatial relationships among hand joints. Hamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on the FreiHAND benchmark, demonstrating both efficiency and adaptability with significantly fewer tokens than traditional methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed network structure significantly enhances prediction accuracy, as shown by results on the FreiHAND and HO3D leaderboards.
2. The experiments on hand pose estimation are comprehensive and well-detailed.
3. The methodology is clearly articulated and easy to follow.
4. Implementation code is provided in the supplementary materials.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper claims efficiency but lacks ablation studies to substantiate this, focusing solely on accuracy-related experiments.
2. The assertion that the method can serve as a “plug-and-play module” is not validated, as experiments are limited to hand pose estimation.
3. Several typographical errors are present, including a citation error on Line 92.
4. The motivation behind the proposed approach is unclear, particularly in how it improves upon existing methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve their paper by including ablation studies to demonstrate the claimed efficiency in terms of inference time and GPU memory usage. Additionally, we suggest that the authors attempt to apply their GSS block to full-body pose estimation to validate its plug-and-play capability. Clarifying the motivation for the proposed approach and providing more qualitative comparisons with the baseline Hamer model would enhance the paper's argument. Lastly, addressing typographical errors and expanding the limitations section to include observed failure cases and other weaknesses would strengthen the overall presentation.
