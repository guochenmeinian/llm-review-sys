Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for 3D visual grounding that incorporates contextual object detection and relation modeling through three modules: a language-guided object detection module, a relation matching network, and a target inference network. The authors propose a pseudo-label generation strategy to supervise the detection of contextual objects, addressing the challenges posed by the scarcity of labeled data in 3D vision-language tasks. The method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple datasets, supported by extensive ablation studies that validate the design choices. Additionally, the authors have received positive feedback regarding the clarity of their architecture and the motivations behind their design choices, with stratified quantitative results and qualitative examples enhancing the paper's impact.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method achieves SOTA results with significant improvements over previous approaches.
- The proposed approach effectively addresses the challenges of data scarcity in 3D vision-language tasks.
- The paper includes thorough ablation studies that effectively demonstrate the importance of each module.
- The authors' explanations have clarified the architecture and design motivations, contributing to the paper's overall readability.
- The writing is generally clear, and the technical details necessary for reproduction are well-presented.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity in several sections, particularly regarding the pseudo-label generation process and the training methodology.
- There are confusions about the supervision of contextual objects and the rationale behind using pseudo-labels instead of available ground truth data.
- The related works section is not comprehensive, missing discussions on existing methods that model contextual relationships.
- Some reviewers expressed concerns that prevented a higher recommendation, indicating that further improvements are needed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper, particularly in Section 3.2 regarding pseudo-label generation, possibly by including a visual diagram. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed analysis of the pseudo labels' quality and their impact on the model's performance. It would also be beneficial to enhance the related works section by discussing existing methods that supervise contextual objects and their relevance to the proposed approach. Lastly, addressing the specific questions raised about the training process and the rationale for using pseudo-labels would significantly aid reader comprehension. Incorporating the suggested revisions and enhancing the presentation of results will be crucial for elevating the paper's overall quality and reception.
