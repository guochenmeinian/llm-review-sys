### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for initializing machine learning services tailored to diverse user preferences, addressing challenges such as non-convex optimization and the absence of pre-existing user preference data. The authors propose a randomized algorithm that adaptively selects a minimal set of users for data collection, ensuring a total loss close to the global optimum under mild assumptions. The approach extends the k-means++ algorithm to a broader problem class and is supported by experiments on real and semi-synthetic datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The authors tackle the initialization challenge in interactive ML systems, which has not been extensively studied.  
- The proposed algorithm is a significant extension of the k-means++ algorithm, designed for general loss families.  
- Strong theoretical guarantees are provided, including tight bounds on total loss, enhancing the robustness of the method.  
- Empirical results validate the algorithm's effectiveness in reducing total loss and improving service specialization, with fairness considerations included.

Weaknesses:  
- The computational complexity is not well studied, particularly in large-scale settings.  
- The algorithm's reliance on specific assumptions about loss functions may limit its applicability in practical scenarios.  
- Empirical validation is limited to two datasets; additional experiments across a broader range would strengthen evidence of effectiveness and generalizability.  
- The method's practical deployment in large-scale systems, such as Netflix, raises questions about user preference collection and clustering methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on computational complexity, especially regarding large-scale applications. Additionally, we suggest conducting further experiments on a wider variety of datasets to enhance the generalizability of the results. Clarifying the implementation of user preference queries in real-world settings would also be beneficial. Finally, exploring the impact of violating assumptions about loss functions and discussing user clustering methods prior to applying AcQUIre could further enhance the method's effectiveness.
