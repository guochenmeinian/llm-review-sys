Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a single object tracking algorithm that utilizes deformable memory and a dynamic relevance attention mechanism to explore historical and spatial information. The proposed method dynamically selects templates from a global representation memory at the token level and ranks tokens for interaction with search region tokens. It was evaluated on five benchmark datasets, achieving competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in long-term tracking scenarios. The authors claim that their method reduces memory consumption and enhances tracking speed, running at 71 FPS.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The overall architecture of the proposed solution is solid and well-designed.
- The adaptive selection of templates from past frames is an effective and novel strategy.
- The dynamic relevance attention mechanism for selecting tokens across spatial-temporal dimensions addresses template update issues effectively.
- The method demonstrates improved performance on datasets like LaSOT, particularly in long-term tracking scenarios.

Weaknesses:
- The title "deformable tracking" is misleading as it has been associated with tracking deformable objects.
- Experimental results show only marginal improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with some cases performing worse.
- The presentation of specific techniques is confusing, particularly the notation used.
- The novelty of the dynamic token selection is limited, as similar ideas have been explored in previous works.
- The comparison with state-of-the-art methods is unfair, as many previous methods used only a single template.
- Other multi-template strategies show limited improvement, particularly in long-term tracking, with some methods experiencing performance drops.
- Multi-temp-Direct lacks template quality evaluation, potentially introducing incorrect templates.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the title to better reflect the contributions of the work. Additionally, we suggest providing results using larger backbone models to strengthen the experimental validation. The authors should clarify the technical presentation, particularly the notation, to enhance understanding. To address concerns about novelty, we advise including a more comprehensive comparison with existing methods, particularly those that utilize similar dynamic token selection strategies. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore more sophisticated temporal update strategies for the OSTrack models to further validate their approach. Finally, we recommend improving the clarity of the memory and attention mechanism by renaming them accordingly and further exploring the limitations of existing multi-template strategies to enhance the discussion on the advantages of their proposed method.
