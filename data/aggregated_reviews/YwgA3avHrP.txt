Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a clip-assisted semantic image segmentation method for surgical instruments, adapting CLIPSeg to a domain-specific problem. The authors propose a mixture of prompt strategies to enhance text prompt information and employ hard sample mining to improve segmentation performance. The method is evaluated on two public surgical instrument segmentation datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to some fully-supervised and clip-assisted methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed method shows improved performance on surgical instrument segmentation datasets compared to existing methods.  
- Utilizing text prompts offers flexibility in segmentation targets, a significant advantage over conventional fully-supervised methods.  
- The paper is well-structured and provides sufficient detail for understanding the methodology.  

Weaknesses:  
- The key take-home information may be unclear, as contributions like hard sample mining and prompt strategies are common practices in the field.  
- The evaluation of improved flexibility with new segmentation targets is insufficiently discussed.  
- The novelty of the proposed modules is limited, as many have been previously explored in traditional segmentation tasks.  
- The dataset used for evaluation is limited, and there is a lack of comparison with inference time and other relevant models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the key take-home messages, emphasizing how their work contributes new knowledge to the field. Additionally, the authors should provide a more thorough evaluation of the flexibility of their method in handling new segmentation targets, particularly in comparison to existing models like CLIPSeg and CRIS. It would also be beneficial to discuss the limitations of their approach, including potential impacts on clinical practice and the risks associated with automated segmentation. Finally, consider including more diverse datasets and conducting comparisons with models like Segment Anything to strengthen the evaluation of the proposed method.
