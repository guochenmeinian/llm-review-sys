### Key Points
This paper presents a multi-turn cleanup dataset aimed at addressing discontinuities in spoken dialogues, focusing on disfluency detection at the dialogue level rather than the utterance level. The authors define a taxonomy of multi-turn discontinuities and collect a dataset based on this taxonomy, which they use to train baseline models. The dataset is expected to facilitate future research in multi-turn disfluency detection systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- The labeling schema is thoughtfully designed, addressing an interesting problem in spoken dialogue.
- The introduction of a new dataset is likely to benefit future research in multi-turn discontinuity detection.
- The detailed description of the data annotation process can aid subsequent data collection efforts.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks analysis using the latest LLMs, which could potentially enhance the results.
- It does not provide extrinsic evaluations to demonstrate whether the cleaned data is easier to process for downstream tasks.
- The rationale for using the Switchboard corpus over other datasets, such as the ICSI corpus, is unclear.
- The inter-annotator agreement statistics lack clarity regarding category-specific agreements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve their analysis by incorporating results from the latest LLMs to demonstrate the effectiveness of their dataset. Additionally, we suggest including audio data in the dataset, as non-phonemic information like prosody may enhance disfluency detection performance. To clarify the purpose of disfluency removal, the authors should provide extrinsic evaluations and specify the intended downstream tasks. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to share more detailed statistics on inter-annotator agreement and consider referencing relevant works on disfluencies related to the ICSI and TRAINS corpora.
