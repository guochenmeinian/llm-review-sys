### Key Points
This paper presents an evaluation framework for exoplanet atmospheric parameter estimation models. By dissecting the dataset into multiple frequent subgroups, the authors identify specific subgroups where model prediction performance deteriorates. This framework is intended to help recognize underperforming subgroups and assist in potential model or training dataset improvements.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The framework effectively identifies subgroups with deteriorating model performance, providing valuable insights for model improvement.  
- The authors demonstrate that the ensemble of models outperforms individual weak learners, highlighting the benefits of ensemble methods.

Weaknesses:  
- The analysis of planetary metadata as continuous variables lacks depth, particularly in visualizing Shapley values over continuous characteristics.  
- The comparison of individual learners against the ensemble could be more informative by examining the performance of different individual learners within the ensemble.  
- The framework may overlook minor groups that constitute less than 1% of the dataset, potentially leading to fatal errors in model performance.  
- The discussion primarily focuses on simulation data, with insufficient exploration of how the framework can inform the refinement of models based on real exoplanet atmospheric parameters.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the visualization of Shapley values by plotting them continuously over characteristics like planet surface gravity to identify trends. Additionally, we suggest comparing the performance of individual learners that compose the ensemble to better understand variance in performance. To address the potential oversight of minor groups, we encourage the authors to explore methods for compensating for corner cases that fall below the specified threshold. Finally, we advise discussing how feedback from this evaluation framework can be integrated into the development of actual ML/DL prediction models, particularly in identifying areas where more ground truth labels are needed for training.
