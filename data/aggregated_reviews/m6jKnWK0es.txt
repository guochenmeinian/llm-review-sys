### Key Points
This paper presents a Transformer-based approach, named HECTOR, aimed at addressing the extreme multi-label classification (XMLC) problem, particularly focusing on label refinement. HECTOR leverages hierarchical structures in the label space to predict missing labels effectively. The authors demonstrate the method's validity through experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, achieving significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- HECTOR outperforms baseline methods by over 10% across various metrics.  
- The approach effectively combines the characteristics of the Transformer architecture with task-specific features.  
- The paper is well-written, clear, and includes a rich set of experiments demonstrating the method's efficacy.  

Weaknesses:  
- The technical novelty of the model architecture is marginal, with limited modifications to the Transformer model.  
- Figures, particularly Figure 1 and Figure 2, lack clarity and do not enhance comprehension.  
- The paper does not sufficiently explore the model architecture or provide clear definitions of technical details, which could improve clarity.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of technical details by adopting a more formulaic approach to defining the problem and model. Additionally, the authors should conduct a more thorough exploration of the model architecture, including ablation studies to assess the contributions of the Transformer and label structure information. The future work section should identify more deficiencies and provide guidance. Furthermore, the authors should enhance the clarity of Figures 1 and 2, focusing on key aspects of the proposed approach, such as the smoothing method used in the loss function and examples of generated paths. Lastly, the authors should discuss the relevance of their approach to the Web context more explicitly in the introduction.
