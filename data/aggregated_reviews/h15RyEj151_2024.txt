Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical analysis demonstrating the necessity of parameterizing state-space models (SSMs) with complex numbers rather than real numbers. It establishes that certain complex linear time-invariant (LTI) systems cannot be accurately approximated by real systems of similar size, and that real LTI systems require exponentially larger state-space dimensions to achieve comparable performance. The authors also explore the implications of using diagonal dynamics in SSMs, revealing that while both real and complex-valued SSMs can be expressive, real-valued SSMs necessitate impractically large parameter sizes for learning sequences.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The theoretical statements are precise, and the proofs are well-structured, aiding comprehension.
2. The paper effectively distinguishes between model expressivity and practical learnability, highlighting the limitations of real-valued SSMs.

Weaknesses:
1. The contribution to the SSM community appears limited, as the necessity for complex parameterization may seem somewhat artificial without further restrictions on the matrix being diagonalized.
2. Experimental results do not robustly support the theoretical claims, and additional synthetic experiments could clarify the exponential gap discussed in theorems.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Theorem 1 by framing it as a counterexample rather than a definitive theorem, emphasizing that complex numbers are crucial for a specific subset of functions. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide empirical validation of their bounds in simpler toy settings to enhance the credibility of their results. Addressing the implications of selectivity in SSMs more thoroughly would also strengthen the paper. Finally, clarifying the relationship between their findings and existing literature, particularly regarding the work of Orvieto et al., could provide a more comprehensive context for their results.
