### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative approach to enhancing the performance of visual language models (VLMs) in mathematical reasoning and visual understanding tasks. The authors propose a question-driven image description pipeline that extracts keywords from questions, generates targeted captions for image-question pairs, and utilizes these captions as prompts for visual question answering (VQA). The approach is evaluated across various datasets, demonstrating improvements in accuracy and robustness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed captioning pipeline significantly enhances VLM performance on mathematical and reasoning tasks compared to baseline methods.
- By generating targeted captions and providing task-specific guidance, the method improves VLMs' focus on visual content and reasoning abilities.
- The pipeline shows consistent improvements across multiple datasets, including geometry, counting, and algebra.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a comparison of its approach to other state-of-the-art methods outside the VLM domain, limiting understanding of its effectiveness.
- The experiments are confined to smaller datasets and open-source models, restricting generalizability to larger-scale, state-of-the-art VLMs like GPT-4.
- The quality of generated captions depends on accurate keyword extraction, and poorly structured queries could lead to suboptimal performance.
- There is insufficient error analysis, making it difficult to understand the reasons behind the model's mistakes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- We recommend that the authors include a comparison of their approach with the best models trained for VQA tasks to highlight the gap the VLM aims to close.
- We suggest exploring more complex problems beyond counting, such as approximating the number of objects, to better simulate human-like reasoning.
- We encourage the authors to incorporate techniques like RAG and few-shot prompting to enhance the human-like simulation aspect.
- We recommend providing a more detailed description of the datasets, types of questions, and conducting an error analysis to clarify the model's performance and areas for improvement.
- In Figure 1 on Page 2, we suggest improving the text format for better readability and clarity.
- In the Experiments section on Page 3, we recommend adding more details about the models used to emphasize their differences.
- In the Results section on Page 4, we note that ‘(Table 4)’ should be corrected to ‘(Table 2)’.
