Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a drifted variance exploding diffusion model that achieves an exponential decay forward convergence rate, improving upon existing models. The authors establish polynomial sample complexity under the manifold hypothesis and provide convergence guarantees for both total variation and 1-Wasserstein distances. They also introduce a tangent-based unified analysis framework that encompasses reverse SDE and probability flow ODE, yielding the first quantitative guarantees for state-of-the-art variance exploding models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of the drifted variance exploding forward process is novel and contributes significantly to the field.
- The paper provides rigorous convergence guarantees in total variation and 1-Wasserstein distances when data is supported on a compact set.
- The analysis is well-structured and clearly presented, making it accessible.

Weaknesses:
- The model's relationship with existing VP-SDE and VE-SDE models could be better clarified, particularly regarding the choice of $\tau$ and its impact on convergence guarantees.
- The experimental validation is limited to synthetic datasets; more comprehensive real-world experiments would enhance the paper's credibility.
- The convergence guarantees for VE-based models with reverse PFODE appear relatively weak, raising questions about their robustness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison of their model with existing VP-SDE and VE-SDE models by exploring the convergence guarantees for a fixed $\tau$ in the range $[1,\infty]$. This could help identify the optimal range of $\tau$ and its dependence on $\beta_t$. Additionally, we suggest including more extensive real-world experiments beyond synthetic datasets to validate the proposed model's effectiveness. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the necessity of the condition $\tau \leq T^{2}$ in Assumption 3.1 and to explore the potential for improving the convergence guarantees for reverse PFODE.
