Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Cambridge Law Corpus (CLC), a comprehensive dataset comprising over 250,000 UK court cases, aimed at enhancing legal AI research. The authors provide expert annotations for case outcomes in a subset of 638 cases and benchmark two language models, RoBERTa and GPT, for extracting case outcomes from the full text of decisions. The dataset is notable for its historical depth, with cases dating back to the 16th century, although it excludes courts from Scotland and Northern Ireland. The authors discuss the legal and ethical implications of using the corpus, emphasizing responsible data release practices and the importance of transparency in data quality assurance. They propose various evaluation metrics, including BERTScore, BLEU, and ROUGE, to better assess model performance and clarify the implications of word error rates for GPT models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
- The dataset is a significant resource for legal AI research, addressing a gap in publicly available datasets for judicial decisions.
- The authors demonstrate a solid understanding of the UK judicial system, enhancing the dataset's credibility.
- Ethical considerations are well-articulated, reflecting a strong commitment to responsible data usage and compliance with regulations like GDPR.
- The authors have made significant improvements to evaluation metrics, incorporating additional scores to enhance model assessment.
- The dataset's potential for diverse research applications is highlighted, emphasizing its importance in the NLP community.

**Weaknesses:**
- The dataset's restrictive license terms limit accessibility, particularly for independent researchers and students.
- The paper lacks clarity regarding the dataset's source, the corpus creation process, and the selection criteria for cases.
- There is inconsistency in the evaluation metrics used for comparing RoBERTa and GPT models, particularly regarding accuracy and F1 scores.
- The complexity of de-identifying personal data in the corpus poses a significant challenge, potentially affecting the dataset's usability.
- The manuscript lacks clarity in certain areas, such as the implications of the licensing terms and the responsibilities of researchers using the dataset.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding the dataset source by elaborating on CourtCorrect's methods for creating the original case dataset. Further discussion on the selection criteria for cases and the potential biases in the dataset would enhance understanding. We suggest providing additional details on the preprocessing steps, including the OCR error rate, and expanding on the quality control process for corpus updates. Additionally, we recommend that the authors improve the accessibility of the dataset by considering a more permissive license, such as Creative Commons, for at least a portion of the data. It is crucial to develop a unified evaluation metric for comparing RoBERTa and GPT models on the same task. Furthermore, including original MS Word and PDF formats in the dataset could facilitate the use of multimodal models, enhancing the processing of long court decisions. We encourage the authors to perform a more formal estimate of OCR errors by sampling a larger number of pages and to provide a detailed error analysis to address low F1 scores. Lastly, we advise the authors to clarify the terminology used regarding case outcome extraction and consider exploring the potential for additional legal tasks in future work, despite current space limitations.
