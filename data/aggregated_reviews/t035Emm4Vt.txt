### Key Points
This paper presents a multiple-instance-learning-based model, Weakly Supervised Detection of Misinforming Sentences (WSDMS), aimed at detecting sentence-level misinformation and assessing article-level veracity. The authors leverage social conversations to enhance fake news detection, demonstrating improved performance through a series of experiments on three real-world benchmarks. The approach is timely and relevant for the EMNLP community, showcasing the significance of sentence-level predictions in the overall assessment of article truthfulness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach of considering social conversations for sentence-level predictions is innovative and yields promising results.
- The experiments are well-structured, logically following the contributions made.
- The writing is clear and well-articulated, with a critical presentation of existing literature.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on an outdated BERT model for sentence representations may hinder optimal performance; newer models like Sentence-BERT could be more effective.
- The datasets used for experimentation are relatively easy, which may not accurately reflect real-world challenges in fake news detection.
- The sentence-level performance evaluation is deemed unfair, as the model lacks sentence labels, raising concerns about its prominence in the title and abstract.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the model by considering more advanced sentence representation techniques, such as Sentence-BERT, to enhance performance. Additionally, conducting experiments on more challenging datasets, where fake news is less prevalent, would provide a better assessment of the model's applicability in real-world scenarios. We also suggest that the authors clarify the distinction between misinformation and disinformation in their paper, as this could enhance the precision of their terminology. Lastly, we encourage the inclusion of a discussion regarding the user study in the main body of the paper to strengthen the overall narrative.
