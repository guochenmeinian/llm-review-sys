### Key Points
This paper presents Spache, a novel web caching system designed for low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks, addressing the challenges of web caching in these environments. The authors conduct a thorough investigation into the limitations of existing distributed web caches, particularly in relation to satellite internet connectivity. Spache integrates cache functionality onto satellites, utilizing schedule-driven cache prefetching and partitioning to enhance cache hit ratios and reduce latency. The authors demonstrate significant performance improvements through real-world evaluations, indicating a 19.8% increase in cache hit ratio and a 17.7% reduction in latency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of web caching challenges in LSNs, beneficial for new researchers.
- Spache effectively reduces user-to-cache latency by integrating caches into satellites, addressing unique challenges such as satellite mobility.
- Extensive experimental validation using real-world data supports the claims of improved cache performance.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a detailed exploration of why existing solutions, such as optimizing ground caches, are inadequate.
- There is insufficient discussion on practical challenges, including hardware limitations, energy constraints, and scalability of cache nodes.
- The analysis of link speed and bandwidth, particularly under high congestion, is limited, raising concerns about Spache's performance in dynamic conditions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the inadequacies of existing caching solutions compared to Spache, providing a clearer rationale for their approach. Additionally, a more thorough analysis of practical challenges related to hardware, energy, and scalability should be included. The authors should also address how Spache manages varying network conditions and potential congestion, ensuring that the system can adapt to dynamic traffic patterns. Finally, clarifying the contributions of the proposed prefetching and partitioning strategies to overall performance would enhance the paper's clarity and impact.
