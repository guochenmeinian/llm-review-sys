Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework named TFGDA for semi-supervised graph domain adaptation (SGDA). The authors propose a Subgraph Topological Structure Alignment (STSA) strategy that utilizes graph structure information to enhance the learning of domain-invariant node features. Additionally, the Sphere-guided Domain Alignment (SDA) strategy is introduced to align feature distributions in spherical space, while the Robustness-guided Node Clustering (RNC) strategy addresses overfitting by guiding the clustering of unlabeled nodes. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TFGDA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in SGDA tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-motivated, clearly structured, and addresses the common challenge of label scarcity in real-world applications.
2. The innovative use of topological structure information enhances the model's transfer performance, providing insights for future research in graph transfer learning.
3. The introduction of the SDA strategy for fine-grained feature distribution alignment in spherical space is a novel contribution.
4. The RNC strategy effectively mitigates overfitting, as validated by experimental results.
5. Extensive ablation studies and comparative experiments confirm the effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of TFGDA.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks discussions on practical applications of graph transfer learning in Section 1, which could emphasize the research's significance.
2. Clarification is needed on the dimensions of topological features used in the STSA strategy and the distance metric employed in constructing the Vietoris-Rips simplicial complex.
3. The advantages of the RNC strategy over K-means clustering should be elaborated.
4. Scalability of TFGDA on larger datasets, such as the AliCVR dataset, is not discussed.
5. A comparison with the recently introduced GIFI method is recommended.
6. The paper primarily utilizes academic graph datasets; exploring other types could validate the method's generalizability.
7. Discussion on the model's inference efficiency and additional quantitative metrics for transfer ability, such as the A-distance, is suggested.
8. A high-level algorithm table summarizing the SDA strategy's complex mathematical details would enhance clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including discussions on practical applications of graph transfer learning in Section 1. Additionally, please clarify the dimensions of topological features used in the STSA strategy and specify the distance metric for constructing the Vietoris-Rips simplicial complex. It would be beneficial to elaborate on the advantages of the RNC strategy compared to K-means clustering. We also suggest discussing the scalability of TFGDA on larger datasets like AliCVR and comparing it with the GIFI method. Furthermore, including a discussion on inference efficiency and additional quantitative metrics, such as the A-distance, would strengthen the paper. Lastly, a high-level algorithm table summarizing the SDA strategy would improve comprehension.
