Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the matrix denoising problem, specifically focusing on recovering rank-one factors from a rectangular matrix corrupted by doubly heteroscedastic Gaussian noise. The authors propose a spectral estimator that improves upon naive methods and prove that under certain conditions, this estimator achieves nontrivial $\ell_2$ error bounds. Additionally, the paper establishes a formula for the information-theoretic signal-to-noise threshold necessary for successful recovery and includes numerical experiments to validate the theoretical findings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and effectively introduces the main ideas.
- It provides a thorough mathematical investigation of the two-sided heteroscedastic spiked matrix model.
- The new algorithm comes with strong optimality guarantees.

Weaknesses:
- The assumptions, particularly that $\Sigma$ and $\Theta$ are known, seem tailored to facilitate the mathematical techniques, raising concerns about their realism.
- The paper does not introduce significant advances in theoretical tools, relying on well-known methods.
- Clarity issues exist regarding which results are rigorous versus heuristic, particularly in the appendix.
- Some figures could benefit from clearer presentation, such as using error on the mean instead of standard deviation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their writing by explicitly stating which results are conjectures and which are theorems. Additionally, enhancing the readability of figures 2 and 3 by using error on the mean would be beneficial. It would also be helpful to add a sentence that clearly describes the differences and advantages of equations (3.1) and (4.1). Addressing minor typos, such as defining $\sigma_2$ earlier and clarifying the Nishimori identity, would enhance the paper's rigor. Finally, we suggest considering the singular values of $A$ before and after preprocessing to observe the emergence of a spike, and exploring the initialization of the estimator in the context of AMP.
