Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the first comprehensive benchmark and dataset for general material state segmentation, introducing an unsupervised method for extracting patterns and textures from real-world images and integrating them into synthetic scenes. The authors propose a large-scale synthetic dataset and benchmark to evaluate existing segmentation models, demonstrating that general segmentation models struggle with material state segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments validate the dataset's ability to enhance model performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed dataset addresses a significant gap in the field.
2. The method for pattern/texture extraction and synthetic scene integration is simple yet effective, facilitating future research improvements.
3. The paper is well organized, clearly written, and supported by thorough experimental results.

Weaknesses:
1. The fuzzy threshold selection strategy lacks detail, including the exact values and experimental setups.
2. The de-redundancy strategy for extracted patterns/textures is unclear, raising concerns about potential redundancy.
3. Some figures have low resolution, and Table 2 exceeds text width, requiring adjustments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors provide more details on the fuzzy threshold selection strategy, including the random seed and number of runs.
2. We suggest addressing the potential redundancy in extracted patterns/textures and clarifying how this issue is managed.
3. We recommend changing some figures from PNG/JPG to PDF for better resolution and resizing Table 2 to fit within text width.
4. The authors should explain how the locations and sizes of the "points" mentioned in line 81 are selected, as this is crucial for the benchmark's quality.
5. We suggest including a comparative analysis with existing methods to better highlight the advantages of the proposed approach and validating the generalizability of the infused data across different domains.
