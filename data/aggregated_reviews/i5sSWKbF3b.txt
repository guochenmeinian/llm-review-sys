Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a decentralized gradient algorithm for the low-rank matrix sensing problem, utilizing a Burer-Monteiro type decomposition. The authors introduce a novel concept of in-network RIP, which integrates the RIP of the measurement operator with network connectivity, providing a new analytical perspective. The paper establishes convergence and generalization guarantees for the decentralized gradient descent algorithm over mesh networks and includes numerical simulations to validate the theoretical findings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and accessible, despite its complexity.
- The formulation of in-network RIP effectively captures the problem's intricacies.
- The study contributes solid theoretical insights into decentralized learning algorithms.
- The interpretation of results enhances the paper's readability.

Weaknesses:
- The proof techniques largely mirror those in prior work, potentially diminishing the theoretical contribution.
- The paper lacks practical applications for decentralized matrix sensing, focusing instead on centralized problems.
- The condition of $\rho$ in (12) appears overly stringent, and the required communication rounds per iteration are unclear.
- The experimental figures need improvement in presentation, particularly regarding font sizes.
- The authors should clarify the potential for exact recovery in noiseless scenarios, as indicated in the theoretical claims.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical contribution by differentiating their proof techniques from those in [34] and elaborating on the technical challenges in proving Theorem 1. Additionally, we suggest including practical applications for decentralized matrix sensing to motivate the proposed algorithms. The authors should also clarify the communication rounds required to satisfy condition (12) and refine equation 15 to better illustrate the sample complexity needed for a desired error. Finally, we encourage the authors to enhance the presentation of figures in the experimental section and provide further clarification on the potential for exact recovery in noiseless cases.
