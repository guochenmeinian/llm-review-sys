Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Dual Teacher framework to address the teacher-student coupling problem in semi-supervised semantic segmentation. The authors propose using two teachers that alternate every epoch to supervise a single student model, thereby managing an implicit ensemble that enhances model diversity and improves segmentation performance. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments on various datasets, including ADE20k and Transformer-based architectures. Additionally, the paper includes a comparative analysis of prediction distances between the Dual Teacher framework and both the Triple Teacher framework and PS-MT, highlighting that the Dual Teacher exhibits higher variability compared to the more stable Triple Teacher. The authors argue that the diversity of teachers correlates with the student's generalization capability, as evidenced by performance metrics, and assert that PS-MT's ensemble teaching approach results in significantly lower prediction distances, suggesting a lack of diversity in its teacher networks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
2. The exploration of the teacher-student coupling problem is novel and significant in the context of semi-supervised semantic segmentation.
3. The experiments are comprehensive, notably including evaluations on ADE20k and Transformer architectures, which is uncommon in this field.
4. The authors effectively demonstrate the relationship between teacher diversity and student performance, supported by empirical data.
5. Clear and detailed tables enhance the readability of the results.
6. The authors provide code in the supplementary material.

Weaknesses:
1. Additional explanations are required for Table 5, particularly regarding the performance of the Triple Teacher framework compared to the Dual Teacher framework. It may be beneficial to plot the prediction distance of the Triple Teacher framework in Figure 2(a) to support claims about model diversity.
2. The paper lacks sufficient ablation studies, making it challenging to assess the effectiveness of individual components. Starting from the mean-teacher framework and adding components incrementally would be more informative.
3. Figure 1(c) appears to contain inaccuracies; the inputs to the teacher and student models should be clarified.
4. The reported results for PS-MT are perceived as unfair due to the use of higher-quality labeled splits, which may skew comparisons.
5. The paper lacks initial comparisons with other methods like AugSeg and UniMatch, which could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of Table 5, particularly regarding the performance of the Triple Teacher framework, and consider including a plot of the prediction distance in Figure 2(a). Additionally, we suggest conducting more ablation studies to clarify the contributions of each component, potentially beginning with the mean-teacher framework. Please correct Figure 1(c) to accurately reflect the inputs to the teacher and student models. Furthermore, we recommend including comparisons with AugSeg and UniMatch in the initial submission to provide a more balanced evaluation. Lastly, the authors should address the concerns regarding the fairness of the splits used for PS-MT to strengthen their claims and clarify the impact of using ClassMix, exploring the results without it to better understand its contribution to performance.
