### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach called Re-KGR, aimed at reducing hallucination scenarios in large language models (LLMs) by detecting entities prone to hallucination and extracting triplet knowledge triples (subject, predicate, object). The method employs knowledge graph retrieval to obtain relevant triples, comparing generated triples with retrieved ones to rectify inconsistencies. The authors apply Re-KGR to the Llama model and its variant, DoLa, demonstrating performance improvements on the MedQuAD dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured, clearly addressing the issue of fact inconsistency hallucinations in medical QA tasks.
- The literature review is thorough, covering hallucination definition, identification, and mitigation.
- The experimental settings are reasonable, and the motivation to enhance LLM trustworthiness is timely.

Weaknesses:
- The difference between LLaMA and DoLa is primarily in their decoding strategies, raising questions about generalization across different models.
- The authors do not benchmark other retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) baselines, limiting the analysis of the proposed method's effectiveness.
- The improvement reported is modest, around 2-3%, and lacks comparison with other hallucination control baselines.
- There are several typographical errors and unclear elements in figures and text.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by exploring the performance of Re-KGR across various decoding methods and models. Additionally, we suggest benchmarking against more RAG baselines, including simpler methods like feeding knowledge to the prompt via dense retrieval. To enhance the verification process, consider incorporating semantic similarity in triple extraction rather than relying solely on exact matching. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the logic behind Figure 1 and address the identified typographical errors for improved clarity.
