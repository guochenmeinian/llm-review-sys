Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DiffLogic, a framework that integrates rule-based reasoning and knowledge graph (KG) embedding for effective knowledge graph reasoning. The authors propose using probabilistic soft logic (PSL) to evaluate the agreement between inferred triples and weighted rules, leveraging embedding representations of entities and relations. The framework employs mechanisms to optimize performance, such as selecting essential triples for assessment and utilizing the sparsity of violated triples for efficient gradient estimation. Extensive experiments indicate that DiffLogic surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both effectiveness and efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Originality: The use of probabilistic soft logic (PSL) for neuro-symbolic reasoning makes DiffLogic differentiable, supported by tailored mechanisms for optimization.
- Quality: The framework is technically sound, with comprehensive experiments demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.
- Clarity: The motivation, challenges, and main ideas are well articulated, and the Experiments Section is well structured.
- Significance: The combination of KG embedding and rule-based reasoning through neuro-symbolic methods shows promise.

Weaknesses:
- Notation Confusion: Some notations, such as I^-_q, I^+_q, A, B, Z(), and the meanings of x(θ) and y(θ), require clarification.
- Writing Quality: The paper would benefit from examples to explain assignments x and y, clearer terminology regarding "ground formulas," and a more explicit connection between contributions.
- Efficiency Claims: The running time results should be included in the main content, and the time complexity of DiffLogic needs to be specified.
- Insufficient Comparisons: The significance of the work is undermined by a lack of comparisons with recent differentiable neural logic approaches and common datasets like FB15k-237.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of notations by providing examples for I^-_q, I^+_q, and explaining the necessity of A and B. Additionally, the authors should clarify the meanings of x(θ) and y(θ) and consider using x|θ and y|θ instead. To enhance the writing, examples for assignments x and y should be included, and the terminology around "ground formulas" should be revised for clarity. We suggest moving the running time results from Supplementary Material to the Main Content and providing the time complexity of DiffLogic. Lastly, we encourage the authors to include a more thorough comparison with recent methods and datasets to strengthen the significance of their contributions.
