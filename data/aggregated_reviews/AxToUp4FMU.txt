### Key Points
This paper presents Cross-Care, a benchmark framework designed to assess disease prevalence representation across demographic groups and evaluate biases in large language models (LLMs). The authors contrast LLM outputs with real illness prevalence data from U.S. demographics, revealing significant misalignments that suggest potential bias propagation in medical applications. The study includes co-occurrence statistics, testing of disease-demographic subgroup pairs, and a visualization tool, contributing to a comprehensive analysis of biases in LLMs within healthcare contexts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of Cross-Care as a dedicated framework for assessing biases in medical applications of LLMs is a significant contribution, with all data and a visualization tool available at www.crosscare.net enhancing transparency.
- The paper provides a thorough analysis of biases in pre-training data, using various architectures and alignment methods, and compares model outputs with actual epidemiological data, addressing critical implications for healthcare applications.
- The use of baseline models like Pythia and Mamba strengthens the study by assessing biases in the pre-training data.

Weaknesses:
- The systematic literature review process is inadequately described, lacking adherence to established standards such as PROSPERO and PRISMA, which could enhance the review's meaningfulness.
- The clarity and legibility of Figure 1 could be improved, and quotations in lines 108 and 109 require adjustment.
- Some methodological choices, such as the selection of window sizes for co-occurrence analysis and the exclusion of NER tagging, are not sufficiently explained, potentially compromising the study's validity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the description of the systematic literature review process by adhering to established guidelines like PROSPERO and PRISMA. Additionally, enhancing the clarity and legibility of Figure 1 and correcting the quotations throughout the paper would be beneficial. We also suggest providing more detailed explanations for methodological choices, particularly regarding the selection of window sizes and the impact of template variations on results. Further clarification on how ethical issues related to privacy and data protection were addressed would strengthen the paper.
