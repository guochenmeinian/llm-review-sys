Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies risk-sensitive action selection in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) under the centralized training but decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm, introducing the Risk-sensitive Individual-Global-Max (RIGM) principle as a generalization of the Individual-Global-Max (IGM) and Distributional IGM (DIGM) principles. The authors propose RiskQ, which adheres to the RIGM principle and is evaluated through theoretical analysis and experiments. The paper addresses environmental uncertainty, non-stationary policies, and partial observability as sources of risk, emphasizing a collective approach to minimizing risk in cooperative settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The contribution is novel and well-motivated.
- The exposition is clear, and the paper is easy to follow.
- The method is thoroughly evaluated with extensive experiments across various environments and tasks.

Weaknesses:
- Limitations of the approach are not discussed in sufficient detail.
- Some concepts, such as Dec-POMDPs and specific notations, are not adequately introduced, hindering clarity.
- The empirical improvements are marginal and do not convincingly validate the claims regarding RiskQ's effectiveness in risk-sensitive cooperation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of limitations and potential future work to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the approach. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the introduction of key concepts like Dec-POMDPs and ensure that all notations are defined to enhance readability. It would also be beneficial to analyze the representation capacity of the proposed method and address how risk considerations might impact convergence in certain scenarios. Lastly, we encourage the authors to refer to the appendix more frequently in the main text to highlight important information.
