### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of "mechanistic interpretability" within the NLP field, detailing its evolution and current state. The authors critically examine the divergence between traditional academic approaches and emerging trends in mechanistic interpretability, advocating for precise terminology and strategies to enhance dialogue between the two communities. The paper also discusses the historical context of interpretability research, tracing its roots from vision models to the current mechanistic interpretability agenda.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well-organized and provides a comprehensive overview of interpretability research history, effectively engaging with both academic literature and informal sources. It offers valuable insights for both traditional NLP researchers and newcomers to mechanistic interpretability, making it a timely addition to the BlackBoxNLP workshop.

Weaknesses:  
The paper assumes a certain level of prior knowledge that may alienate readers unfamiliar with both fields, limiting its accessibility. Key terms, such as "mechanistic interpretability community," are introduced without definitions. Additionally, the abstract lacks clarity regarding the four angles addressed, which could confuse readers. The authors also take a lenient stance on specific mechanistic techniques, which could be strengthened by providing clearer positions on their applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by providing a clearer overview of interpretability research and defining key terms before their introduction. Clarifying the four angles mentioned in the abstract would help set clearer expectations for the reader. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors take a firmer stance on specific techniques that qualify as mechanistic, as this would enhance the paper's argument and provide clearer guidance for the community. Additionally, incorporating objective evidence, such as citation network analysis, could further substantiate claims about the dissociation between the NLPI and MI communities.
