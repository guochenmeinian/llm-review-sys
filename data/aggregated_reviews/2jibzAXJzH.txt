### Key Points
This paper presents T5SCORE, a text generation evaluation metric that combines a discriminative approach trained on unsupervised data using contrastive learning with a generative approach that learns a conditional distribution. The authors evaluate T5SCORE on machine translation and summarization tasks, demonstrating its ability to assess generated texts in multiple languages due to its construction on mT5.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-structured and clearly motivated, effectively combining generative and discriminative approaches.  
- T5SCORE shows promising results across five datasets covering 19 languages, with gains observed in various tasks, including MQM and DA settings.  
- The authors provide ample experimental support for their claims and have released code and models for community use.  

Weaknesses:  
- There is a lack of technical novelty, as the generative metric merely learns a distribution similar to traditional unsupervised tasks, and the discriminative metric employs contrastive learning, which is not new.  
- The proposed method does not adequately compare with recent metrics like SESCORE and SESCORE2.  
- Experimental results are mixed, with other metrics like BARTScore and COMET performing comparably or better in certain tasks.  
- Some claims, such as the advantages of T5SCORE in specific analyses, lack clarity and sufficient support.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their work by clearly distinguishing T5SCORE from existing metrics and addressing the lack of comparison with SESCORE and SESCORE2. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed explanation for the minor gains observed in correlation metrics and ensuring fair comparisons between models of differing sizes. It would also be beneficial to evaluate T5SCORE on diverse generation tasks beyond machine translation and summarization, and to clarify the definitions of accuracy, locale, and style in the MQM section. Finally, we encourage the authors to include relevant references to enhance the discussion of related works.
