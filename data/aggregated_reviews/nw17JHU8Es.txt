Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents MathDSL, a domain-specific language (DSL) designed for solving linear equations through program synthesis, which, when integrated with DreamCoder, achieves superior accuracy and conciseness compared to existing methods like ConPoLe and Lemma. The authors introduce a novel AST-based metric for measuring solution conciseness, allowing for quantitative comparisons beyond mere accuracy. The paper is well-structured, providing a clear literature review and empirical findings that support the efficacy of MathDSL.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- MathDSL enables concise expression of equation solutions and demonstrates strong empirical performance when used with DreamCoder.
- The introduction of a new AST-based metric facilitates quantitative assessment of solution quality.
- The Appendix contains detailed discussions on the evaluation metric and MathDSL, enhancing reproducibility and future research opportunities.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation is limited to linear equations, necessitating broader testing across more complex mathematical domains.
- The paper lacks a clear emphasis on the novelty of MathDSL compared to existing DSLs and program synthesis systems.
- The conciseness metric may favor overly compressed solutions, potentially compromising pedagogical clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors provide more details on the training process of the models, including how ConPoLe and Lemma were trained on equation templates and how the models were evaluated on the test dataset. Additionally, we suggest including more information on the dataset used in the experiments, such as the selection criteria for equation templates and their characteristics. It would also be beneficial to discuss potential solutions to refine the conciseness metric to better account for pedagogical clarity and solution complexity. Finally, we encourage the authors to evaluate MathDSL's performance in more complex mathematical domains and consider comparisons with other existing DSLs beyond ConPoLe and Lemma.
