Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on selection bias due to hidden confounding in recommendation systems, proposing a solution called MetaDebias. The authors leverage heterogeneous observational data, combining confounded and unconfounded datasets, to train a meta-learning framework. Experiments demonstrate that MetaDebias outperforms baseline methods across various metrics and conditions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper compares the proposed approach against numerous existing methods on three benchmark datasets using several evaluation metrics.
- The approach is novel and addresses a significant issue in recommender systems.
- The experimental evaluation is thorough, with clear explanations of the methods used.

Weaknesses:
- The term "heterogeneous" to describe observational data is vague; clarity is needed regarding the datasets used.
- The related work section on causal inference lacks depth, particularly regarding the weaknesses of data fusion methods and missing relevant works.
- The performance improvement over previous methods is not substantial.
- Presentation quality requires enhancement, including spelling out abbreviations upon first mention.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the term "heterogeneous" by explicitly defining the datasets used. Additionally, the related work section should be expanded to better articulate the limitations of data fusion methods and include relevant studies on randomized trials addressing hidden confounding. The authors should also strengthen the empirical evidence supporting the performance claims of MetaDebias and enhance the overall presentation quality, ensuring all abbreviations are defined at their first occurrence.
