Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a systematic evaluation of calibration measures, focusing on their completeness, soundness, and truthfulness. The authors demonstrate that existing measures, while complete and sound, exhibit significant truthfulness gaps. They introduce a new method, Subsampled Smooth Calibration Error (SSCE), which modifies smooth calibration error by subsampling time steps, achieving approximate truthfulness. The paper also establishes a set of requirements for calibration measures, including truthfulness, completeness, soundness, and asymptotic calibration, and shows that many existing metrics fail to meet these criteria.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is the first to systematically investigate the truthfulness of calibration measures, providing extensive and rigorous proofs for all claims.
- It introduces the novel SSCE, which is complete, sound, and approximately truthful, offering a promising alternative to existing measures.
- The modeling and technical aspects are strong, with principled definitions leading to nontrivial theoretical results.

Weaknesses:
- The definition of truthfulness may not align with previous works, and there is insufficient discussion on the importance of truthfulness in calibration, particularly in relation to existing measures like ECE.
- Part III of the paper, which discusses the adversarial setting, lacks prominence and clarity, making its significance difficult to assess.
- The paper is lengthy and complex, with a lack of practical examples that could aid comprehension, particularly regarding the formulation of soundness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the relationship between their definition of truthfulness and previous works, emphasizing its practical implications. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the visibility and discussion of Part III to clarify its importance in the overall context of the paper. Including more practical examples, similar to those in [FRST11], would also help readers better understand the concepts presented. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide numerical experiments to illustrate the utility of the SSCE and its differences from existing measures, as this would strengthen the paper's practical relevance.
