Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to artificial neural networks by incorporating channel-wise quadratic neurons, inspired by dendritic nonlinearity, to enhance model performance. The authors demonstrate competitive results on datasets such as CIFAR and ImageNet while maintaining model simplicity and efficiency. The theoretical analysis and empirical results suggest that quadratic neurons can improve accuracy and generalization by modeling the covariance between input features.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper offers a well-supported exploration of quadratic neurons in ANNs, with clear theoretical and experimental results demonstrating their advantages.  
- Improved accuracy with fewer parameters compared to existing models is achieved through the integration of quadratic neurons.  
- The ablation study and analytical solutions provide valuable insights into the model's performance.

Weaknesses:  
- The theoretical explanations are limited to simplified settings, lacking rigorous justification for claims regarding generalization capabilities and biological plausibility.  
- The empirical analysis, particularly concerning ImageNet, raises questions about the fairness of the evaluation due to sophisticated data augmentation.  
- The connection between the theoretical analysis and practical applications in CNNs is poorly articulated, and the novelty of the approach compared to existing quadratic neuron research is not sufficiently differentiated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical framework by providing a more rigorous analysis of generalization error and the training dynamics of the proposed model. Additionally, clarifying the biological plausibility of the quadratic integration and its implications for synaptic connections would strengthen the paper. It would also be beneficial to include limitations in the main text rather than relegating them to the appendix. Finally, providing comparisons of computational costs and performance across different datasets would help substantiate the claimed advantages of the proposed model.
