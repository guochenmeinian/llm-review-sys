### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the use of local discourse relations and global discourse roles to enhance propaganda detection in political news articles. The authors propose a fine-grained approach that includes both sentence-level and token-level identification. They conduct statistical analyses and develop neural classifiers based on LongFormer to learn PDTB relations and discourse roles, demonstrating improved performance over existing baselines in propaganda detection.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively evaluates its hypothesis through robust statistical and empirical methods, with an ablation study highlighting the complementary nature of the proposed models.
- The results substantiate the authors' claims, and the task is well-motivated, addressing a relevant social issue.
- The writing is clear and accessible, making the main hypothesis and approach easy to understand.

Weaknesses:
- The empirical evaluation relies solely on one dataset, raising concerns about the generalizability of the findings.
- The chat-gpt baseline is rudimentary, and the potential of a few-shot approach and discourse relation information in prompts is not explored.
- The paper lacks document-level evaluation, which could provide a more comprehensive understanding of propaganda detection.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical foundation by providing a clearer definition of propaganda and distinguishing it from media bias, as well as conducting a more structured review of relevant literature. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explore the inclusion of discourse relation information in prompts and consider document-level evaluation to enhance the comprehensiveness of their findings.
