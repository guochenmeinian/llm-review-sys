### Key Points
This paper presents a novel quantum algorithm that eliminates the need for penalty terms in solving constrained problems by constructing a subspace where states satisfy the constraints. The authors utilize parity checks to ensure qubits remain unflipped throughout the process, enhancing error correction. The algorithm is demonstrated on NP-complete combinatorial optimization problems, achieving superior results compared to previous quantum algorithms. Additionally, the paper introduces a Hamming Weight Preserving (HWP) ansatz with parity checks, tested on quantum chemistry and constrained combinatorial optimization problems, showing improved performance on both simulations and superconducting quantum processors.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- **Originality:** The authors propose a quantum machine learning algorithm that effectively addresses constrained optimization without penalty terms.  
- **Clarity:** The paper clearly defines quantum computing concepts, provides detailed derivations, and thoroughly explains the quantum system's architecture.  
- **Significance:** The algorithm integrates constraint conditions into the optimization process, yielding more accurate results than soft constraints, with implications for machine learning in quantum computing.  
- **Quality:** The rigorous language, appropriate citations, and comprehensive analysis of experimental results validate the algorithm's correctness on simulators and real quantum computers.

Weaknesses:  
- The discussion on the scalability of the proposed algorithm is insufficient.  
- The paper lacks sufficient background information for the target audience, particularly in relation to machine learning and NeurIPS.  
- The novelty and impact of the contributions are difficult to gauge compared to previous work, as the main contributions appear incremental.  
- There are limitations regarding different results on superconducting processors versus simulators, influenced by quantum noise and small problem sizes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the scalability of the proposed algorithm to address potential concerns. Additionally, we suggest including more background information in the main text to better cater to the target audience. To enhance clarity regarding the novelty of the contributions, the authors should explicitly compare their work with previous studies, particularly "Rethinking the symmetry-preserving circuits for constrained variational quantum algorithms." Furthermore, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the advantages of the proposed HWP ansatz over UCCS and clarify the training process for the HWP constructed from fixed gates. Lastly, addressing the challenges of extracting feasible states without performing exponentially many measurements would strengthen the paper's contributions.
