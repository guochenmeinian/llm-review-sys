Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Parsimonious Latent Space Model (PLSM) aimed at enhancing latent world modeling through two main strategies: (1) introducing an additional hidden variable \(h_t\) to ensure parsimonious information for improved latent predictability, and (2) employing difference prediction rather than latent prediction. The authors demonstrate that PLSM, when integrated with various world model and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, yields better long-term predictions and enhances performance across multiple benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and engaging.
- The related work section thoroughly contrasts PLSM with existing methods.
- The proposed method is relatively straightforward to implement.
- Experimental results indicate that PLSM enhances long-term prediction accuracy.
- The experiments span diverse settings, including long-term prediction and model-based RL.

Weaknesses:
- The rationale behind minimizing the norm of \(h_t\) for achieving minimal representations is unclear, particularly since \(h_t\) appears deterministic.
- The necessity of the additional \(h_t\) variable is questionable; a bottleneck on \(z_t\) might suffice.
- The emphasis on difference prediction as a novel contribution is misleading, as it is a common practice in model-based RL.
- Performance improvements over existing methods (TD-MPC, SPR) are marginal, and empirical comparisons lack robustness, being limited to single-method evaluations in each setting.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical justification for minimizing the norm of \(h_t\) and clarify its necessity compared to a bottleneck on \(z_t\). Additionally, we suggest providing a more comprehensive empirical comparison with multiple methods to strengthen claims of PLSM's effectiveness. Addressing the marginal performance gains and enhancing the clarity of the writing, particularly in the organization of experimental sections and referencing of figures and equations, would also be beneficial.
