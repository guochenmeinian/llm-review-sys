Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the role of the normalization factor \(1/||\nabla L(x,w)||\) in the perturbation step of the Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) algorithm. The authors compare the behaviors of gradient descent, SAM, and its unnormalized counterpart (USAM) through experiments and theoretical analysis. They conclude that USAM lacks key properties of SAM, such as ease of perturbation radius selection and the ability to drift along minima, which are linked to SAM's empirical success.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and clearly outlines the motivation for understanding the normalization factor in SAM.  
- The theoretical analysis is thorough, and the toy experiments effectively isolate the investigated effects, supporting the conclusions drawn.  
- The study convincingly demonstrates the benefits of normalization across various settings.

Weaknesses:  
- The focus on USAM, which is not a relevant algorithm in practice, limits the insights into SAM's effectiveness.  
- Empirical verification in realistic scenarios is insufficient, raising questions about the practical implications of the findings.  
- The conclusions regarding USAM's performance are based on restrictive experimental settings, and the relevance of the results for practical neural network training remains unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical verification by training a range of models on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 with SGD, SAM, and USAM across various \(\rho\) values. This would provide insights into the practical implications of their analysis and clarify the difficulties in selecting \(\rho\) in real-world settings. Additionally, we suggest exploring alternative scheduling methods for the learning rate and perturbation radius, as well as addressing the potential differences in optimal \(\rho\) for SAM and USAM. Lastly, a broader discussion on the limitations and potential negative societal impacts of the work would enhance the paper's depth.
