### Key Points
This paper presents a system for validating the relevance and faithfulness of language model responses based on retrieved knowledge. The authors propose a method that retrieves knowledge, formulates a response, and validates it using an instruction-finetuned verifier language model. The approach is evaluated across multiple datasets, showing improved performance compared to other retrieval-based methods. The paper also introduces a verifier for RAG models to ensure the relevance of retrieved evidence and the correctness of generated responses.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured, clearly written, and easy to follow.
- It addresses an important topic by validating the faithfulness of model explanations.
- Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements across four datasets compared to retrieval-based baselines without verification.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of using a fine-tuned language model for verification appears incremental, as this concept is not new in the field.
- The need for fine-tuning the verifier may limit applicability to datasets with sufficient data.
- The analysis lacks clarity, particularly regarding the relationship between rectifying steps and end-answer accuracy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty aspect by exploring more integrated approaches that align retrieval and generation processes. Additionally, it would be beneficial to clarify how the label of groundedness for augmented answers is assigned automatically. Including a comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art methods for each dataset would enhance the evaluation. Finally, we suggest providing a clearer analysis of the relationship between rectifying steps and performance metrics to strengthen the findings.
