Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ManiBCI, a novel backdoor attack method targeting EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. ManiBCI employs a three-stage clean label poisoning approach, optimizing the selection of EEG electrodes and frequency masks for each class through reinforcement learning. The attack injects these learned masks into EEG data, resulting in high misclassification rates while preserving the original task's accuracy. Extensive experiments on three EEG datasets validate ManiBCI's effectiveness and robustness. The key contributions include introducing a stealthy backdoor attack for EEG data, manipulating multiple classes simultaneously without model training access, and providing experimental evidence of the attack's success across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
* Introduces a novel and stealthy backdoor attack method for EEG-based BCI systems using frequency transform.
* Demonstrates the ability to manipulate multiple target classes without needing access to the model's training phase.
* Provides strong experimental evidence of the method's effectiveness and robustness across multiple EEG datasets.

Weaknesses:
* Standard baselines (fast gradient sign method and universal adversarial perturbation) are not included for comparison.
* Limited to the datasets used in the experiments, raising questions about generalizability to other EEG datasets or real-world scenarios.
* The practical implementation of the proposed attack might be complex and computationally intensive due to the need for reinforcement learning optimization.
* The proposed methodology lacks clarity, particularly regarding the application of Fourier transform and reinforcement learning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the proposed methodology by highlighting its novelty and originality. Additionally, we suggest summarizing the proposed method as an algorithm to enhance understanding. It is also crucial to include standard baselines for comparison to strengthen the findings. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the experimental settings, particularly regarding inter-subject and intra-subject configurations, to address concerns about generalizability across different EEG signals.
