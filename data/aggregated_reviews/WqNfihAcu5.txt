Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a strategic variant of the multi-armed bandit problem where arms report rewards strategically. The authors propose an algorithm, S-SE, that integrates successive elimination with a carefully designed payment rule, demonstrating that truthfulness is a dominant subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE) under which the algorithm achieves logarithmic regret. The paper also analyzes the utility of the arms under S-SE and the dominant SPE, and evaluates the algorithm's performance against arbitrary arm strategies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The intersection of bandit learning and mechanism design is a compelling area of study.
- The paper is well-structured and accessible.
- The improvement of regret bounds over previous work by Braverman et al. through the extension of successive elimination and payment rules is noteworthy.
- The proof of truthfulness as a dominant SPE is significant.
- The near-optimal regret bound and its dependence on the gaps $\Delta_{1k}$ and $\Delta_{2k}$ are intriguing.
- Despite prior studies, the paper offers insightful and novel contributions.

Weaknesses:
- The discussion on the **Tightness of Regret** lacks rigor; intuitive claims about rational agent behavior should be clearly distinguished from proven arguments. The authors should clarify that they are providing intuition rather than rigorous proof.
- Similar imprecise language appears in other sections; it is essential to specify whether statements are intuitive or proven.
- A minor inaccuracy regarding Lemma 14 in Braverman et al. is noted, where the authors claim that no mechanism can guarantee more than $\mu_2 T$ revenue, which could be misleading.
- The claim regarding the best arm incentivized with a bonus of $O(\Delta_{12} T)$ may be a typo, as a larger bonus could lead to a regret bound of order $T$.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the **Tightness of Regret** section by adapting the language to emphasize that the claims are intuitive rather than rigorously proven. Additionally, ensure that similar statements throughout the paper are clearly categorized as either intuition or proven results. The authors should also correct the potential typo regarding the bonus payment for the best arm to avoid confusion. Furthermore, consider splitting Section 2 into multiple paragraphs for better readability and clearly highlight the observational model and assumptions. Lastly, addressing the minor typos and representation issues will enhance the overall presentation.
