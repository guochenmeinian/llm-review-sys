Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for semantic image synthesis using an unconditional generator, leveraging a proxy mask for semantic guidance to rearrange intermediate features. The authors propose a segmentation module that maps user inputs to the proxy mask in a few-shot manner. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which allows for image generation from diverse input forms, including sketches and scribbles.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The approach innovatively reduces the requirement for large paired datasets to just a single pair, potentially enabling new applications in image synthesis.
2. The authors conducted thorough experiments across different datasets and control signals, validating the method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. The formulation lacks clarity, with terms like $m_{proxy}$ and $K$ being undefined upon their first mention.
2. The paper introduces numerous loss terms without providing ablation study results to assess their impact.
3. The quality of generated images does not match that of previous methods, particularly in full-shot settings, raising questions about the method's performance and sensitivity to random noise.
4. The use of k-means clustering for generating proxy masks may be overly restrictive, particularly for datasets with varying semantic classes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the formulation by defining all terms upon their first mention. Additionally, conducting an ablation study on the various loss terms would provide valuable insights into their contributions. To address the quality of generated images, we suggest that the authors analyze the reasons for subpar performance compared to full-shot methods and conduct experiments to support their claims. Furthermore, a discussion on the limitations of using k-means clustering for proxy mask generation should be included, along with potential solutions to mitigate the impact of noisy masks on the synthesis results.
