### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive study aimed at improving language identification for low-resource languages. The authors propose the MCS-350 corpus, consisting of over 50,000 parallel children's stories in 350+ languages, derived from original-language and human-translated sources. They introduce a machine translation benchmark based on this dataset, demonstrating improved performance for African languages through fine-tuning adaptor units. Additionally, the authors present the LIMIT model, a hierarchical approach that enhances language identification by addressing learned confusion patterns in existing models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The MCS-350 corpus is a valuable resource for the NLP community, covering many under-supported languages and utilizing children's stories, a novel domain for low-resource data.  
- The hierarchical approach to language identification is innovative and shows promise in distinguishing between confused languages.  
- The machine translation benchmark adds significant value to research on low-resource machine translation.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks clarity on how the authors verified the accuracy of language labels in the corpus, raising concerns about potential "representation washing."  
- Key details regarding the machine translation benchmark, such as dataset size and parallelism, are insufficiently addressed.  
- The LIMIT model's justification and comparison with existing systems are underdeveloped, and the evaluation lacks a strong baseline for context.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding how they ensured the accuracy of language labels in the MCS-350 corpus to avoid misrepresentation. Additionally, we suggest providing more detailed information about the dataset used in the machine translation benchmark, including the amount of data for each language and the specifics of parallelism. It would also strengthen the analysis to include comparisons with existing models, such as training a fasttext model on the new dataset, to provide a clearer context for the LIMIT model's performance. Lastly, the authors should clarify the hyperparameter selection process in section 4.1 and improve the captions for tables to enhance understanding without referring back to the text.
