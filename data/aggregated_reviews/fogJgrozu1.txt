Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel localized adaptive risk control algorithm (L-ARC) that enhances the traditional adaptive risk control (ARC) framework by providing both average case and worst-case risk guarantees. The authors propose using a threshold function learned online from data streams via functional stochastic gradient descent over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The experiments demonstrate L-ARC's improved performance in applications such as electricity demand forecasting, tumor segmentation, and beam selection, particularly in achieving fairness across different data subpopulations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written, with helpful illustrations that clarify the localization effects of different choices of $w(x)$.  
- The proposed algorithm is novel and addresses critical issues in applications like medical imaging, where worst-case risk guarantees are essential.  
- The broad application scope of L-ARC and its potential for significant impact are acknowledged.  
- The theoretical guarantees, including convergence analysis, are provided under standard assumptions.

Weaknesses:  
- The simulation results lack comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, making it unclear how L-ARC performs relative to existing approaches in electricity demand prediction and tumor image segmentation.  
- The worst-case guarantee appears to be limited to i.i.d. data, raising questions about its applicability to arbitrary data sequences.  
- The introduction of the threshold function within an RKHS may complicate implementation, and the practical benefits of this approach are not sufficiently justified.  
- The experimental results are not descriptive enough to clarify the advantages of L-ARC over existing methods, and the presentation of results needs improvement for better understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison of L-ARC with state-of-the-art methods in relevant applications to clarify its advantages. Additionally, addressing the limitations of the worst-case guarantee for non-i.i.d. data and providing a clearer explanation of the significance of the RKHS threshold function would enhance the paper's impact. We also suggest improving the presentation of experimental results to ensure that key takeaways are clear and well-explained, particularly regarding the implications of the findings in figures.
