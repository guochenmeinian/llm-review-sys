Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SuperVLAD, a method for visual place recognition that improves upon NetVLAD by reducing the number of clusters and eliminating the need for cluster centers. The authors argue that this leads to a more compact descriptor that is robust against domain shifts. SuperVLAD incorporates techniques such as ghost clusters and a cross-image transformer, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a lower dimensionality compared to GeM pooling and class tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
**S1** The approach achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance with a smaller global descriptor size while maintaining comparable inference time.  
**S2** The experimental evaluation is extensive, providing valuable comparisons and ablation studies that document the influence of architectural choices and feature backends.  
**S3** The method is well-written and technically robust, offering a fresh perspective on image descriptor design for visual place recognition.

Weaknesses:  
**W1** The novelty of the proposed work is limited, primarily differing from NetVLAD in the aggregation method, with minor performance improvements that are not always significant.  
**W2** The reported improvements in generalization are not convincingly demonstrated, as the datasets used do not exhibit a substantial domain gap.  
**W3** The contribution of ghost clusters is unclear, as they do not seem to enhance performance when using a powerful backbone like DINOv2.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the contribution of each component in the method by providing a more detailed ablation analysis, particularly regarding the impact of removing cluster centers and the use of ghost clusters. Additionally, we suggest that the authors conduct further experiments to demonstrate the generalization capability of SuperVLAD in more diverse environments, such as indoor versus outdoor settings. It would also be beneficial to include efficiency results, such as inference and training times, to better assess the practical applicability of SuperVLAD.
