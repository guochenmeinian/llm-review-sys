Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates a theoretical formulation of the contrastive loss used in self-supervised pretraining of vision models, asserting that all self-supervised learning (SSL) losses are variants of the same loss. The authors propose a more compute-efficient version of the loss objective and suggest two practical changes to SSL protocols: employing a higher orthogonalization regularization with a lower-dimensional projection and utilizing more augmentations per sample. These recommendations are empirically supported, showing improved top-1 accuracy and faster SSL convergence.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- There is a strong coupling between theoretical conclusions and experimental results, enhancing credibility.
- The simplified loss objective (from Theorem 3.1) is a valuable contribution that may improve SSL training.
- Experimental results demonstrate higher accuracy with the proposed recommendations compared to baselines.
- The authors clearly delineate their contributions from past work.

Weaknesses:
- The paper is difficult to read due to undefined key terms, requiring extensive references to external works.
- Theorem 3.2 is informally stated, lacking clarity on why SGD chooses redundant directions.
- Typos in terminology, such as the incorrect use of $\lambda$ instead of $\beta$ in Figure 2, detract from clarity.
- The experiments do not ablate discrepancies between the new and traditional loss objectives, nor do they include relevant baselines.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by defining key terms within the text to reduce reliance on external references. Theorem 3.2 should be formally restated in the appendix to clarify its implications. Additionally, the authors should address the typos in Figure 2 and include ablation studies comparing the new loss objective with traditional ones. To enhance empirical relevance, we suggest conducting experiments on larger datasets like ImageNet-100 and exploring a wider range of projector dimensions to validate their claims comprehensively.
