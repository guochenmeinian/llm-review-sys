Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Dual-domain Dynamic Normalization (DDN) method designed to address non-stationary variations in real-world time series data by operating in both time and frequency domains. The authors leverage wavelet transform to decompose time series into high and low-frequency components, employing sliding statistics to dynamically capture distributional changes. DDN can be integrated as a plug-and-play module into existing forecasting models, with extensive experiments demonstrating its superior performance over traditional normalization methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method effectively captures distribution variations in both time and frequency domains, addressing a significant challenge in time series forecasting.
2. Experimental results across various datasets show significant improvements in predictive performance, validating the method's applicability and superiority.
3. The method's practical utility is notable, as it can be easily integrated into existing forecasting models.

Weaknesses:
1. The writing quality and presentation require improvements, with identified typos and errors that need correction.
2. The distinction of the proposed method from existing techniques is unclear in some figures, necessitating better visual representation.
3. Key concepts lack clarity, particularly regarding the challenge to previous studies on "a fixed window," which may mislead readers about the study's primary motivation.
4. The implementation of SlideNorm bears resemblance to existing methods, requiring a clearer comparison.
5. The evaluation is limited, lacking sensitivity analysis of hyperparameters and comparisons with a broader range of baseline models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the writing quality and presentation by addressing identified typos and errors. Additionally, consider enhancing the visual representation in Figure 1 to clearly distinguish the proposed method from existing techniques. We suggest refining the description of key concepts to eliminate ambiguity, particularly regarding the challenge to previous studies on window sizes. It is crucial to clarify the distinctions between SlideNorm and existing methods. Furthermore, we recommend including sensitivity analyses of hyperparameters and expanding the evaluation to include comparisons with more baseline models, such as Transformer and PatchTST.
