### Key Points
This paper presents gender-neutral rewriting for the Portuguese language, addressing the specific challenges posed by its grammatical gender. The authors propose a rule-based rewriter and a paraphrasing model trained on a newly created test set across five domains. Evaluations indicate that while the neural approach shows some generalization, it is generally less accurate than the rule-based method. The paper contributes valuable resources, including a small-scale test set and two rewriting systems, and provides insights into grammatical gender and gender-neutral language in Portuguese.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers valuable resources for gender-neutral rewriting in Portuguese, including a unique test set and two rewriting systems.
- It demonstrates linguistic expertise regarding grammatical gender in Portuguese, aiding future research.
- The presentation is clear and well-structured.

Weaknesses:
- The technical novelty is limited, primarily providing resources and baseline experiments without novel algorithmic contributions.
- Some sections are confusing, particularly regarding the dataset's composition and the terminology used for the "development" set.
- The neural model's performance is hindered by its reliance on annotations from the rule-based model.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the dataset description by including statistics on the gendered references in the development set. Avoid using the term "development" to describe the dataset encompassing training, validation, and testing. Including English translations in tables and highlighting gendered words would enhance readability for non-Portuguese speakers. Additionally, consider training a Portuguese-specific NER model instead of using the Spanish NER system to avoid potential data errors. Clarifying the splits used for training the models and renaming the "base" system to "Do Nothing" baseline would also be beneficial. Finally, we advise conducting a manual error analysis to quantify the types of errors across different models.
