Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an axiomatic approach to preference aggregation in the context of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), drawing from social choice theory. The authors evaluate various aggregation methods, demonstrating that the widely used Bradley-Terry model (BTL) fails to meet essential axioms such as Pareto Optimality (PO) and Pairwise Majority Consistency (PMC). They propose a leximax Copeland rule that adheres to desirable properties like Pareto optimality and majority consistency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and addresses a timely and relevant problem.
- It provides a principled approach to modeling preferences, grounded in social choice theory.
- The theoretical framework is elegantly constructed, covering fundamental components of the problem.

Weaknesses:
- The practical applicability of the proposed leximax Copeland rule is limited, as the assumption of complete rankings for each voter is unrealistic.
- The paper lacks a discussion on how the proposed methods could be implemented in practice, particularly regarding the sampling strategy over voters and candidates.
- The focus on linear models may be overly restrictive, and the relationship between RLHF and social choice theory is not fully explored.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the practical relevance of their work by discussing how the leximax Copeland rule could be implemented in RLHF, including a sampling strategy for voters and candidates. Additionally, the authors should consider exploring non-linear reward function classes and comment on how focusing on partial rankings might impact their results. Finally, we suggest that the authors address the limitations of the linear social choice paradigm and its implications for real-world applications.
