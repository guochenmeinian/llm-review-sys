### Key Points
This paper presents a novel transformer-based approach to text line recognition for both printed and handwritten text, addressing multilingualism and character detection. The authors propose a two-stage training method utilizing synthetic data for bounding box predictions and fine-tuning with real data. The method achieves promising results across various datasets, particularly in cipher recognition.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and organized, making it easy to follow.
- The approach is novel, utilizing transformer-based models for character detection in parallel.
- Strong performance is demonstrated across several datasets, particularly in cipher recognition.
- The use of synthetic data allows for generalization to unseen characters, enhancing model adaptability.

Weaknesses:
- The method is not a complete solution for document analysis, as it relies on accurate line segmentation.
- It is not generally suitable for multilingual contexts, lacking clear solutions for multiple languages.
- Several typos and unclear figures detract from the overall presentation.
- The performance on real-world noisy datasets has not been thoroughly discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of figures and tables, particularly Figure 2 and Table 1, to enhance understanding. Additionally, please provide a more detailed explanation of the synthetic data generation process in the Appendix, including illustrations. It would be beneficial to explore the model's performance on documents with multiple languages and consider training separate models for each language. Furthermore, we suggest addressing the handling of noisy datasets and discussing the computational resource requirements in more detail. Lastly, the authors should clarify the impact of line detection quality on character recognition and provide examples of challenging real-world scenarios.
