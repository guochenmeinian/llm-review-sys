Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CableInspect-AD, a high-quality dataset for visual anomaly detection in robotic power line inspection, developed by Hydro-Qu√©bec experts. The authors propose Enhanced-PatchCore, an updated method that effectively sets detection thresholds using limited labeled data and incorporates feedback on the pixel-level thresholding strategy. They introduce a comprehensive evaluation protocol and add clarifications and quantitative metrics to improve the transparency and completeness of their anomaly segmentation analysis. The dataset, while promising, reveals challenges in detecting various anomalies, establishing its significance as a benchmark.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of CableInspect-AD provides a unique and high-quality dataset tailored for robotic power line inspection.
2. Enhanced-PatchCore effectively addresses the challenge of setting thresholds with minimal normal images, demonstrating comprehensive analysis of various threshold strategies.
3. The dataset includes high-resolution images with detailed annotations, enhancing its utility for future research.
4. The authors have effectively addressed previous feedback, particularly regarding the pixel-level thresholding strategy, and additional clarifications and quantitative metrics enhance the transparency of the analysis.

Weaknesses:
1. The dataset's uniform background may simplify anomaly detection, potentially reducing the complexity of the task.
2. The focus on a single cable category limits its applicability to broader scenarios.
3. The Enhanced-PatchCore method currently only determines image-level thresholds, lacking a strategy for pixel-level thresholding.
4. The review does not specify any remaining concerns or areas that require further improvement.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset by introducing variations in background color and brightness to enhance the challenge of anomaly detection. Additionally, we suggest comparing Enhanced-PatchCore with more recent zero-shot and few-shot methods, such as MUSC and APRIL-GAN, to strengthen the evaluation. It would also be beneficial to explore strategies for determining pixel-level thresholds and to report false negative rates (FNR) in the experiments for a more comprehensive evaluation of performance. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the updates made in response to feedback, ensuring that all changes are explicitly highlighted for reviewers. Finally, consider providing a summary of how the revisions impact the overall findings and conclusions of the paper, and we encourage the authors to host the dataset in a FAIR data repository to enhance accessibility and ensure persistent identification.
