Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the DEQH model, a Deep Equilibrium Model designed to solve quantum Hamiltonians. The authors propose an architecture based on QHNet, demonstrating its effectiveness through experiments on the MD17 and QM9 datasets, including convergence and ablation studies. The model aims to enhance computational efficiency by capturing the self-consistency of Hamiltonians without relying on iterative Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The DEQH model addresses a significant problem in computational chemistry by integrating deep equilibrium models with Hamiltonian solving.
2. The architecture is original and shows improved prediction accuracy compared to QHNet on various datasets.
3. The model inherently captures self-consistency, which is crucial for accurate Hamiltonian predictions.
4. The paper includes ablation studies that validate the effectiveness of different model components.

Weaknesses:
1. Differences between DEQH and QHNet are not clearly highlighted, complicating the interpretation of results.
2. The high epsilon errors in conjunction with low H and Psi errors raise questions about their meanings and implications.
3. The presentation is overly technical, lacking visual aids that could clarify the model's workflow.
4. The comparison is limited primarily to QHNet, with no benchmarking against other relevant models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the differences between DEQH and QHNet to facilitate better interpretation of results. Additionally, we suggest providing definitions and explanations for H, Psi, and epsilon errors to clarify their significance. Enhancing the presentation with visual illustrations and diagrams would aid in understanding the model's components and workflow. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to benchmark DEQH against additional models to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of its performance. Lastly, exploring the use of a self-consistency loss instead of relying on DFT ground truth calculations could significantly enhance the model's efficiency and applicability.
