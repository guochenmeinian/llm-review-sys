### Key Points
This paper presents a privacy-preserving inference framework aimed at protecting user data sent to cloud-based Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors propose a mixing-centric encryption method combined with synthetic data generation to mitigate privacy leakage while maintaining model performance. The framework shows promising results in reducing communication costs and privacy risks compared to existing methods, although it is primarily applicable to text data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed technique effectively minimizes privacy leakage and maintains comparable model performance.
- The innovative use of mixing-centric encryption, inspired by MIMO networks, enhances the framework's novelty.
- The paper is well-written, clearly presenting methodologies with detailed diagrams and synthetic data generation techniques.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks rigorous theoretical proof of privacy guarantees across different datasets and models.
- The applicability of the technique is limited to text data, and the synthetic data generation method shares similar constraints.
- Concerns exist regarding the computational expense on the user side and the usability of the proposed framework, particularly in relation to communication costs compared to cryptographic approaches.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical foundation of their privacy guarantees by providing rigorous proofs applicable to diverse datasets and models. Additionally, the authors should explore the feasibility of lightweight inference methods that preserve privacy and include a utility-privacy analysis. It would also be beneficial to validate the hypothesis regarding the impact of noise on performance in Section 4.2 and to clarify the definitions of terms such as Lap(\epsilon) and vanilla mixing when first introduced. Finally, a comparison of communication costs between the proposed framework and existing cryptographic approaches should be included to enhance usability insights.
