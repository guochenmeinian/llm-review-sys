Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of a linear multi-task regression framework, deriving formulas for asymptotic train and test risk. The authors investigate how raw data covariances, signal-generating hyperplanes, noise levels, and dataset sizes influence risk. Motivated by this analysis, experiments on multivariate time series forecasting are conducted to assess the effectiveness of MTL regularization. The results indicate a good match between theoretical predictions and empirical findings, leading to state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is clearly written, outlining main points effectively.
- Significant theoretical contributions are made, particularly in deriving asymptotic train and test risks using random matrix theory.
- The analyses provide valuable insights into model behavior and generalization performance.

Weaknesses:
- The analyses are limited to a simple linear model, lacking applicability to more common nonlinear models.
- There is a disconnect between the theoretical analysis and experimental results, with experiments primarily highlighting MTL regularization effectiveness without clear ties to the theoretical insights.
- Clarity issues exist, particularly regarding the introduction of multi-task multi-response/regression and the relevance of certain assumptions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the connection between theoretical analysis and experimental results, potentially by utilizing insights from the analysis to enhance experimental outcomes. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion of existing works on theoretical error bounds for multi-task learning to contextualize their contributions. The proof or outline of the proof of Theorem 1 should be included in the main paper, as it represents the major contribution. Furthermore, addressing clarity issues, such as the need for definitions and explanations of symbols and assumptions, will enhance the paper's readability. Lastly, we encourage the authors to discuss the limitations of their current work, particularly regarding the assumptions made in applying random matrix theory.
