### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to addressing visual-linguistic ambiguity in multimodal understanding tasks. The authors propose a joint task of anaphora resolution and object localization, supported by the creation of a new dataset, "Find2Find," which includes 500 anaphora-annotated recipes with corresponding videos. The paper introduces an end-to-end multitask learning framework capable of jointly learning these tasks, demonstrating through empirical validation that this approach enhances both anaphora resolution and object localization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The creation of the "Find2Find" dataset fills a significant gap in resources for studying visual-linguistic ambiguity.
2. The proposed joint task of anaphora resolution and object localization offers a novel perspective that can inspire future research.
3. Empirical evidence supports the effectiveness of the proposed method, establishing a benchmark for similar studies.
4. The paper is well-written and organized, clearly demonstrating the motivation and methodology.

Weaknesses:
1. The dataset's small size raises concerns about the generalizability of the results to other domains.
2. The lack of statistical significance in the results limits confidence in their applicability.
3. The experimental section could benefit from additional baseline methods and evaluations of more vision-language models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing to prevent confusion, particularly regarding the explanation of symbols used in formulas. Additionally, elaborating on the data annotation details and any quality check processes would enhance the manuscript. We also suggest including more baseline methods in the experimental section to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach comprehensively. Finally, addressing the minor points raised, such as the use of "chicken-and-egg" terminology and clarifying the meaning of "incorrect" in line 227, would strengthen the paper.
