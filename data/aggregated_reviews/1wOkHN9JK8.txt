Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an empirical study that develops a new framework for neural representation of motion in the cortex, introducing a novel stimulus synthesis method for model training that generates optic flow fields with low-dimensional latent structures. The authors modify hierarchical Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to argue that the architectural biases of these networks yield more desirable representations of motion, assessed through entanglement metrics and alignment with neurophysiological data. Additionally, the authors introduce a novel simulation framework for unsupervised training and a compressed hierarchical VAE that infers the structure of the world through unsupervised learning, demonstrating that their approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various metrics. The manuscript emphasizes the importance of hierarchical inference in learned motion representation in the primate brain and discusses the architectural effects on latent-to-neuron relationships. However, the theoretical advancements are viewed as marginal, and the significance of the proposed architecture in enhancing understanding of cortical motion processing is questioned.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed stimulus synthesis method for training is well-motivated and effective.
- The last figure effectively illustrates the contributions of different generative factors to performance.
- The manuscript introduces a novel framework and architecture that shows promising results in unsupervised learning.
- The ablation experiments are highlighted as particularly interesting and relevant for future research directions.
- The writing is mostly clear, and the authors effectively address reviewer comments, indicating a willingness to improve the manuscript.

Weaknesses:
- The logic surrounding physiological alignment analyses appears circular and redundant, particularly in penalizing models with worse disentanglement.
- Some metrics and concepts, such as "Completeness," require clearer definitions and explanations.
- The conjecture that disentanglement is a normative goal of the dorsal stream lacks convincing evidence.
- The predictive performance of the proposed model is statistically indistinguishable from vanilla VAEs, raising questions about the significance of the findings.
- The introduction of the architecture remains opaque, and many acronyms are introduced without definitions, which could hinder reader comprehension.
- The paper lacks a Related Work section, making it difficult to assess its contributions relative to existing literature.
- The manuscript may benefit from further exploration of latent space dimensionality and its implications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by providing a more thorough description of the dimensionality of the latent variables in the architecture. Additionally, please define all acronyms upon first use and elaborate on terms such as "end-point error," "permutation importance," and "Completeness." It is crucial to include a Related Work section that connects the paper to the state of the art and clarifies its contributions. We also suggest condensing the metrics into a clearly defined section, offering quantitative definitions for terms like "informativeness," "disentanglement," and "completeness." Lastly, consider restructuring the paper to better separate previous work from methods and enhancing figure captions for clarity.
