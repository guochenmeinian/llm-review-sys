Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method called Structure-broadcasting Graph Dataset Distillation (SGDD) for condensing large-scale graph datasets while preserving original structural information. The authors investigate the impact of Laplacian Energy Distribution (LED) shifts, demonstrating that previous methods neglecting this aspect lead to poor performance in cross-architecture generalization. SGDD achieves state-of-the-art results across nine datasets and various tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in maintaining structural integrity during graph condensation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses the critical issue of structural information in graph condensation, providing a significant contribution to the field.
- The introduction of the Substantial Laplacian Energy Distribution (LED) shifts offers a novel metric to quantify performance impacts.
- Extensive experimental results validate the proposed method's effectiveness, showing superior performance in cross-architecture settings.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for using JS divergence in calculating the LED shift coefficient (SC) is unclear, and the authors do not specify the differences between BWGNN and other backbones.
- The comparison with existing methods is limited; notable approaches like DosCond are not included in the evaluation.
- The writing lacks clarity, particularly in the mixed use of terms related to LED shifts, which can confuse readers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their writing, particularly in defining and consistently using terms related to LED shifts. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of their motivation for using JS divergence in the calculation of SC. It would be beneficial to include comparisons with more recent methods, such as DosCond, to enhance the comprehensiveness of their evaluation. Finally, the authors should report actual computation savings in terms of time and memory usage to better illustrate the practical benefits of their method.
