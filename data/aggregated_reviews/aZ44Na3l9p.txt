Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates whether existing deep multi-instance learning (MIL) algorithms adhere to the fundamental assumptions of MIL. The authors propose a unit test designed to evaluate if an MIL algorithm satisfies the multi-instance assumption, specifically testing the standard MIL assumption and the threshold assumption. The results indicate that all attention-based MIL algorithms fail this test, while CausalMIL and mi-Net are the only deep MIL algorithms that pass. The paper emphasizes the importance of these findings for the application of MIL algorithms in fields such as histopathology image classification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation for this work is compelling, as it formally identifies issues with attention-based deep MIL algorithms through rigorous testing.
2. The proposed unit test is model-agnostic, allowing for the evaluation of both existing and future MIL algorithms.
3. The tested MIL algorithms represent the current state-of-the-art in both classic and deep MIL approaches.

Weaknesses:
1. The writing, formatting, and overall presentation require significant improvement, with numerous grammatical errors and unclear phrasing.
2. The discussion on the implications of the test results is insufficient; it lacks depth regarding how the passing algorithms can be applied and the caution needed for those that failed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the writing and formatting throughout the paper, addressing specific issues such as changing "MIL respecting" to "MIL assumption respecting" and clarifying ambiguous phrases. A brief summary of test results should be included in the introduction to highlight which algorithms satisfy the assumptions. Additionally, the authors should expand the discussion on the implications of their findings, particularly regarding the application of CausalMIL and mi-Net in real-world scenarios, and the risks associated with using attention-based methods. A summary table indicating which models pass which tests would enhance clarity and impact. Finally, the authors should explicitly state the limitations of their work, including the untested MIL assumptions and the potential for future research in this area.
