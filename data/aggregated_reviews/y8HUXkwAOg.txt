Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel algorithm called ChronoEpilogi for feature selection in multivariate time series forecasting, focusing on identifying Markov boundaries of time series variables. The authors validate their approach both experimentally and theoretically, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving forecasting performance by using subsets of features rather than the entire set.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a significant problem with a good formalization and is generally well-written.
2. The proposed algorithm is original, providing a compact representation of mutually equivalent variables and effectively handling large datasets.
3. The experimental results are convincing, including running time metrics, which are often omitted in similar studies.

Weaknesses:
1. Limitations of the model are not fully discussed, particularly the assumption that the selected set of variables remains fixed over time, which may hinder real-world applicability.
2. The experiments lack comprehensiveness, as they do not consider other forecasting models, baselines, or datasets, particularly those with high rates of missing values.
3. The discussion of prior work is incomplete, particularly regarding signature paths and feature selection methods, which should be compared to ChronoEpilogi.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the model's limitations, particularly regarding the fixed nature of selected variables over time. Additionally, it would be beneficial to conduct more comprehensive experiments that include various forecasting models and datasets, especially those with missing values. We also suggest that the authors enhance the discussion of prior work, specifically addressing signature paths and feature selection methods, to provide a clearer context for their contributions. Furthermore, clarifying the definitions used in the paper, such as what "V" stands for, and addressing the computational complexity of the algorithm would strengthen the manuscript.
