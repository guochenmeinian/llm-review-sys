Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a multiply robust targeted average treatment effect (TATE) estimator designed for multi-site studies, particularly focusing on hospital care quality assessment for Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) among Medicare beneficiaries. The authors propose a federated approach that incorporates transfer learning to estimate ensemble weights, accommodating covariate mismatches and enabling the use of diverse outcome and treatment models across sites. The methodology aims to enhance the robustness of causal inferences drawn from decentralized data while addressing significant challenges such as privacy concerns and the need for sensitivity analysis. The authors acknowledge the importance of finite sample bounds and reference recent methods that could be adapted for their estimator.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method effectively addresses the challenges of multi-site studies, particularly in terms of privacy and covariate mismatch.
2. The theoretical analysis provides insights into the estimator's bias and variance, contributing to its soundness.
3. The experimental results demonstrate promising outcomes, supporting the method's practical applicability.
4. The authors plan to enhance the paper by providing a comprehensive overview of the dataset and addressing the evaluation of identification assumptions.

Weaknesses:
1. There are significant privacy concerns regarding the transmission of statistics, as it may not adequately protect against membership inference attacks. The authors should consider incorporating differential privacy methods.
2. The experimental design regarding covariate mismatch lacks clarity and may not accurately reflect the intended data generation process. The authors should revise the experimental settings to ensure they align with the theoretical assumptions.
3. The paper primarily offers asymptotic guarantees without addressing finite sample bounds, which would enhance understanding of the estimator's performance in practical scenarios.
4. There is a lack of evidence for real-world applications and practical applicability of the proposed methods.
5. Concerns remain regarding the clarity of finite sample bounds versus asymptotic guarantees, as well as the need for more background, motivation, and intuition in the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors improve the privacy aspect of their methodology by integrating differential privacy techniques to safeguard against potential membership inference attacks.
2. The authors should clarify the experimental settings related to covariate mismatch, ensuring that the data generation process aligns with the theoretical framework. Specifically, they should consider generating data according to the proposed equations before introducing covariate mismatches.
3. We encourage the authors to provide finite sample guarantees alongside the asymptotic results to better inform readers about the estimator's performance in realistic applications.
4. We recommend that the authors provide concrete evidence of real-world applications to enhance the paper's practical relevance.
5. The authors should clarify the distinction between finite sample bounds and asymptotic guarantees, and include a more detailed sensitivity analysis.
6. We suggest enhancing the background, motivation, and intuition sections to strengthen the overall presentation of the methodology.
7. We recommend restructuring the related work section to clearly delineate the contributions of the current paper compared to the foundational works it builds upon.
