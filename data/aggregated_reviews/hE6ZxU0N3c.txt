Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents PartCLIPSeg, an extension of the CLIPSeg model tailored for open-vocabulary part segmentation (OVPS). The authors propose solutions to three key challenges: lack of generalization, ambiguous boundaries, and missing underrepresented parts. The framework incorporates generalized parts with object-level contexts and an attention control mechanism, demonstrating superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized, with clear writing that facilitates understanding.
- The topic of open-vocabulary part segmentation is significant and underexplored.
- The proposed method shows substantial improvement compared to baseline methods.

Weaknesses:
- The overall architecture in Figure 3 needs refinement to better highlight contributions.
- The analysis of experimental results is insufficient, particularly regarding the performance of seen categories, which show inconsistent trends across datasets.
- The ablation studies primarily focus on the attention control loss, lacking comprehensive analysis of other components and their contributions.
- Limited comparison with other OVPS methods and insufficient discussion on computational complexity and training details.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Figure 3 to emphasize the framework's contributions. Additionally, the authors should provide a more thorough analysis of experimental results, particularly addressing the discrepancies in seen category performance across datasets. Expanding the ablation studies to include the impact of combining object-level and part-level pseudo-labels, as well as a detailed discussion on the effectiveness of proposed losses, would enhance the paper. Furthermore, a more comprehensive comparison with other OVPS methods and a detailed analysis of computational complexity would provide a clearer understanding of the proposed method's advantages. Lastly, including training details directly in the main text would aid readers unfamiliar with CLIPSeg.
