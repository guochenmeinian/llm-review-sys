Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel algorithm for point cloud registration that addresses the challenge of outliers affecting registration quality. The authors propose a two-stage decoupling strategy that reformulates the registration problem as an alignment error â„“0-minimization problem, separating rotation and translation fitting errors. The method utilizes null-space matrices for inlier identification, demonstrating robustness against high outlier ratios and noise, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, including KITTI, 3DMatch, and 3DLoMatch.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method is innovative, employing a unique two-stage decoupling strategy that enhances robustness and accuracy in inlier identification.
2. Comprehensive empirical validation is provided, with rigorous testing across diverse datasets, showcasing the method's effectiveness and robustness.
3. The paper is well-structured and clearly presents the methodology, experimental setup, and results, facilitating understanding.

Weaknesses:
1. The computational complexity and efficiency of the proposed algorithm are not thoroughly discussed, leaving questions about its practicality in real-world applications.
2. The evaluation of real-world datasets indicates that performance may be saturating, suggesting that the claimed robustness may not be necessary in all scenarios.
3. Some figures, such as Figure 1, are too small for effective comprehension, and Figure 5 does not adequately showcase the qualitative advantages of the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on computational complexity and efficiency, particularly regarding time complexity and its implications for real-world applicability. Additionally, we suggest restating the method's advantages, such as time complexity, in the experimental section by including it as a metric in the evaluation tables. Increasing the size of figures for better visibility and replacing Figure 5 with a more representative qualitative result would enhance clarity. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the meaning of "Bayesian Theory" and define any undefined variables, such as K2, to improve the paper's accessibility. Lastly, providing an analysis of failure cases and discussing the method's performance on small-scale data would offer valuable insights.
