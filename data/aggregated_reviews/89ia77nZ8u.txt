Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an approach for the automatic discovery of circuits (ACDC) in artificial neural networks, particularly transformer-based models. The authors propose an algorithm that automates the identification of important nodes through patching model activations, significantly reducing the manual effort typically required in mechanistic interpretability. ACDC is evaluated extensively, demonstrating its ability to accurately recover circuits previously identified by researchers across various tasks. The paper also discusses the choice of patching values and threshold parameters, while providing an open-source implementation for community use.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem addressed is highly impactful, and the paper provides a thorough survey of existing mechanistic interpretability work.
- Clear writing and well-organized presentation enhance understanding.
- Extensive evaluation shows good performance of the automated method, likely improving the speed of future discoveries in the field.
- The methodology extends previous approaches, offering new insights into activation patching.

Weaknesses:
- The choice of threshold parameter tau appears inconsistent across tasks, and guidance on selecting tau for new tasks is lacking.
- The paper does not adequately address how to formulate the task and dataset for the initial step of the workflow, which may be the most challenging aspect.
- Distinction from previous work, particularly HISP, is not clearly articulated, and comparisons of derived circuits could be beneficial.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the selection of the threshold parameter tau, possibly by providing a guideline for its application in new tasks. Additionally, addressing how to formulate the task and dataset for the initial step would enhance the paper's utility. We suggest including a subsection that explicitly compares circuits derived from ACDC and HISP, highlighting specific fail cases where ACDC excels. Lastly, further exploration of KLD as a faithful proxy and a discussion on the sensitivity of the algorithm to hyperparameter variations would strengthen the paper.
