### Key Points
This paper presents the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) architecture, which merges the efficient training of Transformers with the inference efficiency of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). RWKV employs a linear attention mechanism, allowing it to function as either a Transformer or an RNN, thus enabling parallel computations during training while maintaining constant computational and memory complexity during inference. The authors demonstrate that RWKV, scaled up to 14 billion parameters, performs comparably to similarly sized Transformers on various natural language processing tasks, marking a significant advancement in balancing computational efficiency and model performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- RWKV is a novel architecture that effectively addresses the limitations of both RNNs and Transformers.
- The paper provides compelling empirical evidence of RWKV's performance and efficiency on benchmark datasets.
- The authors offer pretrained models ranging from 169 million to 14 billion parameters, facilitating community research.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity in presentation, resembling an advertisement rather than a scientific study, with insufficient experimental detail and unlabeled graphs.
- There are concerns regarding RWKV's performance on tasks requiring hard reasoning and its limitations in handling long contexts.
- The information bottleneck in the architecture may negatively affect tasks needing fine-grained attention, and the lack of parallelization in the time dimension could hinder training for longer contexts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and scientific rigor of the presentation, ensuring that captions and experimental details are comprehensive. Specifically, Figure 1 should include references to datasets and calculations, and the authors should provide standard tables showing tokens/perplexity (or bits per character) alongside graphs for better data efficiency understanding. Additionally, we suggest that the authors investigate and report on RWKV's performance in float16 or bfloat16 precision, as well as conduct further evaluations on long context tasks and the implications of the information bottleneck. Finally, including a transformer baseline in relevant figures would enhance the comparative analysis of RWKV's performance.
