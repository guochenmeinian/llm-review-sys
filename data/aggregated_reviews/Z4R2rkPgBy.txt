Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a multimodal variational mixture-of-experts prior (MMVM) VAE aimed at enhancing representation learning for multimodal data. The authors propose a data-dependent prior that guides each modalityâ€™s latent representation towards a shared aggregate posterior, addressing limitations of existing methods that rely on joint posteriors with restrictive assumptions. Experimental results on various datasets indicate the method's potential effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed data-dependent prior is novel and inspiring, offering a new direction for multimodal representation learning.
- The experimental validation on medical datasets shows promising results for real-world applications.

Weaknesses:
- There is no direct evaluation of the learned representation to substantiate the proposed "soft-sharing of information between modalities."
- The exclusion of relevant multimodal VAE baselines in the experiments weakens the evaluation.
- The experimental analysis lacks depth, relying on single quantitative assessments without referencing the more extensive analysis in the Appendix.
- The paper does not adequately explore potential solutions for unconditional sampling, a significant limitation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation of the learned representation by examining the differences and overlaps among each \(H(z_m|X)\) and how similar each learned \(q^{m}_{\phi}(z_m|x_m)\) is to their prior. Additionally, including the omitted multimodal VAE baselines, Daunhawer et al., 2020 and Palumbo et al., 2023, in the experiments would strengthen the evaluation. We also suggest referencing the extensive analysis in the Appendix within the main text to enhance the discussion. Furthermore, addressing the inability to perform unconditional sampling by exploring potential solutions would significantly improve the paper's contribution. Lastly, we recommend clarifying the metrics and classifiers used in the evaluation and providing a more specific analysis of the limitations of related work to better contextualize the proposed approach.
