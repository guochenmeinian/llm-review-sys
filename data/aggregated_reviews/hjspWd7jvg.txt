Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a multi-variable OT-based framework for addressing Single-Cell related problems, specifically through Generative Entropic Neural Optimal Transport (GENOT). The authors propose using conditional flow matching to learn a continuous parametric plan from discrete entropy-regularized OT problems, validated through various synthetic and real single-cell applications. The methodology demonstrates competitive results in single-cell genomics, tackling challenges such as arbitrary cost functions and mass conservation constraints.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The manuscript is well-structured and clear, effectively presenting the advantages of the method, including its universality and simplicity. The experimental section is robust, showcasing diverse use cases and interesting results, which enhance the understanding of the proposed framework.

Weaknesses:  
The method's reliance on discrete OT may limit its adaptability to high-dimensional setups, potentially leading to significant deviations from true EOT plans. Additionally, the approach is not guaranteed to learn ground-truth plans, and critical experimental details are relegated to the appendix, which may hinder comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the main text by integrating key experimental results and theoretical discussions currently found in the appendix. Additionally, addressing the limitations of the Gromov-Wasserstein implementation in the main body would enhance the paper's impact. It would also be beneficial to clarify the choice of conditional flow matching over other generative techniques and provide a more detailed explanation of the biases introduced by mini-batch OT. Lastly, we suggest introducing abbreviations like DBSM and CFM-SM in the relevant sections to aid reader comprehension.
