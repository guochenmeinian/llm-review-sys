Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method called MambaSCI for efficient reconstruction of quad-Bayer patterned color video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI). The authors propose a novel framework that integrates a non-symmetric U-shaped encoder-decoder architecture, including Residual-Mamba-Blocks, to enhance reconstruction quality and edge details. Experimental results indicate that MambaSCI outperforms existing methods in both effectiveness and efficiency, achieving higher PSNR and SSIM scores.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of Mamba for video SCI reconstruction and the Quad-Bayer CFA pattern is novel and represents a significant contribution to the field.
2. The quality of results is high, with MambaSCI demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
3. The manuscript is well-structured and clearly presented, with sufficient citations and comparisons to build confidence in the proposed method.
4. The contributions of individual modules are clearly articulated, justifying their necessity.

Weaknesses:
1. The reconstruction is limited to low-resolution images (512 x 512), and higher resolution simulations would be beneficial.
2. The method has only been tested on simulated datasets, raising concerns about the noise modeling and its alignment with real data.
3. The novelty of the Residual-Mamba-Block is questioned, as it appears to be an incremental adaptation of existing modules without substantial innovation.
4. The lack of real experiments on quad-Bayer captured videos limits the evaluation of the proposed method's effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the resolution of their simulations to assess the method's performance on higher resolution images. Additionally, it is crucial to include details on how the simulated datasets were created, particularly regarding noise modeling, to enhance the credibility of the results. We suggest providing concrete numbers related to the computational benefits, such as the time taken to reconstruct each frame. Clarifying the generation of the masks and the conditioning of the masking matrix is also essential. Furthermore, exploring the relationship between the number of frames used during reconstruction and the motion between consecutive frames could provide insights into optimizing computational costs. Lastly, we encourage the authors to conduct real experiments using videos captured by quad-Bayer patterns to validate the proposed method's effectiveness in practical scenarios.
