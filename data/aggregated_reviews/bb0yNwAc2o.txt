### Key Points
This paper presents KPG, a novel framework that enhances rumor detection on social media by refining propagation patterns and identifying key substructures. KPG utilizes reinforcement learning to construct cleaner propagation graphs, addressing the limitations of traditional methods. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of KPG through extensive experiments across multiple datasets, showing improved performance over state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The integration of reinforcement learning to enhance propagation graph generation is innovative and effectively addresses traditional limitations.
2. Comprehensive empirical studies, including ablation studies, validate the contributions of individual components.
3. The paper is well-structured and presents its findings clearly.

Weaknesses:
1. The core idea of KPG appears similar to existing methods, particularly those referenced in [1], necessitating further discussion on differences and the inclusion of [1] as a baseline.
2. The paper lacks clarity regarding the training data used, which undermines confidence in the results.
3. There is insufficient statistical significance testing to validate reported performance gains.
4. The methodology section could benefit from clearer delineation from the experimental results.
5. The paper does not adequately address how KPG would handle real-time rumor detection in dynamically evolving social media environments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the novelty of KPG by explicitly comparing it with the method in [1] and including it as a baseline in their evaluations. Additionally, clarifying the training data used for the CRG and ENS modules is essential to enhance the validity of the results. Incorporating statistical significance testing for performance gains would strengthen the findings. We also suggest that the authors provide a more detailed description of the algorithmic steps involved in the KPG framework and address how it can adapt to real-time changes in social media. Finally, improving the clarity of visuals and terminology throughout the paper will enhance reader comprehension.
