### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative approach to optimizing urban mobility digital twins using Bayesian optimization (BO), focusing on travel demand calibration in complex networks like the San Francisco metropolitan area. The authors propose the application of BO to realistic, high-dimensional networks, demonstrating its potential for sample-efficient learning in costly, simulation-based optimization problems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The effective application of BO to realistic networks is well-demonstrated through case studies, providing a clear path for practical implementation.  
- The paper highlights BO's capability to handle costly optimization problems, showcasing its efficiency in complex urban mobility systems.  
- The inclusion of code for travel demand estimation enhances reproducibility.  

Weaknesses:  
- The challenges and primary motivation behind the research are not clearly articulated, and the practical implications need further discussion.  
- The features utilized in the datasets are not adequately explained, requiring more detail.  
- The reliance on synthetic data for validation may limit the applicability of findings to real-world scenarios.  
- Discrepancies between SUMO-simulated data and real-world data need elaboration, along with a discussion on time complexity and scalability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the articulation of the challenges and motivations behind the research, as well as provide a more detailed discussion on the practical implications of their work. Additionally, please elaborate on the features used in the datasets and clarify the discrepancies between the SUMO-simulated data and real-world data. We also suggest including a more thorough discussion on time complexity and scalability to enhance the paper's depth.
