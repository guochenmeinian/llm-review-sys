Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Universal Mesh Movement Network (UM2N), a deep-learning model designed to enhance the solving of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) through adaptive mesh movement. The authors propose a unique architecture that integrates a Graph Transformer encoder with a Graph Attention Network (GAT) decoder, trained on a PDE-independent dataset, enabling zero-shot application across various PDEs and geometries without retraining. This approach allows for significant acceleration in solving PDEs by decoupling the PDE solving from the mesh movement process, making the method adaptable to various solvers, boundary geometries, and mesh structures. The model incorporates element volume loss to improve robustness and mitigate mesh tangling, demonstrating superior performance in accuracy, efficiency, and robustness across diverse PDE types, including real-world scenarios like tsunami simulations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method effectively handles different geometries and PDE types with a single model, significantly reducing time costs compared to traditional methods without sacrificing accuracy.
2. It exhibits robustness and easier convergence compared to prior works like MA and M2N.
3. Comprehensive evaluations show UM2N outperforms existing methods, highlighting its versatility and practical applicability in various scientific fields.
4. The paper is well-written and accessible, with a clear focus on the mesh movement problem and a thorough description of the methodology.
5. The commitment to providing code for reproducibility is commendable.

Weaknesses:
1. The absence of an ablation study on the architecture's individual components limits understanding of their contributions.
2. There are no comparisons with off-the-shelf graph convolutional or transformer methods, and broader comparisons with state-of-the-art methods are limited.
3. The handling of extreme geometries and poor-quality meshes is not adequately explored, which is critical for practical applications.
4. The paper does not sufficiently address theoretical guarantees regarding mesh tangling prevention, and the claim of being "tangling-aware" lacks experimental substantiation.
5. The dataset size appears small for practical applications, both in sample count and vertex number.
6. Computational efficiency and scalability benchmarks are lacking, particularly for large meshes.
7. The challenges of multi-scale phenomena and mesh continuity during deformations are not thoroughly addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by conducting an ablation study to clarify the contributions of different architecture components. Additionally, including baselines from recent graph convolutional or transformer methods would strengthen the evaluation. To address the handling of extreme geometries and poor-quality meshes, we suggest conducting experiments with initial meshes characterized by skewed aspect ratios and complex geometries, including quantitative metrics on mesh quality before and after adaptation. We also encourage the authors to delve deeper into the theoretical guarantees regarding mesh tangling and to include more diverse real-world application scenarios to showcase UM2N's versatility. Including detailed benchmarks of computational efficiency and scalability, particularly for large-scale problems, would strengthen the paper. Furthermore, we recommend introducing experiments targeting multi-scale phenomena and ensuring mesh continuity during local and global deformations. Lastly, we suggest benchmarking the learned mesh configurations against known optimal solutions to assess their accuracy and efficiency, and exploring alternative GNN methods for potential improvements in mesh adaptation. Addressing these weaknesses and questions will significantly enhance the robustness and applicability of the proposed work.
