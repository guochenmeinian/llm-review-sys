Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel long-tailed open-world classification (LT-OPC) setting, addressing the challenges of predicting both closed-set and open-set classes with long-tailed distributions without prior knowledge of the underlying data distribution. The authors propose a Self-Balanced Co-Advice contrastive framework (BaCon) that integrates a contrastive learning branch and a pseudo-labeling branch to tackle data imbalance. The contrastive learning branch regularizes the pseudo-labeling branch, while the pseudo-labeling phase incorporates debiasing and sampling techniques. The authors argue that existing methods, such as SimGCD, fail to generalize effectively to LT-OPC, particularly when oracle distributions are not available. The effectiveness of the proposed components is validated through comprehensive experimental results, demonstrating that BaCon significantly outperforms baseline methods in various distribution scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The LT-OPC setting reflects a practical real-world scenario, enhancing its relevance compared to traditional semi-supervised learning.
- The proposed BaCon method effectively addresses the challenges of LT-OPC, showing substantial improvements in accuracy and balance.
- The interaction between contrastive learning and pseudo-labeling strategies is well-designed, supported by ablation results.
- Empirical results clearly illustrate the limitations of existing methods like SimGCD, even when provided with oracle distributions.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the LT-OPC setting is questionable, as it appears to extend existing generalized category discovery (GCD) methods to long-tailed distributions without sufficient comparisons.
- The assumption that both novel and seen categories follow a Pareto distribution may give an unfair advantage to the proposed method compared to others that do not make this assumption.
- The training setup for baseline methods is unclear, raising concerns about the fairness of comparisons, particularly regarding the inclusion of contrastive learning branches.
- The analysis of results could benefit from deeper insights into the performance gaps and the specific contributions of each method component.
- The introduction of multiple hyper-parameters complicates the model's application to new datasets, necessitating a discussion on generalization capabilities.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty discussion by comparing their work with existing literature on semi-supervised learning and generalized category discovery. Clarifying the fairness of comparisons with baseline methods is essential, particularly regarding the inclusion of contrastive learning branches. We suggest detailing the training protocols for baseline methods to ensure consistency. Additionally, addressing the determination of hyper-parameter values in real-world scenarios and discussing the model's generalization to unseen novel classes would enhance the paper's robustness. We also encourage the authors to improve the clarity of the problem name to "Distribution-Agnostic Generalized Category Discovery" to better reflect the nature of their work. Further exploration of the ablation studies to clarify their significance and a comprehensive analysis of the experimental results detailing how each component of their method addresses the weaknesses of prior works would also be beneficial.
