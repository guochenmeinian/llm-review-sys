Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on inductive out-of-context reasoning (OOCR) in large language models (LLMs), focusing on their ability to infer latent information from implicit training data without in-context learning. The authors introduce five tasks—Locations, Coins, Functions, Mixture of Functions, and Parity Learning—to evaluate this capability. The experiments demonstrate that finetuning models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 leads to better performance in OOCR compared to in-context learning. The findings suggest that LLMs can learn latent information and apply it effectively in downstream tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant issue relevant to the NeurIPS community, focusing on the risks of LLMs censoring dangerous knowledge.
- It proposes an intuitive evaluation framework supported by comprehensive experiments.
- The writing is clear and the results are intriguing, showcasing a high level of rigor and detail.

Weaknesses:
- A major weakness is the reliance on the opaque OpenAI API for experiments, which limits transparency in finetuning methods and reproducibility. This concern is somewhat mitigated by results from Llama 3, but it remains a limitation.
- The connection between the experiments and the safety motivation is not clearly articulated, raising questions about the implications of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental settings to ensure the paper is self-contained without needing to reference the appendix. Additionally, we suggest providing more realistic task examples to illustrate the safety challenges posed by OOCR in practical applications. It would also be beneficial to discuss potential solutions to mitigate the risks associated with OOCR. Finally, consider using different markers or line styles in figures for better distinction and moving the limitations to a dedicated section at the end of the paper to enhance the discussion.
