Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a hybrid approach integrating large language models (LLMs) into the GraphPlan algorithm to enhance classical planning. The authors propose the LLMs4Plan framework, utilizing LLMs for action selection during graph expansion and candidate action set generation during backtracking. Experiments demonstrate that LLMs can better handle corrupted domain files compared to traditional GraphPlan, although the motivation for using corrupted files is not clearly articulated.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of LLMs into graph-based planning is innovative and contributes significantly to the field.
- The technical implementation of LLMs4Plan is detailed, and the empirical validation across ten planning domains showcases its practical applicability.
- The paper explores a largely uncharted area regarding LLMs' effectiveness in planning tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks sufficient experiments and discussions, particularly regarding the trade-off between the hybrid approach and classic GraphPlan, and does not include experiments with valid PDDL domain files.
- The rationale for using corrupted PDDL files is introduced abruptly, lacking adequate motivation.
- Important discussions on hyperparameter effects, such as the number of iterations in Algorithm 1, are missing.
- The writing quality requires improvement, with insufficient explanations of key concepts and terms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their experimental setup by providing detailed information on the corruption of PDDL domain files, including the percentage of files corrupted. Additionally, we suggest including experiments with valid PDDL files to illustrate the trade-off between LLM utilization and exhaustive algorithms like GraphPlan, ideally through a graph comparing success rates to the number of nodes explored.

We also advise the authors to enhance the writing by clearly defining terms and notations earlier in the paper, particularly in sections discussing the algorithm. The authors should consider moving discussions about pruning probabilities and their implications for completeness to earlier sections for better coherence.

Lastly, we encourage the authors to address the limitations of their work more explicitly and to explore potential applications of LLMs4Plan in real-world scenarios to strengthen the paper's contributions.
