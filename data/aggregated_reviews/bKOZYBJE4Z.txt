Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for counterfactual regression over time, leveraging Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) and Information Maximization (InfoMax) to capture long-term dependencies and improve computational efficiency compared to transformer-based approaches. The authors propose a framework that combines an encoder for learning historical representations and a decoder utilizing adversarial loss functions to predict outcomes while addressing selection bias. The method achieves state-of-the-art results in counterfactual estimation, validated through comprehensive experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and structured, providing a thorough theoretical grounding and detailed experimental settings.
- The proposed method demonstrates superior performance in long-term prediction tasks and achieves good empirical results with fewer patient data.
- The use of MI-based principles for causal representation learning is innovative and effectively validated across various datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The complexity of the method raises concerns about its applicability and reproducibility, particularly regarding the computational demands and the role of invertible representations.
- There is insufficient discussion on the consistency of results with varying patient numbers and the performance of the method in random trajectories.
- The theoretical analysis lacks clarity in linking the proposed methods to their practical benefits, and some intuitions regarding invertibility are not adequately supported by formal proofs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the theoretical analysis, particularly in section 5.1, to better connect the information-theoretic methods to their practical benefits. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments on real datasets and multiple synthetic datasets with random settings to validate the robustness of the results and provide error bars. A formal proof regarding the role of invertible representations in improving counterfactual regression should be included to strengthen the theoretical foundation. Finally, we encourage the authors to discuss the tightness of the bounds used in the loss functions and provide comparisons of time consumption with baselines to enhance the evaluation scope.
