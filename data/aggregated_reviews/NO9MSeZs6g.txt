Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies online classification under smoothed adversaries, distinguishing between batch learning and smoothed online learning, particularly when the label set size is unbounded. The authors propose that a hypothesis class can be PAC-learned but may not achieve sublinear regret in smoothed online learning. They present a sufficient condition based on empirical covering numbers that guarantees sublinear regret for smoothed adversarial learning. The results extend previous findings from binary to multi-class classification, highlighting the complexity introduced by unbounded label classes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a well-defined learning problem, enhancing understanding of smoothed online learning, particularly in the context of multi-class classification. The hardness result for unbounded label classes is both interesting and non-trivial.  
- The conceptual contribution is significant, revealing complex behaviors in unbounded label scenarios that merit further exploration.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks a necessary and sufficient condition for the learnability of hypothesis classes under smoothed online learning.  
- The significance of the work is questioned, particularly regarding the relevance of the proposed sufficient condition and the motivation for studying the unbounded label setting. The analysis appears to be a straightforward extension of existing results, and the implications for new theories or algorithms remain unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the significance of their results, particularly in relation to the existing literature on adversarial learning. It would be beneficial to provide a necessary and sufficient condition for smoothed online learnability. Additionally, the authors should address the concerns regarding the straightforward nature of their proofs and clarify the implications of their findings for both theoretical and practical applications in the context of infinite label sets.
