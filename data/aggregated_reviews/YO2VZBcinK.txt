### Key Points
This paper presents topic-aware prompt learning for passage retrieval, addressing the limitations of optimizing a single vector that can lead to semantic space collapse. The authors propose using topic-based prompts derived from a topic model to enhance passage retrieval through contrastive learning. The main contributions include the introduction of multiple prompts to capture diverse semantic information and the application of hierarchical LDA for generating these prompts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- The proposed method shows promising results, achieving non-trivial improvements over baselines.
- It successfully integrates traditional topic modeling with deep retrieval methods, addressing the long-standing issue of anisotropic similarity representations.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental validation is limited, with only two dense retrieval baselines included, and several relevant works not cited.
- Important technical details regarding the selection of negative query pairs and query-passage pairs are missing.
- The novelty is constrained to combining existing methods, and the improvements over simple models are marginal.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including more baseline systems to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Specifically, consider evaluating additional systems like TAS-B and addressing the missing references to related works. Additionally, provide further ablations to clarify the impact of the contrastive loss components and ensure that comparisons between models are fair. Finally, refine the notations and formulas for clarity to enhance the paper's accessibility.
