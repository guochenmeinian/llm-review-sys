Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel unsupervised learning framework for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging, specifically addressing the challenges posed by irregularly undersampled transients. The authors propose a Virtual Scanning Reconstruction Network (VSRnet) and a SURE-based denoiser to enhance reconstruction quality and speed. Extensive experiments validate the method's effectiveness against existing approaches, demonstrating improved fidelity and robustness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces an unsupervised learning framework that eliminates the need for dense scanning and paired data, enhancing generalization to irregular relay surfaces.
2. The authors provide a thorough analysis of challenges in NLOS imaging and incorporate various relay surfaces during training, improving the model's adaptability.
3. Detailed derivation of the SURE loss and extensive real-world experimental results support the method's contributions.

Weaknesses:
1. The reliance on simple geometric shapes for testing raises concerns about the method's applicability to more complex real-world scenarios.
2. Key symbols and schematics lack sufficient explanation, which may hinder reproducibility and understanding.
3. The absence of quantitative evaluations for VSRnet and the SSIM-denoiser limits the assessment of their effectiveness.
4. The motivation for using an unsupervised framework in relation to irregularly undersampled transients is not clearly articulated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of key symbols and schematics, particularly in Figures 2 and 3, to enhance reader understanding. Additionally, providing quantitative evaluation results for VSRnet and the SSIM-denoiser would strengthen the paper. We suggest clarifying the necessity of the unsupervised framework in addressing the reconstruction problem of irregularly undersampled transients. Finally, exploring more complex relay surfaces and varying shutter patterns in experiments could further validate the method's robustness.
