Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for extracting private training molecular data from pre-trained models, addressing the emerging issue of data privacy in scientific applications. The authors propose a machine learning approach utilizing a model-independent scoring function and a Molecule Extraction Policy Network to optimize the extraction process. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments, although the authors acknowledge limitations in the realism of their scenarios and the need for further evaluation in regression tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The manuscript is well-organized with a clear motivation and problem definition.
2. The introduction of a novel molecule generation approach and scoring function provides a unique perspective on security concerns.
3. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method across various pre-training strategies.

Weaknesses:
1. The scenario presented to clarify the problem lacks realism, as molecular representations can often be concealed in classification and regression models.
2. The claim regarding the importance of training data privacy is questionable, given the availability of extensive molecular structures in public databases.
3. The scoring function lacks theoretical or chemical justification, and its relationship with the representations of R and M is unclear.
4. The experiments may not adequately capture the diversity of real-world datasets, and the choice of starting templates for generation could be improved.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the realism of their problem scenarios and provide a more robust justification for the importance of training data privacy. Additionally, we suggest conducting further experiments using a wider variety of datasets to enhance generalizability. The authors should also clarify the theoretical basis for the scoring function and analyze the relationship between the representations of R, M, and G. Finally, we encourage the exploration of additional model architectures and the construction of a more diverse template bank for molecular generation.
