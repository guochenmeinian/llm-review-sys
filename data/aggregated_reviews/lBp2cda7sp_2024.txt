Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of multinomial logistic regression (MLR) into Riemannian spaces, utilizing a straightforward approach based on the logarithm map. The authors construct the Riemannian Multinomial Logistic Regression (RMLR) framework, demonstrating its effectiveness through extensive experiments across various Riemannian backbone networks and geometries, particularly on the SPD manifold and SO(n).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The study employs a simple approach using the logarithm map, avoiding complex methods like gyro structures.
2. The geometric computations are well-founded, utilizing standard methods for tangent space analysis.
3. The paper is well-organized, balancing theoretical results with practical applications, and provides a thorough exposition of the SPD manifold.
4. The proposed RMLR framework is adaptable to different geometries, requiring only the relevant operators in Eq. 11.
5. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed classifiers, showing significant improvements in classification tasks.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper can be confusing, particularly regarding the claim about the necessity of the Riemannian logarithm and the implications of parallel transport.
2. The experimental section lacks thorough explanations, which are relegated to the appendix.
3. More details on the optimization process for learning MLR parameters are needed, particularly concerning hyperparameter selection for the SPD manifold.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity in the introduction by elaborating on the claim regarding the Riemannian logarithm and its relationship with parallel transport. Additionally, we suggest providing more comprehensive explanations in the experimental section to enhance understanding. The authors should also include a discussion on the optimization process for MLR parameters and practical guidance on selecting hyperparameters for the SPD manifold.
