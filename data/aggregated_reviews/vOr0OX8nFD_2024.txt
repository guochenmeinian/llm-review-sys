### Key Points
This paper presents M3CoL, a novel multimodal classification method that employs multimodal mixed contrastive learning to capture shared relationships beyond simple pairwise associations. The authors propose a Mixup-based augmentation for multimodal contrastive learning, which enhances performance on text-image and multimodal medical datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that M3CoL outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its significance in multimodal representation learning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of Mixup-based contrastive loss effectively captures shared relationships between different modalities, extending beyond traditional one-to-one contrastive learning.
2. The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation across diverse datasets, showcasing the effectiveness of M3CoL.

Weaknesses:
1. The performance of M3CoL may be sensitive to hyperparameters, such as the temperature parameter and the Mixup coefficient, which should be discussed.
2. The method's performance on other multimodal data types, such as audio-image/video, needs further exploration.
3. The complexity of the proposed method may hinder implementation and interpretation, particularly due to the large loss function (O(n^2) terms).
4. The novelty of the method compared to previous works is not clearly articulated, raising questions about its distinct contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the mixing process by explaining how the method handles cases where mixed elements are completely distinct and its impact on model learning. Additionally, consider exploring whether the unimodal classifiers used during training can perform inference independently, which could enhance the flexibility of M3CoL. We also suggest including a succinct results table in the main paper and moving detailed equations to the appendix to improve results presentation. Lastly, clarify the definitions of terms such as $m_i$ and ensure consistency in the mixing process illustrated in Figure 1.
