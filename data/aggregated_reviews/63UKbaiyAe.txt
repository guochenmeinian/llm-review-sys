### Key Points
This paper presents new models for extracting explicit discourse connectives and alternative lexicalizations, applying them to various genres and domains. The authors introduce the concept of sense flows, which captures the sequential arrangement of coherence relations, and find that n-gram patterns are stronger predictors than unigram distributions. The paper claims contributions in developing models for classifying discourse senses, characterizing discourse sense N-grams, and using these to distinguish rhetorical styles across documents.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-structured and clearly described, facilitating replication.  
- It effectively utilizes PDTB labels to identify both explicit signals and alternative lexicalizations.  
- The introduction of sense flows to identify rhetorical patterns across genres is a novel approach.  
- The results, particularly regarding alternative lexicalizations, are commendable.

Weaknesses:  
- The organization lacks clarity, combining distinct elements without a coherent connection.  
- Methodological limitations yield only modest enhancements in efficiency and do not adequately address Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) parsing challenges.  
- There is insufficient comparative analysis with existing methods, diminishing the paper's ability to highlight its unique contributions.  
- Some minor issues, such as missing references and typographical errors, were noted.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper's structure by explicitly connecting the elements of signal extraction and discourse sense flows. Additionally, we suggest a more thorough exploration of the potential for adapting discourse sense flow extraction to RST-style parsing. A robust comparative analysis against established methodologies should be included to underscore the distinctiveness of the proposed approach. Furthermore, the authors should address the terminological confusion in rhetorical analysis and ensure all references are complete and accurate. Lastly, we recommend providing a sample of extracted forms, particularly alternative lexicalizations, in an appendix for clarity.
