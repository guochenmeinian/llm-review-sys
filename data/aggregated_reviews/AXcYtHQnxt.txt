Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a domain adaptive semantic segmentation method tailored for cross-view settings, utilizing vision-language models for enhanced supervision. It introduces a cross-view geometric constraint to model structural changes between different viewpoints and proposes a Geodesic Flow-based Metric for measuring these changes. The authors provide extensive quantitative results, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised domain adaptation across various benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a significant and practical problem in semantic segmentation.
2. The proposed method is logically sound and well-suited to the challenges of cross-view adaptation.
3. Quantitative results convincingly demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks sufficient qualitative results, making it difficult to assess the method's performance comprehensively.
2. There is a need for clearer comparisons with prior work, particularly regarding qualitative analysis and the effectiveness of individual components.
3. The experimental benchmarks do not adequately address the open-set setting, despite its mention as a key motivation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation of the paper by enlarging visualizations and tables, particularly in the ablation studies, to enhance readability. Additionally, we suggest including more qualitative results to substantiate the quantitative findings and to provide clearer comparisons with existing methods, especially CROVIA. It would also be beneficial to clarify the motivation behind the adaptation loss design and to generalize experiments to include more unsupervised adaptation datasets. Finally, we encourage the authors to showcase the training process and computational complexity of their methods in the ablation study.
