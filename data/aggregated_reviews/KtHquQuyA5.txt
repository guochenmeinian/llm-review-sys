Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents IDRNet, a context aggregation scheme for semantic segmentation networks that utilizes deletion diagnostics to model pixel relationships. The authors propose simplifying pixel relation modeling to object relation modeling and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through qualitative and quantitative experimental results across multiple datasets. The work builds upon previous object-contextual representations (OCR) by introducing an intervention-based strategy to update, augment, or delete tokens based on semantic relations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The use of deletion diagnostics to update the relation matrix is a novel approach that addresses category context in semantic segmentation from a unique perspective.
- Extensive ablation studies validate the impact of different designs of IDRNet on segmentation performance.
- The paper is clearly presented, with self-explanatory tables and figures that facilitate understanding.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments with Mask2Former+IDRNet are limited to one dataset (ADE20K), lacking comprehensive comparisons across other datasets.
- The originality of the concept is questionable as similar methods exist in transformer networks, such as Mask2Former, which also utilize object relations.
- The paper lacks a discussion on the additional computational costs associated with the Intervention-Driven context module and does not adequately address its limitations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including performance results of Mask2Former+IDRNet on additional datasets like LIP, COCO-Stuff, and PASCAL-Context for a more comprehensive evaluation. Additionally, we suggest providing a clearer explanation of the motivation behind deletion diagnostics and its implications for the proposed method. Furthermore, addressing the computational complexity and memory consumption associated with the Intervention-Driven context module would enhance the paper's clarity and depth. Lastly, we advise revising the writing for consistency, particularly regarding the description of IDRNet in relation to its function and representation in different sections of the paper.
