### Key Points
This paper presents the MyoChallenge 2023, which aims to advance human-level dexterity and agility through two main tracks: Manipulation and Locomotion. Participants utilize a 63-musculoskeletal arm model for Manipulation tasks, focusing on stable grasps of various objects, and an 80-musculoskeletal leg model for Locomotion tasks, requiring agents to chase or evade moving objects. The Myosuite framework facilitates these challenges by providing a realistic, contact-rich, and computationally efficient virtual model, contributing significantly to neuromusculoskeletal research and artificial intelligence.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The MyoChallenge 2023 features a highly realistic simulation environment that closely mimics human movements, providing a sophisticated platform for testing advanced control algorithms.  
- The models are novel and present challenging, high-dimensional control problems relevant to control, robotics, and rehabilitation engineering.  
- The challenge promotes interdisciplinary collaboration by integrating expertise from various fields, enhancing the development of assistive technologies and rehabilitation strategies.  

Weaknesses:  
- The challenge's framework and objectives largely replicate those of previous years, raising questions about the extent of innovation.  
- The tasks, while incrementally complex, revolve around similar themes, potentially limiting the exploration of new applications.  
- The paper lacks sufficient technical detail on the challenges and evaluation mechanisms, appearing somewhat scrappy and discursive.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the documentation of the benchmark to ensure clarity and detail, particularly regarding the challenges and evaluation metrics. Additionally, introducing entirely new paradigms or significantly expanding the variety of tasks could enhance the challenge's novelty. Incorporating human-generated data for some tasks would provide valuable benchmark comparisons and address the physiological accuracy concerns mentioned in Section 5.2. Finally, conducting real-world experiments could further validate the contributions of this work.
