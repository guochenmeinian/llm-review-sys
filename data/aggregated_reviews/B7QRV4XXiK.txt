Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an alternative risk measure for risk-averse reinforcement learning (RARL) based on Gini Deviation, addressing the limitations of the mean-variance criterion. The authors derive the policy gradient for this metric and demonstrate its stability in learning risk-averse policies compared to mean-variance methods. The paper also discusses the challenges of variance-based methods, such as sensitivity to numerical scale and optimization difficulties, and empirically evaluates the proposed method across various benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The use of Gini Deviation as a risk measure is original and well-motivated, effectively illustrating the shortcomings of variance-based methods.
- The paper is well-presented, with a clear explanation of how to estimate Gini Deviation using empirical samples and its integration into a PPO-style algorithm.
- Empirical results show that the proposed method can mitigate the limitations of variance-based methods while achieving high reward returns.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a comprehensive literature review, failing to address existing studies on risk measures and coherent risk measures, which diminishes the context for its contributions.
- The theoretical foundation for the algorithm is insufficient, and there are no convergence guarantees provided.
- The empirical evaluation primarily highlights known weaknesses of mean-variance methods without sufficiently justifying the proposed metric.
- The algorithm's reliance on sorting samples in each iteration may introduce computational inefficiencies and sensitivity to parameter choices.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature coverage by including a more organized survey of related works on risk measures and coherent risk measures to contextualize their contributions. Additionally, we suggest providing theoretical support for the algorithm, including convergence guarantees, to strengthen the paper's claims. Clarifying the nature of the Gini Deviation penalty's contribution to parameter updates would enhance understanding. Furthermore, conducting ablation studies to compare Gini Deviation with variance-based methods would provide valuable insights into their relative performance. Lastly, addressing the computational complexity of the proposed method and discussing hyperparameter sensitivity in more detail would improve the overall robustness of the findings.
