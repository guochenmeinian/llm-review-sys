### Key Points
This paper presents an overview of publicly available medical imaging (MI) datasets and discusses the challenges and considerations in using MI data for machine learning (ML). The authors emphasize that MI datasets require careful handling due to the sensitive nature of healthcare data and propose that existing healthcare data standards, such as the Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR), and specialized tools for radiology/pathology should be integrated into the analysis. They provide a comparison between MI and computer vision (CV) datasets, discuss relevant data governance elements, and analyze the documentation of 30 well-known datasets, identifying issues such as vague licenses and lack of persistent links. The authors also highlight the importance of addressing social, ethical, and legal challenges associated with medical data, including data quality issues and the complexities of interpreting and annotating MI data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper addresses a crucial topic, highlighting the need for careful management of MI datasets, which is particularly relevant for machine learning practitioners lacking a healthcare background. It is well-written, clear, and aims to raise awareness about the critical aspects of medical data. The authors acknowledge the importance of existing healthcare data standards and tools, which could enhance the paper's relevance. Additionally, the engagement with reviewer feedback demonstrates a commitment to improving the work.

Weaknesses:  
The coverage of MI datasets is limited, omitting several well-known datasets like BraTs and ADNI, and failing to discuss lesser-known datasets that may lack rigorous maintenance. Some points made are not specific to MI datasets, such as data duplication, which could benefit from a comparative analysis with CV datasets. The paper lacks sufficient discussion on existing healthcare data standards and software relevant to MI. Unique challenges of MI data are not clearly articulated, particularly regarding data quality and dimensionality issues. The sample size of datasets analyzed is too small to support broad conclusions, and there is insufficient exploration of ethical and social challenges related to medical data governance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the coverage of MI datasets by including more well-known datasets and discussing lesser-known ones to provide a comprehensive view of the landscape. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the relevance of comparing MI datasets to CV datasets and focus on the unique challenges faced by MI datasets. We recommend enhancing the discussion on existing healthcare data standards for ML, specifically mentioning FHIR and relevant Python libraries for radiology/pathology images. The authors should clarify the unique challenges of MI data by quantifying data quality issues and expanding on the complexities of interpreting MI data. Increasing the sample size beyond 10 MI and 10 CV datasets would strengthen their arguments. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide specific recommendations for improving data practices and governance in MI, including the importance of regulated platforms and the need for better documentation and licensing practices, as well as including a more comprehensive discussion on the ethical and social challenges associated with medical data, addressing topics such as privacy regulations and data governance structures.
