### Key Points
This paper presents a study of contextual bandits with feedback graphs, focusing on finite context spaces. The authors propose a new graph-dependent quantity, $\beta_M(G)$, to characterize the learning complexity and establish a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{\beta_M(G) T})$, where $T$ is the number of rounds. They also derive a near-optimal upper bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{\min(\bar{\beta}(G), m(G)) T})$. The work emphasizes the differences between multi-armed bandits (MAB) with graph feedback and contextual MAB, particularly in the context of complete cross-learning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors establish significant upper and lower bounds, advancing the understanding of minimax regret in contextual bandits with feedback graphs.
- The paper provides a clear overview of hard instance constructions, aiding reader comprehension of the challenges involved.
- The incorporation of a sequential graph-theoretic zero-sum game into the bandit algorithm is a novel and intriguing approach.

Weaknesses:
- The comparison with related work, particularly [1], lacks clarity, as the authors do not adequately address the differences in problem formulation and assumptions regarding context transitions.
- The results primarily apply to specific types of context sequences, with general sequences receiving less attention.
- The upper bounds contain unnecessary logarithmic dependencies, which could be streamlined.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with the work of [1] by clearly articulating the differences in problem settings and assumptions regarding context transitions. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed explanation of equation (4) and Lemma 3.1 to enhance reader understanding. Addressing the unnecessary logarithmic dependencies in the upper bounds would also strengthen the results. Lastly, consider discussing the implications of time-varying feedback graphs, as this could broaden the applicability of the findings.
