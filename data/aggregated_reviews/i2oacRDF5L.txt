Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for computing optimal policies in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) using belief state queries (BSQ) that incorporate user preferences. The authors define a BSQ as a condition-action pair that allows for natural language expressions of user preferences. The theoretical analysis shows that the expected cost function for BSQ-compliant policies is piecewise constant, enabling a partition-based optimization algorithm. Experimental results indicate that BSQ-compliant policies outperform a baseline of randomly selected thresholds in terms of expected cost and goal achievement probability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem of user-preference compliant policy computation in partially observable settings is compelling, allowing for additional objectives beyond standard formulations.
- The BSQ framework facilitates user preference specification in a more accessible manner.
- The paper addresses limitations of previous works by providing a formal analysis and removing reliance on past traces.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation suffers from heavy notation and abstract definitions, which hinder readability.
- The expressiveness of the BSQ policy class is inadequately justified, raising questions about its comprehensiveness in capturing user preferences.
- Experimental comparisons are limited, lacking comparisons to reward calibration approaches or non-BSQ-compliant policies, which would provide deeper insights into the method's effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by simplifying notations and providing clearer definitions, particularly for goal-oriented POMDPs. Consider justifying the expressiveness of the BSQ policy class more thoroughly. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons against stronger baselines, such as grid search and random search, to better demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method. If the "BSQ preference" terminology is retained, please discuss alternative interpretations and their implications for user specification. Finally, ensure that the limitations discussed in the appendix are acknowledged in the main text for better transparency.
