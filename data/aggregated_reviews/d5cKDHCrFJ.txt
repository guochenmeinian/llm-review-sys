Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method utilizing large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic tabular data aimed at mitigating class imbalances in datasets. The authors explore various prompting techniques and validate their approach on six real-world datasets and one toy dataset, demonstrating improvements in classification performance, particularly for minority classes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The justifications for CSV formatting, class presentation, variable mapping, and task specification are clear and logical.
2. The choice of experimental results is well-motivated, and the extensive results, including numerous ablation studies, provide valuable insights.
3. The paper effectively discusses various prompt design elements, contributing to the understanding of data balancing approaches.

Weaknesses:
1. The empirical results show limited improvement in F1 scores and balanced accuracy across most datasets, raising questions about the utility of the proposed method.
2. The motivation for using LLMs for synthetic data generation lacks depth, particularly regarding their advantages over existing data augmentation techniques.
3. The prompting process appears complex without a theoretical analysis, and there is no comparison of computing costs associated with the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the utility of LLMs for synthetic data generation, particularly addressing why they are preferable to existing methods. Additionally, we suggest including a detailed analysis of the original dataset sizes and class distributions to strengthen the argument for class imbalance mitigation. It would also be beneficial to move the limitations from Appendix G to the main text for transparency and to expand on the real-world usability of the method. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore prompt optimization methods specifically designed for tabular data generation to enhance performance further.
