Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to the safety alignment of language models (LMs) using constrained Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). The authors propose a closed-form solution to the dual function of a constrained RLHF problem, which simplifies the problem to an unconstrained RLHF framework. Key contributions include two algorithms, Model-based Constrained Alignment via dualization (MoCAN) and Preference-based Constrained Alignment via dualization (PeCAN), along with a theoretical analysis of the dual function's properties and extensive experiments demonstrating improvements in both helpfulness and safety of LMs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and addresses a critical issue in LM safety alignment.
- The closed-form solution significantly reduces computational burden compared to traditional methods.
- The theoretical foundations are robust, and the empirical results support the claims made.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks details on computational resources and times, making claims about reduced computational burden unjustified.
- The evaluation of experiments is limited, particularly regarding the quality of the language models and potential over-optimization.
- The discussion of social impact is too brief, failing to acknowledge potential harmful applications of the proposed methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by providing detailed information on the computational budget and time for experiments to substantiate claims of reduced computational burden. Additionally, conducting experiments with multiple simultaneous safety constraints and exploring the effectiveness of more general preference models would enhance the robustness of the findings. A more thorough discussion of potential biases, privacy implications, and failure cases should also be included to address the limitations adequately. Finally, expanding the social impact discussion to consider dual-use applications of the proposed methods is essential.
