Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to dataset pruning and condensation, targeting on-device scenarios. The authors propose two rules for pruning condensed datasets: the first ranks images based on logit-based prediction error (LBPE), while the second ensures balanced class representation. The method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across various datasets, with clear writing and thorough experiments supporting its effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant yet underexplored problem relevant to on-device applications.
- It introduces two simple and effective rules for selecting informative samples, allowing for flexible dataset size adjustments.
- The writing is clear, and the experimental results show substantial improvements over existing methods.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation lacks fairness, particularly in comparing the proposed method against direct condensation methods.
- The motivation for condensing an already-condensed dataset is unclear, raising questions about the necessity of the two-step process.
- The proof for Theorem 1 is not sufficiently rigorous, and the analysis of class imbalance lacks depth.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind the experimental setup, particularly regarding the necessity of condensing an already-condensed dataset. Additionally, we suggest refining the proof of Theorem 1 to meet formal standards and providing a more thorough analysis of class imbalance. To enhance the evaluation, consider comparing the proposed pruning method directly with results from generating a small condensed dataset without the intermediate pruning step. This would better illustrate the advantages of the proposed approach.
