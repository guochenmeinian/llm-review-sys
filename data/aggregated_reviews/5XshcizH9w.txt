Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical framework connecting contrastive learning (CL) and distributionally robust optimization (DRO). The authors derive that the InfoNCE loss can be interpreted as DRO with a KL ball around the negative sampling distribution, and they leverage DRO insights to derive the optimal temperature parameter. The authors propose ADNCE, where the importance weight of negative samples follows a Gaussian distribution, and validate their methods through experiments across various domains.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper reveals the relationship between CL and DRO comprehensively, addressing the bias-tolerant behavior of CL.
- Theoretical findings regarding the temperature parameter are validated empirically.
- The proposed ADNCE framework shows meaningful performance improvements on datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The connection between contrastive learning and DRO lacks clarity, particularly regarding the robustness property of DRO in the presence of sampling bias.
- The design choice of Gaussian-like weights in ADNCE needs justification, and sensitivity analysis of the parameters \( \mu \) and \( \sigma \) is missing.
- The proposed approach introduces additional hyperparameters, complicating tuning, and it is unclear if performance gains stem from better hyperparameter tuning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the connection between contrastive learning and DRO, particularly in explaining how DRO mitigates sampling bias. Additionally, we suggest justifying the choice of Gaussian-like weights in ADNCE and conducting a sensitivity analysis of the parameters \( \mu \) and \( \sigma \). It would also be beneficial to clarify the meaning of "optimal" in Corollary 3.4 and to provide intuition on why maximizing the distance for all possible distributions of negative samples is essential. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to enhance the exposition for better readability and understanding, addressing the numerous minor typographical and clarity issues noted in the reviews.
