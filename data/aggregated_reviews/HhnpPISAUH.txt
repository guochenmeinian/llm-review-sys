Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents HiCS-FL, a novel client selection method for federated learning that addresses the client sampling problem in non-IID settings. It estimates clients' data statistical heterogeneity through client-updated gradients from the output layer's weights, allowing the server to identify clients with more balanced data. The method clusters clients based on their estimated data heterogeneity and preferentially samples those with balanced data, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper identifies a significant relationship between the output layer's bias gradients and label distributions, contributing to the understanding of data heterogeneity in federated learning.
- The proposed distance metric effectively estimates local data heterogeneity without incurring additional computation or communication overhead, achieving a 2x speedup over other methods.
- The extensive experiments across multiple datasets validate the robustness and generalizability of HiCS-FL.

Weaknesses:
- Privacy concerns arise from the need to access individual client updates, potentially exposing client data through gradient inversion attacks.
- The clustering approach may be less practical compared to simpler methods, and the experiments are limited to a small client set, which may not reflect the effects of heterogeneity in larger systems.
- The focus on label imbalance neglects other forms of data imbalance, such as feature imbalances, and the paper does not compare HiCS-FL with relevant algorithms like Oort and Auxo.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on privacy implications related to gradient updates and consider alternative methods to mitigate potential data leaks. Additionally, addressing other types of data imbalance could enhance the comprehensiveness of the solution. We suggest conducting experiments with a larger and more diverse client set to better understand the method's performance under varying conditions. Finally, including comparisons with algorithms like Oort and Auxo would provide a clearer context for HiCS-FL's effectiveness.
