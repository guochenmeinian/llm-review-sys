Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the identifiability of causal effects in the presence of functional dependencies, introducing concepts such as F-identifiability, functional elimination, and functional projection. It discusses the interaction between positivity constraints and functional dependencies, providing results that reduce D-separation to d-separation and F-identifiability to simpler graphs or identifiability through various theorems. The authors propose a new elimination approach for removing redundant variables while preserving identifiability, contributing to the understanding of causal effect identifiability under novel conditions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a novel problem in causal effect identifiability and extends results to include functional dependencies, which is valuable for various applications.
2. The writing is clear, and the theoretical aspects are well-explained with examples and complete proofs provided in the Appendix.
3. The proposed functional elimination approach effectively preserves identifiability while simplifying the causal graph.

Weaknesses:
1. The practical application of theoretical results to real-world datasets is not sufficiently explained, which could enhance their relevance.
2. The proposed conditions for determining causal effect identifiability are incomplete, lacking a comprehensive condition.
3. The paper is dense with results, and multiple theorems could potentially be consolidated into more general rules for clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the practical relevance of their theoretical results by providing examples of real-world datasets where these concepts can be applied. Additionally, consider consolidating the numerous theorems into two general rules—one for reducing F-identifiability to simpler graphs and another for reducing F-identifiability to identifiability. It would also be beneficial to add a section titled “Motivating Example” to illustrate a hypothetical case study demonstrating the advantages of their approach. Furthermore, we suggest formally stating all assumptions and clarifying the implications of functional variables, particularly when they are the treatment/target variable. Lastly, addressing the limitations of the technical content more explicitly and providing justifications for NeurIPS checklist items would strengthen the paper.
