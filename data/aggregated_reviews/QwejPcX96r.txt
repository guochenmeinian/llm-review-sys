### Key Points
This paper presents an examination of GPT-3.5's translation capabilities for literary texts at both paragraph and sentence levels across 18 languages. The authors collect a dataset of 360 aligned source-target paragraphs and conduct a human evaluation using the Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) framework to assess translation quality. The findings indicate that paragraph-level translations are preferred, particularly highlighting issues with translations into Japanese and errors in Polish regarding gender and case.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The focus on literary translation is under-studied and provides unique insights.
- The human evaluation is rigorous, exploring both error types and preferences among translation outputs.
- The clarity of results and organization of the paper enhance its readability.

Weaknesses:
- The scientific contribution is limited, lacking novelty and depth in analysis.
- The reproducibility of results is questionable due to the opaque nature of the models used and insufficient methodological details.
- The paper conflates document-level and paragraph-level translation, leading to potential confusion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the scientific rigor by providing a clearer comparison of GPT-3.5 with a fine-tuned model on literary texts, as this would yield more relevant insights. Additionally, addressing the lack of background literature on document-level translation evaluation is crucial. We suggest clarifying the applicability of findings to other LLMs and ensuring that the data practices comply with ethical standards, particularly regarding paywalled content. Finally, we encourage the authors to streamline the presentation by reducing the reliance on footnotes and revising figures and tables for clarity and relevance.
