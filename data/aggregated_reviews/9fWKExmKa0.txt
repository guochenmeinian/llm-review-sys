Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DPM-Solver-v3, a new sampling algorithm for solving diffusion ODEs using Rosenbrock-type exponential integrators. The method pre-computes empirical model statistics to minimize the gradient norm of the non-linear term, thereby reducing discretization error. Empirical results indicate that DPM-Solver-v3 excels in both unconditional and conditional sampling, outperforming DPM-Solver++ and UniPC, particularly in scenarios with fewer function evaluations (NFEs).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of empirical model statistics from Rosenbrock-type exponential integrators enhances model parametrization, leading to lower discretization error.
- Experimental results demonstrate that DPM-Solver-v3 consistently outperforms existing methods across various datasets and models, especially in low NFE regimes.
- The theoretical framework for local/global error is well-articulated and appears reasonable.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on pre-computed empirical model statistics introduces additional memory costs and limits adaptability to new use cases.
- The estimation error of the empirical model statistics (EMS) is not adequately addressed, particularly given the instability observed in the results.
- The improvements over prior works seem incremental, and the paper lacks a thorough comparison with typical stochastic samplers, which may yield better sample quality.
- Some experimental results may not ensure fairness, as differences in FID scores appear negligible when accounting for necessary evaluations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of EMS estimation errors, particularly in relation to the observed instability in the results. It would be beneficial to provide a clearer justification for the choice of coefficients and their impact on higher-order solvers. Additionally, we suggest incorporating comparisons with typical stochastic samplers to better contextualize the performance of DPM-Solver-v3. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the unique contributions of their work relative to existing methods and to ensure that all quantitative results are presented in the main body for enhanced clarity.
