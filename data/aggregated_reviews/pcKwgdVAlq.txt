Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Binarized Spectral-Redistribution Network (BiSRNet) for efficient hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration from compressed measurements in snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) systems. The authors propose a novel binarized convolutional layer, BiSR-Conv, which redistributes HSI representations before binarization and employs a scalable hyperbolic tangent function to approximate the Sign function in backpropagation. The design includes four binarized convolution modules to address dimensional mismatch during feature reshaping. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that BiSRNet outperforms state-of-the-art binarization methods while maintaining comparable performance to full-precision algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed BiSRNet effectively utilizes binarized deep learning for HSI reconstruction.
2. The design of four binarized convolution modules allows for the propagation of full precision information throughout the network.
3. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments validate the performance of BiSRNet, surpassing existing state-of-the-art binarized neural networks by significant margins.

Weaknesses:
1. The binarization scheme lacks specific optimization for HSI restoration and does not compare with other general binarized neural networks or reconstruction tasks.
2. Some technical aspects, such as the derivation of the 3D mask and the dimensional mismatch handling, are insufficiently detailed.
3. The paper does not discuss approximation error bounds, which are crucial for understanding the performance of binarized neural networks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the formula for converting model parameters from 32 bits to 1 bit in the binarized convolution layer. Additionally, the authors should provide practical cases demonstrating the use of mobile edge devices for HSI restoration. It would be beneficial to include a detailed analysis of how the full-precision information impacts the network's performance and to discuss the limitations of the proposed method more thoroughly. Finally, we suggest that the authors clarify the definition of the Sign and Tanh functions in their context to avoid confusion.
