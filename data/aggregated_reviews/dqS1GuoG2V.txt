### Key Points
This paper presents the Memory Perturbation Equation (MPE) as a method to measure the sensitivity of machine learning models to their training data, utilizing the Bayesian Learning Rule (BLR). The authors argue that existing sensitivity properties are inadequately understood and propose the MPE as a unifying framework that generalizes prior approaches. The paper includes empirical validation, demonstrating that the MPE can accurately estimate generalization performance across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written, with clear conceptual development and solid methodology.  
- The MPE is a versatile and general method that can potentially impact deep learning significantly.  
- Empirical results are presented clearly, showing strong correlations between estimated sensitivity and actual deviations.

Weaknesses:  
- The presentation could be improved for better accessibility, particularly for readers unfamiliar with the topic.  
- There is a lack of comprehensive comparisons to existing data influence methods, and the empirical results, while interesting, show diminishing performance with larger models.  
- Several terms, such as "memory" and "sharpness," are not adequately defined, and there are numerous typos and grammatical errors throughout the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the background and explanation of key concepts to enhance accessibility for readers with limited familiarity. Specifically, a small exposition on the BLR and clearer definitions of terms like "memory" and "sharpness" would be beneficial. Additionally, we suggest including a more thorough comparison to existing data influence methods and addressing the limitations of empirical results, particularly regarding the performance of larger models. Finally, a careful review to correct typos and grammatical errors is essential for clarity.
