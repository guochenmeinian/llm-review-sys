### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework named Bi-ACL to address data imbalance and representation degeneration in multilingual machine translation (MNMT). The authors propose a bidirectional autoencoder and a bidirectional contrastive learning technique to leverage monolingual data and bilingual dictionaries, demonstrating improved translation performance for low-resource languages. The experiments indicate robustness across various resource levels, although BLEU scores remain low.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed approach is novel and combines accessible techniques to enhance MNMT.
- The framework effectively addresses challenges in extremely low-resource translation directions.
- Experiments are thorough, showcasing the effectiveness of the Bi-ACL framework.

Weaknesses:
- The method section is difficult to follow, particularly regarding the contrastive learning process and the rationale behind positive and negative examples.
- The reported BLEU scores are low, raising questions about the significance of the improvements.
- Some technical details and notations are unclear, leading to confusion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method section, particularly in explaining the contrastive learning process and the construction of positive and negative examples. Additionally, we suggest adding statistical significance tests to the BLEU tables to clarify the implications of the reported scores. The authors should also consider revising notations for better readability and providing more detailed explanations of the bilingual dictionary's role and the implementation of curriculum learning. Finally, addressing the limitations of requiring substantial monolingual data for extremely low-resource languages would strengthen the paper.
