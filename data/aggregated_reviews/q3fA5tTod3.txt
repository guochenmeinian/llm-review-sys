Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study that employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict voxel responses across several regions of interest (ROIs) in the human brain when exposed to natural scenes. The authors develop a strategy termed "brain dissection" to analyze the tuning of specific visual regions to mid-level image characteristics such as depth, curvature, and object relations. The findings reveal distinct feature preferences among the ROIs, contributing to the understanding of visual stream organization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The methodology is original, effectively applying an existing computational strategy to a novel scientific investigation.
- The paper is well-written, clearly organized, and addresses significant questions at the intersection of machine learning and neuroscience.
- The results are important and align with existing literature, providing valuable insights into visual processing in the brain.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks comprehensive descriptions of methods and related work, which may hinder reader understanding.
- Claims regarding functional preferences in specific regions are somewhat speculative and not explicitly tested.
- The theoretical contribution is unclear, as the study does not convincingly demonstrate how the proposed method surpasses previous approaches.
- There is no baseline experiment to validate the improvements from the proposed method, and the results are primarily data-driven without clear implications for understanding high-level visual region functions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related work and methodology to enhance clarity and context. Specifically, include a more comprehensive description of the methods and relevant literature to support or refute the introduced hypotheses about the subdivision of the "scene network." Additionally, clearly report the performance of the trained model across all ROIs to facilitate meaningful interpretation of the brain dissection analysis. It would also be beneficial to rule out non-selective voxels from the analysis to avoid misleading interpretations. Finally, consider discussing the biological plausibility of the model and how the findings relate to real brain functions, potentially making experimentally testable predictions.
