Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper adapts Maia, a group-level model variant of AlphaZero, to function at an individual level, focusing on scaling individual behavior fitting using techniques like LoRA for fine-tuning LLMs. The authors demonstrate that learned embeddings encode decision-making styles corresponding to individual behaviors, allowing for the creation of synthetic styles through linear combinations of these embeddings. The paper also explores modeling user behavior in chess and Rocket League using a PEFT-based method with MHR adapters, showing improved performance in predicting player actions. The authors claim that their approach captures a wide diversity of strategies and allows for the steering of user vectors to produce new styles.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper presents an innovative technical solution using LoRA and routing matrices for player style vector extraction through behavioral cloning.
- The approach is simple yet intuitive, yielding improved performance over prior work and enabling interesting analyses/applications.
- The dataset is well-partitioned, allowing for strong analysis of inter-player and intra-player consistency.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a proper benchmark for comparing accuracy gains, leaving uncertainty about the actual improvements achieved by the method.
- The MHR approach underperforms full fine-tuning when a large number of games are available, and the computational cost of the approach is not adequately discussed.
- The novelty of the proposed method is limited, as it builds on existing techniques without sufficiently clarifying the significance of behavior stylometry in practical applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the benchmarking of their method by establishing a theoretically optimal benchmark for maximal possible accuracy gains across all datasets. Additionally, grounding the discussion in section 5.1 with compute estimates, such as estimated FLOPs, would enhance clarity regarding computational costs. The authors should also provide a more thorough explanation of the significance of behavior stylometry and its practical applications, particularly in the context of existing high-performance models in chess. Finally, exploring the potential of integrating their technique with IRL schemes and studying its implications in biometric recognition could provide valuable insights.
