Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a two-part investigation into the robustness of AI-generated text detection algorithms against paraphrasing. The authors propose DIPPER, an 11B parameter Transformer model fine-tuned from T5-XXL, which effectively generates paraphrases that evade detection by existing algorithms. In the second part, the authors introduce a retrieval-based detection method that successfully identifies paraphrased text, achieving detection rates between 80% to 97% while maintaining a low false positive rate of 1% for human-written sequences.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents a clear hypothesis regarding the detection of AI-generated text.
- DIPPER is a novel and effective paraphrasing model that demonstrates high-quality paraphrase generation.
- The experimental results are solid, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed retrieval-based detection method.
- The authors provide an extensive discussion of the limitations of their approach, particularly regarding the retrieval-based system.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on a comprehensive database of all AI-generated texts raises practical concerns about feasibility and scalability, especially for popular LLMs.
- The evaluation methodology for the detection system is flawed, as it primarily adjusts thresholds based on human-generated continuations without adequately addressing the diversity of the test set.
- The paper lacks direct comparisons with non-DIPPER paraphrasers, which could clarify the claims about DIPPER's superiority.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation methodology by incorporating a more diverse set of human-generated texts in the test dataset to enhance the robustness of their detection method. Additionally, the authors should consider developing a similarity metric that specifically targets paraphrased texts to reduce false positives. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors provide direct experimental comparisons with existing paraphrasing models to substantiate their claims regarding DIPPER's effectiveness. Lastly, addressing the ethical implications of storing user-generated text for retrieval in the main body of the paper would strengthen the discussion on the practical deployment of their method.
