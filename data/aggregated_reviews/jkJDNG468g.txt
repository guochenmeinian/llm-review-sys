### Key Points
This paper presents CY-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset for sub-national crop yield forecasting, specifically for maize and wheat across 42 countries. Key contributions include the creation of a standardized dataset that integrates various predictors such as weather, soil properties, and remote sensing indicators, facilitating consistent evaluations of machine learning models. The dataset supports diverse research efforts, including time series forecasting and domain adaptation, and is publicly accessible, promoting interdisciplinary collaboration among experts in agronomy, climate science, and machine learning. Additionally, the authors introduce enhancements to yield forecasting models, including the introduction of residual models that subtract linear trends to forecast residuals, which show improved performance over traditional models. They propose the use of an InceptionTime model, a 1-D CNN, and a Transformer model, with preliminary results indicating comparable normalized RMSE values among these models. The authors have also updated their results after refining data preprocessing, particularly aligning input data with crop growing seasons, leading to improved performance metrics for machine learning models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Comprehensive Dataset: Covers a wide range of countries and crop types, providing extensive data for model training and evaluation.
- Standardization: Ensures consistent data preprocessing and evaluation, facilitating fair comparisons between different models.
- Multidisciplinary Cooperation: Involves experts from agriculture, climate, and machine learning, enhancing dataset quality and applicability.
- Good Documentation: The shared code and documentation are detailed and intuitive, aiding reproducibility.
- Innovative Techniques: The introduction of residual models demonstrates innovative forecasting techniques that outperform traditional methods.
- Advanced Model Implementation: The exploration of multiple advanced models (InceptionTime and Transformer) shows a commitment to diverse methodologies.
- Improved Performance: Updated results indicate significant improvements in model performance after addressing data preprocessing issues.

Weaknesses:
- No Differentiation Between Irrigated and Non-Irrigated Systems: This could lead to inaccuracies in yield forecasts for regions with mixed farming practices.
- Absence of Weather Forecast Integration: Models cannot access future weather conditions beyond the lead time, potentially missing critical information affecting crop yields.
- Inadequate Comparison with Existing Datasets: CY-Bench is not compared with existing datasets, limiting its contextual relevance.
- Lack of Formal Problem Formulation: The exact training task of the benchmark is unclear due to the omission of a formal definition.
- Preliminary Results for the Transformer Model: Suggest it may require further adaptation to fully leverage its capabilities for the specific task.
- Variability in Model Effectiveness: Performance metrics indicate variability in model effectiveness across different cases.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset by differentiating between irrigated and non-irrigated systems to enhance yield prediction accuracy. Additionally, integrating future weather forecasts into the models would provide critical information that impacts crop yields. To strengthen the dataset's relevance, we suggest adding comparisons with existing datasets, including metrics such as duration, temporal, and spatial resolution. Furthermore, providing more details on data source and feature selection, as well as including an ablation study to justify feature choices, would enhance the dataset's quality. We also recommend that the authors improve the adaptation of the Transformer model to better suit the specifics of their forecasting task. Lastly, further exploration of the factors contributing to the variability in model performance across different cases would enhance the robustness of the findings.
