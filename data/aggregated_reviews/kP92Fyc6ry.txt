Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CryoBench, a benchmark suite for evaluating heterogeneous reconstruction methods in cryo-EM, featuring five synthetic datasets that illustrate conformational and compositional heterogeneity. The authors propose innovative metrics, including Neighborhood Similarity, Information Imbalance, and Per-Conformation Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC), and provide a comprehensive evaluation of ten state-of-the-art methods. The study aims to advance cryo-EM and structural biology by establishing a standardized framework for comparison and improvement of reconstruction techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles a significant topic, providing a well-structured and comprehensive evaluation of cryo-EM methods.
- The introduction of new quantitative metrics and the creation of challenging synthetic datasets represent original contributions to the field.
- The study is clearly presented, with informative figures and tables that enhance understanding.

Weaknesses:
- The data-sharing and code-sharing plan is unclear, causing confusion regarding the accessibility of the datasets and tools.
- The reliance on synthetic datasets with known ground truths limits the applicability of the findings to real-world scenarios.
- Some new metrics may be complex and require additional clarification for broader accessibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the data-sharing and code-sharing plan, explicitly stating whether future contributions to the dataset are invited. Additionally, incorporating more diverse and realistic datasets, including real-world data, would enhance the practical relevance of the benchmark. We suggest simplifying the explanations of the new metrics to ensure they are accessible to a wider audience. Finally, addressing the complexities of noise models in synthetic datasets would better reflect real experimental conditions.
