Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on outlier-robust location estimation for symmetric distributions, specifically focusing on semi-product and elliptical distributions. The authors demonstrate that for "semi-product" distributions, one can achieve an asymptotic error of $O(\epsilon \sqrt{\log 1/\epsilon})$ with a polynomial number of samples and time, and $O(\epsilon)$ asymptotic error with quasipolynomially many samples. For elliptical distributions, they achieve similar results under certain conditions on the scatter matrix. The authors adapt the filtering framework and propose using variants of the Huber loss, allowing them to surpass the $\sqrt{\epsilon}$ error threshold even when covariance matrices are unknown.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper identifies special classes of distributions (semi-product and elliptical) that allow for improved error rates in robust statistics, overcoming limitations of prior works.
- The adaptation of the filtering framework with Huber loss is innovative and offers potential for broader applications.
- The writing is generally clear and the paper is well-structured.

Weaknesses:
- Clarity issues exist, particularly regarding the comparison of guarantees with prior works and the knowledge assumptions of the algorithms.
- The practical relevance of the studied distributions is not well justified, relying heavily on theoretical motivations.
- Some technical claims may be overstated, and the presentation lacks a conclusion or final overview.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the knowledge assumptions in Theorems 1.4-1.6, explicitly stating what the algorithm needs to know about the scatter matrix. Additionally, we suggest revising the claims regarding the sub-Gaussian error rates to reflect a more accurate characterization of the sample complexity. The authors should also consider providing a more comprehensive discussion on the practical relevance of semi-product and elliptical distributions to enhance the paper's persuasive power. Finally, including a concluding section summarizing the findings and implications of the work would improve the overall presentation.
