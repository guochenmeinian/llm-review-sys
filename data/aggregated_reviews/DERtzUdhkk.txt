### Key Points
This paper presents TorchSpatial, a deep learning framework and benchmark for positional encoding, crucial for spatial representation learning (SRL). TorchSpatial comprises three components: a unified framework with 15 positional encodings for geographical data, a benchmark called LocBench featuring 7 geo-aware image classification datasets and 4 geo-aware image regression datasets, and a novel method to quantify geographic bias, termed the Geo-Bias Score. The authors demonstrate through experiments that TorchSpatial addresses gaps in SRL by providing a community-shared framework and benchmark.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The framework and benchmarks are comprehensive, covering various scenarios in SRL.
2. The innovative Geo-Bias Score effectively quantifies geographic bias, enhancing interpretability.
3. The paper is well-structured, facilitating smooth reading, and the extensive experiments support the arguments presented.

Weaknesses:
1. The interaction between image encoding and location encoding is not adequately presented in the paper.
2. The description of the Geo-Bias Score lacks necessary mathematical formulations.
3. Some hyperparameters of the Geo-Bias Score are challenging to set, potentially affecting its application.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the mathematical formulation of the Geo-Bias Score and provide a description of hyperparameter selection for different scenarios. Additionally, the description of location encoding should be enriched, and its relationship to image encoding should be briefly elaborated. Including practical case studies or real-world applications would enhance the paper's appeal. Finally, clarifying the licensing of the datasets and ensuring compliance with original authors' licenses is essential.
