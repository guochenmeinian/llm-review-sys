Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a bias-unsupervised method, uLA, aimed at addressing spurious correlations without requiring group annotations during training or validation. The authors introduce a new dataset, sMPI3D, to evaluate their method, which utilizes self-supervised learning (SSL) representations for bias information extraction. The empirical results indicate that uLA outperforms existing methods that rely on bias annotations across various benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles a significant issue regarding spurious correlations in the absence of group annotations.
- The proposed algorithm is straightforward yet effective, showing promising results in systematic generalization scenarios.
- The introduction of the sMPI3D dataset is a valuable contribution, facilitating the evaluation of model performance across subgroups.

Weaknesses:
- The role of SSL in the training pipeline remains unclear, and the authors should clarify the criteria for selecting the pretraining scheme.
- The robustness of the algorithm to different hyperparameter settings is questionable, necessitating further insights and a more principled hyperparameter search method.
- The presentation could be improved, particularly in explaining the dataset construction and the insights behind key equations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the exposition of how bias variable observations are extracted and provide more detail on the dataset construction. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion on the connections between uLA and existing distributional robustness approaches. To enhance clarity, the authors should also justify the model validation procedure at every epoch and provide empirical verification of the logit adjustment method's effectiveness. Finally, addressing the efficiency concerns related to SSL training time and resource requirements would strengthen the paper.
