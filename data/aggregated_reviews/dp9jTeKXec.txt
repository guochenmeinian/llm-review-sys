### Key Points
This paper presents a new method for document-level informative argument extraction through a simple-to-complex progressive framework. The authors propose ordering predicted events based on their difficulty to mitigate error propagation in argument extraction. The empirical evaluation suggests slight improvements over existing methods, particularly in a Wikipedia-based dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper identifies and addresses the error propagation issue in sequential prediction for event argument detection, which is of significant reference value.  
- The proposed method is well-motivated, clearly explained, and shows some effectiveness in empirical studies.  
- The organization and writing of the paper are commendable, with comprehensive experiments validating the proposed framework.

Weaknesses:  
- The performance improvements of the proposed model are marginal and lack robust statistical validation to confirm that these gains are not due to chance.  
- Some core components, such as the Order Adaptive Argument Pair Constraints, are not clearly articulated, necessitating additional examples or descriptions.  
- The experimental setup lacks detail, and the reliance on a single dataset may limit the generalizability of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of core modules, particularly the Order Adaptive Argument Pair Constraints, by adding examples or detailed descriptions. Additionally, conducting statistical significance tests on the performance improvements would enhance the credibility of the results. The authors should also consider expanding their experimental evaluation beyond the WikiEvents dataset to strengthen their claims. Finally, including a brief description of the proposed methods in the introduction would provide better context for readers.
