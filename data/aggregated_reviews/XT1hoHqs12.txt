### Key Points
This paper addresses prompt readability in the knowledge probing task and proposes READPROMPT, a method for constructing prompts that achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly enhancing readability compared to other automated prompting methods. The authors highlight a misalignment between constructed prompts and knowledge, suggesting that current prompting methods may overestimate the knowledge contained within pre-trained language models (PLMs). The paper also outlines future research directions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper presents a significant contribution by addressing the important issue of prompt readability and misalignment with real-world knowledge.
- The experimental results are convincing, demonstrating the utility of READPROMPT in maximizing knowledge probing effectiveness.
- The analysis of "attack" prompts adds valuable insights into the interpretability of optimized prompts.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed READPROMPT lacks novelty and does not provide significant reference value; the experimental results on existing models are not compelling enough.
- The dataset and pre-training model used are insufficient, and the paper lacks detailed discussions on hyper-parameters and experimental setups, which could hinder reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of the READPROMPT framework by providing more compelling experimental results and a clearer theoretical contribution. Additionally, we suggest incorporating detailed discussions on hyper-parameters and the experimental setup to enhance reproducibility. Clarifying the iterative update process of trigger tokens and discussing the implications of the constrained search would also strengthen the paper. Finally, we encourage the authors to address the awkward phrasing in several sections and ensure consistent terminology and notation throughout the manuscript.
