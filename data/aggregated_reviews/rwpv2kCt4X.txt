### Key Points
This paper presents EGISES, a new metric for measuring personalization in summarization tasks. The authors argue that existing accuracy measures are inadequate, particularly when saliency is subjective, and provide theoretical and empirical evidence supporting EGISES's effectiveness. Their analysis of ten state-of-the-art summarization models indicates that EGISES is stable concerning bias and variance and correlates reliably with human judgment.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and organized, making it a pleasure to read.
- The theoretical proofs establish that EGISES can model personalization effectively.
- The correlation analysis demonstrates that P-Acc differs from existing measures, highlighting the importance of personalization in summarization.

Weaknesses:
- The necessity of the new metric is unclear, as existing metrics like ROUGE may suffice.
- The proposed metric is only tested on a single dataset, limiting its generalizability.
- There is no human judgment included in the evaluation, which is a significant concern.
- The computational complexity is high due to multiple Jenson-Shannon Divergence calculations.
- Limited comparisons with classic metrics such as BERTScore raise questions about the robustness of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 7.2 by providing details on the alpha and beta values used in Table 6. Additionally, addressing the high correlation between P-Acc and Acc would clarify the metric's contribution. We suggest including BERTScore in the evaluation to strengthen comparisons with established metrics. Furthermore, we advise incorporating human judgment in future evaluations to validate the effectiveness of EGISES. Lastly, the authors should provide more details on the computational aspects of the metric to address concerns regarding its complexity.
