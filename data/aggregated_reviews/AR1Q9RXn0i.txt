### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of various contrastive network architectures using multiple distance metrics. The authors provide code implementation for their evaluation framework and report valuable information on optimal combinations of backbone and loss configurations. They demonstrate the superiority of triplet loss for memorization detection and establish a connection between this detection and safe generative artificial intelligence.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper offers a thorough analysis of different architectures and distance metrics, contributing valuable insights into optimal configurations.  
- Statistical significance is assessed with reported p-values, enhancing the credibility of the findings.  
- The connection to generative artificial intelligence provides a foundation for further exploration.

Weaknesses:  
- The evaluation is limited to a private dataset, raising concerns about the generalizability of the results and the validity of the claims regarding data leakage assessment.  
- The use of a fixed $\tau$ value without exploring its impact on performance limits the analysis.  
- The statistical tests used for pairwise comparisons are not clearly described, leaving ambiguity in the methodology.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by evaluating their method on publicly available medical datasets. Additionally, we suggest that the authors analyze performance with varying $\tau$ values to provide a more comprehensive understanding. Finally, we urge the authors to clarify the specific statistical tests employed to determine the superiority of different loss functions, as this information is crucial for validating their claims.
