Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel graph Spectral Alignment (SPA) framework for unsupervised domain adaptation, which includes a coarse graph alignment mechanism using a spectral regularizer and a fine-grained message propagation module that employs a neighbor-aware self-training mechanism. The authors utilize spectral distance to quantify the distribution gap and enhance feature aggregation through pseudo-labeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SPA across multiple datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-organized and clearly presents the proposed method, which is innovative and addresses a critical tradeoff in graph alignment.  
- The introduction of spectral distance as a measure of domain gap is a significant contribution, and the experimental results validate the efficacy of the approach.  
- The framework is easy to follow, with clear writing and comprehensive experiments on commonly used datasets.

Weaknesses:  
- The contribution of the paper lacks clarity, as it directly employs existing spectral distance measures without significant technical development.  
- The novelty is limited, with the graph alignment extending from existing methods and the neighbor-aware self-training mechanism resembling embedding propagation.  
- There are concerns regarding the clarity of certain details, such as the construction of dynamic graphs, the balance of loss terms in the total loss equation, and the visualization of domain-wise graphs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the contribution by providing more technical development of the spectral distance and differentiating their method from existing approaches. Additionally, we suggest including more ablation studies to support claims regarding the balance of transferability and discriminability. The introduction should be made more informative by adding technical details and comparative descriptions of previous works. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the construction of dynamic graphs, the rationale behind using weighted k-Nearest-Neighbor classification for pseudo-labeling, and provide a more detailed analysis of experimental results.
