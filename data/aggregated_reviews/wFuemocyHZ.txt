Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of SDE and ODE-based samplers for diffusion models, introducing a new solver called Restart for sampling. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of Restart on various unconditional and conditional generation tasks, highlighting its ability to balance sampling speed and quality. Theoretical insights into error propagation in diffusion models are provided, showing that ODE samplers excel in low NFE regimes while SDE samplers perform better in high NFE regimes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents a clear theoretical analysis of the differences between ODE and SDE samplers.
- Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed Restart method, showing improved performance over existing samplers.

Weaknesses:
- There is ambiguity in Theorems 1 and 2, particularly regarding their implications when $[t_{\min},t_{\max}] = [0,T]$.
- The performance of Restart in the small NFE regime (NFE â‰¤ 30) is unclear, and comparisons with recent fast samplers are lacking.
- The method relies on several hyperparameters that may complicate tuning in practical applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Theorems 1 and 2 by reformulating them to explain how ODE and SDE have distinct winning regions even when $[t_{\min},t_{\max}] = [0,T]$. Additionally, the authors should provide performance metrics for Restart in the small NFE regime and compare it with recent fast samplers such as [1], [2], and [3]. It would also be beneficial to include a thorough evaluation of the method's performance across various datasets and NFEs, particularly for low NFEs, and to address the sensitivity of hyperparameters beyond the number of restart iterations.
