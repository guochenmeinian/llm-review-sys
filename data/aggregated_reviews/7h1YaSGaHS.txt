Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method called GEESE (Generative Exploitation and Exploration guided by hybrid Surrogate Error) aimed at improving sample efficiency in solving inverse problems in science and engineering. The authors propose a hybrid surrogate error model that combines explicit and implicit error estimations, with the implicit errors modeled using an ensemble of neural networks. GEESE employs a generative twin state selection approach to balance exploration and exploitation, thereby reducing the number of queries needed for physical evaluations. Experimental results indicate that GEESE outperforms baseline methods in both query times and failure rates across various real-world applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel algorithm, GEESE, which effectively reduces query times while maintaining low error tolerance.
- The architecture is innovative, particularly the twin state selection strategy that proposes both near-optimal and informative states.
- Clear writing and effective notation enhance the paper's presentation.
- Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the method's superiority over existing approaches.

Weaknesses:
- The integration of the existing ML model within the GEESE algorithm is unclear, raising questions about its role beyond activation.
- The method's reliance on training data for neural networks may incur significant computational costs.
- The paper lacks detailed explanations of the tasks in Table 1 and the implications of low observation dimensions compared to prior works.
- The introduction could be more concise, and the practical aspects of the D-dimensional state space need clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the integration of the existing ML model within GEESE, explicitly stating its purpose and contributions. Additionally, providing a detailed explanation of the tasks presented in Table 1 would enhance understanding. The authors should also consider elaborating on the implications of low observation dimensions and include a practical introduction to the D-dimensional state space. Lastly, we suggest shortening the introduction to focus on the contributions and methodology more directly.
