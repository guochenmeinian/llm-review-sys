Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
The paper presents WordScape, a pipeline for generating a large-scale, multilingual, and multimodal corpus for document layout detection, utilizing the Open XML structure of Word documents sourced from Common Crawl. It incorporates meticulous data processing techniques such as bounding box annotation, text extraction, and language identification. The authors have revised the paper to include a detailed document type analysis, layout diversity analysis, and benchmark evaluations. Experimental results indicate that pretraining on datasets from WordScape can significantly reduce the need for manual annotation in downstream tasks. WordScape is released as a list of URLs and SHA-256 hashes to avoid copyright and privacy issues, emphasizing its scalability while acknowledging the trade-off between scalability and annotation accuracy. However, the paper lacks experimental comparisons with other existing datasets and targeted experiments for multi-domain and multi-language validation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
- WordScape is the first pipeline for creating a large-scale, multimodal, and multilingual corpus for visual document understanding.
- The authors conducted a comprehensive document type analysis and layout diversity analysis, enhancing the understanding of the dataset.
- A novel bounding box labeling algorithm based on Open XML representation ensures high-quality data generation without manual annotation.
- The dynamic nature of the dataset allows for the creation of up-to-date pretraining data, which is a significant advantage.
- Experimental validation shows that pretraining on WordScape datasets alleviates manual annotation burdens and demonstrates effectiveness in low-resource settings.
- The authors have open-sourced the code and data, fostering further research in visual document understanding.

**Weaknesses:**
- The paper lacks a detailed explanation of how WordScape addresses the limitations of existing methods in terms of domain coverage and language support.
- Experiments only compare pretraining on WordScape datasets with no pretraining, lacking comparisons with other existing datasets to validate its superiority.
- The quality of bounding box annotations is questioned, with no strategies provided to address potential inaccuracies.
- The documentation lacks a clear plan for maintaining the dataset and code, and the GitHub link provided is invalid.
- The paper does not release the full dataset, which may limit accessibility for researchers.
- Performance improvements from pretraining on WordScape are less pronounced in resource-rich settings, raising questions about its applicability in such scenarios.
- Some annotation errors were noted, which could affect the perceived quality of the dataset.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- The authors should improve the explanation of how WordScape overcomes the limitations of existing methods, particularly regarding domain and language diversity.
- Additional experiments comparing pretraining on WordScape datasets with other existing datasets should be included to validate its advantages in multi-domain and multi-language contexts.
- The authors are encouraged to provide strategies for improving annotation accuracy and to quantify the error rates associated with the automatic annotations.
- A clear plan for maintaining the dataset and code should be established, potentially considering repositories like Zenodo for long-term accessibility.
- The authors should clarify the specific number of pre-trained data corresponding to the results presented in Figure 5 and provide a more intuitive comparison of existing datasets, possibly using tables.
- The authors should improve the clarity of the dataset release rationale, emphasizing the balance between reproducibility and copyright concerns.
- The authors are encouraged to provide more detailed analyses of the document layout and topic diversity to further illustrate the dataset's richness.
- The authors should consider including additional experiments that highlight the performance of WordScape in various resource settings to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of its capabilities.
- The authors are also encouraged to propose potential solutions to address the limitations of bounding box annotation reliability.
