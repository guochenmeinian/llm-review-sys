Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for approximate Kalman filtering and smoothing using low-rank approximations, aiming to reduce the cubic complexity of traditional methods to linear or quadratic complexity under certain assumptions. The authors derive fully low-rank predict, update, and smoothing equations, demonstrating their method's effectiveness through various high-dimensional problems. Additionally, the paper critiques the ensemble Kalman filter, highlighting its limitations in tracking low-rank approximations to the state covariance matrix and the necessity of ad-hoc improvements in practice. The authors assert that their proposed alternative addresses these deficiencies and clarify that covariance matrices need only be positive semi-definite, a property that holds for their method. They also note that their citations regarding the ensemble Kalman filter were intended to illustrate its development for computational cost reduction, not as an endorsement.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses the critical issue of super-linear complexity in exact Kalman filtering/smoothing, providing an appealing low-rank factorization approach.
- The derivation is thorough and mathematically sound, with the theoretical contributions being well-judged and relevant.
- The authors effectively identify and address misconceptions regarding the ensemble Kalman filter and its limitations.
- The experimental evaluation includes interesting high-dimensional examples, showcasing the method's performance against existing techniques.
- The clarification on the positive semi-definiteness of covariance matrices is a valuable contribution.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental evaluation lacks simple, low-dimensional models for better visualization and reader intuition.
- The comparison against the ensemble Kalman filter is deemed unfair due to its simplicity, lacking a benchmark against more complex methods.
- The paper is notationally dense, which may obscure the method's simplicity; sections could benefit from being streamlined or supplemented with visual aids.
- The assumption of low rank $r$ is a limitation that is not sufficiently discussed, and comparisons with deterministic algorithms are lacking.
- The absence of specific alternative methods suggested by reviewers limits the discussion on potential improvements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental evaluation by including a simple, low-dimensional model that can be easily visualized, such as a synthetic LDS with dimension ~10. This would help build reader intuition through visual comparisons of state and low-rank factors. 

We encourage the authors to improve their comparisons by including more recent and complex methods that also estimate low-rank covariance matrices, as this would provide a fairer assessment of their proposed method's performance. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion on how to choose the low rank $r$, as well as a comparison against deterministic algorithms to strengthen the evaluation. 

We also recommend reducing the notational density of the paper by moving some technical content to the supplement, allowing for a more digestible main text. For instance, they could retain only the final forms of smoothing equations and provide higher-level sketches or visual aids to complement the mathematical content. 

Lastly, clarifying the implementation details of the DLRA/BUG integrator/solver in the main text would enhance understanding, and addressing the approximation error introduced by the low-rank assumption, possibly by constructing bounds or providing qualitative discussions, would significantly strengthen the paper's contributions.
