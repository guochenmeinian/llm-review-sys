### Key Points
This paper investigates the effects of intergroup interactions on polarization among Indian Twitter users during the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically comparing Muslim and non-Muslim groups. The authors propose a novel measure of group conformity, finding that out-group replies can reduce polarization, although the effect is less pronounced for users with high conformity. The study highlights the varying impacts of intergroup interactions depending on the context of the events discussed.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study is timely and relevant, analyzing a substantial dataset of nearly 700,000 users, providing valuable insights into religious polarization.
- The innovative use of contextualized embeddings enhances the understanding of polarization dynamics on social media.
- The research question is compelling, and the methods employed are effective, translating theoretical concepts into practical hypotheses.

Weaknesses:
- Reliance on Twitter data and methods for inferring religious identity may introduce biases, lacking sufficient evidence for the correctness of these inferences.
- The paper's generalizability is questionable, as it focuses solely on Indian Twitter users during a specific event.
- The use of causal language in describing correlational analyses is misleading, and the claimed contribution of the Group Conformity Score is minimal.
- Several methodological aspects lack clarity, including the selection of events and the rationale behind the metrics used.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification and validation of the new definition of polarization, providing a clearer rationale for its selection. Additionally, the authors should clarify the methods used for inferring religious identity and discuss potential biases introduced by filtering users based on name dictionaries. We suggest enhancing the discussion of results to include speculative thoughts on the causal mechanisms behind the observed effects and providing more details on the selection process for events of interest. Lastly, the authors should ensure that the presentation of methodologies is clearer, particularly regarding the averaging of embeddings and the interpretation of the Group Conformity Score.
