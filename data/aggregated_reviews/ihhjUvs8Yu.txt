### Key Points
This paper presents a study of the tension between persuasion and privacy preservation, specifically within the frameworks of Bayesian persuasion and differential privacy. The authors analyze scenarios involving one receiver and one client, extending their findings to multiple receivers and partial privacy guarantees. They contribute by identifying a constant utility gap in a family of utility functions, geometrically characterizing optimal signaling schemes under various privacy constraints, and developing polynomial-time algorithms for these computations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The claims are well-supported by technical contributions and analyses.
- The paper provides a clear and accessible presentation of complex theoretical concepts.
- The integration of differential privacy into Bayesian persuasion is original and significant.
- The mathematical results, particularly in Section 4, are rich and general.

Weaknesses:
- The motivating examples could be introduced earlier to enhance intuition.
- Some simplifying assumptions reduce the complexity of the persuasion setting, making it difficult to distinguish from standard differential privacy.
- The paper lacks detailed discussions on the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms for large-scale applications.
- The writing lacks engagement and clarity, making it hard to discern key contributions from auxiliary results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by streamlining the presentation and clearly differentiating significant findings from auxiliary results. Additionally, discussing the practical implications of the characterizations in Section 4 would enhance the paper's relevance. We suggest providing more motivation for the choice of differential privacy models and elaborating on the robustness of results to different prior choices. Lastly, addressing the computational efficiency of the algorithms in practical scenarios would strengthen the paper's contributions.
