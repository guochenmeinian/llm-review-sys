Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an auction mechanism aimed at maximizing discounted overall revenue while adhering to fairness constraints for two distinct groups of bidders. The study begins with a static case (T = 1) to establish optimal mechanism constraints, including overall probability distribution and preferential treatment for the disadvantaged group. It extends to a dynamic setting with T rounds, utilizing price history to optimize revenue while maintaining fairness. The authors characterize the optimal mechanism using recursive functions and propose methods for efficient approximation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The manuscript is exceptionally well-written, with clear justification of assumptions and thorough explanations of results, enhancing interpretability.
- Experiments using randomly generated datasets illustrate the practical application of theoretical results, particularly in dynamic settings.
- The discussion on optimal allocation rules provides insightful extensions to existing literature, addressing new contexts of fairness in auctions.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a comprehensive discussion of related works, which would better situate its contributions within the existing body of knowledge.
- Concluding remarks on future directions and real-world applicability are missing, which could enhance the paper's impact.
- Some parts of the paper are unclear, particularly regarding the definition of the discount factor $\delta$ and the motivation for the fairness notion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related works to better contextualize their contributions. Additionally, including concluding remarks that address potential future directions and the real-world applicability of their theory would significantly enhance the paper's impact. Clarifying the definition of the discount factor $\delta$ and providing motivation for the fairness notion would also improve the paper's clarity. Furthermore, we suggest conducting more extensive experiments to validate the theoretical findings and including formal statements regarding the extension of results to more than two groups.
