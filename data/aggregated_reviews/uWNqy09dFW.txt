Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for 3D scene reconstruction from posed RGB-D images by learning an implicit occupancy function. The authors propose to fuse depth frames into a Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) representation and use it as a scene prior for supervision, addressing the challenge of missing depth values in RGB-D images. The primary contribution is the development of an attention function that estimates weights for combining occupancy values predicted by the neural network and those obtained from the TSDF prior. The method employs a hybrid representation with three discrete feature grids and is applicable in SLAM settings where camera poses are optimized alongside network parameters. The authors clarify that TSDF is not used as a supervisory signal but rather as a scene prior, emphasizing the importance of bandwidth in improving performance. The paper discusses the challenges of TSDF in areas lacking RGB-D scans and the implications for occupancy reconstruction.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and clearly identifies the limitations of using depth images for supervising neural networks in 3D reconstruction.
2. The authors provide a reasonable analysis of their proposed method with qualitative and quantitative evaluations.
3. The idea of using fused TSDF grids as a prior is novel and effectively addresses the issue of occluded regions in depth images.
4. The authors provide a detailed rebuttal addressing most reviewer concerns, demonstrating a commitment to improving the manuscript.
5. The use of attention networks to balance TSDF and occupancy inference is a novel approach that shows potential for enhancing reconstruction quality.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks substantial contributions, relying on well-explored hybrid representations and pre-trained MLP decoders.
2. The attention function appears unnecessary, as it only learns weights based on two occupancy values, which could be achieved with a softmax operation.
3. The method is affected by the same problem it aims to solve, as the TSDF prior may also contain holes.
4. Comparisons with existing methods are not entirely fair, as some experiments involve RGB-only inputs.
5. There remains a significant concern regarding the inability of TSDF to compensate for missing depth values, particularly in areas without RGB-D scans.
6. The requirement for dense depth maps of absolute consistent scale is a limitation that may affect the method's applicability in real-world scenarios.
7. The paper does not adequately discuss limitations or potential negative societal impacts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions by providing a more detailed comparison with existing methods like MonoSDF and NICE-SLAM. Additionally, the authors should justify the design choices for the attention mechanism and consider incorporating features from the grids to enhance the attention function's decision-making process. It would also be beneficial to address the limitations of the proposed method, including the reliance on TSDF prior during testing and the potential for low-quality surface completion. We suggest improving clarity regarding the limitations of TSDF in handling invisible areas due to missing RGB-D scans, as this is a critical weakness. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors explicitly state the strict requirement for dense depth maps of absolute consistent scale in the experimental setup to avoid potential misunderstandings. Finally, we encourage the authors to include more detailed insights into the attention model's behavior, particularly in relation to high-frequency geometries, in the revised manuscript. Additionally, we suggest reducing the number of tables in the main paper to improve readability and moving less critical results to supplementary material.
