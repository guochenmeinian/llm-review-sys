Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel task of generating multiview scene graphs from unposed RGB images, where objects and places are represented as nodes. The authors propose a new benchmark based on ARKitscenes and introduce a graph generation method that utilizes off-the-shelf image encoders and detectors, training only a decoder to produce scene graphs. The paper also provides two metrics demonstrating improved performance over existing baselines and discusses an application to enhance DUST3R's process.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a new scene graph format that effectively combines object association and place recognition.
- Promising results from the proposed method compared to traditional baselines, with a well-defined evaluation metric based on edge adjacency.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for the proposed scene graph format is unclear, particularly regarding its advantages over existing formats.
- The experimental section lacks sufficient comparisons with more recent baselines, and the choice of early baselines raises concerns.
- The paper contains several typographical errors and lacks clarity in some methodological explanations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation section by clearly articulating the advantages of their proposed graph format over existing scene graph formats. Additionally, we suggest incorporating more recent baselines for comparison to strengthen the experimental results. The authors should also clarify the design choices made in their method, particularly regarding the use of detection predictions. Furthermore, we advise a thorough proofreading to correct typographical errors and enhance the overall clarity of the manuscript.
