Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach called Absorb & Escape (A&E) for generating DNA sequences by integrating autoregressive (AR) models and diffusion models (DMs). The authors argue that existing methods fail to adequately capture the heterogeneous nature of genomic sequences, which consist of multiple distinct functional regions. A&E alternates between generating sequences with a DM and refining segments with an AR model. The authors evaluate their method on a dataset of promoter sequences from 15 species, claiming improved performance over existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The A&E algorithm effectively combines the strengths of AR and DM approaches.
- The theoretical analysis includes a convergence proof.
- The method is evaluated across multiple species and employs various metrics for assessment.
- New training data considers multispecies contexts.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation lacks validation on real-world long sequences, relying heavily on simulated data.
- The training methodology for baselines across multiple tissues is unclear.
- The benefits of the proposed DMs over existing pre-trained models like DDSM are not adequately justified.
- The paper does not sufficiently explore the impact of hyperparameters, such as the Absorb Threshold (T_Absorb), on performance.
- There is a lack of clarity regarding the calculation of metrics and the specifics of the dataset used for evaluation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the validation of their approach by testing it on real-world long sequences to enhance credibility. Clarifying the training methodology for baseline models across multiple tissues would strengthen the paper. Additionally, providing a detailed comparison of the proposed DMs against existing models like DDSM would help justify their claims. A sensitivity analysis on hyperparameters, particularly T_Absorb, should be included to demonstrate robustness. Lastly, the authors should ensure that metrics are clearly defined and calculated, and consider incorporating promoter strength into their conditioning to enhance the practical relevance of their work.
