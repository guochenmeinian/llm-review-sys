Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of leveraging visual foundation models for complex 3D scene understanding, unifying image, video, and 3D feature representations. The authors investigate optimal encoding methods across four key tasks: Vision-Language Scene Reasoning, Visual Grounding, Segmentation, and Registration. The findings reveal that DINOv2 performs exceptionally well, video models are effective for object-level tasks, diffusion models excel in geometric tasks, and language-pretrained models exhibit unexpected limitations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The study is thorough and meaningful, providing valuable insights to the 3D vision community.
2. The paper is well-structured and easy to understand, with extensive and representative experiments.

Weaknesses:
1. The work lacks a unified conclusion, resembling an experimental report rather than a cohesive research paper. A summary of core principles or model designs based on observations would enhance applicability.
2. The study does not address advanced object-centric encoders like Segment Anything (SAM) or the latest 3D foundation model, Uni3D.
3. Inference time is a significant issue due to the requirement for multiple-view images, and details on using 3D feature fields for specific tasks are insufficiently discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by summarizing the core underlying principles and proposing model designs based on their findings. Additionally, further exploration of 3D scene understanding in an online setting is suggested to enhance real-world applicability. The authors should also include discussions on advanced encoders and provide more details on the baseline models for 3D grounding, QA, and registration in the appendix to strengthen their analysis.
