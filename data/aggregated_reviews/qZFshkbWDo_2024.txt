### Key Points
This paper investigates post robustness in backdoor purification, revealing that backdoors can be recovered through Retuning Attacks (RA) and proposes the Query-based Reactivation Attack (QRA) for this purpose. The authors introduce a Path-Aware Minimization (PAM) defense to enhance post-purification robustness, supported by evaluations across various deep neural networks on CIFAR-10/100 and Tiny-ImageNet. The findings indicate that PAM significantly improves robustness while maintaining low Attack Success Rates (ASR).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The study addresses the often-overlooked vulnerability of DNNs regarding post purification robustness, contributing novel insights into backdoor defenses.  
2. The authors effectively demonstrate that models can relearn backdoors post-purification, leading to the practical Query-based Reactivation Attack.  
3. The identification of inadequate deviation along backdoor-connected paths as a cause of poor robustness is insightful, and the PAM defense is a promising solution.

Weaknesses:  
1. The evaluated attacks are not state-of-the-art; recent attacks like Sleeper Agent and Adaptive Blended are not included.  
2. The balance between post purification robustness and clean accuracy is unclear, particularly regarding the selection of the hyperparameter $\rho$.  
3. Presentation issues exist, such as the order of figures and visibility of results, alongside typographical errors.  
4. The proposed threat model for the attacks raises practical concerns, as it assumes further fine-tuning of the purified model, which may not reflect real-world scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including results on recent attacks such as Sleeper Agent and Adaptive Blended. Additionally, an algorithm for selecting the hyperparameter $\rho$ should be provided to clarify the trade-off between post purification robustness and clean accuracy. The authors should also enhance the presentation by rearranging figures for better clarity and addressing typographical errors. Furthermore, we suggest clearly defining "Post-purification Robustness" to distinguish it from standard backdoor robustness and addressing the practical implications of the proposed threat model. Lastly, a systematic comparison with existing defense methods would strengthen the paper's contributions.
