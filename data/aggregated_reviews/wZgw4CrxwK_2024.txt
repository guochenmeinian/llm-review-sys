### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical framework for a large language model (LLM) text generation service that incentivizes high-quality output through a pay-for-performance model. The authors define contracts based on the quality of generated text, which is influenced by the cost of running different models. They derive optimal contracts from hypothesis tests that distinguish between models based on evaluator outputs, addressing the challenge of moral hazard in pay-per-token pricing. The framework aims to ensure that LLM services utilize their best-performing models while managing uncertainty about operational costs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The theoretical setup and monotone assumptions regarding model performance and costs are reasonable and address a relevant problem in LLM queries.
- The results are intuitive and connect well with existing literature on contract theory and hypothesis testing.
- The characterization of optimal cost-robust contracts and approximation guarantees is valuable.

Weaknesses:
- The requirement for known cost bounds in the theoretical setup is impractical, and the authors should comment on how metrics degrade with looser bounds.
- The model's complexity may be unnecessary, as the problem could be studied in a more basic contract setting without LLM-specific modeling.
- The authors do not address the computational complexity of finding optimal contracts or scenarios where the highest-cost action may not be the best to incentivize.
- The assumption of a trustworthy third party for contract enforcement may not be feasible, and the paper lacks evidence that LLM companies are compromising service quality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the implications of varying cost bounds on contract performance metrics. Additionally, consider simplifying the model to focus on basic contract design principles without the complexities of LLMs. It would be beneficial to address the computational complexity of finding optimal contracts and clarify the practical applicability of the proposed framework, particularly regarding the role of a third-party quality detector. Finally, we suggest providing evidence or rationale for the necessity of addressing moral hazard in LLM services, as the current assumptions may not reflect real-world dynamics.
