Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents GSDF, a novel dual-branch architecture that integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and neural Signed Distance Functions (SDF) for improved novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction. The authors propose a method that enhances rendering quality and geometric accuracy through mutual guidance and joint supervision between the two branches. The 3DGS branch outputs RGB images using splatting-based rendering, while the SDF branch employs volumetric rendering with accelerated optimization via hash grids. The approach emphasizes efficient sampling, guided densification and pruning, and geometric alignment to achieve superior performance over existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is clearly written, making it easy to follow the proposed methodology.
2. The approach demonstrates excellent performance on quantitative benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
3. Impressive qualitative results highlight improvements in geometric accuracy and surface details.
4. The framework's versatility allows for future adaptations, suggesting a plug-in strategy for optimizing various Gaussian-based and Neural SDF approaches.

Weaknesses:
1. The claimed speedup in SDF optimization due to the dual-branch system is unclear, particularly when compared to the faster Instant-NSR implementation of NeuS.
2. There is no discussion on the mesh extraction method used for surface reconstruction, raising questions about the potential for leveraging both representations.
3. The memory footprint of the dual-branch approach is not adequately addressed, leaving concerns about its feasibility on standard hardware.
4. The novelty of the approach is questioned due to its reliance on existing works, with a need for clearer differentiation from similar methods like NeuSG.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the speedup in SDF optimization, explicitly detailing how the dual-branch system contributes to this claim. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion on the surface extraction method, exploring the potential for using both representations for mesh extraction. It would be beneficial to provide details on the memory requirements for the dual-branch approach to assess its practicality. Lastly, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the novelty of their work in relation to existing methods, particularly NeuSG, to better highlight their contributions.
