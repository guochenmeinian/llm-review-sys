### Key Points
This paper presents a framework utilizing the action chunk bisimulation metric as a self-supervised learning objective to construct an action chunk representation space for multi-step decision-making. The authors propose an effective method, ACR, which uncovers the underlying structure of the action chunk space to enhance reinforcement learning (RL) efficiency. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the method's superior performance across various tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The action chunk representation is novel and promising for future imitation learning research.
- The method appears sound, and the writing quality is good.
- Extensive baselines are compared in experiments, providing valuable insights.

Weaknesses:
- The paper's focus on action chunking seems misaligned with the workshop's theme of 'Safe Generative AI', raising questions about its relevance.
- ACR's encoding of action chunks using a Transformer lacks a detailed explanation of how it enhances action chunking effectiveness in RL, particularly regarding decision-making and learning efficiency.
- Main results do not clearly demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other self-supervised action representation learning methods, as overlapping error bars obscure statistical significance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the connection of their work to the workshop's theme by addressing safety in generative models or AI systems. Additionally, a more detailed explanation of how ACR enhances action chunking effectiveness, including theoretical support for its claims, would strengthen the paper. We also suggest adjusting Figure 2 to accurately depict the reward model's $R_{s_t}^{c_i}$ within $D_r$, and providing further clarification on the pseudometric $d_c$ introduced in Equation (1). Finally, including experiments that compare ACR-DRL algorithms with strong baselines, such as CQL and IQL, and conducting paired t-tests to demonstrate statistical significance would enhance the credibility of the results.
