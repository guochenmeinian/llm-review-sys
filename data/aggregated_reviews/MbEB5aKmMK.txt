Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates online composite optimization under the Stochastically Extended Adversarial (SEA) model, establishing regret bounds for three types of time-varying loss functions: smooth and general convex, smooth and strongly convex, and smooth and exp-concave. The authors propose a multi-level universal algorithm that achieves optimal bounds without prior knowledge of the loss functions, extending previous results and addressing the inadequacies of existing work in intermediate settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The presentation is excellent, with clear organization and comprehensible proofs.
- The problem of online composite optimization between stochastic and adversarial environments is significant, bridging previously separate fields and extending existing cases.
- The theoretical results are comprehensive, generalizing previous findings and providing intermediate examples that highlight their implications.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks empirical validation, which could strengthen the theoretical results.
- The novelty of the techniques appears limited, primarily extending existing methods without significant innovation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by conducting experimental studies to validate their theoretical results. Additionally, we suggest relocating the Implications Section to follow the Universal Strategy Section to enhance logical flow. Furthermore, the authors should clarify their technical contributions and consider exploring dynamic regret bounds in the investigated setting for a broader impact.
