Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on learning stochastic contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) using an offline density estimation oracle, achieving a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{H^7 S^4 A^3 T \log (|\mathcal{M}|/\delta)})$. The authors propose an algorithm that extends the Inverse-Gap-Weighting (IGW) technique to CMDPs, employing trusted occupancy measures for model approximation. Additionally, the paper introduces a novel approach to improving the efficiency of oracle calls in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), reducing the number of calls from \(O(T)\) to \(O(\log T)\). The authors assert that any online estimation oracle can be efficiently converted to an offline one, enhancing the practical applicability of their results. They provide examples of online estimation oracles, specifically the multinomial logit model and linear combinations of MDPs, and discuss the implications of Lemma 3.4, which asserts a multiplicative lower bound over occupancy measures under certain conditions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses an important open question in reinforcement learning theory regarding regret bounds for stochastic CMDPs using offline oracles.
2. The proposed algorithm effectively extends the IGW technique, demonstrating strong performance in both regret minimization and reward-free exploration.
3. The paper introduces a significant improvement in the efficiency of oracle calls, which is a valuable contribution to the field.
4. The authors provide a clear connection between online and offline oracles, enhancing the understanding of their approach.
5. The discussion of specific examples, such as the multinomial logit model, adds practical relevance to the theoretical findings.

Weaknesses:
1. The writing lacks clarity, particularly in the algorithm's presentation and the explanation of trusted occupancy measures.
2. The proof of Lemma 3.4 is complex and difficult to follow, which may hinder comprehension of the results.
3. The focus on logarithmic oracle complexity overlooks the established efficiency of \(O(T)\) oracle calls in CMDPs, which could be more relevant.
4. The authors' reliance on assumptions regarding the contexts in which the multiplicative bounds hold raises questions about the generalizability of their findings.
5. The oracle's convergence guarantee concerning the squared Hellinger distance raises practical concerns, as its implementation is not well-discussed, and examples for simpler function classes are missing.
6. The computational complexity of policy cover calculations is not adequately addressed, leaving a significant cost unaccounted for.
7. Recent relevant works on CMDPs are not sufficiently referenced, and comparisons with these works could enhance the literature review.
8. Some reviewers express concerns about the limited applicability of the proposed methods and the clarity of the technical content.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the algorithm's presentation by defining key terms before their introduction in the algorithm. Additionally, we suggest that the authors improve the clarity of the proofs, particularly for key lemmas like Lemma 3.4, to facilitate better understanding. It would be beneficial to include a detailed discussion on the computational complexity of the policy cover calculations and to explicitly reference and compare their work with recent literature on CMDPs. We also encourage the authors to provide a concrete example of a function class of MDPs that allows for efficient oracle implementation, as this would address reviewer concerns about the practical applicability of their approach. Lastly, we recommend that the authors elaborate on the conditions under which the multiplicative bounds in Lemma 3.4 hold, particularly regarding the distribution of contexts and the implications for regret bounds.
