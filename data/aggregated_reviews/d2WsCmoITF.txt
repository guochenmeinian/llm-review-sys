Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel combination of unbalanced Optimal Transport (OT) and low-rank OT, addressing the computational challenges associated with the cubic complexity of traditional OT methods. The authors propose low-rank approximations to enhance efficiency and extend their approach to Gromov-Wasserstein and Fused-Gromov-Wasserstein problems. They validate their methods through experiments on spatial transcriptomic matching problems, demonstrating the practical applicability of their algorithms. The authors argue that their work provides valuable tools for the machine learning community, despite concerns about its incremental nature compared to prior works on low-rank and unbalanced OT.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work is original in combining unbalanced OT with low-rank OT, providing a scalable solution to OT problems.
- The authors tackle complex technical difficulties, making their contributions noteworthy for future research.
- The authors present theoretical proofs for their algorithms, and empirical results support their effectiveness in practical applications, particularly on large spatial transcriptomics datasets.
- The thoroughness of the UOT variants computed provides a range of tools for the community.

Weaknesses:
- The discussion on low-rank approximations is insufficient, particularly regarding the rationale for using low-rank plans and their applicability to specific data types.
- The contribution is perceived as incremental, lacking sufficient theoretical analysis and understanding.
- The experimental section lacks diversity and detail, with limited comparisons to other methods and insufficient performance metrics for the proposed algorithms.
- Some reviewers feel the experimental section is rushed, particularly in Section 4.3, and lacks detail.
- The presentation suffers from unclear definitions of key terms and notations, leading to potential confusion for readers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on low-rank approximations by addressing the rationale behind their use and clarifying which types of data are suitable for such assumptions. Additionally, we suggest including more comprehensive experimental illustrations, such as plots comparing the time performance of standard OT versus low-rank OT as a function of sample size, and the impact of parameters $(\tau_1, \tau_2)$ on performance in biological tasks. We also recommend enhancing the theoretical analysis of ULOT to bolster its perceived contribution. Expanding Section 4.3 with more details would address concerns about the experimental section being too brief. Finally, we advise restructuring the paper to enhance clarity, particularly by defining all notations and ensuring that critical methodological details are included in the main text rather than relegated to the appendix. Clarifying the convexity of unbalanced OT solvers in their responses would also prevent misunderstandings regarding the non-convexity of their formulation.
