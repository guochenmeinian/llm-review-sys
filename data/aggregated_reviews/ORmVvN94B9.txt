Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis of the Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) for the multi-objective minimum weight base problem, including a detailed explanation of the algorithm's fitness functions and decomposition scheme. The authors propose several algorithms for finding extreme points and a complete trade-off set, supported by a rigorous theoretical analysis that provides expected time bounds for minimizing scalarized weights and enumerating the convex hull of the feasible region. Empirical studies demonstrate that MOEA/D significantly outperforms GSEMO in computing extreme points under appropriate decomposition.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a thorough theoretical analysis of the MOEA/D algorithm, contributing to the understanding of its performance and efficiency.
- The authors apply their theoretical findings to a real-world problem, demonstrating practical relevance.
- A comparative analysis of MOEA/D and GSEMO provides valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of these algorithms.
- The paper develops insight into the local structure of matroid optimization problems, which is beneficial for analyzing the runtime of other evolutionary algorithms.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks generality, as it primarily focuses on the multi-objective minimum weight base problem without broader applicability.
- Several assumptions made in the paper, such as distinct supported solutions having distinct images under the weight function, may not hold in all scenarios.
- The definition of the multi-objective minimum weight base problem is unclear, particularly regarding the range of decision variables and objectives.
- The presentation suffers from readability issues, with insufficient intuitive descriptions of the problem and algorithm.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definition of the multi-objective minimum weight base problem, including the range of decision variables and objectives. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed discussion on how to choose parameters for the MOEA/D algorithm. The authors should also address the assumptions made in the paper, particularly regarding the distinct supported solutions, and elaborate on the rationale behind these assumptions. Furthermore, enhancing the presentation with clearer intuitive descriptions and including figures would significantly improve readability. Finally, we encourage the authors to analyze standard multi-objective benchmark functions to allow for comparisons with other MOEAs.
