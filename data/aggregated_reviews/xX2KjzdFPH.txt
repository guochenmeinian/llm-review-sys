### Key Points
This paper presents a structured concept predictor (SCP) designed to predict concepts and their structures, integrating these into the decoder for image caption generation. The authors utilize weighted graph convolutional networks (W-GCN) to model relationships among concepts, enhancing the understanding of cross-modal semantics. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on the MS COCO dataset, supported by extensive experiments demonstrating its effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of structured concept prediction is innovative and significantly enhances cross-modal understanding.
- The W-GCN effectively captures concept relations and dependencies.
- The paper is well-written and provides a solid literature review, showcasing clear improvements over existing methods.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks sufficient engagement with related works, missing comparisons with previous methods addressing similar problems.
- There is a need for a comprehensive evaluation, including inference speed and additional experiments such as error analysis and MSCOCO online evaluation.
- Some sections require clarification, particularly regarding the implementation of query embeddings and the rationale behind certain examples.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related works, particularly by comparing their method with previous studies like DIFNet and others mentioned. Additionally, including an analysis of inference speed relative to other baselines would strengthen the research. The authors should also provide more detailed explanations of the query embedding mechanism and consider expanding their experiments to include a broader range of applications beyond captioning. Finally, addressing the identified writing issues, such as adding transitional phrases for clarity, would enhance the overall readability of the paper.
