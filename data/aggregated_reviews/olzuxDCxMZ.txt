### Key Points
This paper examines the effect of cross-lingual transfer on various debiasing techniques, concluding that debiasing is feasible through this approach. The research identifies SentenceDebias as the most effective technique in this context and reports improved results for lower-resourced languages. The study applies popular debiasing methods on mBERT, evaluating their performance across English, French, German, and Dutch languages under a zero-shot setting.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a significant research problem in NLP by extending debiasing efforts to multilingual models, which have predominantly focused on English.  
- It covers a diverse range of debiasing techniques and provides straightforward, substantial result reporting based on experiments.

Weaknesses:  
- The evaluation is limited to four languages in Latin script, raising questions about the applicability of findings to non-Latin script languages and true low-resource languages.  
- Key methodological details are missing, particularly regarding how translations were obtained and the specifics of the debiasing process, which hampers reproducibility and clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the methodological clarity by including a dedicated section that details how translations were obtained—whether they were automatic or manual—and the quality of these translations. Additionally, we suggest conducting further experiments with a more diverse set of languages, particularly non-Latin scripts and true low-resource languages, to strengthen the conclusions about cross-lingual transfer and debiasing. An analysis of the results, including a manual error analysis, would also enhance understanding of the changes occurring during cross-lingual debiasing.
