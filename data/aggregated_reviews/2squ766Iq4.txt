Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical framework for addressing out-of-support extrapolation using a latent-variable model. The authors propose identification results for scenarios involving distribution shifts, both global and local, and connect these results to test-time adaptation (TTA) algorithms. The study validates its theoretical findings through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, including popular TTA benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The identification results for out-of-support extrapolation are novel and contribute significantly to the field.
2. The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of assumptions and detailed descriptions of experimental setups and results.
3. The work addresses a highly relevant problem in machine learning.

Weaknesses:
1. The technical soundness is questionable, particularly regarding the connection between identification results and TTA objectives, as TTA methods do not estimate data distributions.
2. The definition of identification lacks a meaningful relationship between estimated and true latents, undermining the practical value of the results.
3. The paper omits a related work section, making it difficult to contextualize the contributions within the field.
4. There are minor typographical errors and unclear elements, such as the representation of results in Table 1 and the missing source code.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the connection between the identification results and TTA methods, addressing the density estimation constraint comprehensively. Additionally, the authors should clarify the definition of identification to establish a meaningful relationship between estimated and true latents. We suggest including a related work section to better contextualize the contributions and addressing the minor typographical errors throughout the paper. Finally, providing source code would enhance the reproducibility of the findings.
