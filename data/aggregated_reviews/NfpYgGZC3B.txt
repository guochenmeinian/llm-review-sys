Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents B4B, a framework designed to actively defend against model stealing attacks, particularly focusing on SSL encoders. The authors propose three modules: 1) coverage estimation to differentiate between legitimate users and adversaries; 2) a cost function that penalizes coverage to deter stealing; and 3) a per-user transformation function to mitigate sybil attacks. The results indicate that B4B effectively prevents stealing while maintaining the utility of representations for legitimate users.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The topic is timely and relevant, addressing active defenses against model stealing.
- The paper includes extensive ablation studies, providing valuable insights into hyperparameter impacts.

Weaknesses:
- There is a notable absence of comparisons with existing defense mechanisms, undermining claims of B4B's uniqueness.
- The assumption that B4B operates independently of encoder architecture and adversary strategies is impractical.
- The design intuition lacks persuasiveness, particularly regarding the effectiveness of B4B against small surrogate datasets.
- The experimental evaluation is limited, focusing on only one type of stealing attack and lacking analysis of the proposed transformations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve their comparison with previous work to substantiate claims regarding B4B's advantages. Specifically, they should reassess their assertions about being the first active defense and include comparisons with methods such as those in [13], [26], and [32]. Additionally, the authors should discuss the limitations of their assumption regarding user query distributions and analyze the impact of queried distributions on utility. It would also be beneficial to expand the experimental evaluation to include various stealing attacks and provide detailed analyses of the transformations applied in their experiments. Finally, clarifying the process for per-user representation transformation and the tuning of hyperparameters for different tasks would enhance the paper's clarity and reproducibility.
