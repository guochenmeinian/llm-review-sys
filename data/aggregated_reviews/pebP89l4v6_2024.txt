Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SemanIR, a novel Transformer architecture for image restoration that introduces a key-semantic dictionary to store the top-k semantically related patches for each patch. This approach allows for efficient attention computation by focusing only on relevant patches, significantly reducing computational costs. The dictionary is constructed once per transformer stage and shared across layers, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various image restoration tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The method efficiently utilizes top-k semantically close patches, adapting computational costs with minimal performance loss.
2. The approach is generally applicable beyond image restoration, indicating broader utility.
3. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of SemanIR is limited, as it closely resembles existing methods like KiT, differing mainly in the reuse of semantic relations across layers.
2. The clarity of Figure 2 needs enhancement, particularly regarding the dimensions of $\hat{K}$ and $\hat{V}$.
3. The rationale behind the random top-k strategy is unclear, especially compared to a fixed top-k approach.
4. The paper lacks comparisons with certain related works in the image restoration domain.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Figure 2 by explicitly detailing the dimensions of $\hat{K}$ and $\hat{V}$. Additionally, the authors should clarify the advantages of the random top-k strategy over a fixed top-k approach, particularly in terms of performance. We suggest including comparisons with related works, such as NAFNet, to strengthen the paper's contributions. Furthermore, addressing the potential benefits of constructing the key-semantic dictionary after each layer could enhance the discussion on efficiency. Lastly, we encourage the authors to consider open-sourcing their implementation for broader accessibility.
