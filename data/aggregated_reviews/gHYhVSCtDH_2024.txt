Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Voxel Mamba, a novel architecture for 3D object detection utilizing point clouds. It introduces a group-free approach that employs State Space Models (SSMs) to overcome limitations of traditional voxel-based methods, such as small receptive fields and inefficient grouping. Voxel Mamba utilizes asymmetrical SSMs for multi-scale context handling and space-filling curves for efficient data serialization, demonstrating superior performance on the Waymo and nuScenes datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The integration of group-free SSMs and space-filling curves significantly enhances traditional voxel-based methods, improving long-range dependency handling and multi-scale context processing.
2. Comprehensive empirical evaluations indicate notable improvements in accuracy and efficiency on major benchmarks.
3. The introduction of the Hilbert curve for input serialization and the detailed explanation of asymmetrical state space models reflect a strong grasp of 3D object detection challenges.

Weaknesses:
1. The manuscript contains typographical errors and may overwhelm readers unfamiliar with advanced concepts like Hilbert curves and asymmetrical state space models.
2. Voxel Mamba's computational demands may restrict its deployment in resource-constrained environments.
3. The complexity of the model does not yield proportionate performance improvements, raising questions about the trade-off between complexity and efficiency.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind using SSMs and their advantages over traditional methods. Additionally, providing specific computational metrics such as runtime and memory usage for various model sizes would enhance the assessment of efficiency. The authors should also include visual experimental results and a detailed comparison with state-of-the-art methods to demonstrate Voxel Mamba's versatility. Further investigation into the model's robustness to variations in point cloud density and environmental conditions is essential. Lastly, clarifying the role of downsampling sequences in the backward SSM sequence and discussing the implications of the chosen space-filling curve on accuracy would strengthen the paper.
