Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach called TAS-GNN (Topology-Aware Spiking Graph Neural Networks) to address the performance gap between spiking neural networks (SNNs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) in graph classification tasks. The authors identify a "starvation" problem in spiking neurons within GNNs, where many neurons do not emit spikes during inference, leading to significant information loss. The paper proposes a strategy to mitigate spike frequency deviations based on the correlation between graph topology and spike frequency patterns, utilizing adaptive thresholds among neurons grouped by degree.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors clearly articulate the performance gap between GNNs and SNNs in graph classification tasks.
2. The identification of the "neuron starvation" problem is a critical contribution, along with the introduction of topology-aware group-adaptive neurons (TAG).
3. The experiments conducted on multiple datasets demonstrate the competitive potential of the TAS-GNN method.

Weaknesses:
1. The term "topology" is misleading, as the method primarily relies on node degree, which raises questions about the appropriateness of the title.
2. The analysis of performance variations across datasets lacks depth, particularly regarding the results in PROTEINS and the identical outcomes for GAT and GAT+TAG in IMDB-Binary.
3. The paper contains several typos and grammatical errors that detract from its presentation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the term "topology" by explicitly stating that it refers to node degree. Additionally, the authors should provide a more thorough analysis of the performance discrepancies observed in different datasets, including potential reasons related to dataset characteristics. It would also be beneficial to address the identical results for GAT and GAT+TAG in IMDB-Binary. Lastly, we suggest the authors carefully proofread the manuscript to correct typos and grammatical issues that affect readability.
