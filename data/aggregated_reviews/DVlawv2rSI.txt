Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to improve data efficiency in imitation learning by utilizing a pre-trained visual language model (VLM) to encode expert demonstrations or task descriptions. The authors propose using the dot product between the learned and demonstrated embeddings as a reward function, aiming to train a robot to perform manipulation tasks after only one demonstration. Experiments are conducted in Metaworld and the Franka simulation, focusing on tasks such as "closing a door" and "pressing a button." The method also allows for out-of-domain demonstrations, eliminating the need for domain-specific data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The concept of employing a pretrained VLM to generate rewards from expert demonstrations is straightforward and innovative.
- The authors conduct extensive robot experiments in simulation, demonstrating the feasibility of learning policies from videos.
- The paper is well-written and presents a clear methodology, with thorough evaluations across multiple perspectives.

Weaknesses:
- The rationale for using the dot product as the reward function is insufficiently explained, and the effectiveness of this approach needs further elaboration.
- The domain alignment between text descriptions and video data is poor, leading to potential misalignment in task execution.
- Experimental performance is weak, with several instances of failure and underwhelming out-of-distribution results.
- The selected baseline methods are outdated, and the proposed method performs worse with an increased number of expert demonstrations.
- Qualitative results are difficult to interpret, raising concerns about the clarity of the robot's actions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the rationale behind using the dot product as the reward function to clarify its effectiveness. Additionally, addressing the domain alignment issues highlighted in the confusion matrix would enhance the reliability of the method. We suggest conducting more comprehensive experiments on a wider range of tasks to strengthen the validity of the results. Furthermore, including real robot results would significantly bolster the applicability of the proposed method to real-world scenarios. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide clearer visualizations and explanations of the qualitative results to aid in understanding the robot's behavior.
