Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an augmented Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) model that addresses polarization and disagreement in online social networks by incorporating timeline recommendation algorithms. The authors propose an optimization problem to minimize the disagreement-polarization index, supported by a convex optimization framework that is efficiently solvable. They introduce a gradient descent-based algorithm, GDPM, which is empirically validated on 27 real-world datasets, demonstrating significant speed and performance improvements over naive black-box optimization and heuristic baselines. The paper also contributes by providing open access to the dataset and code, enhancing future research opportunities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The problem addressed is significant, and the new FJ model effectively integrates opinion dynamics with timeline recommendation algorithms.
2. The proposed algorithms are theoretically sound and outperform naive optimization methods in both speed and solution quality.
3. The paper is well-organized and clear, with strong theoretical contributions and empirical evaluations.
4. The authors provide open access to their dataset, expanding the research community's resources.

Weaknesses:
1. The results section is awkwardly structured, which could hinder clarity.
2. Some motivations for the model lack sufficient grounding in existing literature, particularly regarding personalization.
3. The choice of baselines for comparison appears weak and requires better justification.
4. The writing quality needs improvement, particularly in the abstract and overall organization.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the structure of the results section for better clarity, possibly by prioritizing the most critical findings. Additionally, we suggest redefining the learning rate in Section 6 to align with conventional terminology. The authors should also consider including a more comprehensive evaluation by exploring additional baseline methods and discussing potential extensions of their approach to other algorithms. Clarifying the conditions for comparison with black-box solvers and providing more detailed motivations for their model would enhance the paper's rigor. Lastly, addressing the writing quality, especially in the abstract and organization of sections, will improve the overall readability.
