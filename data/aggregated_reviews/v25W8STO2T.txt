### Key Points
This paper presents an attention-based predictive agent model that samples its visual environment through a sequence of glimpses, optimizing a perception-action loop guided by perceptual prediction error. The authors evaluate three variants of the model for handwriting generation and recognition, demonstrating its efficiency compared to human participants and a highly cited attention-based reinforcement model. The study is notable for its end-to-end interaction with images for recognition via generation, achieving high accuracy and efficiency. The paper effectively addresses the simultaneous generation and classification of handwritten numerals and alphabets, marking a significant advancement in the field.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces a novel attention-based agent model that efficiently performs both generation and classification tasks.  
- It provides comprehensive benchmarking against existing models, demonstrating superior data efficiency and alignment with human fixation patterns.  
- The writing is clear, with well-cited background and related work, making the proposed model easy to understand.

Weaknesses:  
- There are questions regarding the training differences between models M1, M2, and M3, particularly concerning their classification accuracies.  
- The human population comparison data may not fully reflect real-world conditions, as it relies on static images viewed under free-viewing conditions.  
- Clarification is needed on how the order of fixations affects the proposed metrics and model behavior.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the training methodologies of models M1, M2, and M3 to address the discrepancies in classification accuracy. Additionally, we suggest providing more context on the parameter sharing between classification and generation modalities in model M3. It would also be beneficial to include model M4 in the case study in section two for consistency. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the implications of fixation order on the proposed metrics and model behavior to enhance understanding of the model's operational dynamics.
