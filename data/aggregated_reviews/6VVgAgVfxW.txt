### Key Points
This paper presents Team-Fictitious Play (Team-FP), a novel variant of fictitious play designed for teams of self-interested agents to achieve Team-Nash Equilibrium (TNE) in multi-team games, particularly focusing on zero-sum potential team games (ZSPTGs). The authors provide a rigorous convergence analysis and extend Team-FP dynamics to multi-team Markov games, supported by extensive simulations that compare Team-FP with other algorithms to demonstrate its effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The introduction of Team-FP fills a gap in the multi-team game theory literature, particularly for zero-sum potential team games.  
2. The paper offers rigorous theoretical analysis and practical insights, including convergence proofs and error bounds.  
3. Extensive simulations effectively demonstrate Team-FP's performance and the impact of various parameters on convergence speed.  
4. The grammar and expression are accurate and professional.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The modifications to classical fictitious play are not significantly groundbreaking, representing incremental improvements rather than major innovations.  
2. The notations are confusing, making it hard to follow, as both 'agent index' and 'team index' use lowercase letters.  
3. Limited discussion on computational complexity; more insights into scalability and potential bottlenecks would enhance understanding of practical feasibility.  
4. The theoretical analysis is quite technical; more intuitive explanations and illustrations, such as diagrams, would be beneficial.  
5. The discussion on practical applications is insufficient; more experiments and analysis in specific scenarios would strengthen the paper.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve their academic writing skills, particularly in enhancing the logical flow between paragraphs and sentences. Additionally, we suggest reorganizing the paper to better highlight the challenges and gaps in current research that Team-FP addresses. Including more background on Nash equilibrium and related algorithms, as well as a more detailed analysis of parameters and their sensitivity, would be valuable. We also encourage the authors to provide experimental evidence supporting their convergence proof and to simplify their notations for clarity. Finally, expanding the discussion on practical applications and including comparisons with other multi-team learning algorithms would enhance the paper's contribution.
