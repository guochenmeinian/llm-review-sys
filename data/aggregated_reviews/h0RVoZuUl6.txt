Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents resilient constrained learning, addressing the challenge of balancing performance and constraints in machine learning tasks. The authors propose a method that adapts constraints based on their impact on the learning task, providing theoretical guarantees for the balance between relaxation gains and costs. The algorithm is validated through experiments in invariant learning and federated learning, demonstrating its potential in real-world applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-motivated, effectively addressing the constraint-performance trade-off with a theoretically sound algorithm derived from detailed assumptions.
2. The writing is clear and accessible, making the concepts easy to follow.
3. The algorithm is simple yet effective, allowing flexible adjustments through a relaxation cost parameter $\alpha$.

Weaknesses:
1. The experimentation is simplistic, particularly the federated learning problem, which appears more like a toy example.
2. There is a lack of in-depth analysis regarding various aspects of the algorithm's performance.
3. The paper does not comprehensively compare existing constrained learning approaches, limiting its contribution.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including more diverse baselines and quantitative metrics, particularly in the federated learning context. Additionally, we suggest conducting a more thorough comparison with existing constrained learning algorithms to clarify the advantages and limitations of the proposed method. Furthermore, a detailed discussion of the limitations and assumptions of the proposed method should be included to enhance the paper's rigor. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify basic concepts, such as the definition of nominal specification, and ensure that all claimed experiments are present in the main text.
