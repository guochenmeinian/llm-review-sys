Aggregated Review:
**Key Points**  
We were impressed with the analysis of image characteristics in the scribble-based interactive segmentation technique. The paper compares traditional segmentation methods, such as thresholding, Meijering filters, and Geodesic Distance Transforms, with the MedSAM model for medical images, focusing on modalities like fundus, OCT, PET, and microscopy. It highlights the advantages of simpler models in segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the use of different preprocessing methods for each modality raises concerns about the generalizability of the foundation model.

**Strengths and Weaknesses**  
Strengths include a thorough examination of traditional methods and their performance relative to more complex models, providing clarity on their applicability across different imaging modalities. However, weaknesses arise from the reference errors in section 4.8 and the lack of sources for the datasets used, which could hinder clarity and reproducibility. Additionally, the varied preprocessing methods may limit the model's broad applicability.

**Suggestions for Improvement**  
We suggest correcting the reference errors in section 4.8 and providing the sources of the datasets used in the challenge to enhance clarity and reproducibility. Furthermore, we recommend standardizing preprocessing methods across modalities to better align with the goal of developing a generalizable foundation model.
