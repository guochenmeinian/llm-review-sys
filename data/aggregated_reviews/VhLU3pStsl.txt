Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel mechanism for learning a Riemannian metric from distance observations, which is significant for applications involving relative observations, such as perception studies. The authors propose a method based on local regression, deducing a Riemannian metric from a Taylor expansion of the geodesic distance. The approach is tested on various datasets, including trip time data in New York and MNIST images, although the experimental results are limited.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an important and understudied question in the machine-learning community.
- The proposed Riemannian metric estimator is new, simple, and practically useful.
- The estimator provides a direct estimate of the Christoffel symbols, which are typically tedious to compute.
- The examples throughout the paper are instructive and assist the reader.

Weaknesses:
- The approach appears challenging to scale to higher-dimensional data, although this may not be a significant issue given the low-dimensional nature of current applications.
- The computational procedure relies on a discretization of the input space, limiting its effectiveness in higher dimensions.
- The kernel smoothing used to produce the Riemannian metric is somewhat ad hoc and could be better integrated with local regression.
- The problem setting is restrictive, as it is rare to have both low-dimensional coordinate representations and meaningful intrinsic distances.
- The paper lacks comparisons with other Riemannian metric estimation methods and does not adequately address the limitations of the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the scalability of their approach to higher-dimensional data and clarify the assumptions regarding the known chart in their methodology. Additionally, we suggest providing a more extensive discussion of the limitations in the main text rather than relegating it to the supplements. The authors should also consider including comparisons with existing methods for estimating Riemannian metrics to contextualize their contributions better. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore practical applications of their method beyond obtaining geodesics, as this would enhance its relevance to the community.
