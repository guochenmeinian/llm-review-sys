### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to predicting hashtags for tweets by focusing on temporal adaptation, addressing the challenge posed by the dynamic nature of user-generated social media data. The authors propose a non-parametric dense retrieval technique that allows for effective hashtag prediction without the need for costly re-training, demonstrating improvements over baseline models through experiments on a year-long Twitter dataset. The method leverages a constructed datastore to retrieve similar tweets, providing contextual information essential for real-time predictions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a non-parametric dense retrieval technique offers a simple and effective solution for adapting NLP models to temporal changes.
- The experiments show improvements over baseline methods, highlighting the relevance of the approach in the context of evolving social media data.
- The paper addresses a critical issue regarding the high costs associated with maintaining training data for model retraining.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset description lacks detail, such as data volume and the basis for time division.
- The experimental results raise concerns about the method's reliability, particularly regarding the lower recall @1 for adapted models compared to non-adapted counterparts.
- The decision to partition data into weekly segments may not realistically simulate temporal separation, and the paper lacks statistical significance tests for the reported results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset description by providing detailed information on data volume and the rationale behind the time division. Additionally, consider adopting a more reasonable time interval for training and testing to enhance the validity of the experiments. It would be beneficial to include a significant test to ascertain the statistical significance of the results. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors clarify their choice of the KNN model, provide explanations for parameter settings such as top-k and top-R, and address how the model will handle tweets that significantly differ from historical data.
