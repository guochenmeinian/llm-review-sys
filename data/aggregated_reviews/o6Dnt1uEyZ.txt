Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for optimizing large floorplans in warehouses and manufacturing facilities using neural cellular automata (NCA) combined with quality diversity (QD) algorithms. The authors aim to maximize the number of robots operating within the system while avoiding congestion. The proposed method addresses the limitations of previous QD algorithms that only optimized small-scale environments, demonstrating improved throughput and scalability across three domains: multi-agent warehouses, multi-agent manufacturing, and single-agent maze environments. The NCA framework generates optimized patterns from initial configurations, maintaining consistent patterns regardless of size, and showing scalability to larger environments. The evaluation includes a reinforcement learning agent that scales with the NCA, providing a novel approach to environment generation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The originality of combining NCA generators with QD algorithms to tackle scalability challenges in multi-robot systems.
- The use of an interesting unsupervised objective for training NCA environments with various optimization techniques.
- Comprehensive methodology and systematic evaluation across multiple domains, with statistically analyzed results demonstrating the proposed approach's quality.
- The ability of the NCA to generalize from small to larger environments effectively.
- Clarity in presentation, with well-explained mathematical formulations and illustrative figures aiding understanding.
- The creative evaluation strategy involving a scaling RL agent, which could be a valuable area for further investigation.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a comprehensive literature review to adequately demonstrate the novelty of the proposed method compared to prior works.
- Insufficient evaluation of scalability, focusing on limited environment sizes without a systematic study of varying sizes.
- The paper lacks an ablation study or discussion on the limitations of scalability and generalization, particularly in non-rectangular environments or different station placements.
- Limited comparisons with baseline models and state-of-the-art methods, which weakens the findings.
- Absence of real-world implementation and validation, reducing practical significance.
- Lack of discussion on the generalizability of the method to other domains and applications.
- Insufficient analysis of hyperparameters and their impact on performance.
- No open-source implementation provided, hindering reproducibility.
- The justification for the design choices regarding NCA and quality diversity objectives is unclear.
- There is potential for introspection into the strategies learned by the NCA, which is not fully explored.
- The paper could benefit from additional examples of generated environments and a more comprehensive discussion of the quality diversity aspect.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review to clearly differentiate their method from existing approaches in environment generation and optimization. A more thorough analysis of scalability with varying environment sizes and intermediate steps is necessary to provide a clearer understanding of the method's capabilities. Additionally, including comparisons with more baseline models and state-of-the-art methods would strengthen the paper's findings. We suggest conducting real-world validation of the proposed method in automated warehouses or manufacturing scenarios to enhance its practical significance. A discussion on the generalizability of the method to other domains should be included, along with a detailed sensitivity analysis of hyperparameters. We also recommend that the authors improve the discussion on scalability by including diverse test samples and addressing potential failures of the NCA in various settings. Exploring the strategies learned by the NCA could enhance the understanding of the underlying rules governing the generated patterns. It would be beneficial to provide more examples of generated environments in the main draft to illustrate the quality diversity aspect. Clarifying the rationale behind the design choices and including comparisons with other environment generation methods, such as Compositional Pattern Producing Networks, would strengthen the paper's contributions. Lastly, addressing the subjective nature of human design comparisons and providing details on the hardware and execution time would improve the overall clarity and rigor of the study.
