### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) using the SMT solver Z3Py to solve counting problems. The authors introduce a method for generating synthetic training data consisting of combinatorics problems paired with Z3 solutions, which is evaluated against a held-out set of real problem instances. The results indicate that fine-tuning LLMs on this synthetic data improves their mathematical problem-solving capabilities, particularly in counting problems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The writing is clear and easy to follow, effectively describing the domain and proposed solutions.
- The approach of generating synthetic data is novel and practical, demonstrating success in improving model performance.
- The paper is relevant to the workshop's focus on SMT solvers and their application in formal mathematics.

Weaknesses:
- The absence of a related work section limits the context of the research; an appendix comparing this work to prior studies would be beneficial.
- The use of pass@k as a metric is questioned, as it may not be meaningful in this context without a clear way to identify correct outputs.
- There is a lack of detailed interpretation of results, particularly regarding the semantic diversity of outputs across different fine-tuning methods.
- The claim of a "novel algorithm" for data generation may be overstated, given the commonality of such synthesis methods.
- There is insufficient analysis of which aspects of the synthetic data contribute most effectively to model performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including a related work section or appendix to contextualize their research within existing literature. Additionally, the authors should consider revising their use of pass@k as a metric, providing a more meaningful evaluation method for their results. We suggest that the authors include a more thorough interpretation of their findings, particularly focusing on the semantic diversity of outputs and quantifying this aspect. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the novelty of their algorithm and provide a detailed analysis of the synthetic data components that enhance model performance.
