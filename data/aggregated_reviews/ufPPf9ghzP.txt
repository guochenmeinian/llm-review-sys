Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an approximate MPE inference scheme for multiple discrete probabilistic models, ensuring efficient log-likelihood computations. The authors propose a neural network-based approach that leverages self-supervised learning to avoid expensive MPE oracle labeling, iterative optimization of network parameters at prediction time for anytime inference and continual learning, and a teacher-student training scheme (GUIDE) to mitigate overfitting. The evaluation is conducted on various binary benchmarks from TPM and PGM literature.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents sensible, novel contributions.
- Extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
- The approach can compute any-MPE without pre-fixing query/evidence variables, addressing a significant limitation of prior neural network methods.

Weaknesses:
- Limitations of the approach are not clearly articulated.
- Some experimental details lack clarity, and runtime evaluation is deferred to supplementary materials.
- Inference time optimization appears to significantly enhance performance, overshadowing pretraining benefits.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the limitations of their approach in the text. Additionally, we suggest providing more detailed experimental information, including the training time of the proposed method and the number of unique query instances used in the training data. It would also be beneficial to include a diagram illustrating the components of the proposed method for better clarity. Finally, we encourage the authors to evaluate the performance using average conditional likelihood \( p(q|e) \) to address potential biases in their current evaluation based on average joint likelihood \( p(q,e) \).
