### Key Points
This paper presents TadNER, a type-aware decomposed framework for few-shot named entity recognition (NER), addressing challenges such as over-detected false spans and unstable prototypes. The authors propose a method that filters out spans semantically distant from type names and constructs stable prototypes using a type-aware contrastive learning strategy. The approach is evaluated on various benchmarks, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance, particularly in few-shot settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method significantly outperforms previous approaches, especially in very few-shot scenarios.
- The paper is well-structured and includes a comprehensive set of experiments and an extensive ablation study.
- The semantic connection between transformers and labels is an interesting aspect of the study.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks sufficient novelty and appears to be a limited improvement over existing methods like DecomposedMetaNER.
- Some sections are difficult to follow, particularly the method section, which lacks clear examples and tidy LaTeX formatting.
- The explanation of filtering false spans is unclear, raising questions about the effectiveness of the proposed filtering strategy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method section by providing more detailed examples and ensuring that the LaTeX formatting is tidy. Additionally, we suggest that the authors elaborate on the novelty of their approach compared to existing methods, particularly addressing the theoretical basis for the effectiveness of the added label information. Clarifying the filtering process and its implications on boundary information would also enhance the paper's impact. Finally, including visual representations of prototype corrections or aggregations would provide clearer insights into the method's effectiveness.
