Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Neural Material Adaptor (NeuMA), a framework that integrates existing physical laws with learned corrections to accurately model dynamics while maintaining generalizability and interpretability. It proposes a particle-driven 3D Gaussian Splatting variant, Particle-GS, which allows back-propagation of image gradients to optimize simulations. The authors evaluate their method against existing approaches, demonstrating consistent improvements in dynamics and novel view quality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The integration of a new correction term for the material law enhances accuracy and generalizability.
2. The binding mechanism between particles and Gaussian kernels is innovative.
3. The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations and informative diagrams.
4. The method shows qualitative and quantitative superiority over baseline approaches.

Weaknesses:
1. The dataset lacks detailed descriptions, such as the number of views for scene initialization and optimization, which are crucial for understanding the efficiency of the learning-based material law.
2. The absence of real-world examples limits the demonstration of the method's practicality.
3. There are inconsistencies in the results, particularly regarding the performance of 2D versus 3D supervision, suggesting potential issues with the training of the 3D baseline.
4. The evaluation of generalization to novel objects and interactions is insufficiently explored, raising questions about the framework's robustness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset description by including details on the number of views used for initialization and optimization, as well as the training episodes for each material type. Additionally, we suggest providing real-world examples to substantiate the method's applicability. The authors should also clarify the evaluation of the 3D baseline to address the observed performance discrepancies. Lastly, we encourage a more thorough exploration of generalization to novel objects and interactions to strengthen the paper's contributions.
