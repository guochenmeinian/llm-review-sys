### Key Points
This paper presents a hyperspectral compute-in-memory architecture that leverages both frequency and spatial dimensions for matrix-matrix multiplication (MMM) to enhance system throughput. The authors report preliminary results focused solely on the accuracy of the MMM.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well written and presents correct findings regarding the accuracy of the MMM.

Weaknesses:  
The work is primarily a progress report with limited novelty, as several existing papers have already explored the use of space and wavelength dimensions for scaling the system.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their work by providing more comprehensive results beyond accuracy and addressing the existing literature on space and wavelength dimensions to strengthen their contributions.
