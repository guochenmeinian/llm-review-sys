### Key Points
This paper presents a linear time algorithm for the problem of information maximization with augmentations (IMA), which is a natural extension of the influence maximization problem. The authors propose a more efficient approximation of the greedy choice using the reverse sampling technique, originally introduced for the influence maximization problem. The paper provides theoretical guarantees and extensive experimental results demonstrating that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both computational efficiency and effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem addressed is interesting and relevant.
- The claims are justified through solid theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments.
- The paper is well-organized, clear, and presents a significant contribution to the field.

Weaknesses:
- The technical novelty of the approach is questionable, as it closely resembles existing methods.
- The explanation of the method in Section 4 lacks clarity and could benefit from more intuitive illustrations.
- The reliance on a fixed propagation model may limit adaptability to complex real-world scenarios.
- The baseline comparisons are insufficient, primarily focusing on the Greedy algorithm without including other relevant methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method's explanation in Section 4 by incorporating intuitive illustrations or figures. Additionally, consider expanding the baseline comparisons to include other relevant works, such as those by Cor√≤ et al. on link recommendation for influence maximization. It would also be beneficial to clarify the technical novelty of the algorithm, particularly highlighting any unique observations that differentiate it from existing techniques. Furthermore, we suggest addressing the complexity of prior works alongside the authors' contributions in O tilde notation for clearer theoretical context. Lastly, ensure that all key terms and notations are defined early in the manuscript to enhance reader comprehension.
