Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents FERERO, a novel algorithm for preference-guided multi-objective learning framed as a constrained vector optimization problem. It integrates relative preferences, defined by a polyhedral cone, and absolute preferences through linear constraints. The authors propose both deterministic and stochastic algorithms with finite-time convergence guarantees, validated through experiments on various benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. FERERO effectively manages both preference constraints and objective values adaptively, avoiding the need for multiple subprograms.
2. The finite-time convergence rates for FERERO and its variants are well-established with solid proofs.
3. The proposed approximated rules and stochastic variants are practical for real-world applications.

Weaknesses:
1. The step sizes in some convergence analyses depend on $T$, which may be unknown in practice.
2. The computational cost per iteration may exceed that of traditional scalarization methods.
3. The problem's motivation is unclear, as it complicates traditional multi-objective optimization without sufficient real-world applications to validate its significance.
4. The experiments do not utilize $C_A$, focusing instead on traditional multi-objective optimization, which appears insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by clearly defining the vector optimization aspect and the meaning of "maximize" concerning the cone. It is essential to explicitly state how much of the true Pareto front the proposed algorithms capture upon convergence, potentially by demonstrating guarantees for the solutions returned and comparing them with existing $(\epsilon,\delta)$-PAC results. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the problem setup and preliminaries, ensuring that the definitions of optimality are accurately represented and appropriately cited from established works. Lastly, addressing the ambiguity in the choice of $C_A$ and providing more detailed experimental validation of the preference constraints would enhance the paper's clarity and impact.
