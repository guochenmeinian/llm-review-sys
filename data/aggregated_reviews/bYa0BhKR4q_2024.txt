### Key Points
This paper presents DeepInception, a jailbreak technique that prompts models with fictional setups to comply with harmful instructions. The authors document a systematic approach to jailbreak LLMs by creating nested hypothetical scenarios, demonstrating its applicability across various models and defense techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method achieves significant success rates on state-of-the-art models.
- The authors effectively demonstrate the technique's applicability across different contexts and against various defenses.

Weaknesses:
- The paper represents a slight modification within a crowded field, with limited contributions to understanding LLM vulnerabilities, as the limitations of existing models against such prompts are already well-known.
- The motivation drawn from the Milgram experiment is unconvincing, as it lacks relevance to LLM behavior, and the existing research on role-playing provides a more compelling rationale.
- The criticality of the jailbreak is unclear, especially when other approaches perform comparably or better, as noted in Table 2.
- The marginal gains from the nested layering approach appear minimal, resembling traditional methods that provide context to LLMs.
- There is a lack of statistical inference in benchmark comparisons to substantiate claims of improvement over prior approaches.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for using Milgram's experiment and explicitly state its relevance to LLMs. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a clearer assessment of the jailbreak's criticality and consider conducting statistical inference when comparing benchmarks to validate their findings. Furthermore, we advise avoiding unscientific statements, such as 
> DeepInception is a mechanism of hypnotizing LLMs based on the modelsâ€™ intrinsic imagination capabilities.
