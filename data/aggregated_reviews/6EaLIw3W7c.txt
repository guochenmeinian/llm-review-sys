Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel linker design task where fragment poses are unknown, addressed through the development of a 3D equivariant diffusion model called LinkerNet. The model enables the co-design of fragment poses and linker structures, viewing fragments as rigid bodies and employing a fragment pose prediction module inspired by the Newton-Euler equations in rigid body mechanics. LinkerNet generates chemically valid, synthetically-accessible, and low-energy molecules, demonstrating superiority over baseline methods in both unconstrained and constrained generation settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- The effective fragment pose prediction module allows accurate adjustments of fragment center positions and rotations, marking a significant technical contribution compared to DiffLinker.
- Comprehensive experiments on ZINC and PROTAC-DB datasets validate LinkerNet's performance against existing generative models.

Weaknesses:
- The application of LinkerNet for molecule generation conditioned on the target protein is not demonstrated.
- The experimental results lack error bars (standard deviation), and comparisons of training complexity, training time, and sampling time between methods are missing.
- The writing requires improvement, particularly in explaining the equation forms and concepts for a broader audience.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the fragment pose prediction module description, especially leading up to equation (12), and provide details on the neural network architecture used. Additionally, the authors should include error bars in the results and compare training and sampling complexities with existing methods, particularly DiffLinker. To enhance accessibility, we suggest that the authors better introduce the problem for a general machine learning audience, explaining concepts like ubiquitination. Lastly, we advise expanding the discussion of limitations in the conclusion for greater depth.
