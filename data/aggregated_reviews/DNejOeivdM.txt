### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the performance of recommender systems for users with multiple interests, emphasizing fairness for these users. The authors propose a framework that utilizes multiple embeddings for each user to represent their diverse interests, alongside a center embedding reflecting key user characteristics. The paper empirically evaluates this framework against existing algorithms, demonstrating that it can achieve better fairness-utility tradeoffs. Interest diversity is measured using two metrics: the diversity of item categories in user interactions and the diversity of interests based on item embeddings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem of users with multiple interests is well-motivated, and the finding that existing algorithms perform poorly for these users is relevant.
- The introduction of multiple embeddings to reflect different user interests is a natural and well-justified approach.
- The paper provides a nuanced comparison by including modified versions of LightGCN and CAGCN* with fair baselines (DRO and ARL), facilitating clear evaluation of the proposed framework.

Weaknesses:
- The rationale for requiring multiple virtual embeddings for items, in addition to users, is unclear.
- While the paper frames the issue as a fairness problem, it is not evident that fairness for users with varied interests is a primary goal in practice. The example provided regarding sexual orientation on dating apps suggests that explicit fairness approaches may be more applicable.
- The empirical evaluation indicates that the proposed method does not outperform existing approaches based solely on accuracy (recall).

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the necessity of multiple virtual embeddings for items within the framework. Additionally, a more detailed discussion on the fairness motivation is needed, including real-world examples where poor recommendation quality for users with varied interests could lead to fairness concerns. We suggest providing a caption for Table 3 to better contextualize the experimental results and addressing the statistical significance of the findings. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to analyze the limitations of the Interest Matching aspect of their model, particularly regarding users with singular interests. Lastly, we recommend improving Figure 5 for clarity, as it currently confuses the representation of the framework's components.
