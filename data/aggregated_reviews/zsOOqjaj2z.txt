Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the identifiability of the generator of linear stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with both additive and multiplicative noise. The authors derive sufficient conditions for identifiability, supported by geometric interpretations and simulations that illustrate identifiable and non-identifiable cases. They also propose a framework for identifying the laws of post-intervention processes in SDEs, ensuring reliable causal inference even when underlying signatures are not identifiable from observational data. The discussion includes specific SDE formulations and their corresponding generators, emphasizing the relevance of this work for the machine learning community, particularly in the context of neural SDE models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is theoretically sound and well-structured, addressing unresolved issues in stochastic differential equations and contributing to the understanding of random dynamics relevant to machine learning.  
- The authors provide a clear rationale for the importance of their work in causal inference, with detailed mathematical examples that effectively illustrate the proposed identifiability conditions.  
- Significant improvements have been made to the clarity of presentation based on reviewer feedback, and the condition in Theorem 3.3 is well-defined and effectively addresses the identifiability of the SDE generator.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks practical examples and scenarios, making it difficult to assess its practical importance and applicability in non-static settings.  
- The introduction does not adequately link causal inference to the identifiability of SDEs, leaving the motivation unclear.  
- The presentation remains confusing for non-experts, with insufficient explanations of key concepts like the generator of SDEs.  
- There is skepticism regarding the novelty of the mathematical results, particularly in light of existing literature that may offer stronger contributions.  
- Some reviewers have expressed uncertainty about the validity of the proof, impacting their confidence in the work, and the manuscript contains clerical errors and inconsistent citations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the manuscript by including practical examples or scenarios to motivate readers and demonstrate the relevance of their work. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the connection between causal inference and SDE identifiability in the introduction. It would be beneficial to provide a gentle introduction to key concepts, such as the generator of SDEs, to enhance accessibility for a broader audience. The authors should also consider expanding their simulations to include higher-dimensional datasets to better reflect real-world applications. Furthermore, we recommend improving the clarity of the discussion on the implications of non-Markovian systems and self-feedback in SDEs, and enhancing the exposition of mathematical examples in relation to real-world applications. Finally, we encourage the authors to ensure that all theoretical claims, especially those related to Theorem 3.4, are rigorously validated and clearly articulated in the manuscript, while addressing clerical errors and inconsistencies in citations to improve professionalism.
