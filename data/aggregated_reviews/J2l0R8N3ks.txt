### Key Points
This paper presents a zero-shot quantization framework for textual pre-trained language models (PLMs), specifically through the proposed Zero-shot Sharpness-Aware Quantization (ZSAQ) method. The authors aim to enhance quantization accuracy and model generalization by optimizing a minimax problem and provide a theoretical convergence analysis for the Sharpness-Aware Minimization variant (SAM-SGA). Experimental results across 11 tasks demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, particularly for low-bit weights.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses significant challenges in LM quantization, introducing novel concepts like adversarial training and sharpness-aware minimization, which are underexplored in NLP.
- It offers a solid theoretical framework, particularly with the convergence analysis of the SAM-SGA algorithm.
- Empirical results show consistent performance improvements on both generative and discriminative models, indicating the potential of the ZSAQ method.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty and technical improvements may be limited, relying heavily on existing methods like Zero-shot Adversarial Quantization and Sharpness-Aware Minimization, which are not original contributions.
- Some experimental results, particularly concerning the ZeroQuant baseline, are lower than reported in original studies, lacking adequate explanation.
- The ablation studies do not convincingly support claims regarding the importance of SGA versus SAM, and the generalization claims from the Task Generalization and Visualization of Landscape experiments require reconsideration.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion and comparison of existing zero-shot quantization methods to better contextualize the strengths of ZSAQ. Additionally, the authors should provide more detailed explanations for the discrepancies in ZeroQuant results and include ablation results on the full GLUE dataset to substantiate their claims. Clarifying the motivation for zero-shot quantization in generative tasks and ensuring rigorous experimental designs for all tasks would strengthen the paper's arguments. Lastly, addressing the visibility of adversarial training stages on loss curves and the training data for the generators would enhance transparency and reproducibility.
