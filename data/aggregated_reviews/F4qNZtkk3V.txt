Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Multiple Knowledge Fusion Model (MKFM) aimed at enhancing emotion recognition in conversations by integrating various knowledge sources such as co-reference, topics, and emotional causes. The authors utilize ChatGPT to generate these knowledge sources and conduct extensive experiments on established emotion datasets to demonstrate the model's effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The idea of leveraging diverse knowledge sources for emotion recognition is intriguing and technically robust.
- The extensive experimental sessions illustrate the advantages of the proposed model, which surpasses state-of-the-art benchmarks.
- The use of ChatGPT for knowledge extraction is a promising approach for addressing annotation challenges in NLP tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The paper suffers from excessive use of abbreviations, complicating readability.
- The methodology lacks clarity regarding the role of ChatGPT and the categorization of knowledge sources.
- The results, while showing improvements, are marginal and the model's complexity raises concerns about reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology section by organizing it into three categories: 1. Auxiliary Contextual Knowledge, 2. Auxiliary Label Knowledge, and 3. Utterance Knowledge. This structure would enhance understanding of how the MKFM integrates different types of knowledge. Additionally, we suggest reducing the number of abbreviations to a few essential ones to improve readability. It would also be beneficial to include a validation process for the knowledge obtained from ChatGPT to ensure its reliability and mitigate potential noise. Lastly, the authors should justify the extra effort required to obtain this knowledge in light of the marginal performance improvements observed.
