### Key Points
This paper presents a new List-wise Learning-to-Rank (LTR) approach, named CPP-based LTR, for profit-aware recommendation systems. The authors propose the Current Preference and Profit (CPP) metric, which integrates user preferences and item profitability to optimize recommendations. The framework aims to balance user satisfaction with platform profitability, classifying unobserved items based on CPP and employing LTR to enhance ranking accuracy and profitability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The CPP metric effectively balances recommendation accuracy and profit maximization.
- The classification of unobserved items based on CPP utilizes previously neglected information.
- Empirical evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrate the framework's feasibility and superiority over existing methods.
- The paper is well-organized and presents thorough experimental designs.

Weaknesses:
- The chosen baselines for comparison do not represent the latest advancements in the field.
- The feasibility of the CPP-based LTR approach in real-world scenarios is not demonstrated, lacking integration with dynamic pricing or user feedback mechanisms.
- The paper does not address computational efficiency, omitting comparisons of training and inference times against baselines.
- The definition of CPP lacks theoretical justification for its combination of user preferences and item profit.
- The use of inconsistent metrics for profit evaluation raises concerns about the validity of results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the representation of baselines by including more recent advancements in the field. Additionally, the authors should demonstrate the practical applicability of the CPP-based LTR approach in real-world scenarios by addressing integration with dynamic pricing and user engagement feedback loops. To enhance the paper's rigor, we suggest including a discussion on computational efficiency, specifically training and inference time comparisons with baseline models. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide a theoretical justification for the CPP metric's formulation and to adopt a consistent metric for profit evaluation throughout the experiments. Lastly, clarifying the time complexity explanation in Section 4.5 and addressing the apparent inconsistencies in the performance of baseline models would strengthen the paper.
