### Key Points
This paper presents a study on multi-task representation learning for pure exploration in bilinear bandits. The authors propose the GOBLIN algorithm, which utilizes an experimental design approach to optimize sample allocations for learning a global representation while minimizing the samples needed to identify the optimal pair of arms in individual tasks. Their findings demonstrate that learning a shared representation across tasks significantly enhances sample complexity compared to traditional independent task solutions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written, addressing an interesting and well-motivated problem.
2. The theoretical analysis is sound, and the methodology is rigorous with clear explanations.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks clarity on its main technical novelty compared to existing methods like SVD, G-optimal design, and phased elimination in the bilinear/linear bandit literature.
2. There is insufficient elaboration on the differences in formulation, algorithms, and results between this work and [Du et al. 2023]. The transformation of multi-task representation learning for bilinear bandits to linear bandits needs further explanation.
3. A comprehensive literature review is missing, particularly regarding existing work on pure exploration in bilinear bandits and multi-task representation learning.
4. The rationale behind the choice of dataset, experimental design, evaluation metrics, and baselines is not adequately explained.
5. Details on data preprocessing, feature engineering, model architecture, hyperparameter tuning, and implementation are absent.
6. The assumption that the matrix Θ∗ has a known low rank r is significant and should be explicitly stated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by explicitly stating the main technical novelty and how it differs from existing methods. Additionally, we suggest providing a more comprehensive literature review that includes relevant works on pure exploration in bilinear bandits. The authors should elaborate on the rationale for their dataset and experimental design, as well as include details on data preprocessing, feature engineering, and implementation. Lastly, we advise including the assumption regarding the known low rank r of the matrix Θ∗ in the list of assumptions.
