Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel loss function called AUCOC, aimed at maximizing the area under the confidence operating characteristic curve to improve model accuracy and confidence while minimizing the number of samples delegated to human experts. The authors conduct extensive experiments on various image classification datasets, including computer vision and medical images, to evaluate their approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The idea of using the area under the confidence operating characteristic curve as an additional differentiable loss is novel and well-articulated. The paper is well-written, and the core method is clearly explained, with experimental results supporting the claims. The approach shows promise in outperforming other loss functions and addresses a significant problem in minimizing human effort in human-in-the-loop systems.

Weaknesses:  
The related works section is sparse, lacking relevant literature, particularly in the area of active learning, which is crucial to the paper's context. The empirical evaluation is limited to image classification datasets, and there is no exploration of performance on larger-scale datasets or diverse data types. The title may be misleading, and there is a need for clearer references to the specific CNN architectures used in experiments. Additionally, the evaluation of only Gaussian noise for CIFAR 100-C experiments raises questions about the robustness of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related works section by including relevant literature on active learning and previous metrics for "human effort." A broader empirical evaluation across diverse datasets, including text and tabular data, would strengthen the paper's contributions. Clarifying the specific CNN architectures used in experiments and exploring the influence of the AUCOC loss on CNN prediction behavior would enhance the understanding of the proposed method's effectiveness. Additionally, addressing the confusion in the language regarding the relationship between AUCOC, accuracy, and expert load in the paper would improve clarity.
