Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents new lower bounds for public-data assisted private stochastic convex optimization (SCO) when public examples are available, both labeled and unlabeled. The authors propose a simple algorithm for generalized linear models (GLM) that utilizes unlabeled public examples, demonstrating that this approach eliminates a dimension-dependent term, akin to prior findings. The paper also investigates a public-data-assisted differential privacy problem, introducing a novel mean estimation lower bound and a dimension-independent rate for unlabeled public data. The main contributions include stronger lower bounds and a new algorithm for leveraging unlabeled public data for dimension reduction in labeled private data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem addressed is significant and relevant to the differential privacy community.
- The results provide valuable insights into the limitations of public-data assisted private SCO, particularly in narrowing the gap between lower and upper bounds.
- The analysis is technically solid, especially regarding the dimension-independent rate achieved with unlabeled public data.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation is lacking; key results and their improvements over previous bounds are not summarized clearly, which could be enhanced with a comprehensive table.
- The significance of Theorem 3 is ambiguous, and comparisons to existing results are insufficiently detailed.
- Corollaries 2 and 3 are difficult to interpret, necessitating clearer explanations.
- The paper's general assertions about the ineffectiveness of sophisticated methods for leveraging public data should be moderated, as improvements have been shown in specific problem classes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by summarizing main results in an accessible format, possibly through a table detailing assumptions and conditions. The authors should clarify the missing conditions on \(n_{pub}\) in Theorems 3, 6, and 7, ensuring that the implications of these conditions are explicit. Additionally, we suggest providing more context regarding the assumptions that Theorem 3 avoids and how it compares to existing literature. The authors should also consider rephrasing statements in the abstract and throughout the paper to accurately reflect the nuanced findings, particularly regarding the effectiveness of leveraging public data.
