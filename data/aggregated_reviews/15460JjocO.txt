### Key Points
This paper presents a study on partner diversity in training generalist agents, emphasizing the balance between diversity and specialization. The authors introduce a method for quantifying diversity and specialization using mutual information, while identifying the limitations of the cross-play minimization (XP-min) technique, which can lead to overfitting. They propose reinforcement learning and supervised learning methods, specifically "SpecTRL" and "SpecTRL DAgger," to mitigate overfitting while preserving beneficial behaviors. Empirical results validate that these methods enhance the robustness of generalist agents.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
* The paper introduces a novel method to quantify partner diversity and specialization using mutual information.
* It effectively identifies the issue of overfitting in partners generated by the XP-min technique.
* The proposed methods are empirically validated, demonstrating improvements in training robust generalist agents.
* The paper provides a thorough analysis of how diversity and specialization impact the robustness of generalist agents.

Weaknesses:
* The experiments are limited to a specific cooperative environment (multi-recipe Overcooked), which may restrict the generalizability of the results.
* The overfitness measurement relies on an oracle generalist, which may not be practical in real-world scenarios.
* The limitations section is relegated to the appendix, which may detract from the paper's overall clarity.
* Table 2 is difficult to interpret due to its complexity; visual representations could enhance understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by validating results in additional environments beyond Overcooked. Additionally, we suggest that the authors move the limitations discussion from the appendix to the main body of the paper for better accessibility. To enhance clarity, consider simplifying Table 2 or providing visual representations of the data. Lastly, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the computational requirements for implementing SpecTRL and SpecTRL DAgger in various environments and discuss strategies for identifying or creating an oracle generalist when one is not readily available.
