### Key Points
This paper studies the moral stance of several popular LLMs and evaluates their ethical reasoning by injecting ethical policies at different levels of abstraction in their prompts. The authors propose a framework for constructing ethical principles with varying clarity and demonstrate biases in LLMs' moral stances through experiments. The results indicate that most LLMs exhibit biases towards certain moral values, with GPT-4 showing the best ethical reasoning capabilities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well organized and presents a novel dataset of moral dilemmas.  
- It effectively highlights the importance of value pluralism and the inherent biases in state-of-the-art LLMs.  
- The ethical reasoning experiments with policies at different abstraction levels are interesting and contribute to the understanding of LLM behavior.

Weaknesses:  
- The experiments primarily focus on in-context learning (ICL), neglecting other proposed methods such as post-processing with classifiers and human feedback alignment, which limits the impact of the findings.  
- The analysis of models' inherent bias lacks sufficient test cases for each pair of values, reducing the authority of the experimental results.  
- Some writing is informal and lacks clarity, making it difficult to follow certain arguments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental design by including tests with all (ambiguous, conflicting) ethical policies to assess how they may confuse the models. Additionally, the authors should explore the other proposed methods, such as post-processing with classifiers, and clarify the rationale behind the need for classifiers/data in Section 3.2. We also suggest enhancing the precision and rigor of the language used throughout the paper, particularly in defining terms like "ethical policies" and "ethical reasoning." Lastly, addressing the clarity of the take-away from Figure 1 and ensuring that all claims are adequately supported would strengthen the manuscript.
