### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of the importance of distinguishing between positive and negative predictions from the perspective of post hoc uncertainty quantification (UQ) in DETR models. The authors propose a novel contribution by differentiating these queries to enhance UQ, which is particularly relevant for applications in complex scenes such as autonomous driving and medical image analysis. The manuscript includes solid empirical evaluations across multiple datasets, including COCO and Cityscapes, but the overall quality is deemed general, with insufficient background research on the target detection transformer.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The focus on UQ in DETR models addresses a significant gap in current object detection literature.
- The differentiation between positive and negative queries adds depth to the understanding of DETR’s internal mechanisms.
- The paper provides empirical validation across multiple datasets, enhancing the robustness of the proposed methods.

Weaknesses:
- The overall quality of the article is general, with a need for a clearer connection between the state of the art and the paper's goals in the introduction.
- The proposed ContrastiveConf method lacks clarity regarding parameter selection and generalizability to different DETR variants, particularly the scaling factor λ, which requires a thorough theoretical justification.
- There is inadequate discussion of failure cases, with a need for more in-depth analysis to strengthen the paper’s conclusions.
- The focus on object-level UQ is limited, and preliminary insights in this area could enhance the practical utility of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by clearly linking the state of the art to their paper goals, identifying knowledge gaps, and reasoning both the novelty and relevance of their objectives. Clarifying methodological details, such as the threshold for separating positive and negative queries and the rationale behind specific parameter values, would enhance accessibility. Expanding the scope of experiments to include more diverse datasets or real-world scenarios would demonstrate broader applicability. Additionally, discussing the computational cost of the proposed UQ methods would be beneficial, especially for real-time applications. Finally, we suggest revising the conclusion to highlight insights and applicability in a more concise format, ideally in one or two paragraphs.
