### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for analyzing the ACL Anthology of NLP publications from 1979 to 2022, focusing on the relationships between tasks, methods, datasets, and metrics (TDMM) to illustrate the evolution of NLP research. The authors employ statistical and causal analysis methods to quantify these relationships and their impact on research trends. The work aims to assist both novice and experienced researchers in understanding the historical context of NLP tasks and the influence of various entities on these tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a significant research question, providing a framework for automatic historical analysis beneficial for researchers at all levels.  
- It employs a thorough causal analysis, presenting novel methods to quantitatively represent task stability and shifts.  
- The extensive coverage of NLP research over a long period and a wide range of tasks adds depth to the analysis.  
- The empirical pipeline is well-developed, offering a model for future large-scale data-driven analyses in the community.

Weaknesses:  
- The initial sections of the paper are confusing, with unclear definitions and relationships among TDMM entities, particularly regarding the role of tasks.  
- The findings are perceived as somewhat obvious, lacking deeper insights that could enhance the paper's value.  
- The paper does not adequately address the influence of early arXiv publications on the causal analysis, potentially affecting soundness.  
- Some terminology, such as "causality," is deemed too strong and could benefit from more precise language.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the initial sections by providing clearer definitions and relationships among TDMM entities, particularly how tasks influence each other. Additionally, consider introducing key concepts, such as the causal relationships, earlier in the paper to aid reader comprehension. We suggest expanding the findings to include more specific insights into task biases and the impact of various datasets on task evaluation. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to revise the use of "causality" to more accurately reflect the nature of their analysis, potentially using terms like "task-oriented." Lastly, enhancing the introduction with the time period of the dataset and providing more detailed explanations of formulas and tables would improve overall readability and comprehension.
