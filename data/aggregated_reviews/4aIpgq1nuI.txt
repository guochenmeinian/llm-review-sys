Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the conditions that make data distributions suitable for accurate predictions by locally connected neural networks, utilizing theoretical tools from quantum physics. The authors propose that a locally connected neural network can predict data accurately if and only if the data distribution exhibits low quantum entanglement under specific feature partitions. They develop a preprocessing method to enhance compatibility between data distributions and locally connected neural networks, supported by experimental evaluations across various datasets and models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces the concept of quantum entanglement, providing new insights into the learnability of data distributions by specific neural networks.  
- It offers a compelling theoretical result that establishes a clear link between representation power and entanglement, which is both theoretically elegant and practically relevant.  
- Extensive experiments are conducted across different locally connected neural networks, with results demonstrating the potential for improved predictive power through feature permutation.

Weaknesses:  
- The numerical experiments are limited, primarily focusing on randomly arranged data rather than original datasets, which may weaken the argument's support.  
- The presentation is dense in some areas, making it challenging to follow; clearer qualitative discussions and intuitive illustrations of key concepts, such as low entanglement properties, are needed.  
- The motivation for using quantum entanglement and the implications for networks with high connectivity are insufficiently discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by providing more qualitative discussions to enhance readers' intuition regarding the relationship between representation power and entanglement. Additionally, we suggest conducting comprehensive experiments on more architectures and datasets, including classical CNNs and textual data, to validate the findings further. It would also be beneficial to illustrate the low-entanglement property on toy datasets and clarify the definition and significance of the tensor network's width, denoted as $R$. Lastly, addressing the motivation for using quantum entanglement over other metrics and discussing the implications for networks with high connectivity would strengthen the paper.
