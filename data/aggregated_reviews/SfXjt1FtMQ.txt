Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Gaussian multi-Graphical Model (GmGM), a novel method for constructing sparse graph representations of matrix- and tensor-variate data. The authors propose that GmGM learns representations across multiple tensors sharing axes, which is essential for analyzing multimodal datasets, particularly in multi-omics scenarios. The GmGM algorithm achieves significant speed improvements over previous models by utilizing a single eigendecomposition per axis, enabling its application to large multi-modal datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. GmGM extends Gaussian Graphical Models to multi-tensor datasets, addressing a significant gap in data analysis methodologies.
2. The model demonstrates impressive efficiency improvements, allowing for the handling of large multi-modal datasets while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.
3. The results on five real datasets are well explained, with a comprehensive discussion of both successful and less impressive outcomes.

Weaknesses:
1. The evaluation lacks quantitative analysis, which would enhance the findings. The authors should include results on the COIL-20 dataset and provide quantitative comparisons with baselines regarding efficiency and accuracy.
2. The algorithm's strict assumptions about data integrity and quality limit its broader applicability. The authors are encouraged to consider relaxing these assumptions or proposing strategies for handling missing data and noise.
3. The paper's representation and flow require substantial improvement. Key concepts, such as the Kronecker product and Gram matrix, are not clearly introduced, and the logical flow is unclear, hindering reader comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the quantitative evaluation by including results on the COIL-20 dataset and conducting UMAP consistency analysis for the LifeLines-DEEP dataset, along with quantitative comparisons on the 10x dataset. Additionally, the authors should consider relaxing the assumptions regarding data integrity and quality to enhance the model's practical utility. Finally, we suggest reorganizing the paper to clarify key concepts and improve the overall flow, ensuring that notations and definitions are clearly presented to enhance readability and comprehension.
