### Key Points
This paper presents a method for addressing the limited lexicon of multilingual language models by utilizing pixel representations instead of subword embeddings. The authors propose that this approach improves performance on the TED dataset across multiple languages and enhances cross-lingual transfer, particularly for low-resource languages with non-Latin scripts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The study introduces a novel approach that demonstrates improved performance over traditional subword-based methods.  
- It effectively enhances cross-lingual transfer to unseen scripts and is more data efficient, particularly benefiting low-resource languages.  
- The proposed pixel representations show robustness when scaling model size.

Weaknesses:  
- The technical distinction between this approach and Rust et al., 2023, is unclear.  
- There is a lack of experimentation with various image conversion parameters and better multilingual models, such as NLLB, M2M-100, and SMaLL100.  
- The claim of "up to 9 BLEU" is misleading; mean values should be reported, and chrF should be prioritized for robustness.  
- The rationale for selecting specific languages in Table 2 is not adequately explained.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the technical differences between their approach and Rust et al., 2023. Additionally, we suggest experimenting with better multilingual models like NLLB, M2M-100, and SMaLL100 to strengthen their findings. It is also essential to explore different image conversion parameters, such as fonts, sizes, and resolutions, to enhance the robustness of their results. Furthermore, we advise the authors to report mean BLEU scores and prioritize chrF for performance evaluation. Lastly, please provide a clearer explanation for the selection of languages in Table 2.
