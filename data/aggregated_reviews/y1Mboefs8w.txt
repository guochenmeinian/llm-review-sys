### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method named EXGC aimed at addressing inefficiencies in graph condensation (GCond) by utilizing mean-field approximation for parameter updates and the Gradient Information Bottleneck (GDIB) principle to prune redundancy. The authors integrate leading explanation techniques, such as GNNExplainer, to enhance both efficiency and explainability in the graph condensation process. Extensive experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a critical problem in graph representation learning, reflecting a deep understanding of current challenges in handling large-scale web data graphs.  
- The proposed method effectively combines efficiency and explainability, applying existing explainable models to filter informative nodes, which enhances training and storage efficiency.  
- The experimental analysis is comprehensive, showcasing substantial improvements across various performance metrics compared to established benchmarks.  

Weaknesses:  
- The technical details are complex and difficult to follow, lacking high-level explanations that could improve readability.  
- The paper does not sufficiently explain the limitations of existing methods or how these limitations manifest, particularly regarding the linear increase in parameters during the E-step.  
- There is insufficient discussion on why EXGC outperforms other GCond methods, and comparisons with state-of-the-art techniques are limited.  
- The presentation of experimental results is confusing due to varying backbones and naming conventions, and the claim of a 2-4 times speed increase lacks supporting details.  
- The theoretical improvements of the proposed method are not established through complexity or convergence time analyses.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the technical details by summarizing complex variational approximations into key lemmas and providing more high-level insights into the modules like MGCond and GDIB. Additionally, we suggest that the authors elaborate on the limitations of existing methods with theoretical references or experimental results to clarify their claims. It would be beneficial to include a more objective discussion on how EXGC exceeds other GCond methods and to provide comparisons with a broader range of GCond baselines. Furthermore, we advise the authors to enhance the presentation of experimental results by standardizing the backbone used and clarifying the naming conventions. Lastly, we recommend including a complexity analysis and convergence time analysis to substantiate the claimed improvements.
