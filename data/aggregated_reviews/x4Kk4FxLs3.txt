Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents PARD, a graph generation model that integrates autoregressive and diffusion models to enhance efficiency and maintain permutation invariance. By generating graphs block-by-block using a partial order of nodes and edges, PARD addresses the limitations of traditional autoregressive models, which are sensitive to order, and diffusion models, which require extensive denoising steps. The model employs a shared diffusion mechanism with an equivariant network and a higher-order graph transformer, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various datasets, including large ones like MOSES.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The combination of autoregressive modeling with diffusion models showcases a novel approach to graph generation.
2. The proposed partial order ensures permutation invariance in the autoregressive generation process.
3. Experimental results demonstrate the model's effectiveness and efficiency.

Weaknesses:
1. The employment of the diffusion model in PARD lacks clarity, particularly in the connection between Sec 3.1 and Eq. 6.
2. The paper requires proof or references for certain claims, such as the 2-FWL expressivity of the higher-order transformer.
3. The results of other baselines on QM9 are not provided, limiting comparative analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the diffusion model's implementation in PARD, specifically elaborating on the relationship between Sec 3.1 and Eq. 6. Additionally, please provide proof or references for the claims made about the higher-order transformerâ€™s expressivity. It would also be beneficial to include results from other baselines on QM9 for a more comprehensive evaluation. Furthermore, consider moving some redundant discussions to the appendix and addressing the limitations of the model more explicitly in the manuscript.
