Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension to the diffusion models framework for function spaces, introducing functional diffusion processes (FDPs) that utilize a noising process based on a Wiener process in a Hilbert space. The authors demonstrate the existence of a time-reversal process under certain noise conditions and derive an evidence lower bound (ELBO) using an extension of the Girsanov theorem. They also extend the sampling theorem to reconstruct functions from evaluations at discrete points, applying their model to the CelebA dataset and achieving low FID scores with relatively few parameters.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The submission is generally clear and well-structured, particularly Section 2, which is well fleshed out.
- The proposed methodology is rigorous and sound, with precise theoretical claims and correct proofs.
- Theorem 2 provides sufficient conditions for recovering the original function, which is potentially useful.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental setups are limited, lacking ablation studies, making it difficult to assess the practical benefits of the approach.
- The focus on the CelebA dataset restricts the exploration of the model's advantages with functional data, particularly regarding resolution invariance and irregular grids.
- The experiments yield worse FID scores compared to standard diffusion models, raising questions about the practical applications of this method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including more diverse datasets and conducting ablation studies to better illustrate the practical benefits of their approach. Additionally, addressing the resolution invariance property of the learned models would enhance the analysis. It may also be beneficial to explore applications such as upscaling or handling irregular time-series data. Clarifying the relationship between this work and concurrent function-space diffusion models would strengthen the contribution. Finally, we suggest revisiting the complexity metrics in Table 1, as they appear subjective and may mislead readers.
