Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents GEPS, a meta-learning method designed to generalize a PDE solver to unseen environments through a low-rank-based meta-learning strategy. The authors configure the PDE solver as a low-rank framework, training domain-specific diagonal matrices for adaptation. They also incorporate a hybrid framework that integrates physics prior as a trainable module. The method demonstrates better generalization compared to classical ERM approaches, with extensive experiments conducted across various dynamical systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The focus on PDE generalization addresses an important problem.
- The proposed method is reasonable and performs well in most scenarios.
- The paper is well-written and clear, with thorough experiments and detailed comparisons to other meta-learning models.

Weaknesses:
- The technical contribution is limited, as the architecture resembles existing models like LoRA and relies on a combination of established techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts.
- The motivation for the model design is unclear, particularly regarding the hybrid framework's structure and the physics module's implementation.
- Experimental results, especially for the Gray-Scott equation, lack robustness, and some important baselines are missing.
- The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of computational efficiency or discuss the sensitivity of hyperparameters extensively.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind the proposed method and elaborate on the hybrid framework's design choices. Specifically, they should clarify the rationale for using the physics prior module at the beginning of the model. Additionally, including comparisons with simple but important baselines, such as adaptor-based methods and generalizable backbones, would strengthen the experimental section. We also suggest conducting more ablation studies to elucidate the contributions of each model component and providing a detailed analysis of computational efficiency and hyperparameter sensitivity. Lastly, reconsidering the title "adaptive conditioning" to better reflect the method's specific contributions would enhance clarity.
