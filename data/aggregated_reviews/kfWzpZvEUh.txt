Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Neural Acquisition Process (NAP), a novel method for Bayesian optimization that employs a transformer architecture to jointly handle surrogate and acquisition functions. The authors formulate the meta-Bayesian optimization as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem, utilizing an auxiliary loss to enhance training stability. The method is empirically validated across four benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to existing approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors propose an innovative and effective transformer-based method for Bayesian optimization, supported by a solid engineering foundation.
- They clearly differentiate their approach from prior work, addressing parameters such as history order invariance and the number of tokens.
- The experimental protocol is robust, with comprehensive comparisons against relevant baselines across diverse datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The method may be overly complex for smaller search spaces and less expensive functions, although it is applicable to costly black-box functions like deep neural networks.
- The experiments lack a temporal comparison, leaving questions about the method's efficiency in terms of time.
- There is insufficient experimental evidence, particularly the absence of ablation studies to analyze the impact of the auxiliary loss.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including ablation studies to investigate the effect of the auxiliary loss. Additionally, it would be beneficial to provide a comparison of the method's performance in terms of time efficiency, particularly against other approaches. Addressing the complexity of the method and its implications for high-dimensional state/action spaces would also enhance the clarity of the paper.
