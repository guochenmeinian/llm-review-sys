Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Networks (S²GNNs), a hybrid model that integrates Spatial Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) with Spectral Graph Neural Networks. The authors argue that this combination enhances the modeling of both local and global information, addressing issues like over-squashing and under-reaching. They provide a comprehensive analysis of their method, including a novel technique for position encodings that improves expressiveness beyond the 1-WL test. The authors validate their approach through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art results, particularly on peptide datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with aesthetically pleasing figures and tables.
- The problem addressed is well-motivated, and the method is easy to comprehend, yielding strong empirical results.
- The analysis of S²GNNs is thorough, with interesting mechanistic in-context learning experiments relevant to long-range modeling.
- The empirical results on peptide datasets are impressive, achieving state-of-the-art performance without position encodings and using fewer parameters than competitors.
- The theoretical analysis is insightful, particularly regarding the advantages of spectral filters and their connection to virtual nodes.
- The introduction of two new datasets for long-range tasks is a valuable contribution.

Weaknesses:
- The main text lacks focus, with some theoretical insights being unnecessary and distracting.
- Subsection 3.3 is confusing for readers unfamiliar with spectral methods and requires more context or relocation to supplementary materials.
- The discussion of related work on Laplacian positional encodings and recent methods addressing long-range relationships is insufficient.
- A direct comparison of runtime with a simple MPNN is missing, which would enhance the paper's clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the focus of the main text by relocating some theoretical discussions to supplementary materials. Additionally, we suggest expanding Subsection 3.3 to provide clearer context for readers less familiar with spectral methods. The authors should also enhance the related work discussion by including references to similar Laplacian positional encodings and recent methods like GRED, AMP, and NBA. Finally, we advise including a table that directly compares the runtime of S²GNNs with a simple MPNN, such as a GCN or GIN model, to clarify performance metrics.
