### Key Points
This paper presents a framework named SPC for identifying implicit speakers in novels through symbolization, prompt, and classification. The key research problem addressed is implicit speaker identification in long-range contexts, where existing methods struggle with explicit identification. The proposed framework demonstrates a significant accuracy improvement of 4.8% over previous state-of-the-art methods on a web novel collection and outperforms ChatGPT in two benchmarks. The authors provide thorough ablation studies to illustrate the effects of each component of the framework and acknowledge potential limitations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The manuscript introduces an interesting framework for implicit speaker identification.
- Experimental setup details are adequately provided.
- The paper is clear and concise, with a strong focus on implicit cases.

Weaknesses:
- Clarity issues arise from undefined terms such as "speaker," "mention," and "occurrence," which may confuse readers.
- The proposed approach largely echoes established insights from previous works, lacking a novel perspective.
- The improvement over baselines, particularly in cross-domain settings, is minimal, and ChatGPT performs comparably in zero-shot scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by providing precise definitions for key terms like "speaker," "mention," and "occurrence" to avoid reader confusion. Additionally, the authors should clarify whether the labels for the auxiliary tasks NUSC and MMC are from the original dataset or annotated by them, as this impacts the fairness of comparisons. To strengthen the paper, we suggest including examples of dialogues that require different types of semantic understanding and elaborating on how their system handles features of written dialogue better than existing systems. Finally, we advise the authors to ensure consistent terminology regarding ChatGPT and GPT-3.5-turbo throughout the manuscript.
