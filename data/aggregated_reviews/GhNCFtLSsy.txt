Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to knowledge transfer in long-horizon tasks using the Categorical Successor Feature Approximator (CSFA) within an enhanced Deep Option Keyboard (Deep OK) framework. The authors aim to minimize environmental interactions during training while achieving effective task transfer in a challenging 3D environment. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in success rates across various tasks, including "Find" and "Place."

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors propose a dynamic transfer query that facilitates sharing among task encoders and SF approximators.
- The methodology is implemented effectively in long-horizon tasks, showcasing its potential for knowledge transfer.

Weaknesses:
1. The authors do not adequately position their contribution against existing methods for long-horizon tasks, such as hierarchical, hindsight, and meta-learning approaches.
2. Some experimental descriptions are unclear, particularly regarding computational resource comparisons among USFA, MSFA, and the proposed methods. Detailed memory and computational load comparisons are necessary.
3. The rationale for why MSFA is considered sharable or suitable for different tasks is not sufficiently explained.
4. There are typographical errors, such as "Transfer tasks are conjunctions of known known tasks" (line 289).
5. The generalization ability of SFGPI is not discussed, and the performance of CSFA on other general tasks remains uncertain.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the positioning of their work by explicitly comparing it with hierarchical, hindsight, and meta-learning approaches. Additionally, include detailed memory and computational load comparisons among USFA, MSFA, and the proposed methods. Clarify the rationale behind MSFA's sharability and suitability for various tasks. Address the typographical errors and enhance the clarity of experimental descriptions. Finally, consider expanding the evaluation metrics beyond success rates and discuss the upper limits of task sharing capabilities.
