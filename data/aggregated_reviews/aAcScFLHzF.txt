### Key Points
This paper presents CoFedRec, a novel federated recommender system aimed at addressing statistical heterogeneity in Federated Recommender Systems (FRS) through a co-clustering approach. The authors propose clustering users based on item categories and employing a supervised contrastive learning strategy to enhance model performance. The effectiveness of CoFedRec is validated through experiments on four datasets, demonstrating its potential for improved personalized recommendations while maintaining user privacy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The investigation into statistical heterogeneity in FRS is crucial and well-articulated.
- The concept of clustering users for personalized model generation is logical and straightforward.
- Experimental validation across four datasets showcases the generalizability and effectiveness of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- The necessity of "co-clustering" is unclear, as alternative methods for generating synthetic user embeddings could suffice (W1).
- The process for determining item membership M lacks clarity (W2).
- Random selection of core clients may yield unexpected results, particularly in datasets with abnormal client interactions (W3).
- The paper lacks comparisons with other clustering-based federated recommendation methods and does not adequately discuss computation costs associated with clustering operations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the necessity for "co-clustering" by addressing alternative methods for generating synthetic user embeddings. Additionally, please clarify how item membership M is determined and provide a detailed analysis of the potential implications of randomly selecting core clients. It would also be beneficial to include comparisons with other clustering-based federated recommendation methods and to discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed approach. Finally, consider providing insights into the relationship between the proposed method's performance and dataset characteristics, such as distribution and sparsity, to strengthen the evaluation.
