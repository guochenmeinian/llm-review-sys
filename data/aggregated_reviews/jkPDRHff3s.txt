Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents generalization bounds for variational autoencoders (VAEs) using PAC-Bayesian bounds. The authors derive a PAC-Bayesian bound based on a posterior distribution (Theorem 3.1) and subsequently establish generalization bounds for reconstruction loss (Theorem 4.2) and generated distribution (Theorem 5.1). These results depend on broad quantities and are elaborated in corollaries that include assumptions such as bounded instance spaces and manifold assumptions. The paper also addresses the adaptation of the PAC-Bayes theorem for cases where the posterior is conditioned on a learning sample.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents original contributions to the field.
- The assumptions are thoroughly discussed, and intuitive explanations accompany the technical results.
- Limitations are clearly stated without exaggeration, and the paper addresses an important theoretical topic.

Weaknesses:
- The lack of experimental results is a significant weakness, particularly given the theoretical nature of the work. Conducting experiments on synthetic problems could assess the asymptotic behavior of the bounds concerning parameters like reconstruction losses, $\lambda$, and Lipschitz constants.
- The bounds require computation using samples different from those used to train the VAE, which undermines one of the primary advantages of PAC-Bayes bounds as learning objectives.
- The obtained bounds are not uniform with respect to decoder parameters, affecting the sample size rate.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including an experimental section that tests the theoretical results on synthetic datasets. This could involve assessing the bounds' performance concerning various parameters, such as reconstruction losses and Lipschitz constants. Additionally, we suggest exploring the possibility of computing the bounds numerically to evaluate their tightness and non-vacuity. Finally, addressing the uniformity of bounds with respect to decoder parameters could enhance the robustness of the results.
