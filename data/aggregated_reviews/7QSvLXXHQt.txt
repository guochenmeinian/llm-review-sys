### Key Points
This paper presents PromptAV, an innovative approach for authorship verification (AV) that utilizes large language models (GPT-3.5) to evaluate stylistic similarity between text samples. The method employs a structured prompting technique to guide the model in using specific stylometric features, resulting in a confidence score that determines authorship similarity. The authors demonstrate that PromptAV achieves effective accuracy rates of 59% in zero-shot and 67% in few-shot evaluations on the IMDB62 dataset. The paper also emphasizes the importance of human-comprehensible reasoning for interpretability, particularly in legal contexts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of linguistic features as prompts for AV is a novel contribution.
- PromptAV shows improved performance over baseline methods in various evaluation settings.
- The approach allows for authorship verification without the need for extensive training data, making it accessible for practical applications.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on a pre-determined set of stylometric features may limit the method's applicability, as consensus on effective features is not universally established.
- The comparison of PromptAV is limited to existing prompting methods, lacking a benchmark against state-of-the-art AV techniques.
- The paper does not adequately address data requirements and the practicality of the method, particularly regarding computation time and robustness against authorship obfuscation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the robustness analysis of PromptAV, particularly its performance against various authorship obfuscation methods. Additionally, a thorough examination of the computation and time consumption associated with PromptAV should be included. The authors should also clarify how PromptAV addresses data requirements, as the current justification may imply a need for more data rather than less. Finally, we suggest that the authors provide a more detailed comparison with state-of-the-art AV methods to better contextualize the utility and potential of their approach.
