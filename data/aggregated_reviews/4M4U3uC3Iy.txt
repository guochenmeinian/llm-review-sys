### Key Points
This paper presents ChatCoT, a tool-augmented chain-of-thought reasoning framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning abilities of chat-based large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. By modeling chain-of-thought reasoning as multi-turn conversations, ChatCoT enables LLMs to interact with tools and perform reasoning in a unified manner. The approach achieves a 7.9% relative improvement over state-of-the-art baselines on complex reasoning tasks in two datasets, MATH and HotpotQA.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The introduction of ChatCoT as a novel framework effectively leverages multi-turn conversations and external tools, enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs for complex tasks.  
- The writing style is clear and concise, facilitating comprehension of the proposed framework and its components.  

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty of the proposed method is relatively weak, as it does not significantly deviate from existing approaches.  
- The experimental evaluation lacks comparisons with other large-model-based methods and fine-tuned smaller models. Additionally, the paper does not address how the system handles incorrect reasoning chains generated by ChatGPT, raising concerns about robustness and fault tolerance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of the framework by clearly distinguishing it from existing methods. Additionally, the authors should conduct a more comprehensive experimental evaluation by comparing ChatCoT with other large-model-based methods and fine-tuned smaller models. It is also essential to explore how the framework can handle erroneous reasoning chains, including mechanisms for recognizing and correcting such errors.
