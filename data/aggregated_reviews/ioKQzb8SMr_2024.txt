Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel conditional generative modeling approach called Guided Trajectory Generation (GTG) for offline model-based optimization (MBO). GTG constructs synthetic trajectories using locality bias and employs a conditional diffusion model to generate these trajectories based on their scores. The method demonstrates superior performance on the Design-Bench benchmark and includes extensive ablation studies to validate its effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written, effectively motivating the approach and clearly describing the conditional guidance for exploring high-scoring regions.
2. The method introduces a new way to generate trajectories that consistently improve upon existing techniques.
3. The use of diffusion models allows for handling complex, high-dimensional data effectively.

Weaknesses:
1. The authors should clarify the distinctions between their method and existing approaches, particularly the Decision Diffuser, to emphasize their unique contributions.
2. The experimental results lack clarity regarding data handling to prevent label leakage, and the fairness of comparisons with other models needs to be discussed.
3. There is insufficient detail on the experimental results, particularly regarding the reliability of the Design-Bench benchmark tasks, which have inherent issues.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions by explicitly differentiating their method from existing approaches like Decision Diffuser. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on data handling during experiments to ensure no label leakage occurs and discuss the fairness of model comparisons. A more detailed description of the experimental results is necessary, especially addressing the reliability issues in the Design-Bench benchmark tasks. Furthermore, we suggest including a principled mathematical explanation for the proposed approach and discussing the implications of using a proxy function for out-of-distribution designs.
