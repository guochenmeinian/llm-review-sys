Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents WAFFLE, a slowdown attack designed to generate natural adversarial text that bypasses early-exit points in multi-exit language models. The authors evaluate the robustness of these models against adversarial slowdown using the GLUE benchmark, demonstrating that the attack significantly reduces the computational savings provided by multi-exit mechanisms. The study reveals that more complex mechanisms are more vulnerable to this attack and discusses the ineffectiveness of adversarial training compared to input sanitization methods like ChatGPT.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- The evaluation is comprehensive, covering various multi-exit mechanisms and attack settings.
- The proposed attack is the first of its kind on language models, contributing to the literature on availability attacks.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a measurement of the running time impact of the adversarial slowdown attacks, which is crucial for understanding the attack's effectiveness.
- There is insufficient discussion on the differences between WAFFLE and similar slowdown attacks in the computer vision domain.
- The attack often produces incoherent text, indicating a potential overfitting to a specific distance metric.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by measuring the running time of experiments to assess the impact of adversarial slowdown attacks. Additionally, a discussion on the differences between WAFFLE and existing slowdown attacks in the vision domain should be included to clarify the novelty of their approach. We also suggest exploring alternative distance functions, such as token/character edit distance, to enhance the generality of the attack. Finally, a section discussing the limitations of the study should be added to provide insights for future research directions.
