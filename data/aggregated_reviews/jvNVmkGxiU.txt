### Key Points
This paper presents a dataset and analysis focused on human interactions with AI-assisted creative tools, specifically examining Midjourney for text-to-image generation. The authors identify a feedback loop where user prompt design is influenced by model biases rather than personal goals, grounding their hypotheses in linguistic theory. They compile a dataset of 107K threads, revealing convergence patterns in prompt features such as length and perplexity. The authors caution against reusing this data for model training due to potential biases.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The analysis is timely and relevant, enhancing understanding of user interactions with AI models.
- The dataset has broad applications, including refining prompts and gauging biases in image generation.
- The paper is well-structured, clearly written, and provides valuable insights into prompting dynamics.

Weaknesses:
- Greater discussion is needed on the impact of removing predefined parameters on output acceptability.
- The choice of thresholds for IoU/Jaccard and BERTScore lacks justification and illustrative examples.
- The evidence for the second proposed explanation regarding model-like language is insufficient, and the analysis does not adequately control for individual user goals or experiences.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the impact of removing predefined parameters and provide a version of the analysis with consistent hyperparameters. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the rationale behind the chosen thresholds for IoU/Jaccard and BERTScore, including illustrative examples. To strengthen the evidence for the second explanation, consider demonstrating how users adapt their language styles through a learning process. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore the generalizability of their findings beyond Midjourney and over a larger number of iterations.
