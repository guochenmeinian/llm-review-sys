Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on continuous attractor networks (CANs) and their instability under noise, demonstrating that these attractors, while fragile, exhibit functional robustness. The authors analyze the behavior of noise-perturbed CANs and introduce the concept of slow manifold structures that persist despite theoretical instability. Additionally, the paper proposes a theoretical framework addressing the resilience of animal behavior to fluctuations in neural dynamics, asserting that continuous attractor models for analog working memory remain relevant despite biological complexities. The authors aim to enhance the manuscript's accessibility by simplifying language, adding a section on implications for experimental neuroscience, and providing intuitive definitions of key concepts. They also clarify the bifurcation and stability analysis, indicating that results can be extended to higher-dimensional systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The investigation of continuous attractors in the finite time limit offers a novel perspective, contributing original insights to the field.
- The theoretical motivation is compelling, supporting the correctness of the results.
- The authors effectively address concerns regarding the relevance of continuous attractor models in biological contexts.
- Proposed changes, including a new section and simplified language, demonstrate responsiveness to feedback and a commitment to improving accessibility.
- The authors provide a significant theoretical contribution by demonstrating the existence of a persistent attractive manifold in various bifurcations of continuous attractors.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation, particularly in Section 5, is unclear and dense, requiring significant expansion for better understanding.
- The focus on 1D ring attractors limits the generalizability of the findings; additional experiments with LSTMs, GRUs, and other attractor structures are necessary.
- Many figures lack clarity and connection to the text, leading to confusion regarding their relevance and interpretation.
- The bifurcation and stability analysis is currently limited to low-dimensional systems with specific parameters, which may restrict the generalizability of the findings.
- The manuscript's initial complexity may hinder understanding for a broader audience.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 5 by expanding on the discussion and simplifying the presentation of complex concepts. Additionally, including control experiments with LSTMs and GRUs would strengthen the claims regarding generality. The authors should clarify the differences between their slow manifold picture and related works, as well as provide examples with diverse attractor structures beyond ring-like configurations. Furthermore, we suggest revising the title to better reflect the manuscript's content and ensuring that all figures are adequately referenced and explained in the text. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the bifurcation and stability analysis by explicitly stating how these results can be generalized to higher-dimensional systems. The new section on implications for experimental neuroscience should be well-integrated into the main text and clearly outline the relevance of their findings. Lastly, simplifying Theorem 1 and relegating complex concepts to supplementary materials should be executed with care to maintain the integrity of the theoretical framework while enhancing readability. Addressing the audience's accessibility by toning down theoretical jargon could enhance the paper's impact on experimental neuroscientists.
