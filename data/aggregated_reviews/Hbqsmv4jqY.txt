### Key Points
This paper presents a novel active learning (AL) architecture designed for low-resource annotation scenarios, integrating an explanation generation model and a prediction model. The system utilizes human-provided labels and explanations to fine-tune both models, demonstrating its effectiveness through two AL simulations on the eSNLI dataset, where it consistently outperforms baseline methods. The authors also evaluate the generated explanations, finding them less effective than human explanations but preferred over those from other baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The application of AL for annotating explanations and labels is significant.
- The proposed framework demonstrates superior performance compared to baselines.
- The paper thoroughly reviews related literature and explores the efficacy of generated explanations.

Weaknesses:
- The AL approach is only validated on NLI problems, raising concerns about its generalizability to other problem types.
- The method of selecting unlabeled data relies heavily on similarity to human-annotated data, which may not be innovative.
- The paper lacks a results table comparing different pre-trained models and data labeling techniques, limiting the assessment of various strategies.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by testing the AL framework on non-NLI datasets and involving human annotators in the evaluation. Additionally, we suggest incorporating a results table to compare the performance of various pre-trained models and data selection techniques. Finally, addressing the potential increase in annotation costs due to the inclusion of natural language explanations would strengthen the paper's argument.
