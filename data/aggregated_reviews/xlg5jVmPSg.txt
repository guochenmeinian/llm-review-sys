### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive survey of Machine Theory of Mind (ToM) in large language models (LLMs), addressing two critical questions: (1) how to taxonomize machine ToM, and (2) how to establish an effective evaluation protocol to avoid spurious correlations. The authors propose a taxonomy of ToM into seven mental states using the ATOMS framework and advocate for a situated evaluation that incorporates physical and social contexts. A preliminary study in a grid world scenario demonstrates the proposed evaluation tasks across ten different setups, contributing valuable insights into the landscape of ToM.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a structured review of existing literature on machine ToM, presenting both evidence and counter-evidence.
- It proposes a clear taxonomy of ToM into different mental states, enhancing clarity and consistency in evaluations.
- The situated evaluation approach is innovative, aiming to address limitations in current benchmarks.
- The preliminary study serves as a practical demonstration of the proposed evaluation tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks an in-depth discussion on how situated evaluation can mitigate spurious correlations, particularly in relation to data contamination.
- The rationale for deriving the taxonomy from child development and the effectiveness of the proposed tasks compared to existing baselines is not convincingly articulated.
- Concerns regarding the applicability of the grid world scenario as a truly situated environment remain unaddressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on how situated evaluation can specifically mitigate shortcuts and spurious correlations, providing a detailed analysis in the relevant sections. Additionally, the authors should clarify the necessity of the taxonomy derived from child development and justify the selection of the ten tasks for evaluating ToM compared to other baselines. To enhance the robustness of the preliminary study, consider providing a more comprehensive analysis of the results and their implications, particularly in relation to the maturity of LLMs for complex ToM tasks. Finally, we suggest revising the presentation of Figure 3 to clearly define the corresponding characteristics and meanings of colors used, ensuring clarity for the reader.
