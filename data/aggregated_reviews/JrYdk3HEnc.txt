Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an algorithm for online non-stochastic control within continuous-time linear dynamical systems. The authors propose a two-level online algorithm that minimizes regret by addressing a discretized reduced problem at a higher level while managing discretization errors at a lower level. The work achieves an $O(\sqrt{T} \log T)$ regret, consistent with results from discretized systems, and is validated through empirical evaluations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The investigation of controlling continuous-time linear dynamical systems is meaningful and contributes to the field.  
- The algorithm achieves an $O(\sqrt{T} \log T)$ regret, comparable to discretized systems.  
- Sufficient empirical evaluations demonstrate the method's effectiveness, including the impact of frame stack and frame skip.  
- The paper is well-written and employs novel proof techniques.

Weaknesses:  
- The technical novelty appears insufficient, particularly regarding the challenges of bounding state magnitudes and addressing the curse of dimensionality.  
- The presentation of results is often unclear, with ambiguous notation and several typographical errors.  
- There is a gap between theoretical results and experimental validation, with insufficient discussion on the implementation of the studied setting in experiments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their notation to avoid confusion, particularly in distinguishing between time steps and the use of matrices in the DAC policy. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide more detailed explanations of the technical challenges faced in continuous-time systems compared to discretized ones. It would be beneficial to include comparisons with previous assumptions in discretized systems in the appendix for better reader comprehension. Furthermore, we advise revising the discussion on domain randomization to clarify its theoretical implications, and addressing the strict assumptions regarding state derivatives and disturbances to enhance the applicability of the findings. Lastly, we encourage the authors to ensure that all relevant citations are included and to correct any typographical errors throughout the paper.
