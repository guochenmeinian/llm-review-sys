Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel data augmentation method for reinforcement learning (RL) in continuous control tasks, leveraging Euclidean symmetries through rotational transformations of states. The authors propose a limb-based state representation, enhancing the applicability of these transformations. Evaluated on 10 tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite, the method demonstrates improved data efficiency and performance, particularly in complex 3D tasks, outperforming existing techniques and proving computationally efficient. However, the method shows limited effectiveness, primarily dependent on specific task properties, such as rotation symmetries about gravity. The authors note that even in tasks where the method shows improvement, it necessitates changes in configurations and additional hyperparameter tuning. There remains a question regarding the performance difference between the proposed method and the default DDPG setting, which could result in marginal performance differences if hyperparameters are optimized carefully.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach of utilizing Euclidean symmetries for data augmentation is innovative and addresses an underexplored area in state-based RL.
- The limb-based state representation effectively facilitates Euclidean augmentation.
- Comprehensive experiments across 10 tasks, including thorough ablation studies and comparisons with relevant baselines.
- Additional experiments enhance understanding of the method, leading to an improved evaluation score.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper does not clarify how the method addresses environments where Euclidean data augmentation may conflict with constraints.
2. The data composition process lacks detail, particularly regarding the integration of augmented transitions.
3. The study is limited to 0-100% augmentation; exploring larger multipliers could yield valuable insights.
4. The focus on rotation transformations may overlook other potentially beneficial transformations like translation and reflection.
5. In several tasks, the performance of $œÅ_\text{aug} = 0\%$ suggests that the limb-based representation may be more critical than the augmentation itself, raising questions about the generalizability of the limb-based approach.
6. The method's performance is contingent on specific task properties, requiring significant adjustments and tuning, which raises concerns about its general applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding how their method handles constraints in specific environments. Additionally, a more detailed explanation of the data composition process is necessary. Exploring larger augmentation multipliers and incorporating other transformations such as translation and reflection could enhance the analysis. Furthermore, justifying the advantages of limb-based over joint-based representations would strengthen the paper. We also suggest including a discussion of recent state-based data augmentation methods in the related work section to better position the paper within the literature. Lastly, clarifying the performance differences between the proposed method and the default DDPG setting, particularly in relation to hyperparameter choices, could enhance the method's robustness and applicability across a broader range of tasks.
