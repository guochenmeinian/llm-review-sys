Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical exploration of the effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting in autoregressive Transformer models for solving mathematical and decision-making problems. The authors demonstrate that bounded-depth Transformers cannot solve certain tasks without CoT unless their size increases super-polynomially with input length. The paper includes empirical validation through experiments on various tasks, confirming the theoretical findings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a solid theoretical proof of CoT's effectiveness, contributing significantly to understanding its underlying mechanisms.
- The theoretical proofs are comprehensive and well-organized, enhancing the clarity of the study.
- The research addresses a significant problem, as CoT has shown strong empirical performance but lacked theoretical analysis.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental section is insufficient, with the length extrapolation experiment covering only one task.
- There is a lack of exploration regarding different model architectures and their effectiveness with CoT.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including results from multiple tasks in the length extrapolation experiment. Additionally, consider exploring other model architectures, such as encoder-decoder models like T5, to assess CoT's effectiveness across different frameworks. Clarifying the impact of layer numbers on CoT performance and addressing the quality of intermediate steps in experiments would also strengthen the findings. Lastly, simplifying the notation in Section 4.1 could enhance accessibility, and a deeper conceptual analysis of the theoretical results would provide greater insight into the implications of the study.
