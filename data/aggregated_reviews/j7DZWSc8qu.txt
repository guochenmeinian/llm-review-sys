### Key Points
This paper investigates inference scaling laws related to task performance versus model parameters and inference FLOPs, comparing tree search variants to sampling-based methods. The authors propose REBASE, a tree search method that employs a separate reward model for node expansion, demonstrating that a smaller language model with this novel algorithm achieves a Pareto-optimal tradeoff. The empirical results indicate that REBASE outperforms other baselines, such as MCTS and sampling methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper presents solid empirical results that validate the advantages of the proposed REBASE method.
- It conducts a comprehensive analysis of inference scaling laws across various model sizes and compute budgets.
- The introduction of REBASE is well-explained and empirically validated, showcasing its superior performance and computational efficiency compared to MCTS and sampling methods.
- The study highlights the benefits of combining small models with REBASE in resource-limited environments.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a theoretical analysis and intuition regarding REBASE's design, including its convergence properties and regret bounds.
- There is insufficient discussion on the limitations or potential drawbacks of REBASE, as well as hyperparameter sensitivity, particularly concerning the balance temperature \( T_b \).
- The authors do not compare REBASE with other tree search variants beyond MCTS, nor do they address how REBASE manages reward normalization across different tree depths.
- The introduction could benefit from a more comprehensive review of related work and a discussion on the broader implications of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis of REBASE by providing mathematical intuition about its design and performance, including the rationale behind the exponential weighting formula. Additionally, the authors should include experiments with larger-sized language models and additional benchmarks, such as AIME2024, to enhance the generality of their findings. A comparative analysis with other advanced tree search methods and a detailed discussion of REBASE's limitations and hyperparameter sensitivity would also strengthen the paper. Finally, addressing the potential applicability of REBASE to other problem types beyond mathematical reasoning would broaden the impact of the research.
