Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new method for coherence-free entrywise estimation of eigenvectors in signal plus noise models, demonstrating that entrywise estimation error for rank-1 matrices scales as $\tilde{O}(\sigma/|\lambda^\star|)$ with high probability. The authors propose a general rank-$r$ algorithm, empirically validated, and establish a new lower bound on minimax eigenvector estimation in $\|\cdot\|_{2\to\infty}$. The work also addresses the low-rank matrix estimation problem, proposing an algorithm that does not depend on the incoherence parameter, supported by mathematical analysis and numerical experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1) Theorem 1's coherence-free entrywise estimation is a practical result that can enhance experiments requiring accurate entrywise estimates. The algorithm and its guarantees are noteworthy.
2) The authors' empirical evaluation of a generalization of the rank-1 algorithm, despite not proving guarantees in the rank-$r$ setting, is commendable.
3) The lower bounds for matrix estimation in $\|\cdot\|_{2\to\infty}$ are notably tight compared to previous results.
4) The experimental results effectively complement the theoretical findings, indicating promising practical performance.

Weaknesses:
1) The main theorem is only proven for rank-1 matrices, with the rank-$r$ setting only empirically tested.
2) The Gaussianity assumption is restrictive; a statement analogous to Theorem 1 in a more general setting would be preferable.
3) The bounds may be improvable in logarithmic terms.
4) Assumption 2 is problematic and may not hold in many important cases, complicating the theoretical framework.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalization of their results by providing a statement analogous to Theorem 1 under less restrictive assumptions. Additionally, addressing the limitations of Assumption 2 and clarifying its implications on coherence would enhance the robustness of the theoretical claims. We also suggest comparing the proposed algorithm with other non-spectral methods to contextualize its performance. Lastly, a more detailed discussion of Algorithm 1 and its computational requirements would be beneficial for clarity.
