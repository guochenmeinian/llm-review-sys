### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for improving annotations by generating soft labels that incorporate annotator confidence and disagreement. The authors utilize a Bayesian approach to align confidence levels among annotators and introduce a dataset aimed at enhancing soft label research in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The method addresses the limitations of traditional single-label classification by maximizing data utilization from uncertain annotations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper challenges conventional practices by leveraging uncertain annotations for soft labels, thus maximizing data utilization.
- It addresses a recognized limitation in data annotation methodologies for single-label classification tasks.
- The creation of an innovative dataset supports future research in the field.

Weaknesses:
- The method is compared against outdated baselines; more recent comparisons, such as weakly supervised baselines, are needed.
- The datasets used in experiments are small, raising concerns about performance on larger datasets.
- Insufficient evidence or validation may undermine the credibility of the approach, particularly regarding dataset accessibility.
- The methodology section could benefit from simplification and clearer notation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison by including more recent baselines, such as weakly supervised methods that utilize soft labels. Additionally, the authors should provide a clearer explanation of their dataset's accessibility and validation. It is crucial to conduct more result analysis and clarify the experimental setup, particularly regarding the training and test set usage. We also suggest including a hyperparameter search space and discussing any observed variance in results. Lastly, simplifying the methodology section and clarifying notation would enhance the paper's clarity.
