Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents "Hollowed Net," a novel framework for memory-efficient LoRA fine-tuning in on-device text-to-image diffusion models. The method modifies the U-Net architecture by removing less-essential layers, significantly reducing memory requirements during training while maintaining performance. The authors propose that by excluding middle layers during fine-tuning, they can enhance personalization while minimizing GPU memory requirements. They provide detailed computational analysis, including FLOPs and memory consumption for both Hollowed Net and LoRA, and emphasize the method's scalability and generalizability across various applications. The authors claim that their approach is flexible and scalable across different model architectures, with potential applications in resource-constrained environments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and provides quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.
- Hollowed Net shows improved efficiency, reducing training memory costs while maintaining competitive performance.
- The authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the trade-offs between model complexity and performance, particularly in on-device settings.
- They provide comprehensive metrics and comparisons with existing methods, highlighting the efficiency of Hollowed Net.
- The inclusion of user studies and results from large datasets supports the claims of scalability and effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The assumption that external layers of the U-Net are more affected than internal ones lacks empirical support, raising questions about the validity of the approach.
- The efficiency gains reported are relatively modest compared to standard LoRA fine-tuning, and the novelty of the method is questioned due to similarities with existing techniques like ControlNet.
- The experimental evaluation relies on metrics (DINO and CLIP scores) that may not align with human preferences, and the dataset size for evaluation is considered too small.
- The lack of additional experiments with actual on-device chipsets may limit the practical applicability of the findings.
- Some terminology, such as "using class-level inputs for the middle layers," was initially misleading and required clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical validation of their assumptions regarding layer importance by providing data to support their claims. Additionally, we suggest expanding the evaluation to a larger dataset to enhance the robustness of their findings. More comprehensive analysis on model size, latency, and the memory usage of buffering stages should be included to strengthen the claims of on-device applicability. We also recommend conducting further experiments with actual on-device chipsets to validate the performance claims in real-world scenarios. Finally, improving the clarity of technical terms used in the paper will help avoid confusion and enhance the overall comprehensiveness of the work.
