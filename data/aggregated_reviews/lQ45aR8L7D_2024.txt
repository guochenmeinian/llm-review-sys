### Key Points
This paper presents a method called Set-Based Prompting to address the order dependency issue in large language models (LLMs), which leads to inconsistent outputs when the order of semantically identical inputs is altered. The authors propose modifying input representations to eliminate order information, supported by theoretical proofs that validate the method's effectiveness. Empirical evaluations on multiple LLMs, including GPT-2, Llama 2, Llama 3, and Mistral, demonstrate that while the method may slightly impact performance, it generally maintains accuracy and mitigates variation caused by different orderings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides rigorous theoretical proofs validating Set-Based Prompting's effectiveness in eliminating order dependency.
- Extensive empirical evaluations across multiple models and datasets demonstrate the method's robustness.
- The writing is clear, and the innovative idea of incorporating metadata akin to positional encoding opens new research avenues.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation of the method could be simplified, as it is perceived as more complex than necessary.
- The contribution, while valuable, is relatively straightforward and could benefit from additional experiments to confirm efficacy across a broader range of tasks.
- The requirement for users to manually specify sub-sequences limits usability and scalability, and the evaluation scope is narrow, primarily focusing on multiple-choice question datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation to make the method more accessible. Additionally, expanding the evaluation to include more diverse tasks and datasets would strengthen the paper's contributions. Exploring automation for sub-sequence specification could enhance usability. Finally, addressing the potential out-of-distribution performance implications and providing concrete examples of practical applications would further solidify the method's relevance and impact.
