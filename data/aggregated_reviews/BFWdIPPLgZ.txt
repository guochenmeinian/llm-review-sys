Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a simplified attention network with shared Query and Key matrices trained using MSE loss, revealing a sharp phase transition during training. It provides a closed-form solution for training and test loss in the high-dimensional limit, demonstrating a transition from positional to semantic information based on sample complexity. The authors argue that this theoretical finding highlights the advantages of attention mechanisms over fully-connected networks when sufficient data is available.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The work contributes to understanding phase transitions in neural networks and training dynamics in transformer models, marking a significant theoretical advancement in attention mechanisms.  
- The design of the task and the properties leading to the phase transition are clearly articulated, with empirical results closely aligning with theoretical predictions.  
- The paper offers a novel theoretical analysis of self-attention, presenting a closed-form solution and demonstrating a phase shift between positional and semantic minima.

Weaknesses:  
- The reliance on the model reaching a minimum raises questions about the applicability of results to randomly initialized networks, which is a concern for studying training dynamics.  
- Certain sections, particularly 4.1 and 4.2, lack sufficient motivation or clarity, potentially limiting their audience.  
- The mathematical density of the paper may hinder comprehension for readers not well-versed in the relevant literature, and some assumptions may not clearly connect to practical language modeling.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and motivation of sections 4.1 and 4.2 to broaden their accessibility. Additionally, addressing how the results might extend to randomly initialized networks would strengthen the paper's implications for training dynamics. We also suggest that the authors clarify the practical implications of their assumptions, particularly regarding the independence of token samples and the low-rank attention model. Finally, exploring the effects of architectural changes, such as variations in the value matrix, on the phase transition could provide valuable insights.
