Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the issue of noisy gradient-based explanations stemming from high-frequency content, identifying down-sampling operations like MaxPooling as significant contributors. The authors propose FORGrad, which employs a low-pass filter on the Fourier spectrum to mitigate high-frequency noise in gradients. Empirical results demonstrate FORGrad's effectiveness across three faithfulness metrics, suggesting potential improvements to existing gradient-based explanation methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with a coherent structure that effectively presents the motivation, hypothesis, supporting evidence, and proposed solution.
- The analysis of high-frequency noise in gradients is intriguing and could inform future designs of explanation methods.
- FORGrad offers a simple yet effective solution, enhancing explainability scores and demonstrating practical applicability.

Weaknesses:
- The definition of "high frequencies" lacks clarity, particularly regarding its deployment across various model architectures and datasets, which may undermine the work's significance.
- The assertion that "high frequencies are just noise" is overly strong; the analysis does not conclusively demonstrate that high-frequency information is always irrelevant.
- Improvements introduced by FORGrad are often minor, raising questions about its genuine effectiveness versus random variation.
- The investigation of high-frequency gradient sources is limited, focusing primarily on down-sampling and training without addressing other potential factors.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the term "high frequencies" and provide a more rigorous definition applicable to various contexts. Additionally, we suggest that the authors validate their claim regarding high-frequency information by conducting further experiments to explore its relevance. To strengthen the paper, consider incorporating a broader analysis of high-frequency gradient sources beyond just down-sampling and training. Finally, we encourage the authors to include qualitative evaluations of attribution maps to complement the quantitative results and address the concerns regarding the theoretical justification of their approach.
