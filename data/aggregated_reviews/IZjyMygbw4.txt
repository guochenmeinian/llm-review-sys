### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to hallucination detection by leveraging gaze patterns as human cognitive and behavioral information. The authors create and share the first eye-tracking corpus for hallucination detection, comprising 500 instances annotated by five annotators. They demonstrate the consistency of human attention biases, introducing a cognitive-inspired deep learning framework that utilizes these biases for improved hallucination detection. However, the experimental results are primarily based on the authors' dataset, raising questions about generalizability and validation against other datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces a valuable eye-tracking corpus that may aid future research in hallucination detection.  
- The proposed method shows promise and is supported by comprehensive experiments that validate the effectiveness of human gaze patterns.  
- The identification of attention strategies, such as global and local attention, enhances the understanding of human cognitive processes in hallucination detection.  

Weaknesses:  
- The analysis section is brief and lacks depth, requiring a more thorough examination of the findings.  
- The reliance on a small dataset of 500 instances raises concerns about the generalizability and statistical significance of the results.  
- The experimental results lack detailed analysis, and the explanations for baseline comparisons are overly simplistic.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis section to provide a more comprehensive examination of their findings. Additionally, consider validating the proposed method on external datasets to enhance reliability. Clarifying the differences between the proposed dataset and existing datasets in Section 5.1.3 would strengthen the paper. We also suggest conducting more detailed ablation studies to better understand the contributions of global and local attention. Finally, revising figures for clarity and visual appeal would enhance the overall presentation of the paper.
