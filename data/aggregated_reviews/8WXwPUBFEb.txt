### Key Points
This paper presents a method to address the reading order issue in Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks on visually rich documents (VRD) through token path prediction (TPP). The authors propose a reading order invariant labeling scheme that treats tokens as nodes in a graph, allowing for improved entity extraction. They revise existing datasets (FUNSD and CORD) to better reflect OCR errors and demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors provide a thorough analysis of challenges in VRD recognition tasks and propose a novel solution that outperforms existing benchmarks.
- The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations and vivid examples, making it accessible even to less-informed readers.
- The evaluation of the proposed method is compelling, showing substantial improvements across various tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments are conducted solely on revised datasets, limiting fair comparisons with existing methods.
- Practical impact of TPP may be constrained, as entity continuity rates remain relatively high even in modified datasets.
- Potential data leakage concerns arise from using the original CORD dataset for training TPP.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison of their model's performance on original datasets to provide a clearer context for their results. Additionally, we suggest addressing the potential data leakage issue in TPP training and clarifying the discrepancies in performance metrics related to preprocessing methods. Finally, please ensure that the continuation of the sentence in line 1021 is added to the appendix for completeness.
