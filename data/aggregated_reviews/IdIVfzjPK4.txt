Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework for graph anomaly detection called ARC, which is designed to detect anomalies across various graph datasets without the need for dataset-specific training. The authors propose a "one-for-all" model that utilizes in-context learning with few-shot normal samples during inference. The methodology includes a smoothness-based feature alignment module, an ego-neighbor residual graph encoder, and a cross-attentive in-context anomaly scoring module. The paper is well-motivated, with extensive experiments validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The setting of generalist graph anomaly detection is both interesting and novel, addressing significant practical challenges.
2. The discussion on feature smoothness and abnormality is insightful and may inspire future research.
3. The method is carefully designed with three powerful modules that effectively capture anomaly-aware knowledge.
4. Experimental results demonstrate a significant performance advantage over baseline methods.
5. The visualization of the attention module's working mechanism is engaging.

Weaknesses:
1. Methodological details are lacking, particularly regarding the specific feature projection method used in the experiments.
2. Definitions for single-class normal and multi-class normal concepts are missing, hindering understanding of design motivations.
3. Some figures, particularly Figure 2, lack readability and would benefit from additional annotations.
4. The claim of detecting anomalies without training on specific target data lacks solid theoretical support.
5. The reliance on few-shot normal samples for in-context learning may pose challenges in highly anomalous environments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology by specifying the type of feature projection method used. Additionally, definitions for single-class normal and multi-class normal should be included to enhance reader comprehension. We suggest enhancing Figure 2 with more annotations for better readability. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide a more robust theoretical analysis to support the claim of generalizability without dataset-specific training. Lastly, addressing the challenges related to the reliance on few-shot normal samples in practical scenarios would strengthen the paper.
