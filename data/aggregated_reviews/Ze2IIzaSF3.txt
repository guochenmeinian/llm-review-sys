### Key Points
This paper presents a novel adversarial framework called "HiddenTables" for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in table question answering (QA) tasks without exposing full table content. The key components include an "Oracle" agent that holds the table data and a "Solver" agent that generates executable Python code based on schema and natural language instructions from the Oracle. The framework aims to enhance privacy and efficiency while analyzing LLM limitations in table QA, supported by a new dataset, PyQTax, with 116k samples linking questions to Python code.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The idea of restricting table access to test language understanding is insightful and well-motivated.
- Thorough experiments across diverse datasets validate the utility of HiddenTables.
- The framework allows large-scale testing of LLMs on datasets not feasible with standard approaches, enhancing privacy.

Weaknesses:
- Significant accuracy degradation on complex questions under HiddenTables needs further analysis to identify Solver struggles.
- Uncertainty exists regarding whether privacy and efficiency gains outweigh accuracy losses; a discussion on this tradeoff is necessary.
- The scalability of the Oracle-Solver conversation protocol requires more analysis, particularly for high query volumes.
- The absence of meaningful baselines limits the understanding of the proposed system's effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of accuracy by providing a detailed breakdown based on table size and question complexity, identifying where the Solver struggles most. Additionally, a comparison of accuracy results with full table exposure should be included to quantify the privacy/efficiency versus accuracy tradeoff. The authors should also analyze the scalability of the iterative Oracle/Solver conversation protocol and clarify the Secure Interpreter's functionality to ensure reproducibility. Finally, incorporating additional baselines, including a non-interactive ChatGPT and a full information baseline, would enhance the understanding of the proposed system's performance.
