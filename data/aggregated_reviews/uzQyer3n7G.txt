### Key Points
This paper presents SPEAR, a structure-preserving graph backdoor attack that manipulates node attributes to implant triggers while maintaining the graph structure, thereby enhancing stealthiness and effectiveness. The authors propose a methodology that includes selective node poisoning, global feature importance, and a neighborhood-aware trigger generator. Extensive experiments demonstrate high attack success rates, the ability to bypass robust models, and the preservation of accuracy on clean data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a novel graph backdoor method capable of bypassing current defenses through structure-preserving manipulation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
2. SPEAR adapts graph backdoor attacks to scenarios with significant feature sensitivity, such as fraud detection, refining the existing graph backdoor pipeline.
3. A comprehensive set of baselines is presented, covering various attacks and defenses integrated with different test models, effectively demonstrating the proposed method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. The exposition of global feature importance in Section 4.3, particularly Equation (10), is insufficient given its critical role.
2. While the dataset selection shows size diversity, including a broader range of datasets would enhance the evaluation of robustness and transferability.
3. The claim in Section 4.4 regarding optimal performance under shared architectural and parametric configurations lacks direct experimental proof, potentially undermining its solidity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the exposition of global feature importance in Section 4.3 to clarify its significance. Additionally, including a wider variety of datasets would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of SPEAR's robustness and transferability. We also suggest that the authors provide direct experimental proof for the claims made in Section 4.4 regarding optimal performance. Furthermore, addressing the sensitivity of attack performance to different surrogate models and testing SPEAR on other widely-used graph datasets would strengthen the findings. Lastly, discussing the computational complexity of SPEAR's trigger generation process would clarify its feasibility for large-scale graphs.
