Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to safe reinforcement learning (RL) by introducing the Unified Trajectory-Level Textual Constraints Translator (U3T), which models diverse real-world safety requirements through universal natural language constraints. The authors propose a system that includes a trajectory encoder and a text encoder trained jointly using a contrastive loss based on KL-divergence. U3T addresses cost sparsity by identifying actions or states contributing to constraint violations via an attention mechanism. Experimental results indicate that U3T can accurately predict trajectory violations and that policies trained with this method exhibit improved safety.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. U3T's broad applicability allows it to model diverse constraint requirements across various environments, enhancing its utility compared to traditional methods.
2. The approach is novel, effectively addressing the challenge of natural language constrained reinforcement learning through multimodal alignment and integrating a credit assignment component.
3. U3T automates constraint handling and cost allocation, reducing reliance on manually designed cost functions and improving system flexibility.
4. Empirical results demonstrate that policies trained with U3T achieve lower violation rates than those using standard cost functions.

Weaknesses:
1. The complexity and computational cost of implementing U3T may be significant, particularly for large-scale datasets or real-time applications.
2. The paper lacks specificity regarding the text encoder model used in experiments, which could hinder reproducibility.
3. Effective implementation of U3T is heavily dependent on high-quality, well-annotated textual and trajectory data, which may be difficult to obtain.
4. There are concerns about the soundness of the approach, particularly regarding the ambiguity of natural language constraints and the lack of a clear ground truth for constraint verification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the text encoder model used in the experiments and provide a rationale for its selection. Additionally, we suggest that the authors experimentally analyze the inference speed of the proposed framework to address computational concerns. It would be beneficial to elaborate on the relationship between average reward and cost results, as well as clarify the average trajectory length used in the experiments to address potential context bottlenecks. Finally, we encourage the authors to discuss the integration of large language models to enhance the understanding of complex textual constraints.
