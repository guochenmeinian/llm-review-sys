Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Adaptive Passive-Aggressive online regression framework with Side Information (APAS) that addresses limitations of traditional Passive-Aggressive (PA) methods, particularly in selecting optimal thresholds and adapting to complex scenarios with additional metrics. The authors propose an efficient implementation using Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) and provide regret bounds for non-convex loss functions. The algorithm is validated through numerical experiments demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving low tracking error and high returns compared to traditional PA methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The integration of side information into the PA framework and adaptive threshold selection effectively addresses existing method limitations.  
2. The theoretical analysis and experimental validation demonstrate the robustness of APAS.  
3. The paper is well-structured and presents a clear problem formulation.  
4. The proposed method shows a reasonable tradeoff between tracking accuracy and enhancing monetary returns.

Weaknesses:  
1. Clarity remains a significant issue, particularly regarding the motivations for the threshold-update techniques and the definition of the objective function in regret guarantees.  
2. The introduction of side-information regularization is abrupt and lacks sufficient motivation.  
3. The mathematical derivations could benefit from more intuitive explanations.  
4. The paper does not adequately discuss the implications of results or compare them with related work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing more intuitive explanations for mathematical derivations and theoretical concepts. Additionally, the authors should address the motivations behind the use of PA-online regression with an adaptive threshold and the abrupt introduction of side-information regularization. It would be beneficial to include an explicit section on limitations, discussing assumptions and potential negative societal impacts. Furthermore, we suggest conducting experiments with various types of side information to evaluate their effects on time complexity and tracking error, as well as providing insights into the choice of the trade-off parameter lambda and its impact on performance.
