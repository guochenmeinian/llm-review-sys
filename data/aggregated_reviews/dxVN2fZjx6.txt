Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical framework for learning SO(3) equivariant representations from 2D images, proposing an induction layer that maps features to a spherical signal. The authors evaluate their method on PASCAL3D+ and SYMSOL datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness for pose estimation tasks. The paper also discusses the general form of H-equivariant linear maps and their application to SO(2)-SO(3) settings, showing improved performance in specific tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation for equivariant mappings from 2D to 3D.
- The proposed framework extends to 6D pose estimation and has potential implications for various 2D-to-3D learning tasks.
- Empirical results are convincing, especially with limited training data.

Weaknesses:
- The implementation details are insufficiently elaborated, leaving unclear connections between theory and practice.
- There is a lack of experimental analysis, such as visualizations and ablation studies, to validate the proposed method's effectiveness.
- The performance of the proposed method does not consistently surpass existing methods, raising concerns about its claimed advantages.
- The paper does not adequately address the limitations of single-view pose estimation and its applicability to multi-view scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the implementation section by providing more detailed explanations of how to construct the induction layer and its connection to the theoretical framework. Additionally, including visualizations and ablation studies would strengthen the empirical validation of the proposed method. The authors should also clarify the limitations of their approach, particularly regarding its performance in multi-view scenarios, and consider expanding the theoretical framework to encompass more general application settings beyond SO(2)-SO(3). Lastly, addressing the performance discrepancies with existing methods and providing analyses of failure cases would enhance the paper's credibility.
