Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel mechanism called ReMaX for training efficient panoptic segmentation frameworks, introducing relaxation techniques for mask and class predictions. The authors demonstrate that these techniques can consistently enhance performance across various datasets, including COCO, ADE20K, and Cityscapes. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results, particularly with the R50 backbone, where ReMax-M reaches 49.1 PQ and 51.9 FPS. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The results are impressive, particularly with the R50 backbone, achieving significant performance metrics.  
2. The paper is well-written, with a clear motivation and reasonable methodology.  
3. The proposed relaxation techniques (ReMask and ReClass) effectively address the issue of excessive false-positive loss in training.  
4. The method shows consistent improvements and is compatible with multiple existing approaches.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The generalization of the proposed training mechanism needs further demonstration across various frameworks beyond kMax-DeepLab.  
2. Some experimental results are unconvincing, and the design appears too coupled with mask transformers.  
3. The paper lacks in-depth discussions on the qualitative impact of false-positive loss on final results.  
4. Error bars are not reported, and the manuscript requires non-linear reading effort due to unclear definitions and missing equations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalization of the proposed method by demonstrating its effectiveness on additional frameworks such as Mask2Former, YOSO, and Panoptic DeepLab. We also suggest providing a more thorough discussion on the novelty of the ReMask technique and its contributions compared to existing methods. Additionally, clarifying the balance between Lpan and Lose, and including error bars in the results would enhance the paper's rigor. Lastly, addressing the readability issues by defining terms and providing a bird's-eye view figure would benefit the manuscript.
