Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a static analysis technique for probabilistic programming languages that annotates random variables with metadata to characterize their tail behavior using generalized Gamma distributions. The authors demonstrate that these distributions are closed under various operations, enabling an algebra that infers tail behavior throughout probabilistic programs, including posterior distributions. At runtime, neural splice flows initialized to the inferred Gamma distributions estimate random variables, ensuring correct tail behavior while allowing flexibility for the bulk of the probability mass. The approach shows improved performance in density estimation tasks compared to conventional methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant problem in probabilistic programming.
- The static analysis method for tail behavior is novel and competently executed, utilizing newly derived theoretical results.
- The combination of inferred Gamma distribution parameters with neural splice flows is innovative, maintaining correct tail behavior while allowing flexible bulk estimation.
- Encouraging experimental results are provided across various tasks, including density estimation and Bayesian linear regression.
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with detailed derivations in the appendix.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental models are somewhat small; larger programs would better demonstrate the method's robustness.
- The paper does not address certain limitations, such as log-normal tails and operations between dependent variables, which should be highlighted with applicable complex models.
- The guarantees and assumptions of the static analysis are not clearly stated, particularly regarding operations involving reciprocals, exponentials, and logarithms.
- The description of the probabilistic programming language lacks comprehensiveness, and the independence assumption may restrict the applicability of the approach.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the guarantees and assumptions of the static analysis by presenting them as a self-contained theorem, particularly concerning the composition of operations. Additionally, elaborating on why normalizing flows do not affect tails in section 3.3 would strengthen the paper. Including larger experimental models would demonstrate the robustness of the method, and a more comprehensive description of the probabilistic programming language is necessary. Finally, addressing the limitations regarding the independence assumption and its implications for practical applications should be prioritized.
