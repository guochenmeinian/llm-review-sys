Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method called Scattered Online Inference (SOI) aimed at reducing the computational complexity of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by reusing partial states from previous inferences. SOI employs techniques such as strided convolution, transposed convolution, and skip connections to achieve significant reductions in computational cost while maintaining model performance. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of SOI through extensive experiments in tasks like speech separation and acoustic scene classification, achieving notable reductions in computational costs with minimal performance loss.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed SOI method effectively reduces computational complexity in CNNs, showcasing originality in its approach.
- Extensive experiments validate the method's effectiveness, achieving a 64.4% reduction in computational cost for speech separation with only a 9.8% decrease in SI-SNRi.
- The writing is clear and well-structured, making complex concepts accessible, and the method is applicable to resource-constrained environments.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation lacks clarity, particularly regarding the explanation of STMC and the mathematical formulation, which is poorly described.
- There is no theoretical justification for the computational complexity reduction, making it challenging to assess the accuracy-complexity trade-off.
- The method's robustness across different network configurations is questionable, and the evaluation is limited to specific tasks, lacking generalizability.
- The paper does not adequately discuss the sensitivity of SOI's performance to hyperparameters or provide a detailed quantitative analysis of trade-offs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by providing a thorough explanation of STMC and enhancing the mathematical formulation, including clearer formulae and better references to figures. Additionally, we suggest including a theoretical analysis of the computational complexity reduction to facilitate understanding of the trade-offs involved. Expanding the evaluation to include diverse tasks and datasets would strengthen the claims regarding SOI's applicability. Furthermore, a detailed implementation guide or open-sourcing the code could enhance reproducibility, and conducting a sensitivity analysis on hyperparameters would provide valuable insights for users.
