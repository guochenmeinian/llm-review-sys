Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the vector-valued regression problem, aiming to output an estimator $\hat{f}$ that minimizes the expected squared error between $\hat{f}(x)$ and the optimal regressor $f^{\star}(x)$. The authors propose using spectral regularization methods, including Tikhonov regularization, hard-thresholding, and iteration filters. They demonstrate that the ridge estimator fails to leverage the higher-order smoothness of $f^{\star}$, while other spectral estimators can exploit this smoothness. The manuscript also identifies inaccuracies in previous works and provides a rigorous confirmation of the saturation effect in ridge regression for infinite-dimensional output spaces.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively extends non-parametric regression results to potentially infinite-dimensional output spaces, providing a solid theoretical foundation.
- It rigorously introduces vector-valued RKHS and discusses the smoothness of target functions using interpolation spaces.
- The authors clarify the contributions, making advancements in the field accessible.

Weaknesses:
- The proof of Theorem 4 is fully deferred to the Appendix, and a high-level proof sketch in the main text would enhance reader comprehension.
- The results, while novel, follow expected lines in non-parametric regression, and the distinction between this work and previous literature could be more clearly articulated.
- The manuscript lacks a final section summarizing contributions and discussing future directions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions compared to previous works, particularly regarding the differences with [1] and [2]. Additionally, including a high-level proof sketch for Theorem 4 in the main text would aid reader understanding. It would also be beneficial to summarize the contributions and potential future directions in a concluding section. Lastly, consider elaborating on the unique challenges posed by the vector-valued setting, especially concerning the (EVD+) condition and the implications of the saturation effect.
