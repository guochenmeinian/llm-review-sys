Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach, HQA-Attack, for generating high-quality adversarial samples aimed at improving the robustness of machine learning models, particularly through black-box hard-label adversarial attacks on textual data. The authors utilize iterative word substitution with synonyms to enhance the quality of adversarial samples and validate their method through experiments on various NLP datasets and commercial APIs. The paper outlines a three-step process: random initialization, sequential word substitution, and a final optimization step to enhance quality. The authors argue that both black-box and white-box adversarial attacks are essential for understanding vulnerabilities in AI security, emphasizing that black-box attacks simulate real-world scenarios where attackers have limited knowledge of the target model.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and addresses an important research problem in adversarial attacks on text.
- The experimental design is comprehensive, including evaluations on multiple datasets and real-world APIs, which supports the practicality of the proposed method.
- The methodology is solid, with a clear structure and effective techniques for optimizing adversarial examples.
- The paper effectively discusses the significance of black-box attacks in simulating real-world attack scenarios and evaluating model vulnerabilities.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical analysis is lacking, particularly regarding the number of queries and computational complexity, which is essential for a top conference like NeurIPS.
- The fluency of the generated sentences is not adequately considered, potentially affecting the quality of the adversarial samples.
- There is limited novelty in the proposed approach compared to existing methods, as it primarily optimizes the reverse searching process.
- The complexity of the proposed algorithm raises concerns about its practical applicability in real-world attacks, which often do not require complicated pipelines.
- The evaluation lacks human annotation, which is critical for assessing the validity of adversarial samples, as automatic metrics may not capture semantic changes.
- The research significance is questioned, as the proposed method does not seem to offer new theoretical insights or direct practical applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis of their method, particularly regarding the number of queries and computational complexity, to enhance its rigor. Additionally, the authors should consider incorporating human evaluations to assess the quality of adversarial examples more effectively. It would also be beneficial to clarify the novelty of the word back-substitution component and provide more qualitative results to illustrate the improvements in adversarial example quality. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors address the concerns regarding the complexity of their method by comparing it with existing heuristic attacks that are more query-efficient. Finally, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind their proposed algorithm, emphasizing its practical applications and theoretical contributions, and discuss and cite relevant literature to strengthen the context of their work.
