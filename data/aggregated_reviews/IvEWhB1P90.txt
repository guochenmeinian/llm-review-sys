Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to Probabilistically Robust Learning (PRL) that identifies a flaw in the original PRL framework, where misclassified samples could be attacked correctly by adversaries, inadvertently decreasing the loss. The authors propose a regularization scheme based on a notion of probabilistic perimeter and introduce a revised loss function that applies the PRL loss only to correctly classified points while using the standard Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) loss for misclassified points. The authors provide theoretical results that generalize losses used in probabilistic robustness, demonstrate the existence of solutions for their minimization problems, and initiate a theory of limiting cases for these generalizations. Empirical results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show that their method achieves competitive clean accuracy while enhancing adversarial robustness, performing similarly to the previously proposed CVaR method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- **New generalizations of probabilistic robustness:** The paper rigorously analyzes the framework of probabilistic robustness, offering a novel interpretation through the perimeter-based perspective, akin to the relationship between TRADES and vanilla adversarial training. 
- **Existence of solutions:** The existence proofs are innovative and particularly interesting, especially the surprising connection between the CVaR problem and a generalized perimeter problem in Theorem 6.
- **Clarity of writing:** The writing quality is generally strong and effectively communicates the differences between various loss functions.

Weaknesses:  
- **Contributions:** The first claimed contribution regarding the flaw in PRL lacks clarity. The authors need to articulate which property PRL is missing, explain why this constitutes a flaw, and demonstrate how their method addresses it. The supposed flaw is not well-defined, particularly regarding the non-negative functional and "spike-like" regions. Additionally, the final contribution's claim that the new method enhances adversarial robustness is not convincingly supported by experimental results.
- **Practical implications:** The practical implications of considering misclassified examples in the PRL loss are unclear, particularly regarding their impact on clean accuracy and adversarial robustness, especially given the contrasting results on MNIST and CIFAR datasets. The empirical evaluation could be strengthened by including datasets with more challenging data points, as the high accuracy in MNIST limits the number of misclassified examples. Furthermore, the reviewer finds it challenging to assess the correctness and relevance of the existence results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their claims regarding the flaw in PRL by explicitly defining the missing property, justifying why it is a flaw, and demonstrating how their perimeter-based method addresses it. The authors should also clarify the definitions and implications of "spike-like" regions and label probabilities in their figures. Additionally, we suggest improving the discussion on the practical implications of misclassified examples in the PRL loss, particularly how this affects clean accuracy and adversarial robustness in real-world scenarios. Evaluating their method on larger datasets, such as ImageNet, would provide a more robust empirical foundation. Clarifying the context of Eq. (4) regarding the ground truth labels and defining $\mathcal{A}$ in line 55 would enhance the paper's clarity. Lastly, we encourage the authors to consider their work as an extension of the PRL framework rather than merely addressing a flaw, and to refine the illustrations in Figure 1 for better clarity, possibly by adopting the approach used in [Robey 2022].
