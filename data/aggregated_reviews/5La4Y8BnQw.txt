Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents tailored algorithms for solving Wasserstein distributionally robust Markov Decision Processes (WDRMDPs) with fast implementations based on $L_1$, $L_2$, and $L_\infty$-based Wasserstein distances. The authors propose a computationally efficient solution framework that decomposes the optimization problem involved in distributionally robust Bellman updates, achieving quasi-linear complexity in the number of states and actions. The paper demonstrates that the proposed algorithms outperform prior works in terms of computational efficiency and provides numerical experiments to support these claims.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The algorithms are the fastest in terms of dependency on the number of kernels, states, and actions for solving WDRMDPs.  
- The paper is clear, concise, and presents a significant problem in the literature of distributionally robust MDPs.  
- The proposed method exhibits state-of-the-art complexity results and shows convincing experimental performance compared to prior algorithms.  

Weaknesses:  
- The application of the proposed framework is somewhat limited due to its reliance on the specific structure of the Wasserstein ambiguity set.  
- The WDRMDP problem itself is not novel, and some results appear incremental or obvious, with certain technical contributions lacking originality.  
- The experiments are conducted on simple, randomly generated MDPs, which may oversimplify the problem and limit real-world applicability.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental validation by including comparisons with more diverse and realistic baselines, particularly addressing the performance of solving equations (5) and (8) through convex optimization versus the proposed approach. Additionally, the authors should clarify the implications of the rectangularity assumption and explore the extension of their methods to non-rectangular settings. It would also be beneficial to discuss the limitations of the proposed method more thoroughly and address the potential trade-offs between computational complexity and accuracy introduced by the problem decomposition in Section 4.
