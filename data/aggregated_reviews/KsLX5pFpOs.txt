### Key Points
This paper presents a synthesis of three notions of fair clustering: proportional fairness, individual fairness, and transferable core. The authors demonstrate that approximate proportional fairness implies both approximate individual fairness and transferable core, and vice versa. They introduce metric adaptations of justified representation (mJR) and proportional justified representation (mPJR) from approval-based committee selection, showing that these concepts imply approximations of the aforementioned fair clustering notions. The paper also discusses the implications of mPJR for the q-core in contexts where agents measure cost by distance to the qâ€™th most distant center. Additionally, it extends existing algorithms to handle an infinite number of center candidates while preserving small constant approximations of fairness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper effectively connects various fair clustering desiderata, providing a comprehensive survey that clarifies the state of the field for future research. It establishes a formal link between fair approval-based committee selection and clustering, enhancing understanding of fairness in these contexts. The writing is clear, and the results are well-supported by formal arguments, with illustrative examples and a well-structured discussion of related work.

Weaknesses:  
The work is largely incremental, focusing on relationships between previously studied notions of fairness, which may limit its impact. The algorithmic contributions are somewhat constrained, primarily tightening existing guarantees rather than introducing novel algorithms. Additionally, there are minor issues in clarity, such as the confusing visualization in Fig 1 and the need for a more comprehensive discussion on limitations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the asymmetry in theoretical results, particularly regarding individual and proportional fairness. Clarifying the visualization in Fig 1 would enhance understanding, specifically by explaining the relationship between the alphas. Additionally, we suggest including a more comprehensive discussion on the limitations of the work and exploring the potential transferability of results to settings where cluster centers are not part of the data, as in k-means algorithms. Finally, discussing the practical applications of the work in fair clustering contexts would provide valuable insights into decision-making processes and the implications of different fairness definitions.
