### Key Points
This paper surveys recent developments in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, focusing on semantic shift where samples originate from unknown categories. The authors propose a taxonomy based on the availability of in-domain and out-of-domain data, providing a comprehensive overview of various approaches, datasets, metrics, and applications. The paper aims to serve as a useful resource for researchers new to the field.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is clearly written and organized with a meaningful taxonomy.
- It covers a large body of recent work and provides insightful discussions on future research directions.

Weaknesses:
- The survey lacks empirical results, making it unclear for newcomers to determine where to start.
- It does not address non-semantic shifts, which are relevant in real-world scenarios.
- The discussion on datasets and metrics is insufficient, lacking a standardized benchmark and pros/cons analysis.
- The taxonomy is not well-aligned with previous surveys, and the comparison between methods is superficial.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including empirical results to clarify which methods perform better under different conditions. Additionally, a more detailed discussion of the limitations and pros/cons of existing approaches is necessary, particularly in Section 6.1. We suggest enhancing the comparison between CV and NLP methods to provide deeper insights. Furthermore, we advise the authors to align their taxonomy with previous surveys and to consider including a table that summarizes the studies in Section 3 for better accessibility. Lastly, addressing the questions raised regarding the necessity of labeled OOD data and the role of OOD detection in structured prediction tasks would strengthen the paper.
