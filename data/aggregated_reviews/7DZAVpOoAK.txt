Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method, MeCo, aimed at defending against depth function preserving model extraction (DFME) attacks by introducing data-dependent random perturbations to input data. The authors claim that MeCo effectively reduces the accuracy of cloned models while preserving the utility of the target model. The approach is evaluated across several datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing defense strategies in terms of effectiveness, computational efficiency, and memory usage. Additionally, the paper proposes a defense called DRO, which perturbs input images to manipulate class probabilities, evaluated against multiple datasets and baseline approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The extensive experiments and clear presentation of results highlight the quality of the work.
2. The originality of the proposed methods, MeCo and DRO, is notable, with both approaches demonstrating effectiveness and efficiency in defending against DFME attacks.
3. The paper is well-organized, providing a satisfactory analysis of existing research and the problems in the field.

Weaknesses:
1. The evaluation is limited to smaller datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MNIST), raising concerns about the model's extensibility to larger datasets.
2. The lack of theoretical support for the proposed methods is a significant limitation, as is the insufficient consideration of the impact on the performance of the target model.
3. The optimization setup for DRO is unclear, particularly regarding the objective formulation and the fixed perturbation budget, which may not generalize well to novel attacks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis of their proposed methods to provide a deeper understanding of their mechanisms. Additionally, conducting experiments on larger datasets would enhance the generalizability of the results. Clarifying the DRO optimization objective and addressing the concerns regarding the perturbation budget would also strengthen the paper. Finally, a more detailed discussion on the potential negative social impacts of the proposed approach would be beneficial.
