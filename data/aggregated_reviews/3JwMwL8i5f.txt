Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a multi-resolution network for diffusion models, enhancing image generation by addressing image distortion through a combination of transformer and convolutional blocks. The authors introduce a time-dependent layer normalization technique to improve model performance while reducing parameters compared to AdaLN in DiT. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on ImageNet, with FID scores of 1.70 and 2.89 for ImageNet 256 and 512, respectively.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of a multi-resolution structure effectively addresses image distortion caused by varying patch sizes, balancing computational complexity and model performance.
- The multi-branch architecture and multi-resolution loss contribute significantly to the learning process, demonstrating SoTA FID scores through quantitative and qualitative results.
- The time-dependent layer normalization is a simplified and efficient alternative to AdaLN, enhancing parameter efficiency.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a discussion comparing the proposed method with cascaded methods like "Cascaded diffusion models" and "Matryoshka diffusion models."
- Table 1 should include recent SoTA methods like MDTv2 and PaGoDA for a comprehensive overview.
- The proposed multi-scale diffusion loss is also found in SimpleDiffusion, necessitating a discussion of differences.
- The design lacks interconnections between low-resolution and high-resolution branches, and the authors should consider implementing skip-connections.
- The method's distortion rates remain a concern, particularly due to the use of strided convolution at the start of each branch.
- The paper does not clarify the performance implications of using AdaLN-Zero with the multi-branch architecture.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of their method in relation to cascaded diffusion models to highlight its advantages. Additionally, updating Table 1 with the latest SoTA methods will provide a clearer context. The authors should clarify the differences between their multi-scale diffusion loss and that of SimpleDiffusion. We encourage the authors to explore the implementation of skip-connections across branches to enhance interconnections. Furthermore, addressing the reasons behind the distortion rates and the performance of AdaLN-Zero in Table 2 will strengthen the paper. Lastly, including a comparison of sampling speeds with baselines will provide valuable insights into the model's efficiency.
