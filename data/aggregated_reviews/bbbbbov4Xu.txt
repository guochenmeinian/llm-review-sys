Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for 3D instance segmentation by leveraging pre-trained 2D instance segmentation models, introducing a method called Contrastive Lift. The authors propose a scalable slow-fast clustering objective function that allows for segmenting an unlimited number of objects. Additionally, they create a synthetic dataset, Messi Rooms, which includes up to 500 objects, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods on both public datasets and their new dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed scheme for addressing instance label ambiguity is innovative.  
- The paper is well-written and presents a technically sound method that achieves state-of-the-art performance.  
- The introduction of the Messi Rooms dataset provides a valuable benchmark for future research.  
- The contrastive momentum-teacher loss is computationally efficient compared to the Hungarian-algorithm-based loss.  

Weaknesses:  
- The notation used in the paper is occasionally confusing and deviates from established conventions.  
- The evaluation metrics are limited, focusing solely on PQ^scene^, which may not provide a comprehensive comparison.  
- There is insufficient discussion on the complexity of the proposed method and its potential impacts.  
- The paper lacks ablation studies on different 2D segmenters and does not adequately analyze their results.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their notation to align with standard conventions, particularly regarding the representation of mappings and functions. Additionally, we suggest including a broader range of evaluation metrics beyond PQ^scene^ to provide a more comprehensive assessment of performance. The authors should also discuss the complexity of their method and its implications more thoroughly. Furthermore, we encourage the inclusion of ablation studies on various 2D segmenters to strengthen the analysis of their approach. Lastly, clarifying the random partitioning of pixels and the determination of the ground plane in the Messi Rooms dataset would enhance the paper's transparency.
