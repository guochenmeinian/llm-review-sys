### Key Points
This paper presents methods for detecting coordinated activity on Twitter, utilizing datasets from verified information operations across six countries and employing various graph analysis techniques. The authors propose a novel approach that combines user similarity networks with node pruning based on eigencentrality, demonstrating that this method often outperforms traditional edge filtering. The study aims to enhance understanding of influence campaigns on social media.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Utilizes large-scale datasets from multiple countries.
- Investigates various graph analysis techniques to identify coordinated activity.
- Proposes a novel framework that shows promising results in detecting information operations.

Weaknesses:
- The control dataset does not align with the activity patterns of the information operations dataset, raising concerns about the validity of comparisons.
- The method for inferring optimized parameters is unclear, and the selection process needs clarification.
- The approach may misidentify popular users as information operation drivers due to their high connectivity.
- The creation of the control group lacks sufficient justification, particularly regarding the adequacy of using only 100 tweets and the verification of bot-like behaviors.
- The mathematical implications of using cosine similarity in centrality measures are not adequately explained.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the alignment of the control dataset with the information operations dataset to ensure comparability. Specifically, subsampling could be employed to match activity levels between the two datasets. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the process for inferring optimized parameters in Section 5.1 and discussing whether this selection contributes to the paper's novelty. Furthermore, the authors should address how their method in Section 5.2 distinguishes between influencers and information operation drivers, as well as provide more details on the structure and properties of the similarity graphs. Lastly, we encourage the authors to consider the generalizability of their methods to other social media platforms and to acknowledge prior work on the datasets used.
