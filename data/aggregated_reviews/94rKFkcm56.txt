Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a version of the 2-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm, termed d-DRFWL(2), which restricts the distance between nodes in processed node tuples. The authors propose a graph neural network (GNN) based on this restriction, investigating its capability to count cycles and other substructures. The proposed algorithm demonstrates efficiency in counting 6-cycles while maintaining lower time and memory complexities compared to traditional methods. Additionally, the paper provides a detailed analysis of the expressiveness of the d-DRFWL(2) model compared to FWL(2) and δ-k-LWL, highlighting a strict separation in their capabilities. The authors establish that d-DRFWL(2) loses information from distant 2-tuples due to its localized representation, while FWL(2) captures global information. The implications of increasing d and k on expressiveness and running time are discussed, noting the complex relationship between d and classification accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well written and clearly structured, effectively presenting the problem, goal, and motivation.  
- The proposed algorithm is the most efficient known model for counting 6-cycles, with time and memory complexities of \(O(n\mathrm{deg}^4)\) and \(O(n\mathrm{deg}^2)\), respectively.  
- The authors provide comprehensive theoretical and empirical analyses, enhancing the paper's robustness.  
- The distinction between d-DRFWL(2) and other models is clearly articulated, particularly regarding their update rules and complexity.  
- Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets yield convincing results, supporting the theoretical claims and providing valuable insights into the cycle counting power of d-DRFWL(2) for larger d values.

Weaknesses:  
- The description of the main contribution, d-DRFWL(2), lacks clarity, particularly regarding what information is updated and how, necessitating clearer illustrations and explanations.  
- The expressiveness comparison with other models is not fully addressed, which may leave gaps in understanding.  
- The theoretical investigation should be extended to relate the approach to k-WL and δ-k-LWL.  
- The unexpected performance degradation of the model on certain datasets remains unexplained.  
- The efficiency of the method is limited to sparse graphs, and it does not perform well on larger datasets, such as those with sizes \(O(100)\).  
- There is a lack of baseline comparisons with other higher-order GNNs, which raises questions about the proposed method's relative performance and efficiency.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the description of d-DRFWL(2) by providing more precise explanations and illustrations. Additionally, the authors should extend the theoretical investigation to clarify the relationship between their approach and k-WL and δ-k-LWL. We suggest including a more thorough analysis of d-DRFWL(2) against other expressiveness hierarchies and incorporating theoretical and empirical findings related to the cycle counting power for \(d \geq 3\) in the main text or appendices. To address the performance issues on the ogbg-molpcba dataset, we encourage the authors to conduct further tuning and provide explanations for the observed discrepancies. Finally, it is crucial to compare the proposed method against other higher-order GNNs to establish its performance and efficiency more clearly.
