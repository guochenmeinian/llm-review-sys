### Key Points
This paper explores the hypothesis that large language models (LLMs) contain a generalizable representation of the truth or falsity of statements. The authors propose a method called SAPLMA, utilizing hidden layer activations to classify the truthfulness of statements generated by LLMs. They create a dataset of true/false factual statements across six topics, achieving approximately 70% accuracy on held-out topics, significantly outperforming few-shot prompting and classifiers trained on BERT embeddings. The study provides evidence that LLMs encode factuality-related information, even when generating nonfactual text.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a critical issue regarding false information generated by LLMs.
- It presents a practical method for detecting false statements, supported by thorough experiments across various conditions.
- The organization and narrative of the paper are clear, enhancing comprehension.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation is limited to a single dataset and model, raising concerns about generalizability.
- The dataset construction details are insufficiently explained, and the scope is restricted to simple factoid sentences.
- The classifier architecture appears arbitrary, lacking hyperparameter tuning and comprehensive analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset construction section by providing detailed information on the sources and methods used. Additionally, conducting experiments on larger models like GPT-175B or LLaMA-65B would clarify the transferability of findings. We suggest including a broader range of baselines to strengthen comparisons and addressing the unclear design decisions highlighted in the reviews. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore the causal relationship between the extracted information and model behavior, potentially through linear probes or amnesic probing experiments.
