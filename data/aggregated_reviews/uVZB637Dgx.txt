### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of knowledge distillation, specifically focusing on the transfer of 'knowledge' from larger teacher models to smaller student models. The authors propose a comparative analysis of various methods, including KL divergence of soft outputs, Jacobian matching, and contrastive representation learning, assessing their effectiveness in transferring mechanisms and addressing simplicity bias. The study evaluates these methods across different modalities, specifically images and text, and highlights the implications of loss terms on performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper robustly explores various methods, providing a comprehensive view of their effectiveness in knowledge transfer.  
- It offers nuanced insights into how different loss terms affect performance based on dataset and modality, enhancing the depth of analysis.  
- The discussion on simplicity bias is commendable, detailing its implications in the knowledge distillation process.  

Weaknesses:  
- The analysis of trade-offs, such as computational costs and KL divergence, lacks structure and detail, which would improve comprehensiveness.  
- Section 4 presents challenges in clarity, with poorly explained datasets, tasks, and evaluation protocols, making results difficult to interpret.  
- Tables and figures contain several abbreviations that are not well defined, complicating understanding.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental setup to facilitate better evaluation of findings. An extended discussion on the role and impact of various loss terms, providing deeper insights into their effectiveness across different scenarios, would enhance the paper. Additionally, verifying typos and misspellings would improve overall presentation.
