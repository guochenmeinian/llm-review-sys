Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method called TMEA to address uncertain correspondences in multi-modal entity alignment within multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs). The authors propose a Multi-modal Knowledge Encoder (MKE) module for encoding relational, attribute, and visual knowledge, and a Missing Modality Imputation (MMI) module that generates pseudo features using Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) to handle modality absence. Additionally, an inter-modal commonality enhancement mechanism based on cross-attention with orthogonal constraints is introduced to improve weak semantic associations. Extensive experiments demonstrate TMEA's effectiveness, showing significant improvements over competitive baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively encodes diverse knowledge into feature representations, providing a holistic view of entity features.
- It employs large language models and in-context learning for enhanced attribute alignment and filtering.
- The method is clearly presented, and extensive experiments validate its effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The problem description in the introduction is unclear, and the writing lacks coherence, failing to articulate the challenges faced by existing methods.
- The contribution points are not explicitly summarized, and the innovation appears limited, primarily relying on existing modules.
- The ablation study lacks thoroughness, with only individual module tests conducted and no combined ablation experiments performed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the problem description and the logical flow of the writing in the introduction. It would be beneficial to explicitly summarize the contributions of the paper and provide a more detailed explanation of the alignment-augmented abstract representation. Additionally, we suggest conducting combined ablation studies to better assess the impact of each component on performance. Finally, addressing the concerns regarding the effectiveness of the MMI module and considering personalized attribute learning methods could enhance the paper's contributions.
