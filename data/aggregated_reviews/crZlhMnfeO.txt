Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents MucRays, a framework for 3D shape representation that utilizes ray-based neural functions with multi-view geometry consistency. The framework comprises three components: a ray-surface distance field, a dual-ray visibility classifier, and a multi-view consistency optimization strategy. MucRays demonstrates superior quantitative results compared to existing coordinate- or ray-based networks for both synthetic and real-world scene modeling, achieving depth image inference that is 1000x faster.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The dual-ray visibility classifier is well-motivated and foundational for the multi-view consistency optimization.
2. The quantitative results, particularly the high performance on the DAE metric, indicate MucRays' capability to render accurate depth images.
3. The method addresses the critical issue of multi-view inconsistency in ray-based scene representations and is extensively evaluated, showing efficacy without slowing down inference.

Weaknesses:
1. Qualitative results are unsatisfactory, particularly in representing thin structures, as seen in the Reception scene where the desk lamp's arm is missing. A discussion on this phenomenon is warranted.
2. NeuS is a more suitable baseline than DeepSDF due to its ability to utilize both depth and color for supervision.
3. The geometric results, particularly the mesh result on Lego, appear over-smoothed compared to DS-NeRF or NDF, raising questions about whether this is due to TSDF or the nature of ray distance representation.
4. The method's reliance on ground truth depth information for training limits its applicability, especially compared to light field methods.
5. The paper lacks clarity on the implementation of baselines and the impact of varying layer depth and hidden channels in the proposed architecture.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the qualitative results by discussing the limitations in representing thin structures and exploring potential solutions. Additionally, we suggest providing a clearer explanation of the implementation of baseline methods, particularly regarding the classifier's role in performance metrics. The authors should also consider including an analysis of the impact of varying layer depth and hidden channels on performance. Furthermore, discussing the implications of training without depth maps would enhance the completeness of the paper. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore the possibility of simultaneous training of the two networks to streamline the process.
