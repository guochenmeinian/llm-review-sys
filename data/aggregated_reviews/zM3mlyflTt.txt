### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the use of sparse Mixtures of Experts (MoEs) and product-key memories (PKMs) to enhance the efficiency of resource-efficient large language models (LMs). The authors propose a novel MoE that employs a non-competitive expert selection function followed by top-k selection, alongside specific initialization schemes and load-balancing regularization. Empirical evaluations indicate that the proposed method achieves competitive performance compared to dense baselines while being more compute-efficient.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a novel perspective on approximating two-layer feedforward networks and presents a general framework that unifies various methods.
- Empirical results demonstrate the competitive performance of MoEs against dense architectures, supported by ablation studies.
- The motivation and theoretical analysis are clearly articulated, making a compelling case for the proposed approach.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the proposed method is questioned, as it extends existing techniques without sufficient justification for its design choices.
- The empirical investigations are limited to a narrow dataset, necessitating broader evaluation across diverse datasets.
- The paper lacks a thorough comparative analysis of computational complexity and training time against other methods, and the theoretical underpinnings require further elaboration.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for their design choices within the MoE framework, particularly regarding the impact on model performance. Additionally, expanding the experimental scope to include diverse datasets such as PTB and C4 would strengthen the performance claims. A more comprehensive comparison with existing methods in terms of computational complexity and efficiency is essential. Finally, we suggest providing a deeper theoretical analysis to validate the design decisions and situate the work within the existing literature.
