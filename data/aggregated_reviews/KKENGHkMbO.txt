### Key Points
This paper presents a method for predicting treatment response in cancer patients using dimensionality reduction techniques applied to radiomics from CT and PET imaging. The authors evaluate their model on three datasets, aiming to imitate oncologists' decisions. However, the paper lacks relevance to the workshop topic "Gaze Meets ML," as gaze tracking is only mentioned in the title.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The use of classification and survival models is appropriate.
- The authors effectively utilize three datasets to evaluate their model's performance.
- The study avoids bias in comparisons and achieves reasonable accuracy.

Weaknesses:
- The paper does not analyze gaze data, making it irrelevant to the workshop.
- It lacks originality, as dimensionality reduction is standard in machine learning.
- The authors did not optimize hyperparameters for tSNE and UMAP methods.
- Numerous grammatical and spelling errors are present.
- There are excessive abbreviations and a missing figure reference.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and coherence of the writing, addressing grammatical issues and unnecessary abbreviations. Specifically, revise sentences for clarity, such as changing "The abundance of radiomics, high-dimensional (HD), impedes the models to accurately predict the outcome" to "The high-dimensionality of radiomics impedes the development of accurate models." Additionally, we suggest that the authors optimize hyperparameters for tSNE and UMAP to ensure fair comparisons. To enhance clarity, we recommend reformatting Figure 4 into multiple figures and converting log-rank results into a simple table. Finally, we urge the authors to expand their dataset analysis to include more patient diversity and validate their model's performance across various datasets.
