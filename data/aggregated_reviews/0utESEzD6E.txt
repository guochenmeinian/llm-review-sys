### Key Points
This paper presents a study on NFT Airdrop Hunters and proposes ARTEMIS, a novel graph representation learning technique integrated with multimodal features to detect potential hunters. The authors utilize data from the NFT marketplace Blur for evaluation, demonstrating significant improvements over existing models in identifying hunters. The system employs a tailored neighbor sampling method, multimodal feature extraction, and advanced price representation, claiming to be the first application of machine learning in airdrop hunting.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a relevant and under-researched issue in NFTs, contributing significantly to the field.
- The proposed method creatively combines graph learning and multimodal features, showcasing technical soundness and innovation.
- Comprehensive evaluation using real-world data from Blur demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed system.

Weaknesses:
- The rationale behind certain design decisions is unclear, particularly regarding the significance of multimodal features in detecting hunters.
- The evaluation is based solely on data from Blur, raising questions about the generalizability of the findings to other NFT marketplaces.
- The detection performance is suboptimal, with precision and recall values indicating a high rate of false positives.
- Insufficient details on ground-truth labeling and the clustering process for identifying airdrop hunters.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their design decisions, particularly regarding the significance of the multimodal features in the context of Airdrop Hunters. Additionally, the authors should clarify whether NFT Airdrop Hunting is a widespread issue across various marketplaces, enhancing the understanding of the system's applicability. We suggest including a detailed discussion on the ground-truth labeling procedure and providing evidence of airdrop hunting. Furthermore, the authors should address the low detection performance by conducting error analyses and exploring potential improvements. Finally, we encourage the authors to discuss how airdrop hunters might adapt to ARTEMIS and the implications for benign users, given the current precision rate.
