### Key Points
This paper presents a method for inverse rendering that reconstructs geometry, material properties, and environmental lighting from posed images with fixed lighting. The authors propose two main contributions: 1) representing pre-integrated illumination as a single Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and 2) approximating self-occlusion on pre-integrated lighting to supervise an occlusion MLP for disentangling shadows and materials. The method achieves state-of-the-art results with fast training times, under an hour.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The representation of pre-integrated illumination as an MLP is innovative, with a clever regularization approach using a pure specular MLP to enhance training (Eq. 5).  
2. The occlusion factor estimation method is novel, utilizing a simple trick to factor out occlusion as an independent scalar for light integral, computed via Monte Carlo integration and distilled into a neural network for efficient inference.  
3. The quantitative results indicate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly on diffuse scenes (NeRFactor dataset).  
4. The method is efficient, achieving high-quality relighting results in about an hour of training on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The proposed method could benefit from testing on additional datasets, such as the TensorIR dataset.  
2. Concerns arise regarding the fairness of relighting results obtained via Blender's PBR shader, which may utilize global illumination, potentially disadvantaging certain baselines.  
3. The material and lighting representation appears trivial, with flaws in qualitative results, such as albedo containing specular and shadow bake-in, and discrepancies in metalness and roughness compared to ground truth.  
4. The occlusion introduced to improve material estimation lacks robustness for validation.  
5. The proposed model does not account for complexities in real-world objects with multiple material layers.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the robustness of the occlusion handling to validate its contribution more effectively. Additionally, we suggest testing the method on more diverse datasets, including the TensorIR dataset, to strengthen the findings. It would also be beneficial to clarify whether the relighting results utilize global illumination and to conduct experiments ensuring all methods operate under similar conditions. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide material editing visualizations and further analysis of potential errors in normal estimation, particularly in challenging scenes like those with LEGO and coffee.
