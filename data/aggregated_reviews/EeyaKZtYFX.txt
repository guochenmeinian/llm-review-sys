### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework for weakly supervised anomaly detection called KDAlign, which integrates rule knowledge from human experts to enhance the performance of deep learning models with limited labeled data. The authors utilize optimal transport techniques to align knowledge and data in a high-dimensional embedding space, introducing an additional loss term to the original objective function. Experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that KDAlign outperforms several baselines and achieves state-of-the-art results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and easy to understand.
2. The integration of rule knowledge for anomaly detection is well-motivated and the proposed solution is intuitive.
3. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Weaknesses:
1. Key methodological details, such as the construction of the knowledge graph, are insufficiently explained in the main text.
2. The experimental setup appears overly favorable, as anomaly samples matching rules are removed from the training set, raising questions about performance in more challenging scenarios.
3. The technical novelty is limited, as similar integrations of knowledge rules have been explored in prior works.
4. The rationale for the effectiveness of KDAlign in handling noisy knowledge during training is unclear, and the relationship between performance improvement and noise ratio is not well established.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology section, particularly regarding the calculation of optimal transport and the transformation of propositional formulas into graphs. Additionally, providing qualitative examples or visualizations of the knowledge-data alignment would enhance understanding. The authors should also discuss the limitations of the KDAlign framework, including how to address noisy or incomplete rule knowledge and the implications for scaling to larger datasets. Furthermore, we suggest elaborating on the rationale behind using optimal transport and conducting more ablation studies on distance metrics to justify its selection.
