Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach called Prompt Evolution with Graph ODE (PURE) aimed at improving out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in fluid dynamics modeling. The authors propose a framework that includes Multi-view Context Exploration, Time-evolving Prompt Learning, and Model Adaptation with Prompt Embeddings. PURE learns from historical observations and system parameters to initialize cue embeddings, which are then adapted over time using a graph ODE to capture spatio-temporal variations. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PURE across various benchmark datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The idea is innovative, linking prompt learning to dynamic system modeling for OOD challenges.
2. The method is technically sound, effectively capturing continuous model adaptation through graph ODE.
3. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the approach's effectiveness in diverse environments.

Weaknesses:
1. The contribution regarding OOD problem handling needs clearer articulation, particularly in comparison to existing methods.
2. The writing quality requires improvement, with undefined symbols in the method description.
3. The experimental design lacks comprehensiveness, including insufficient baseline comparisons and a lack of analysis on the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the contribution by explicitly comparing PURE to previous methods addressing OOD challenges. Additionally, the authors should define all symbols used in the method description to enhance readability. To strengthen the experimental section, we suggest including a broader range of baseline comparisons, such as data augmentation and domain adaptation methods, and providing a detailed analysis of the experimental results to elucidate the reasons behind the observed performance.
