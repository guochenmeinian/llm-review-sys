Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents novel algorithms for the multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, demonstrating that variants of the Prod algorithm can achieve optimal regret bounds without relying on importance weighting. The authors propose two Prod-type algorithms that resolve an open problem regarding incentive-compatible online learning, achieving $O(\sqrt{KT\log K})$ and $O(\sqrt{KT\log T})$ regret. Additionally, they introduce a Tsallis entropy variant that provides best-of-both-worlds guarantees in both adversarial and stochastic settings. The work also refutes a conjecture by Freeman et al. (2020) regarding the difficulty of incentive-compatible multi-armed bandits compared to regular ones.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper resolves an open question in the field, achieving significant regret guarantees for incentive-compatible online learning.
- The introduction of an importance-weighting-free algorithm is a notable contribution.
- The paper provides valuable insights into the relationship between Prod algorithms and first-order Online Mirror Descent (OMD) approximations.

Weaknesses:
- The rationale for using the Prod algorithm and the benefits of eliminating importance weighting are not clearly articulated.
- The presentation assumes a specialized audience, which may limit accessibility for less experienced readers.
- The lack of experimental results and comparisons with other algorithms diminishes practical applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the rationale behind the use of the Prod algorithm and the advantages of avoiding importance weighting. Additionally, consider adding dedicated appendices or references to relevant literature to enhance accessibility for a broader audience. Providing experimental results and comparisons with other algorithms achieving optimal regret guarantees would strengthen the paper's practical implications. Lastly, including a discussion of limitations, even in theoretical work, would be beneficial for practitioners.
