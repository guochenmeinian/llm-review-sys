Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents "Richelieu," an LLM-based agent designed for the game of Diplomacy, which evolves through self-play without relying on human data. The authors propose a novel architecture that integrates strategic planning, social reasoning, and memory reflection, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. The method simplifies previous architectures by avoiding reinforcement learning and human demonstrators, leveraging the inherent capabilities of commercially available LLMs like GPT-4 and LLAMA.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of sub-goals enhances the reasoning process, improving LLM output and reducing hallucinations.
2. The novel architecture includes a memory buffer functioning as a pseudo-RAG, enhancing context utilization.
3. The paper provides a comprehensive repository for reproducing experiments, facilitating further research.

Weaknesses:
1. The model's win rate against CICERO is low (<1%), raising concerns about its competitiveness despite being more lightweight and cost-effective.
2. The alignment of the model with human communication styles is difficult to assess without direct human interaction in gameplay.
3. The paper lacks clarity on several experimental details, such as the base model used and the specifics of the ablation study.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of experimental details, including specifying the base model used in experiments and the representation of other countries in gameplay. Additionally, we suggest providing a more in-depth analysis of the social reasoning and planning modules to demonstrate their effectiveness. It would also be beneficial to clarify the meaning of "evolve" in the context of the model and consider stronger baselines for comparison, such as ReAct or PlanAct. Lastly, addressing the limitations of the model and including a discussion of related work would enhance the paper's contribution.
