Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents WeiPer, a post-hoc method for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection that enhances detection performance by leveraging weight perturbations in the final layer of neural networks. The authors propose linear projections of the penultimate layer through perturbations, revealing a fingerprint-like nature of in-distribution samples. A KL-divergence-based scoring function is introduced and evaluated against existing methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on near OOD tasks using the OpenOOD benchmark.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- WeiPer is a novel approach that can be combined with various existing OOD detection scoring functions, enhancing their performance.
- The paper provides extensive analyses that clarify design choices and underlying intuitions.
- Notable improvements are demonstrated on challenging benchmarks, particularly the near-OOD evaluation on ImageNet-1K.

Weaknesses:
- The related work section lacks strong baseline comparisons, particularly regarding data depths and information projections, which are significant in the OOD detection community.
- WeiPer introduces additional computational complexity and memory requirements, potentially limiting its applicability in resource-constrained environments.
- The method's performance is not consistently stable across all benchmarks, necessitating further validation on a broader range of datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section by including strong baselines such as data depths and information projections. Additionally, incorporating comparisons against these baselines will enhance the robustness of empirical evaluations. We also suggest that the authors present a comparison of computational costs (time and memory) between WeiPer and other OOD detection methodologies. Finally, a broader discussion on the motivation and contributions of WeiPer to the OOD field would strengthen the manuscript.
