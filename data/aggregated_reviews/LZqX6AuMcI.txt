### Key Points
This paper presents the Fair Surveillance Assignment Problem, where a set of agents is tasked with surveilling edges in a graph. The assignment cost for each agent is determined by the minimum vertex cover of the edges they surveil. The authors focus on the Maximin Share (MMS) fairness concept, providing three main results: (i) no algorithm can guarantee better than a 2-approximate MMS allocation, (ii) an oracle-based algorithm achieves a ~4.562-approximation for heterogeneous agents, and (iii) optimal 2-MMS allocations exist for up to four agents.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses an active research area relevant to the conference.
2. It presents non-trivial results, particularly the constant approximation mechanism, which is impressive given the specific cost function.
3. The technical execution is sound and the paper is well-structured.

Weaknesses:
1. The problem's generality is overstated; the surveillance problem is not clearly defined.
2. The writing quality appears rushed, affecting overall clarity.
3. The assertion regarding the primary technical contribution related to the ~4.562-approximate MMS allocations is misleading, as it relies on the NP-hard nature of constructing the vertex cover.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the problem definition, particularly the surveillance problem, and explicitly acknowledge the NP-hardness of the vertex cover in the contributions section. Additionally, we suggest exploring polynomial-time algorithms for $\alpha$-MMS allocations to enhance the applicability of the results. A thorough review for typographical errors is also advised, particularly the misuse of "exist" instead of "exit." Finally, we encourage the authors to strengthen the motivation for the problem by referencing relevant literature on clustering and min-max fairness.
