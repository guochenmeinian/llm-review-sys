### Key Points
This paper presents UniChart, a pre-trained model specifically designed for chart comprehension and reasoning, addressing a significant gap in AI related to visual data interpretation. The authors propose a large-scale pre-training dataset for charts, which is diverse and covers various themes and visual styles. By pre-training UniChart on this dataset and subsequently fine-tuning it, the authors demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across four downstream tasks, showcasing the model's strong generalization capabilities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The development of a large-scale, diverse pre-training dataset for charts is a substantial contribution that can facilitate further research.
- UniChart achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple tasks, indicating its effectiveness and broad applicability.
- The comprehensive evaluation of the model, including automated metrics and human assessments, supports the claims made.

Weaknesses:
- The comparison with ChatGPT lacks sufficient detail, raising concerns about the fairness and validity of the evaluation.
- Important model comparison details, such as the number of parameters, are missing, limiting understanding of computational complexity.
- The statistical interpretation of p-values is ambiguous, and the paper does not adequately describe data preprocessing steps, hindering reproducibility.
- The training details for the Chart image encoder and text decoder are unclear, affecting the understanding of the model's capabilities.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the comparison with ChatGPT in Table 2 by specifying whether images were used as input and ensuring the comparison is fair. Additionally, including the number of parameters for each model in the comparison would enhance understanding of their computational demands. The authors should elaborate on the significance and interpretation of the reported p-values to clarify their analysis. Furthermore, a detailed description of the data preprocessing steps and confirmation of whether all data in Table 1 was used for pre-training would aid reproducibility. Lastly, the authors should specify whether the Chart image encoder and text decoder were trained from scratch or utilized pre-trained weights from other datasets.
