### Key Points
We recognize that the article addresses significant issues in motion generation and offers valuable insights for future research. However, we find the organizational structure confusing and the visualizations of results lacking. The authors claim their method surpasses traditional motion capture, but this is misleading as it requires a pre-trained model on paired data. We note inconsistencies in the presentation of metrics and suggest that the authors should clarify their definitions and comparisons. Additionally, we believe that showcasing specific motions that improve after DPO would enhance understanding.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
- The authors are pioneering the integration of RLHF and human preferences in the motion generation domain.
- They have created a new dataset of human preferences that can improve text-to-motion (t2m) quality and alignment.
- The work is important for advancing the field and can serve as a foundation for future research.

**Weaknesses:**
- The claims of improvement are difficult to substantiate due to unclear supplementary materials and a lack of visual comparisons.
- The generated dataset lacks diversity as it is produced by a single model.
- The quality metrics presented do not demonstrate significant improvement over the baseline, as indicated by user studies.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We suggest that the authors clarify the rationale for not using the labeled data signal indicating "how much better the motion is" during training and propose a method to incorporate this signal. Additionally, we recommend including qualitative comparisons between the proposed methods and the baseline, as well as providing clearer details on the user study, including the number of pairs generated and participants involved. Finally, augmenting the supplementary material with more examples of both successful and failed cases would enhance the paper's clarity and impact.
