Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of exact recovery in the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) for node-attributed graphs (CSBM). It introduces a binary setting with a tight bound on the information theoretical (im-)possibility of recovering blocks using Chernoff information. Additionally, it explores a scenario where graph structure and node attributes are sampled from exponential family distributions, providing a characterization of the phase transition for recovery. An iterative likelihood maximization algorithm is proposed and evaluated on synthetic data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a valuable perspective on the interplay between network structure and node attributes.
- The claims are sound, and the sections contain clear statements.
- The theoretical framework is general, presenting thresholds for exact recovery without specific distribution assumptions.

Weaknesses:
- Experiments are unconvincing, relying solely on synthetic graphs that favor the algorithm.
- Comparisons are limited to two baseline algorithms that optimize only one dimension; more challenging comparisons with node-attributed community detection methods (e.g., [19,20]) are needed.
- The related work section is sparse and primarily distinguishes contributions rather than presenting relevant literature.
- The presentation is at times confusing, with unclear transitions and structure, particularly in section 4.
- The appendix numbering conflicts with the main text, complicating references.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental validation by including comparisons with other node-attributed community detection approaches, particularly those mentioned in the related work. Additionally, conducting experiments on real-world datasets would strengthen the paper's contributions and applicability. The authors should also enhance the related work section to provide a more comprehensive overview of existing literature. Clarifying the dependence of results on previous work and improving the overall structure and flow of the paper will aid reader comprehension. Lastly, discussing the limitations of the approach and the implications of requiring known functions $\psi^*$ and $\phi^*$ in Algorithm 1 would provide valuable context.
