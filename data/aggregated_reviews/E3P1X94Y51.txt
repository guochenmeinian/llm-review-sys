Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SemFlow, a unified framework for semantic image segmentation and image synthesis using a rectified flow model and ordinary differential equations (ODE). The authors propose a method that optimizes both tasks simultaneously, incorporating techniques like pseudo mask modeling and bi-directional training. The effectiveness of SemFlow is demonstrated through comparisons with existing models, although it shows a performance gap in quantitative results, particularly in semantic segmentation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The unified framework for joint optimization of semantic segmentation and image synthesis is novel.
- The writing style is clear and the paper is generally well-structured.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for transforming semantic segmentation masks into 3-channel pseudo-masks is unclear, and further insights on the derivation of formulations are needed.
- There is a significant performance gap in image synthesis compared to other diffusion models, and the semantic segmentation performance is over 10% lower than basic methods.
- The literature review is insufficient, lacking citations of relevant works, and the theoretical and practical value of the proposed method is limited.
- The experiments are inadequate; the authors should include comparisons with additional relevant methods and provide complete quantitative results across all datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the necessity of using the Euler sampler and clarify the differences between Euler and DDIM/DDPM. Additionally, the authors should address the gaps in quantitative results by including comparisons with FreeMask and other relevant methods for both tasks. It is also essential to provide complete quantitative results on all datasets and enhance the literature review to include pertinent citations. Finally, the authors should clarify the computational cost advantages and the rationale behind the exclusion of text prompts in their framework.
