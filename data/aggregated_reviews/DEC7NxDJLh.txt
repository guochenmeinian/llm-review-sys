Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for cortical surface reconstruction (CSR) that estimates the midthickness surface from MRI images and deforms it to obtain white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) surfaces. The authors emphasize the importance of midthickness surface initialization and simultaneous optimization of WM, pial, and midthickness surfaces. They claim that their approach improves robustness and reduces topology errors compared to existing methods like CortexODE. The proposed method aims to enhance the accuracy of surface reconstruction while addressing the limitations of previous techniques, incorporating various regularization terms to improve performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem addressed is well-motivated, with a thorough analysis of existing methods' limitations.
- The proposed method demonstrates good quantitative results and is well-written, with clear storytelling and well-made figures.
- The incorporation of topology constraints in the reconstruction process is a significant advancement.
- The authors effectively demonstrate the significance of midthickness initialization in improving surface reconstruction.
- The method achieves a balance between accuracy and topology quality, outperforming alternatives in terms of topology errors.
- The integration of direct cortical thickness estimation is a novel contribution.

Weaknesses:
- The contributions of the paper are overstated; the initialization method closely follows existing work (CortexODE), and the novelty of the approach is questioned.
- The technical contributions are perceived as limited, and the problem addressed is considered too narrow, which may hinder broader applicability.
- The proposed method does not run faster than CortexODE, raising concerns about its efficiency.
- The paper lacks clarity in presenting equations, which could benefit from being numbered and explained immediately after their introduction.
- Long paragraphs and insufficient discussion of the trade-offs related to spatial resolution and computational costs detract from the overall clarity.
- The novelty of template-based mesh reconstruction and the use of midthickness initialization is questioned, as similar concepts have been employed in prior works.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their equations by presenting them as numbered equations and providing explanations for each variable immediately after. Additionally, splitting long paragraphs into shorter ones, each conveying a single observation or insight, would enhance readability. The authors should also address the limitations of their method, particularly regarding the initialization process and the implications of spatial resolution on reconstruction quality. Furthermore, we suggest improving the efficiency of their method to ensure it runs faster than existing approaches like CortexODE. Consider expanding the applicability of the method beyond cortical surface reconstruction to enhance its relevance in broader contexts. Finally, a more comprehensive literature review is necessary to acknowledge related works and clarify the unique contributions of their approach, particularly regarding the initialization techniques and loss functions used.
