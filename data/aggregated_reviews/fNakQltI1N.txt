### Key Points
This paper presents Trajectory Flow Matching (TFM), a simulation-free training algorithm for neural differential equation models, enabling the modeling of continuous physiological processes using irregular, sparsely sampled, and noisy data. The authors provide theoretical proof of the effectiveness of TFM and validate it through empirical studies on clinical datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and uncertainty prediction.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The method extends flow matching to time series, providing a strong research contribution.  
- It explicitly models uncertainty, effectively handling noisy and irregular data.  
- The application to clinically relevant datasets offers significant societal benefits.  
- The paper is well-structured, clearly written, and logically organized.  
- The originality in bridging flow matching and differential equation models is commendable.  

Weaknesses:  
- The discussion on the impact of simulation-free training on TFM's scalability is insufficient.  
- The provided code lacks a README for result reproduction.  
- Explanability studies would enhance clinical usability.  
- TFM is primarily designed for discrete time series, which may limit its applicability in continuous modeling.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the scalability of TFM due to simulation-free training. Additionally, please include a README file with instructions for reproducing results. We also suggest conducting explainability studies to enhance the clinical usability of the model. Furthermore, exploring the application of TFM to periodic time series, such as ECG, could be a valuable future research direction.
