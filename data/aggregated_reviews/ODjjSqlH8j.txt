### Key Points
This paper presents Direct Acquisition Optimization (DAO), an innovative active learning algorithm that utilizes influence functions to approximate the effect of training on candidate unlabeled data. DAO addresses two significant issues in expected error reduction (EER) methods: the necessity of holding out a validation dataset and the computational expense of retraining the model for each candidate observation. By eliminating the need for retraining and revalidation, DAO optimizes the use of limited labeling budgets on the most informative observations. The authors build on the concept of surrogates from the active testing literature, which helps approximate the true label distribution. The experimental results demonstrate DAO's predictive advantages over baseline algorithms, including BALD, BADGE, DBAL, and GLISTER, across seven benchmark datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The innovative approach of using influence functions for model parameter updates is clever and addresses key challenges in active learning.  
- DAO shows impressive performance in low-budget settings, outperforming several baseline algorithms.  
- The paper is well-written and aligns with the workshop's theme on active learning.

Weaknesses:  
- Certain sections, such as the explanation of surrogates and the theoretical foundations of DAO's predictive advantages, lack clarity.  
- There are inconsistencies in notation and references to the appendix that may confuse readers.  
- Some minor grammatical issues and unclear figures detract from the overall presentation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their methodology by providing a more detailed explanation of the use of surrogates. Additionally, we suggest formalizing the reasoning behind how DAO integrates acquisition diversity to strengthen the promotion of DAO. The authors should also address the inconsistencies in notation and references to the appendix to enhance coherence. Finally, we advise correcting the identified grammatical issues and ensuring that figures, particularly Figure (2), are clearly labeled and understandable.
