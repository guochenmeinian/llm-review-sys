Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents G4SATBench, a benchmark suite for evaluating graph neural network (GNN)-based SAT solvers, built on a diverse set of synthetic CNF generators comprising 7 datasets from 3 domains. The framework allows for fine-grained analyses with easy and medium levels across all datasets. The authors implement various GNN models, assessing their performance on multiple prediction tasks and training objectives. Notably, GNNs exhibit a tendency to adopt a greedy local search heuristic but struggle with backtracking heuristics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors address the evaluation of GNNs in SAT solving, providing a unified framework that facilitates fair comparisons across different models.
2. The re-implementation of four GNN-based SAT solvers with consistent interfaces offers valuable baselines for future research.
3. The paper is well-written, making it accessible for future authors to build upon.

Weaknesses:
1. The explanations regarding the modifications of LCG* and VCG* compared to their original forms lack depth, particularly concerning their impact on baseline results.
2. The performance discrepancies in medium SR, 3-SAT, and $k$-Clique datasets require clarification as they do not align with the authors' descriptions.
3. The current collection of GNN-based SAT solvers in G4SATBench is limited and should be expanded.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the modifications made to LCG* and VCG* and their implications on baseline results. Additionally, please clarify the reasons for the lower performance in medium SR, 3-SAT, and $k$-Clique datasets compared to easier datasets. We suggest increasing the number of GNN-based SAT solvers included in G4SATBench to enhance its comprehensiveness. Furthermore, please ensure that the font size in figures and tables is increased for better readability, and consider adding highlights to tabular results for clarity. Lastly, we encourage the authors to enhance the documentation in the GitHub repository to facilitate easier understanding and extension of their work.
