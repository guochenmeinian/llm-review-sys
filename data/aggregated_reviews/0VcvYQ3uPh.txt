Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on frequency estimation and learning-augmented frequency estimation, focusing on CountMin and CountSketch algorithms. The authors analyze these algorithms under a Zipfian distribution, demonstrating that the learning-augmented algorithm can improve accuracy by allocating unique buckets for predicted heavy hitters. They provide theoretical bounds on the weighted error for CountSketch, CountMin, and a novel algorithm, showing that predictions enhance performance in low space settings. Empirical results support the theoretical claims.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem of learning-augmented frequency estimation is well-motivated and significant in practice.
- The algorithms are straightforward, and the results appear correct.
- The paper is well-written and provides tight bounds on expected estimation errors for CountSketch and CountMin.

Weaknesses:
- The prediction model lacks clarity, particularly regarding the robustness of predictions and their impact on performance. The theoretical results assume perfect predictions without discussing trade-offs.
- The paper does not clearly articulate its improvements over prior work, particularly in comparison to Hsu et al. (2019), and lacks detailed experimental results for the parsimonious algorithm.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the prediction model by discussing the robustness of predictions and their effect on performance. It would be beneficial to include a trade-off analysis between prediction quality and weighted error bounds. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more explicit comparison to prior work, particularly Hsu et al. (2019), in the introduction and include previously known results in Table 1 for clearer context. Finally, we encourage the authors to conduct experiments with the parsimonious algorithm and clarify the limitations of their approach regarding the estimation of the data stream length.
