Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a facial parts swapping framework called FuseAnyPart, which utilizes diffusion models to enable the swapping of individual facial features rather than entire faces. The authors propose a method that fine-tunes a pre-trained CLIP model for feature extraction and employs a stable diffusion model for generating swapped faces. An Addition-based Injection Module is introduced to merge these features into the UNet feature map. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through extensive experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is easy to follow and presents an interesting approach to region-based face swapping using diffusion models.
2. The proposed injection method enhances the final generation compared to traditional cross-attention methods.
3. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Weaknesses:
1. The results indicate that skin color changes when only the eyes are swapped, which is not discussed by the authors.
2. The Addition-based Injection Module is simplistic; advanced modules may yield better performance.
3. The evaluation metric OSim lacks detailed explanation, particularly regarding its input and training labels.
4. The term "one-step" contradicts the 50 steps of the ddim sampler, necessitating careful usage in diffusion model contexts.
5. The method is limited to aligned faces, restricting its practical applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the evaluation metric OSim by providing detailed descriptions of its input and training labels. Additionally, addressing the skin color change issue when swapping features would enhance the discussion. The authors should consider exploring advanced injection modules beyond the Addition-based Injection Module to assess potential performance improvements. Furthermore, we suggest clarifying the use of the term "one-step" in relation to the ddim sampler to avoid confusion. Lastly, expanding the dataset diversity and providing more qualitative results would strengthen the robustness of the claims made in the paper.
