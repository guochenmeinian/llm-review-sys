### Key Points
This paper presents an approximation algorithm, HB, for the Quadratic Group Steiner Tree Problem (QGSTP), which aims to identify a semantically cohesive subgraph connecting entities that match query keywords. The authors claim that HB is empirically efficient compared to existing methods across various datasets, while maintaining a similar approximation ratio. The paper includes extensive experimental evaluations to support the proposed techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The main goal of the paper is clear, focusing on designing an efficient algorithm that matches or exceeds the performance of existing methods.
- The technical components are well-defined and self-contained.
- Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for QGSTP is weak, lacking clear real-world applications, particularly in knowledge graph exploration.
- The theoretical complexity remains high, and the approximation ratio is criticized for being too large to be meaningful, despite empirical efficiency.
- The experiments do not adequately evaluate the effectiveness of HB in real-world applications, lacking accuracy assessments and user studies.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation section by providing clearer real-world applications for QGSTP beyond knowledge graph exploration. Additionally, the authors should discuss the theoretical complexity and approximation ratio in more detail, clarifying why the approximation ratio is acceptable despite its size. Including a case study or user study would be beneficial to evaluate how well HB meets user demands in exploring knowledge graphs. Furthermore, the authors should enhance the experimental section by addressing the rationale behind the choice of angular distance in embeddings and the dimensionality of the embeddings used.
