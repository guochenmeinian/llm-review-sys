Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical investigation of diffusion guidance in generative models, characterizing the behavior of guidance through stylized models. It demonstrates that guided diffusion sampling tends towards the edges of class-conditional distributions, revealing a phenomenon that contradicts common intuitions. The authors provide a mathematical analysis and empirical experiments to support their claims regarding the effects of guidance scales on sample quality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an important question regarding guidance in diffusion models, revealing significant insights through rigorous theoretical treatment.
- The theoretical analysis is well-justified and systematically combined with experiments, enhancing the paper's credibility.

Weaknesses:
- The paper's structure is disorganized, making it difficult to follow the theoretical statements and their implications. The introduction lacks clarity and should separate background, main results, and related works into distinct sections.
- Key results in Section 4 are not clearly explained, and the role of score estimation error is inadequately described.
- The experiments are primarily heuristic, particularly regarding the MNIST dataset, and lack rigorous recommendations for practical implementation of guidance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization of the paper by clearly separating the introduction into distinct sections for background, results, and related works. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the main results in Section 4 and provide a more detailed explanation of the role of score estimation error. To enhance the empirical component, we encourage the authors to consider more rigorous experimental designs and provide concrete implementation recommendations for guidance, including theoretical guarantees.
