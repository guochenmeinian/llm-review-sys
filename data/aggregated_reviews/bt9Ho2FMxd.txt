### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of implicit and explicit hate speech detection, utilizing contrastive learning to enhance the relationship between these two forms of hate speech. The authors conduct cross-validation evaluations across various datasets, revealing that models do not generalize well. Visualizations of embedding representations suggest that contrastive learning may effectively link implicit and explicit hate instances.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-structured and systematically addresses research questions.  
- It uncovers important insights regarding the anchoring of hate speech embeddings around target groups.  
- The use of contrastive learning to connect implicit and explicit hate speech is an interesting approach.  
- Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate a solid understanding of hate speech detection.

Weaknesses:  
- The contribution lacks novelty, primarily relying on existing methodologies and visualization tools.  
- The clarity of results related to research questions, particularly RQ1, is questionable, and the effectiveness of contrastive learning in improving classification remains unproven.  
- The analysis is insufficiently thorough, with weak conclusions and a lack of exploration into linguistic or causal mechanisms.  
- The paper does not adequately address variations in implicit hate speech labeling across datasets, which may affect accuracy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how cross-evaluation results address RQ1 and provide evidence demonstrating that contrastive learning enhances hate speech classification. Additionally, incorporating a formula for the modified loss function in contrastive learning would clarify this aspect. We suggest conducting quantitative research on the explicitness of hate speech and analyzing the implications of varying percentages of explicit hate information on implicit detection performance. Finally, including ablation studies to demonstrate the specific contributions of contrastive learning to performance improvements would strengthen the paper.
