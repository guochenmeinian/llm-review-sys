### Key Points
This paper presents a method for data acquisition in decentralized data marketplaces, proposing DAVED, which selects training data by optimizing test loss on a test set instead of relying on a validation set. The authors utilize a linear experimental design framework and gradient-based optimization to determine the sampling probability of data points while considering budget constraints. The experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the advantages of DAVED.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses an important problem in data acquisition within decentralized marketplaces.  
- It introduces a novel approach that does not depend on validation data, which is a significant contribution.  
- Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:  
- There is a lack of comparison with existing data acquisition methods, particularly those relevant to decentralized settings and federated learning.  
- The experimental evaluation does not account for variations in test data distribution.  
- The motivation behind the proposed approach could be articulated more clearly.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with existing data acquisition methods, particularly those that do not utilize a validation set, to better contextualize the performance of DAVED. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments to analyze the impact of different test data distributions and the relationship between training and test data distributions. Clarifying the practical implications of the example provided regarding the patient and the data acquisition process would enhance the paper's relevance to real-world scenarios. Furthermore, including more detailed explanations of the theoretical foundations and assumptions, particularly regarding the feature extractor and its impact on performance, would benefit readers unfamiliar with the V-optimal experimental design framework.
