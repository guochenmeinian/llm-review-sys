### Key Points
This paper investigates *structural priming* in multilingual language models, proposing a cross-lingual experimental setup that primes a model in one language and tests it in another. The authors argue that this approach uncovers abstract linguistic structures more effectively than monolingual settings. They leverage a variety of cross-lingual experiments and find that the multilingual model (XGLM) exhibits patterns similar to human responses.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper adds significant value to the priming paradigm within LLM interpretability research by introducing a multilingual approach.
- It engages thoroughly with existing psycholinguistic literature, resulting in a rich experimental setup across multiple languages.
- The experimental design is compelling, and the results align well with human linguistic experiments.

Weaknesses:
- The procedure for measuring the priming effect lacks sufficient detail, raising concerns about clarity and interpretation.
- The interpretation of results may overstate the evidence for abstract grammatical representations, particularly in light of potential surface-level similarities in closely related languages.
- Some sections are repetitive, and specific terminology is misused, which could confuse readers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the priming effect computation by explicitly distinguishing between production and comprehension, and by providing a concrete example in Section 3.2. Additionally, addressing the concerns regarding the mixed-effects model and its handling of length differences and prior probabilities would strengthen the paper. We also suggest discussing alternative hypotheses to abstract grammatical representations to provide a more balanced view of the results. Lastly, restructuring sections `4.{1,2}.*` into a table format could enhance readability and reduce redundancy.
