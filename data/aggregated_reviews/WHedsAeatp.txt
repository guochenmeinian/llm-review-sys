Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Rank-N-Contrast (RNC) framework, a novel approach for learning regression-aware feature representations. The authors claim that this method captures the continuous nature of sample orders, leading to improved performance in downstream regression tasks. The paper includes theoretical proofs and experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of RNC across various regression tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper provides both theoretical analysis and empirical results, supporting the proposed method's validity.  
2. It includes a comprehensive ablation study and analysis, which enhances the understanding of the method's performance.  
3. The RNC loss is simple to implement and shows promise in generating continuous representations that outperform traditional methods.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The paper lacks high-level intuition and in-depth analysis regarding the method's effectiveness, particularly in explaining why preserving order in feature representation aids in learning continuous nature.  
2. The experimental evaluation is limited to datasets with mostly scalar responses, which may not fully demonstrate the method's capabilities.  
3. There is a noticeable gap between theoretical claims and experimental results, particularly regarding the relationship between delta-ordered embeddings and regression performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical connection between delta-ordered feature embeddings and regression performance to justify their utility. Additionally, we suggest expanding the experimental evaluation to include higher-dimensional responses and comparisons with tree-based methods in tabular settings. Addressing the limitations and ethical implications of the proposed method, especially concerning datasets involving human faces, would also strengthen the paper. Finally, clarifying the tuning of the temperature parameter \(\tau\) and providing insights into the trainability of the RNC loss would enhance the paper's rigor.
