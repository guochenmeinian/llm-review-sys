Aggregated Review:
**Key Points**  
We note that the paper addresses the annotation quality issue in autonomous driving datasets, specifically concerning pedestrians. The findings suggest that omitting overly ambitious pedestrian annotations can lower annotation costs while enhancing model detection performance. 

**Strengths and Weaknesses**  
We find the topic engaging and relevant for inclusion in our workshop. However, we believe the study could benefit from a broader scope, particularly by exploring its implications for vision language models.

**Suggestions for Improvement**  
We suggest extending the research to include vision language models to investigate how "hallucination" may impact annotation quality.
