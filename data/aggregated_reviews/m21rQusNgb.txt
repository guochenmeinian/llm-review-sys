### Key Points
This paper presents a novel domain-invariant ranking method that emphasizes list-wise feature invariance rather than item-wise feature invariance. The authors establish a new domain adaptation bound specifically for ranking problems and demonstrate significant empirical improvements over item-wise invariance methods. The approach, termed list-level alignment, aims to learn higher-level invariant representations for ranking tasks, addressing the limitations of existing domain adaptation methods that lack theoretical guarantees.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The theorem introduced is novel and requires new techniques for analyzing the ranking problem, distinguishing it from existing domain adaptation bounds.  
- The method is innovative, and the empirical results are strong, particularly in unsupervised domain adaptation tasks.  
- The paper is well-written and presents a compelling argument for the relevance of list-level alignment in ranking problems.  

Weaknesses:  
- There is skepticism regarding the empirical improvement between ItemDA and ListDA, as it may stem from differences in discriminator architecture rather than list-wise invariance.  
- The theoretical contribution may be perceived as an extension of existing domain adaptation theorems rather than a groundbreaking advancement.  
- The connection between the proposed method and its theoretical foundation is not sufficiently clear, leaving some readers uncertain about their relationship.  
- The evaluation of certain choices, such as the use of a transformer discriminator, lacks empirical ablation studies.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the theoretical contributions by explicitly articulating the distinctions between list-level alignment and prior adversarial alignment methods. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments using the same discriminator architecture for both ItemDA and ListDA to isolate the effects of list-wise invariance. It may also be beneficial to address the limitations of focusing solely on reranking tasks and consider broader applications beyond passage re-ranking. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide further elaboration on the statement in line 141 to clarify the implications of item-level invariance on list-level invariance.
