Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents HEALNet, an early fusion method for integrating diverse biomedical data modalities. HEALNet employs an iterative cross-attention structure that operates directly on raw input modalities, facilitating cross-modal interactions and handling missing modalities during inference. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of HEALNet on survival analysis tasks, showing promising results compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem motivation is clear, and the explanation of related work is thorough, providing context for the proposed method's uniqueness.
- The paper is well-organized, with a logical flow and high-quality illustrations.
- The iterative paradigm effectively addresses missing modalities and enhances interpretability.

Weaknesses:
- The methodology lacks clarity, particularly regarding the treatment of hyperparameters and the latent update function in Equation 2.
- The evaluation is limited to survival analysis, raising concerns about generalizability across different tasks.
- The sample sizes for the datasets are small, and the absence of comprehensive performance metrics limits the understanding of the model's effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology, particularly by providing detailed explanations of hyperparameter choices and the latent update function $\psi(\cdot)$. Additionally, conducting evaluations on a broader range of tasks beyond survival analysis would enhance the model's applicability. We suggest including more performance metrics, such as cumulative proportion surviving plots, to better visualize results. Finally, addressing the readability of figures and ensuring that the presentation is intuitive would significantly improve the paper's quality.
