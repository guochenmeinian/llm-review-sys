Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a model-agnostic framework named DAUC for categorizing uncertain examples identified by uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods. It introduces a confusion density matrix and categorizes suspicious examples into three classes: out-of-distribution (OOD), boundary (Bnd), and in-distribution misclassification (IDM). The authors provide a methodology for constructing this density-based matrix and demonstrate its efficacy through empirical studies on various benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper offers a novel approach to categorizing uncertainties, which is a significant contribution to the field.  
2. The writing is clear and well-structured, making the core ideas accessible.  
3. Empirical evaluations on different datasets, including MNIST and UCI, support the proposed framework's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:  
1. The rationale for dividing uncertain samples into three categories is insufficiently explained, with only a brief mention in the abstract.  
2. The proposed method's application to datasets with a larger number of classes remains unclear, raising questions about scalability and computational feasibility.  
3. The model-agnostic nature of DAUC is not adequately demonstrated in the experimental section.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of why uncertain samples are categorized into three classes, providing a more detailed justification in the main text. Additionally, clarifying how the choice of layer impacts categorization and how uncertainty is computed would enhance understanding. We suggest including a discussion on the scalability of the algorithm, particularly regarding datasets with a large number of classes. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide a clearer demonstration of DAUC's model-agnostic capabilities in the experimental results.
