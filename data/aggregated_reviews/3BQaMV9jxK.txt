Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a benchmark dataset for predicting seismic properties, specifically focusing on elastic full waveform inversion across various geological structures. The authors propose three deep learning methods as initial benchmarks, contributing to the understanding of seismic signal propagation. The paper is well-written, methodologically sound, and responsive to the conference theme, meriting acceptance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The dataset addresses a significant scientific problem with multiple geological applications, including earthquake prediction and oil/gas extraction.  
- It aggregates open-access data into a unified format, enhancing accessibility for researchers.  
- The authors provide computationally-intensive S-wave velocity maps, facilitating standardization and aiding researchers with limited computational resources.  
- The introduction of three baseline models, including InversionNet, VelocityGAN, and SimFWI, adds robustness to the study.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper assumes a high level of domain knowledge, which may alienate non-expert readers.  
- Figures lack adequate explanations and units, particularly in Figure 1 and Figure 2.  
- There is insufficient discussion regarding the categorization of datasets into "easy" and "hard," and the statistical significance of results is not clearly presented.  
- Limited visualizations and documentation of the original data are noted.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the accessibility of the paper by adding a basic background section to aid non-experts in understanding the seismic data concepts. Specifically, clarify Equation 1 and the use of mathematical operators like the gradient ($\nabla$) and divergence ($\nabla \cdot$). Additionally, provide more comprehensive explanations for Figures 1 and 2, including units and clearer descriptions. We suggest that the authors include quantitative measures for dataset categorization and enhance visualizations to better illustrate the data. Finally, we recommend discussing the potential impacts of the dataset more explicitly, particularly in the context of environmental concerns, and ensuring that the documentation includes accessible code once it is approved.
