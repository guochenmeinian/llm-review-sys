### Key Points
This paper presents a comparative analysis of four text rendering strategies to address redundancy in the input space of pixel-based language models. The authors propose that a character bigram structure significantly enhances performance in sentence-level tasks and allows a 22M language model to achieve results comparable to an 86M model. The study includes detailed ablation experiments and an investigation of the embedding space, revealing clustering of low-frequency tokens.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed rendering strategy enables a smaller model to perform similarly to a larger model, offering a potential means of parameter compression.  
- The ablation experiment design is thorough, analyzing various aspects such as model parameter magnitude and token frequency.  
- The bigram representation achieves competitive results with fewer parameters, promoting efficiency in NLP.  

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty of the rendering strategy is somewhat limited, as it builds on previous work without introducing significant innovations.  
- The experimental results, particularly regarding UDP, may have issues, including the use of a task-specific MLP that could lead to illegal parsing structures.  
- The rendering strategies may not generalize well beyond English, and the advantages of pixel-based models over tokenization-based ones are not sufficiently demonstrated in resource-rich settings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their experimental results, particularly regarding the post-processing of parsing tasks, and specify the statistical indicators used in their evaluations. Additionally, we suggest that the authors consider highlighting the performance of pixel-based models on low-resource languages in the main text rather than relegating this information to the appendix. Lastly, enhancing the novelty of the proposed methods could strengthen the paper's contribution to the field.
