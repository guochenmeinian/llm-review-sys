Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DisC-GS, a novel method that employs Bézier curves to enhance boundary rendering quality in Gaussian splatting. The authors address the challenge of accurately modeling high-frequency boundaries by introducing a discontinuity-aware rendering pipeline and a gradient approximation strategy. The framework theoretically reduces the number of Gaussian kernels required for modeling high-frequency boundaries compared to the original 3D-GS. Quantitative comparisons of Gaussian kernel distribution in edge and non-edge regions of 3D scenes demonstrate that DisC-GS uses significantly fewer kernels, especially in edge regions. Experimental results indicate that DisC-GS consistently outperforms existing methods, including 3D-GS, across various metrics, supported by both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. The authors assert that DisC-GS is capable of incorporating smooth kernels when necessary.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed method effectively addresses the limitations of Gaussian splatting in rendering boundaries, utilizing Bézier curves to enhance boundary representation.
- The paper provides clear quantitative evidence showing the efficiency of DisC-GS in reducing Gaussian kernel usage, particularly in edge regions.
- Experimental results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of DisC-GS over state-of-the-art algorithms, bolstered by comprehensive ablation studies.
- The authors effectively address the capability of DisC-GS to maintain smooth kernels, ensuring versatility in different scene types.
- The innovative approach of performing post-scissoring after projection onto the image plane is a notable advancement.
- The paper is well-structured, with clear writing and detailed discussions that facilitate understanding.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks sufficient qualitative comparisons and presents mismatched quantitative metrics, raising questions about the consistency of the data used for evaluations.
- There is an absence of synthetic scene comparisons, which could provide clearer insights into the method's performance independent of real-world inaccuracies.
- The lack of visualization of the point cloud distribution may lead to confusion regarding the changes in Gaussian kernel distribution.
- The discussion on the number of Gaussians, training time, and storage implications is insufficient, leaving important aspects of the method unexplored.
- Concerns exist regarding the optimization process, particularly the potential for local optima and the impact of polynomial computations on rendering speed.
- The assertion that DisC-GS is always superior to 3D-GS may require further empirical validation in diverse scene types, particularly in diffuse scenes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the qualitative comparisons by including more diverse scenes and ensuring that the quantitative metrics are calculated consistently across methods. Additionally, conducting experiments on synthetic scenes would strengthen the evaluation of DisC-GS. We suggest improving the visualization of the point cloud distribution to clarify the changes in Gaussian kernel distribution. Furthermore, providing more empirical evidence to support the claim that DisC-GS consistently outperforms 3D-GS across all scene types, especially in diffuse scenarios, would enhance the paper's credibility. We also recommend providing a detailed discussion on the number of Gaussians used, as well as the implications for training time and storage. Clarifying the optimization strategies employed in DisC-GS and addressing the clarity of label definitions and computational complexity analysis would improve the overall presentation.
