Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents KIAN, a method for leveraging multiple sub-optimal policies to enhance reinforcement learning tasks. The authors introduce a new Knowledge-Grounded MDP, integrating external knowledge policies into the traditional MDP framework. KIAN learns embeddings for each knowledge policy and maps the current state to a query embedding to identify the most suitable policy for action at each timestep. The paper also defines the Knowledge-Grounded RL (KGRL) setting, emphasizing properties such as knowledge-acquirable, sample-efficient, generalizable, compositional, and incremental.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
* The paper is well-structured and easy to read, demonstrating great attention to detail in motivating theorems and equations.
* It effectively addresses a relevant problem in reinforcement learning, improving sample efficiency and enabling knowledge transfer.
* The methodology is clearly described, allowing for replication, and is supported by well-designed figures and diagrams.

Weaknesses:
* The evaluation is limited, particularly regarding the OpenAI robotics task, which only provides slight support for the proposed method.
* The use of only 3 or 5 seeds in experiments may be insufficient, given the large error bars observed, raising concerns about statistical robustness.
* The paper lacks clarity on the representation of error bars in the plots, hindering data interpretation.
* Limitations of the proposed method are not adequately addressed, and the authors should include insights on this in the conclusion or Appendix D.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by expanding it to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the proposed method's performance. Increasing the number of seeds in experiments would enhance statistical robustness. Additionally, clarity regarding the error bars in the plots should be provided to aid interpretation. We suggest conducting ablation studies to investigate the effects of various factors on the proposed method's performance, including the influence of attention weights, the impact of random policies, and the effects of different types of knowledge policies. Finally, we encourage the authors to explicitly address the limitations of their method in the conclusion or Appendix D.
