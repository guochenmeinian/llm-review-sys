### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark of uncertainty measures for various state-of-the-art (SOTA) molecular representation learning models across multiple tasks. The authors evaluate uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods, motivated by the need for improved model robustness and accurate data distribution estimation. The study analyzes current SOTA methods through different backbone models and UQ method categories, providing a clear view of the results. Additionally, the authors have made a GitHub repository available for convenient usage.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper provides a thorough quality assessment of a wide variety of uncertainty quantification methods for several SOTA molecular representation models.  
- It is well-written, with a clear experimental setup and defined UQ methods.  
- The results are of broad interest to the community, addressing a noticeable lack of benchmarks in the field.  

Weaknesses:  
- It is challenging to generalize which uncertainty quantification method to use broadly in molecular representation learning, despite showing that ensemble methods perform best.  
- The high computational costs associated with ensemble methods may hinder their adoption in the field.  
- The study compares only significant studies, and extending the research to include more pretraining models would be beneficial.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by providing clearer guidance on selecting appropriate uncertainty quantification methods for various scenarios in molecular representation learning. Additionally, consider expanding the research to include a broader range of pretraining models to enhance the comprehensiveness of the study.
