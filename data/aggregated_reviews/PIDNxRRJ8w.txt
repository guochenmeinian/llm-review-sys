Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for dataset ownership verification that utilizes invisible domain watermarks to ensure models correctly classify hard samples, which benign models misclassify. The authors argue that previous backdoor methods are harmful and propose a harmless approach that generates domain watermarks and modifies benign samples to create a watermarked dataset. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through experiments on CIFAR-10, Tiny-ImageNet, and STL-10.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed method is novel, offering a different perspective on dataset copyright protection by focusing on hard samples.  
- The theoretical analysis is reasonable, and extensive experiments support the effectiveness of the method.  
- The paper is well-written, with a clear motivation to avoid harmful practices associated with existing methods.  

Weaknesses:  
- The practicality of the method is not sufficiently explained, particularly regarding the potential for models trained on large datasets to outperform benign models without using the watermarked dataset.  
- Sections 3.3 and 3.4 lack clarity, with insufficient explanations of key terms and concepts.  
- The experiments are limited to two model structures (VGG and ResNet), raising questions about the method's transferability to larger datasets and other architectures.  
- The potential for watermark domain collisions between datasets from similar domains is a significant concern, as it complicates ownership claims.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Sections 3.3 and 3.4 by providing specific definitions for terms such as z, \hat_{z}, \theta, and \omega, and explaining how to obtain these features. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments with a wider variety of model architectures to assess the method's effectiveness across different settings. To address the concern of watermark domain collisions, we recommend adding experiments to evaluate this scenario or proposing mechanisms to mitigate such risks. Lastly, the authors should discuss the implications of adaptive attacks and domain generalization training methods on the assumptions of their proposed method.
