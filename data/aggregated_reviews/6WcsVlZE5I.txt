### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of a multilingual end-to-end speech translation (E2E ST) model using Singular Value Canonical Correlation Analysis (SVCCA), focusing on learned representations from language similarity and linguistic typology. The authors reveal that linguistic similarity may be less effective with insufficient training data and that encoder representations yield better accuracy for phonological features. They also highlight the importance of training data in enhancing translation quality, especially for low-resource languages, and the limitations of their findings due to data diversity and quality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is clearly written and easy to follow.  
- It provides valuable insights into multilingual representations in speech translation, contributing to both research and practical applications.  
- The use of SVCCA is a novel approach for analyzing language similarity, and the findings are supported by reliable analyses.  

Weaknesses:  
- The experiments are limited to single-domain data, raising concerns about the generalizability of the conclusions.  
- Some analyses on language similarity lack depth, making it challenging to disentangle factors affecting performance.  
- The conclusions may not be fully supported by the low performance of some low-resource languages, indicating potential overfitting or inadequate representation learning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of language similarity by providing a more detailed examination of the dissimilarities between languages, particularly for low-resource pairs. Conducting ablation studies by grouping languages by family could enhance understanding of the impact of training data. Additionally, including a baseline similarity analysis using a multilingual language model or pure text language model would clarify the findings. Addressing the quality of multilingual ASR results and providing examples of poor alignment in multilingual settings would also strengthen the conclusions. Lastly, we suggest revising the discussion on data quantity to reflect its impact on the validity of the conclusions drawn.
