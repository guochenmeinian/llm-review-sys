Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical and empirical investigation of input loss curvatures in membership inference attacks (MIAs). The authors propose a new black-box MIA that utilizes input loss curvature, demonstrating its effectiveness in distinguishing between train and test sets. The study reveals limitations of shadow model-based MIAs and provides both theoretical analysis and experimental validation across multiple datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper offers an interesting theoretical explanation of MIAs based on input loss curvature, which has shown empirical success but lacked theoretical grounding.  
2. The proposed MIA is simple, theoretically motivated, and thoroughly evaluated, outperforming existing baselines.  
3. The introduction of input loss curvature into privacy attacks is original and broadens its application beyond previous works.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The paper is missing references, such as Li et al. 2023 and the original DetectGPT paper (Mitchell et al. 2023).  
2. A proof sketch of the theorems would enhance the theoretical understanding presented in the main body.  
3. The assumption that the curvature score follows a Gaussian distribution is not validated, which is crucial for the theoretical analysis.  
4. The robustness of the attack against simple defenses, such as subsampling training data, is low, raising concerns about its practical applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical framework by including a proof sketch of the theorems in the main body. Additionally, addressing the missing references would strengthen the paper's foundation. The authors should validate the assumption regarding the Gaussian distribution of curvature scores and explore the implications of errors in zeroth-order curvature estimation. Finally, we suggest that the authors consider the generalization of their approach to various model architectures, including piecewise linear networks, to demonstrate the robustness of their method across different settings.
