Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new framework and algorithm for finding performatively optimal solutions within the performative prediction framework, addressing the challenge of estimating the underlying distribution map. The authors utilize robust optimization tools to account for statistical errors, providing structural theorems that bound the performance of distributionally robust performative optima (DRPO) and guidelines for hyperparameter selection. The proposed approach minimizes the distributionally robust performative risk (DRPR) over a set of distribution maps, validated through simulations in various settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation and ideas are compelling, bridging robust optimization and performative prediction.
- Clear examples illustrate the value of the proposed methods.
- The experimental section is well-executed, supporting the framework's usefulness.
- The theoretical setting and analysis are sound, with practical extensions.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty primarily lies in integrating existing distributionally robust optimization (DRO) results with performative prediction.
- The proposed DRPR framework may require more deployments than standard methods, raising concerns about real-world applicability.
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion of trade-offs and limitations of the chosen approach, particularly in complex distribution map scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity around the computational complexity of their algorithms and provide precise statements regarding the solvability of the robust optimization problem under tractable conditions. Additionally, we suggest incorporating a dedicated discussion section that addresses the pros and cons of the distributionally robust approach, particularly in relation to more complex distribution maps. Expanding on the implications of the results in the experimental section and providing more detailed insights into the calibration methods and grid search processes would enhance the paper's clarity and depth.
