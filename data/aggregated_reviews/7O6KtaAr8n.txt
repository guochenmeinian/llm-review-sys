Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the learnability of social welfare functions, focusing on the implications of decisions made by a central decision-maker considering constituents' welfare. The authors propose various settings, including cardinal utility vectors and pairwise comparisons, while addressing learning with and without noise. Theoretical PAC bounds are derived, and the authors validate their findings through experiments on proprietary data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces an interesting and novel concept with quality results, contributing meaningfully to the research community.  
- The methodology is reasonable, and the writing is clear, providing both theoretical and empirical analyses.  
- The theoretical results are solid and well-organized, exploring claims in sufficient depth.

Weaknesses:  
- The implications and interpretations of the results are not sufficiently discussed, leaving the quality and comparison to prior work unclear.  
- The paper's clarity could be improved, as some results, such as those in Theorem 3.2, are hard to interpret.  
- The technical contribution appears limited, relying on standard learning theory without addressing potential challenges in deriving results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing additional intuitions for all theorems and lemmas, particularly for results that are currently difficult to interpret. Enhancing the motivation for the experiments earlier in the paper would also be beneficial. Including a short primer on VC dimension, pseudo-dimension, Rademacher complexity, and PAC learning in the appendix could aid unfamiliar audiences. Additionally, we suggest discussing the implications of the PAC bounds in relation to prior work and real-world applications to provide a clearer context for the results.
