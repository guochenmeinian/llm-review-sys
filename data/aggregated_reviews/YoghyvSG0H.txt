Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to semi-supervised 3D object detection (3DOD) by utilizing diffusion models to enhance the quality of pseudo-labels. The authors propose a method called Diffusion-SS3D, which aims to improve the accuracy of pseudo-labels generated by a teacher model through a denoising process that addresses both 3D object sizes and class label distributions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through experiments on ScanNet and SUN RGB-D datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to previous approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The abstract and introduction effectively motivate the problem and the proposed solution, clearly stating contributions over prior works.
2. The method description and mathematical definitions are clear, with well-prepared figures and algorithms that enhance understanding.
3. The proposed method shows significant improvements over baseline models, supported by various ablation studies.
4. Qualitative examples in the supplementary material provide additional insights into the method's performance.

Weaknesses:
1. The application of the method during training versus inference is not clearly articulated, leading to potential confusion.
2. The source of performance improvements in the state-of-the-art comparison is unclear; distinguishing the effects of enhanced pseudo-labels and prediction refinement is necessary.
3. The paper lacks a comprehensive evaluation on outdoor datasets, which limits the generalizability of the findings.
4. The limitations of the method, particularly regarding computational costs and performance on different datasets, are not thoroughly discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity in the abstract and introduction by explicitly stating when the diffusion mechanism is applied. Additionally, including a baseline without the authors' method in the state-of-the-art comparison table would clarify the contributions of the proposed enhancements. We suggest conducting experiments on outdoor datasets to assess the method's efficacy in broader contexts. Furthermore, providing statistical data or visualizations to evaluate the quality of pseudo-labels would strengthen the claims made regarding their reliability. Lastly, discussing the computational costs associated with the diffusion model would provide a more comprehensive understanding of its practicality.
