### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of recommender systems that utilize implicit feedback, focusing on matrix factorization models and the impact of weighting schemes. The authors challenge the conventional wisdom that weighted methods outperform unweighted ones, providing experimental evidence that unweighted methods often yield better ranking accuracy, particularly as model capacity increases. They introduce novel algorithms for optimizing weighted objectives and conduct comprehensive experiments across various datasets, analyzing the interplay between weighting, regularization, and model dimension.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper features a well-structured experimental design and rigorous methodology, utilizing diverse datasets and matrix factorization algorithms.
- It presents a counterintuitive discovery that unweighted methods can outperform weighted ones, prompting a reevaluation of common practices in recommender systems.
- The introduction of efficient optimization algorithms and detailed mathematical derivations adds significant technical value.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks adequate explanations for certain experimental details, such as the specific values of regularization parameters and the consistency of algorithms used.
- There is insufficient intuitive evidence supporting the main finding, making it difficult to accept the conclusion that unweighted methods are superior.
- The discussion on related work is inadequate, failing to clarify why efficient optimization remains a challenge in large-scale matrix factorization.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their experimental details by including specific values of regularization parameters in the results tables. Additionally, they should ensure consistency in the application of algorithms across experiments. To enhance the intuitive understanding of their main finding, we suggest adding a table that clearly compares the best-performing weighted and unweighted methods for each dataset, and highlighting these results in the larger tables. Revising overly embellished statements about the main conclusion to reflect a more cautious tone would also be beneficial. Finally, enriching the discussion on related work regarding large-scale matrix factorization would clarify the significance of their contributions.
