Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the sample complexity of training diffusion models, presenting an exponential improvement in the dependence on Wasserstein error and network width, expressed as \(\tilde{O}(d^2 P D \log \Theta \log^3(1/\gamma) / \epsilon^3)\). The authors demonstrate that a sufficiently expressive neural network is required to achieve this bound, which exhibits better polynomial dependence on \(d\) and \(P\), but worse polynomial dependence on \(\epsilon\).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper provides a significant improvement in sample complexity results for diffusion models, with a clear analysis of the L\(_2\) accuracy barrier and the proposal of using a (1-\(\delta\))-quantile error for analysis.
- The organization of the paper is commendable, and the proofs are generally clear despite the complexity of the subject matter.

Weaknesses:  
- The theoretical insights and implications of the results are limited, raising questions about their practical significance for diffusion models.
- The presentation lacks clarity in several areas, including the positioning of the work within existing literature and the novelty of the contributions, particularly regarding the optimization error and the assumptions made about the neural network's representational capacity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by clearly positioning their work within the existing literature, possibly by including a comparative table of sample complexities. Additionally, the authors should discuss the implications of their assumptions, particularly regarding the neural network's ability to represent complex dynamics and the optimization error, which has not been adequately addressed. We also suggest that the authors clarify the importance of Section 4 and the relevance of the examples provided, as well as ensure that all terms and parameters are well-defined throughout the paper.
