### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to multi-hop question answering by utilizing prompting strategies that generate subquestions in a tree structure, where answers to some questions feed into others. The authors propose a probabilistic tree-of-thought reasoning framework, which decomposes complex questions and integrates uncertainty into the reasoning process. The methodology includes three answering strategies: Child-aggregate, Open-book, and Closed-book, with each answer being scored based on the average log-probability of tokens in the explanation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of this approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem addressed is well-motivated and the methodology is intuitive and clearly explained.
- The incorporation of uncertainty into the reasoning process and the self-evaluation-based method for quantifying answer confidence are significant contributions.
- Experimental results are promising, with substantial gains over existing models and useful analyses provided.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the approach is questioned due to similarities with existing works, particularly regarding question decomposition and uncertainty estimation.
- The lack of intrinsic experiments with various instantiations of the ProbTree method's parameters limits the depth of analysis.
- The scoring mechanism based on token probabilities may be fragile and requires further analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the differences between their contributions and those in reference [1]. Additionally, the authors should explore the potential for using simple semantic parsing methods for question decomposition and clarify the rationale behind the maximum number of nodes in each layer being set to three. Further analysis of the calculated uncertainty and its correlation with answer quality is essential, as is a discussion on the process of extracting intermediate answers. Lastly, we suggest that the authors consider how the system might recover from decomposition mistakes in future iterations.
