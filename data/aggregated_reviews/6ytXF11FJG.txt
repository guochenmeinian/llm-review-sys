### Key Points
This paper presents PARROT, an artificial neural network model designed to mimic human speech perception by generating phoneme sequences from simulated cochlear input. The architecture integrates a biologically inspired front-end with deep neural network components, demonstrating promising alignment with human phoneme recognition patterns. The authors provide a thorough experimental evaluation, including comparisons to human performance on non-word transcription tasks, indicating a strong model-human correlation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The experimental evaluation shows strong alignment with human performance, particularly in non-word transcription tasks.  
- The model's architecture is innovative, combining biologically inspired elements with deep learning techniques.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks a detailed discussion of limitations and future work, particularly regarding generalizability and biological plausibility.  
- There are significant concerns about experimental design, including unclear training data comparisons and the absence of ablation studies.  
- The paper's title and abstract may overstate the model's contributions to explaining continuous speech perception.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of limitations and future work, particularly focusing on generalizability and biological plausibility. Additionally, we suggest incorporating ablation studies to validate the cochlear front end's importance and providing clearer comparative analysis with existing biologically inspired models. The authors should clarify the training data differences in the context of the SUPERB Benchmark and ensure that the title accurately reflects the contributions of the work. Finally, addressing the trade-off between interpretability and performance more explicitly would enhance the paper's depth.
