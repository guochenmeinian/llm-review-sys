### Key Points
This paper presents a machine learning model designed to classify sign-up, sign-in, and non-authentication web pages, followed by a browser fingerprinting detection analysis on sign-up and sign-in pages. The authors propose a new methodology for web page classification using features extracted from the HTML DOM via Puppeteer crawler's headless mode. The study also includes a large-scale measurement of browser fingerprinting across the top 100K domains, discussing fingerprinting rates, third-party scripts, and comparing findings with existing literature.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed classifier demonstrates promising performance for identifying sign-up and sign-in pages.
- The large-scale measurement of browser fingerprinting on authentication pages is a valuable contribution to the field.

Weaknesses:
- The fingerprinting detection section relies heavily on existing techniques, raising questions about its technical contributions.
- The focus on fingerprinting APIs neglects the flow of browser attributes, which is critical for detection, as highlighted in recent studies.
- There are inconsistencies in the paper regarding the classification of pages and the findings presented, particularly concerning the overlap of login and sign-up pages.
- The measurement results, while confirming previous studies, lack a deeper discussion on improving existing fingerprinting defenses.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the technical contribution of the fingerprinting detection section by incorporating insights from recent studies that emphasize the flow of browser attributes. Additionally, clarify the methodology used for regex patterns in identifying login and sign-up pages and address the inconsistencies regarding page classifications. It would also be beneficial to expand the discussion on how the findings can inform improvements in fingerprinting defenses, particularly regarding the categorization of scripts as "fraud prevention." Lastly, ensure that the abstract accurately reflects the nuances of existing literature on fingerprinting techniques.
