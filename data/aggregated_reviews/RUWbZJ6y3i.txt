### Key Points
This paper presents a multi-granularity super-resolution data map inference framework (MGSR) aimed at inferring fine-grained urban data maps from incomplete multi-granularity data. The framework comprises three components: the Granularity Alignment Network (GLAN) for aligning and imputing missing data, the Feature Extraction Network (FEN) for capturing spatio-temporal dependencies, and the Recurrent Super-Resolution Network (RSRN) for multi-task inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate MGSR's effectiveness, achieving significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The exploration of multi-granularity data is a significant contribution to the literature.  
- The experimental analysis is well-presented, elucidating the results' underpinnings.  
- The study has practical relevance in fields such as urban planning and healthcare.  
- Clear concepts and mathematical definitions are provided, along with detailed explanations of the network structure and components.  
- Solid and extensive experiments with comprehensive comparisons to baseline results.

Weaknesses:  
- The introduction lacks clarity regarding research gaps and contributions.  
- There is insufficient analysis of the differences between the proposed method and previous methods.  
- The related work section is too general, hindering readers' understanding of the proposed method's uniqueness.  
- The presentation and analysis of the correlation between coarse-grained and fine-grained data are inefficient.  
- Tables and figures require more explanations for better reader comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction to clearly articulate the research gaps and contributions. Additionally, a more in-depth analysis of the differences between the proposed method and previous methods is necessary. The related work section should be expanded to provide a detailed comparison, enhancing readers' understanding of the proposed method's significance. We also suggest improving the presentation of the correlation analysis between coarse-grained and fine-grained data. Finally, we recommend adding more explanations to tables and figures to facilitate intuitive understanding, and including comparisons with methods like DiffUFlow, UFI-Flow, and FODE in a tabular format.
