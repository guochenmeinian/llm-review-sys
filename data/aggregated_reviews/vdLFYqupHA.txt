### Key Points
This paper presents a novel reference-free, uncertainty-based method for detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), addressing the inefficiencies of existing methods that rely on external knowledge or multiple samples. The authors propose an approach that mimics human focus in factuality checking by concentrating on informative keywords, unreliable tokens in historical context, and token properties. Through extensive experiments, including ablation studies, the authors demonstrate that their method outperforms existing systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles an important and emerging problem in LLMs, with a well-motivated problem setting.
- The proposed solution is intuitive and easy to follow, showing strong empirical performance.
- Extensive experiments support the proposed approach, including effective ablation studies.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks details in the experimental section, particularly regarding LLaMA variants without focus, which makes it unclear whether performance improvements stem from the proposed method or model differences.
- There is uncertainty about the claim regarding the uniqueness of the WikiBio GPT-3 dataset for LLM hallucination evaluation.
- The paper could benefit from additional baselines and comparisons to other model backbones to demonstrate the generality of the approach.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the term "focus" by providing a clear definition, similar to how "attention" is defined in transformer literature. Additionally, please elaborate on exposure bias in lines 265-270 with an example, as it is a key point that may not be familiar to all readers. We suggest rephrasing lines 272 to 287 to avoid confusion regarding the probabilities depicted in Figure 2. Furthermore, consider including more details in the experimental results, such as LLaMA variants without focus, and explore the use of other benchmarks, as mentioned in Section 4.2 of Zha et al. (2023). Lastly, adding more baselines could enhance the understanding of the usability of the developed approach.
