### Key Points
This paper presents a novel diffusion model for text generation, termed Masked-Diffusion LM, which incorporates a linguistic-informed soft masking process during the forward diffusion. The authors propose a method for computing word importance based on TF-IDF and entropy, allowing for efficient token prediction via cross-entropy loss. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance in controllable text generation tasks and integrates well with pre-trained language models like BERT.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The linguistic-informed masking strategy is intuitive and demonstrates clear benefits in ablation studies.
- The proposed method shows state-of-the-art performance on controllable text generation tasks, enhancing efficiency in training and inference.
- The paper is well-written, providing sufficient background and clarity on new techniques.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a description of the reverse process for the proposed soft-masking diffusion model, which complicates its application compared to traditional diffusion models.
- There is no evaluation of the model in multilingual settings, limiting its applicability and comparison to prior work.
- Comparisons to other discrete diffusion techniques are minimal, which could provide more informative insights.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including a detailed description of the reverse process for the soft-masking diffusion model. Additionally, conducting evaluations in multilingual contexts would strengthen the findings and demonstrate the model's capabilities more comprehensively. Expanding comparisons to other relevant diffusion models, both continuous and discrete, would also enhance the paper's contributions and situate the proposed model within the broader research landscape.
