Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents FINCON, an LLM-based multi-agent framework aimed at enhancing financial decision-making through a manager-analyst communication hierarchy. The authors evaluate their system using historical multimodal data and introduce conceptual verbal reinforcement (CVR) to refine agent prompts. The study demonstrates that FINCON effectively mitigates investment risks and improves trading performance, particularly during periods of high market volatility. The authors propose that FINCON marginally outperforms the buy-and-hold strategy in bullish market conditions and shows a clear advantage over other autonomous trading systems. They have extended their training and testing periods, recalibrating their model and correcting previous errors in cumulative return reporting.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of LLMs into a multi-agent framework for financial tasks is a novel approach.
- The dual-level risk control mechanism, including a self-critiquing feature, is a unique contribution.
- The paper is well-structured, making it easy to follow the methodology and findings.
- Empirical results indicate strong performance, with FINCON achieving positive cumulative returns and Sharpe ratios in single stock trading.
- The authors provide comprehensive updates and clarifications regarding their model's performance, including extended training and testing periods.
- The inclusion of additional ablation studies enhances the understanding of the model's risk-control component and overall effectiveness.
- Reviewers acknowledge the novelty and technical soundness of the framework, as well as its significant contributions to the financial decision-making field.

Weaknesses:
- The generalizability of the proposed method is questionable, as it only outperforms the buy-and-hold strategy for certain stocks.
- The advantage shown in the results may stem from selective stock choices, necessitating a more rigorous evaluation.
- The complexity of the multi-agent setup raises concerns about the specific contributions of each component.
- Limited reproducibility due to the absence of shared code and insufficient details on certain methodologies.
- The original manuscript lacked final, verified results, which were only presented during the rebuttal process, leading to confusion.
- The absence of confidence intervals in the statistical significance analysis raises concerns about the robustness of the results.
- The small size of the new test period limits the ability to conduct thorough statistical analyses.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by conducting a more comprehensive evaluation across a broader range of stocks. Additionally, we suggest including confidence intervals for the cumulative returns to address statistical significance concerns. We further recommend providing clearer ablation studies for the memory module and other components to elucidate their individual impacts. To enhance reproducibility, we urge the authors to share their code and provide detailed implementation information for the CVR algorithm. We also suggest conducting further experiments to validate the effectiveness of the framework under extreme market conditions and across a broader range of trading tasks. Finally, addressing the potential ethical implications and scalability of the model in real-world applications would strengthen the paper's contributions.
