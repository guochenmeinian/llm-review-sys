Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a social intelligence challenge involving physically constrained agents that require assistance in achieving tasks. The environment includes a leading agent, a helper agent, obstacles, and target locations, with the helper agent needing to interpret the primary agent's goals from egocentric visual input. The challenge is significant for human-AI cooperation and planning, extending beyond previous solutions by utilizing realistic visual stimuli and incorporating perturbations in both indoor and outdoor settings. The authors benchmark various models, including a novel agent that combines traditional recognition models with LLMs for planning, establishing important baselines for future research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors propose a new challenge for evaluating socially-aware intelligent agents assisting physically constrained humans.
- The benchmarking of different models, including LLM-based agents, is comprehensive.
- The incorporation of diverse scenarios with indoor and outdoor scenes and perturbations enhances realism.

Weaknesses:
- Key details are missing regarding the helper agent's actions and its awareness of the primary agent's location and actions.
- The specification of metrics in section 3.1 lacks clarity, particularly regarding the design of the success rate and the constants used.
- The absence of error bars in results raises concerns about the reliability of claims made in the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify whether the helper agent autonomously moves objects to target locations or merely to areas accessible to the primary agent. Additionally, the authors should specify how the helper agent tracks the primary agent's location during asynchronous actions. We suggest enhancing the clarity of the success rate metric in section 3.1 and providing references for its design. To improve the reliability of results, we recommend including error bars in the performance metrics. Lastly, we advise the authors to refine the use of the term "social" in the context of intelligence, potentially replacing it with "inter-agent" or "contextual" intelligence, and to discuss plans for participatory engagement with user communities facing accessibility issues.
