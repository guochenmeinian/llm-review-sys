### Key Points
This paper presents Supervised Angular-based Contrastive Learning for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis, aiming to enhance the discrimination and generalization of multimodal representations. The authors propose a novel loss function that incorporates angular margin-based contrastive learning and introduce a self-supervised triplet loss to capture generalized representations across modalities. The experimental setup is extensive, utilizing datasets such as CMU-Mosi and CMU-Mosei.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed angular margin-based contrastive learning enhances discriminative representation.
- The introduction of self-supervised triplet loss is beneficial for generalizing representations.
- The paper is well-organized and presents a thorough experimental analysis.

Weaknesses:
- The related work section is weak and lacks coverage of state-of-the-art methods.
- Some insights, particularly from figures and analyses, are not clearly explained.
- The novelty of the approach is questioned, as it appears to be a simple extension of existing methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section by incorporating more recent and relevant references, including studies such as those found at https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07250 and https://aclanthology.org/W19-4331/. Additionally, clarify the analysis, especially regarding figures 4 and 5, and provide a detailed explanation of the benefits of the loss function defined in equation (11). Address the modality-losing problem by discussing previous works that have tackled this issue, and ensure that the performance improvements in the experimental section are more significant. Lastly, we suggest that the authors refine their explanations to enhance clarity and depth throughout the paper.
