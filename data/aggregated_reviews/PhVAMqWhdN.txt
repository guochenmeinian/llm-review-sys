Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into how cognitive and algorithmic biases affect user behavior and search outcomes, particularly in the context of debated topics. The authors describe a user study with both explorative and confirmatory analyses, concluding that users' attitude changes predominantly occur in the initial phase of search sessions, and that confirmation biases can interact with algorithmic ranking biases, leading to more biased behavior.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study addresses a relevant and significant problem within the information retrieval community.
- The literature review is extensive and well-structured, providing a solid foundation for the research.

Weaknesses:
- The complexity of the study and its results can be overwhelming, with tables that are too packed and small print.
- The theoretical contribution to the field is unclear, raising questions about the paper's fit within ICTIR as opposed to other conferences like SIGIR or ECIR.
- The design of session conditions and the rationale behind certain hypotheses are inadequately explained, leading to potential confusion regarding the experimental setup.
- The limited scope of only four mildly controversial topics and the requirement for users to select queries from a predefined pool restricts the generalizability of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and presentation of the study by simplifying tables and enhancing the explanation of session conditions. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more robust theoretical framework that clearly articulates the novel contributions of their work to the field of information retrieval. Expanding the scope of the study to include more controversial topics and allowing users to formulate their own queries could also enhance the relevance and applicability of the findings.
