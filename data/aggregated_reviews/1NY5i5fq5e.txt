Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of free-space optical dot-product engines aimed at accelerating Transformer models, specifically through experimental results on an SLM-based optical system. The authors estimate system performance and efficiency, comparing them to digital computers, and discuss the scalability of optical processors for future technologies. Additionally, the paper explores optical neural networks (ONNs) and their potential energy efficiency advantages over traditional GPU architectures, proposing that ONNs can achieve significant energy savings for large-scale models. The authors address the complexities of implementing attention mechanisms and the challenges of noise and error analysis, clarifying that their energy calculations are estimates intended to discuss ONNs' efficiency rather than provide precise predictions. They conclude that the use of optics to accelerate large-scale Transformers is a promising avenue for future research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Experimental results on an SLM-based free-space optical system for matrix multiplication are demonstrated.
2. The paper provides a thorough examination of ONNs' energy efficiency, particularly in comparison to GPUs.
3. The authors acknowledge the complexities of implementing attention mechanisms and provide a clear rationale for their assumptions regarding weight streaming.
4. The discussion on noise and error analysis is insightful, emphasizing the importance of photon count for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirements.
5. The paper discusses scalability with future technologies, highlighting the potential benefits of optical computing.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty is questionable, as no new hardware design or algorithm innovations are presented; the SLM-based system is not new, and the claimed optical hardware is primarily designed for CNNs/MLPs. The paper lacks a clear machine learning contribution.
2. The weight-in-place system requires extensive parallel MVM to offset weight programming costs, which may not be feasible for Transformers due to low arithmetic intensity. A weight streaming system may be more appropriate.
3. The implementation of only a small portion of the Transformer layers optically raises questions about the efficiency and performance benefits of using optics in a hybrid system.
4. The noise analysis focuses solely on shot noise, neglecting other significant variations in the system.
5. The assumption of a 10 GHz light modulator array requires further justification, particularly regarding the switching frequency and energy costs associated with large modulators.
6. The paper does not adequately address the power consumption of the light source, TIA, and ADC at high frequencies, nor does it consider memory access bottlenecks.
7. The title "optical Transformer" is overly broad, as the paper primarily focuses on SLM-based free-space optics, which have practical deployment issues. A comparison with other integrated photonic platforms is necessary.
8. The paper lacks a detailed discussion of specific ONN systems and their error profiles, which could enhance the understanding of the broader context.
9. The estimates for GPU efficiency may be overly generous, potentially skewing the comparison with ONNs.
10. There is insufficient exploration of related ONN works, hardware miniaturization, and the use of lookup tables (LUTs).

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of the paper by introducing new hardware designs or algorithm innovations relevant to Transformers. Additionally, further justification for the weight-in-place system's applicability to Transformers is needed, potentially advocating for a weight streaming architecture. The authors should provide a clearer analysis of the efficiency benefits in hybrid systems and expand the noise analysis to include other variations. Justifying the 10 GHz modulation speed and addressing the power consumption of associated components is crucial. We also suggest improving the discussion surrounding related ONN works and hardware to provide a more comprehensive context for their findings. Addressing the potential overestimation of GPU efficiency in their calculations would strengthen the validity of their claims. Including more details on miniaturization and scaling, as well as a deeper exploration of LUTs, would also enhance the paper's contributions to the field. Finally, we suggest narrowing the paper's scope or title to reflect its focus on SLM-based systems and include comparisons with other optical hardware platforms to enhance the discussion.
