### Key Points
This paper presents a method for local unlearning in Gaussian Processes (GPs) to address out-of-distribution issues, which is applicable in areas like transfer learning and Bayesian optimization. The authors formulate an optimization problem to unlearn GPs and develop a linear time GP posterior update method, demonstrating its efficiency through various real-world applications. The paper also discusses the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm, which approximates the optimal solution while significantly reducing computational demands.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The manuscript is well-organized and written to a high standard.  
- The theoretical analysis is sound, and the discussion on computational complexity is essential.  
- The proposed method shows efficiency compared to other baselines.

Weaknesses:  
- The experimental analysis does not adequately support all claims, requiring more in-depth numerical discussions.  
- Figure 1 alone is insufficient to demonstrate the model's superiority.  
- The complexity analysis indicates considerable time requirements with large training sizes.  
- Certain statements in the appendices lack clarity and justification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical explanations regarding the proposed method's performance, particularly how it avoids local optima and whether this advantage is linked to maximizing variance. Additionally, clarify the use of covariance as a kernel function in Appendix B.2, ensuring it is not perceived as a fixed value. We also suggest providing a basis for the statement regarding the tuning of $\eta$ and $\gamma$ and including a brief description of baseline methods in either Appendix B or the related work section to aid reader comprehension. Finally, enhancing the experimental details to allow for reproducibility would significantly benefit the manuscript.
