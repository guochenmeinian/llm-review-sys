Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to best arm identification (BAI) in scenarios where arms exhibit unknown correlations, diverging from traditional frameworks that assume independence. The authors propose algorithms for both bounded and Gaussian reward settings, allowing simultaneous sampling of multiple arms to leverage their covariance structure. The theoretical analysis demonstrates improved sample complexity, supported by empirical evaluations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Originality: The authors introduce a significant advancement in BAI by addressing correlated arms, which has practical implications.
- Theoretical Soundness: The theoretical framework is robust, with both upper and lower bounds established.
- Empirical Validation: The experimental results convincingly support the theoretical claims, and the availability of code enhances reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- Clarity: Certain sections, particularly from Line 59 to Line 123, lack structure and clarity, making it difficult to follow the arguments.
- Practicality: The requirement for a large number of rounds before eliminating suboptimal arms raises concerns about the practicality of the proposed methods.
- Overhead Cost: The potential overhead cost associated with estimating covariance is not adequately discussed, which may impact the practical performance of the algorithms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by restructuring the section from Line 59 to Line 123 to better highlight key points. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explicitly address the overhead cost of estimating covariance in their discussion, clarifying how it compares to scenarios with structured assumptions. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to unify the discussions of Theorems 4.1 and 5.1 to enhance the understanding of their contributions and to provide a more detailed comparison with existing covariance-adaptive bandit works.
