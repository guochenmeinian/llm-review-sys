Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a variant of contrastive learning applied to time series data, demonstrating that the joint distribution of representations can be modeled as Gaussian. The authors validate their theoretical insights through numerical experiments on tasks with up to 46 dimensions. They propose that learning contrastive representations with the infoNCE objective and an L2 constraint allows for effective planning via linear interpolation within the learned representation space.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The problem addressed is fundamental and the theoretical analysis is robust.
2. The writing is clear, facilitating understanding of the main ideas.
3. The experiments effectively illustrate the method's applicability and advantages over traditional dynamic programming approaches.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of using contrastive learning is diminished by its established use in various contexts, although the paper offers new insights regarding Gauss-Markov chain representations.
2. The evaluation section lacks depth; additional experiments would strengthen the paper's contributions.
3. The discussion surrounding the novelty and contributions is insufficient, leading to skepticism about the significance of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation section by incorporating real datasets, such as those from Traffic and Stock areas, to validate their method further. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include running time metrics for each experiment to address efficiency concerns in high-dimensional tasks. We suggest enhancing the discussion of related work to clarify the contributions and novelty of the results, particularly regarding Lemmas 2 and 3, which should be contextualized within existing literature. Furthermore, the authors should consider restructuring the presentation of key results, such as the interpolation property, to emphasize their significance more clearly. Lastly, addressing minor writing issues and clarifying technical terms will enhance overall readability.
