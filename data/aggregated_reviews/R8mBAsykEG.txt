### Key Points
This paper presents RL_CSIO, a reinforcement-learning-based methodology for conducting covert social influence operations (CSIOs), focusing on the trade-offs between maximizing influence and minimizing detectability. The authors conducted an IRB-approved 5-day experiment with 225 human subjects on a virtual social media platform, exploring eight research questions related to RL_CSIO-driven influence campaigns. The study provides insights into bot-human interactions and the dynamics of covert influence campaigns.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow.  
- The authors are commended for conducting an IRB-approved experiment with a substantial number of human subjects, enhancing the credibility of the findings.  
- The innovative application of reinforcement learning allows for dynamic adaptation of bot behavior, contributing fresh insights into the field.  
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics provide a well-rounded assessment of the methodology.  

Weaknesses:  
- The use of a random forest classifier as the bot detector may not align with detection strategies on platforms like X or Facebook, raising concerns about the universal applicability of the conclusions.  
- The dataset of 225 participants is relatively small and unevenly distributed, which may limit generalizability.  
- The abstract is too brief and lacks sufficient detail on the motivation, methodology, and significance of the work.  
- The introduction does not adequately contextualize the proposed approach or its contributions.  
- The analysis of the relationship between influence and activity levels is inconsistent, requiring further clarification.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the abstract to provide a more comprehensive summary of the motivation, methodology, and significance of the work. Additionally, the introduction should include a high-level overview of RL_CSIO and its contributions to enhance reader understanding. We suggest enlarging Figure 1 and adding annotations or a step-by-step explanation to improve clarity. An ablation study should be included to validate the importance of reinforcement learning and graph-based modeling in the proposed framework. Furthermore, a dedicated discussion of the paper's limitations and potential applications for social media platform administrators would strengthen the overall impact of the findings. Lastly, we advise the authors to double-check for typographical errors and ensure all abbreviations are defined upon first mention.
