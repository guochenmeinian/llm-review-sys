Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel speculative execution algorithm, Cascade Speculative Drafting (CS Drafting), aimed at improving the inference efficiency of large language models (LLMs) by integrating vertical and horizontal cascades. The authors propose that the autoregressive generation in the drafting process leads to suboptimal performance, and their method achieves better speedup while maintaining the output distribution of the target model. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model outperforms the vanilla model.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The proposed model introduces a new framework that considers acceleration at different granularities and varying model capabilities.  
2. The method is model-agnostic and does not require additional training.  
3. Experimental results demonstrate better speedups compared to baseline models.  
4. The idea of using multiple draft models is interesting and supported by analysis, showing effective performance.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The model employs a heuristic approach with numerous hyperparameters, particularly the $k$-matrix, complicating its implementation.  
2. The experimental results are insufficient, lacking comparisons with the latest speculative decoding methods and not exploring performance with varying candidate token numbers.  
3. Algorithm 1 is complex and should be simplified; it also lacks clear explanations for some variables.  
4. The paper does not address the algorithmic complexity introduced by additional cascades, nor does it discuss memory and computational constraints.  
5. There is a lack of ablation studies to analyze the impact of different model combinations on performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Algorithm 1 by including an explanation of its overall logic and providing descriptions for the variables used. Additionally, we suggest incorporating relevant ablation experiments to illustrate the relationship between the two cascade methods and conducting analytical experiments to demonstrate robustness with different candidate token counts. Furthermore, simplifying Algorithm 1 would enhance readability, and addressing the algorithmic complexity and memory constraints associated with multiple models would strengthen the paper.
