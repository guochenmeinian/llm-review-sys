### Key Points
This paper presents a system for classifying medical information from multi-turn doctor-patient dialogues, focusing on extracting predefined medical items and their statuses. The authors propose a neural-network-based model utilizing a heterogeneous graph to model relationships among medical entities and statuses, enhanced by attention-based modules. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms several baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the DMIE dataset. The paper includes extensive evaluations, including ablation studies and performance analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper reports significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art models, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
- It is well-structured and clearly written, making it accessible for readers.
- The inclusion of ablation studies adds depth to the understanding of the model's dynamics.

Weaknesses:
- Some technical details regarding the dialogue representation and the processing of term variations are insufficiently explained.
- The novelty of the proposed model is questioned, as it appears to apply existing methodologies without substantial innovation.
- Limited evaluation of recent graph methods and comparisons with newer large pretrained language models are noted as gaps.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how the dialogue representation is obtained, specifically whether the graph from the IIHGC model is generated for each 5-turn window or from the full dataset. Additionally, the authors should provide more information on how term variations are handled and consider including comparisons with newer large pretrained language models. We also suggest that the authors include a qualitative or error analysis to enhance understanding of the model's results and better situate their contributions within the existing literature. Finally, addressing the limitations and ethics sections in the main text would strengthen the paper.
