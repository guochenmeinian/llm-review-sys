Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on variance estimation for Gaussian distributions under compound decision/empirical Bayes settings, assuming bounded means and variances. The authors establish upper and lower bounds on the estimation rate for mean squared error, with the upper bound achieved through a cumulant-based algorithm utilizing Bell polynomials to estimate the cumulant $\gamma_2$. The lower bound is derived using moment matching and $\chi^2$-divergence techniques, leading to indistinguishability results. The paper also discusses the significance of the Gaussian assumption in the context of the results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and organized, with clear explanations and motivations.
- The theoretical results are solid, providing a sharp minimax rate of variance estimation under mild assumptions.
- The use of cumulants instead of moments is innovative and adds depth to the analysis.

Weaknesses:
- The title is too general and may mislead readers; it should reflect the bounded means/variance assumption.
- The motivation for the problem setting is not well articulated, which may hinder understanding for readers unfamiliar with the topic.
- The paper lacks numerical experiments to validate the proposed estimator's performance and does not discuss the computational complexity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the title to include "under bounded means/variance assumption" for clarity. In Section 3, consider re-ordering the explanation to clarify the relevance of moment matching earlier in the discussion. We suggest enhancing the motivation for the problem setting to better engage readers unfamiliar with the literature. Additionally, we encourage the authors to include numerical experiments to demonstrate the estimator's performance and discuss its computational complexity. Lastly, please clarify the dependence of the estimation rate on $L$ and provide insights into the concentration behavior of the estimator.
