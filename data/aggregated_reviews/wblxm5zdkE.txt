Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for online sample selection that addresses individual and interactive constraints, aiming to control false selection rates (FDR) and expected similarity (ES) under an empirical Bayes framework. The authors provide both theoretical guarantees and empirical evaluations using synthetic and real data to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The problem addressed is significant, and the formulation is novel.  
- The paper is well-presented, with clear theoretical and empirical support for the claims made.  
- The simplicity of the online selection rule enhances its practical applicability.  
- Detailed information is provided for replicability, including comparisons with conformal p-values.

Weaknesses:  
- Certain sections, particularly 2.2, 2.3, and 4, may require multiple readings for clarity, indicating a need for improved accessibility.  
- The choice of interaction constraints lacks sufficient motivation, and the implications of assumptions like \hat\mu being a bijection need further discussion.  
- The paper does not adequately address the gaps between ideal and obtained diversity profiles, nor does it explore potential improvements to balance trade-offs between constraints.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper's clarity by revising sections 2.2, 2.3, and 4, possibly including a flowchart to illustrate the algorithm's steps and differences between Oracle and Data-driven selection procedures. A toy example could also enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest providing a longer description and/or table of benchmark methods for empirical performance comparisons. It would be beneficial to clarify the rationale behind the choice of interaction constraints and the implications of the assumption regarding \hat\mu. Lastly, analyzing the gap between ideal and actual diversity profiles and exploring methods to balance trade-offs between constraints could strengthen the paper.
