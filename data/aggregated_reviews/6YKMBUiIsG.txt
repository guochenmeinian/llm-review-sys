Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the compatibility of speculative sampling with watermarking in large language models (LLMs), presenting a no-go theorem that establishes the impossibility of simultaneously achieving maximum watermark strength and sampling efficiency. The authors propose a "two reweight framework" and develop two methods focused on either watermark strength or sampling efficiency. The paper includes theoretical proofs and empirical results to validate these methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces an original framework that integrates unbiased watermarking with speculative sampling, enhancing generation efficiency.
- A rigorous no-go theorem is presented, demonstrating the trade-off between watermark strength and sampling efficiency.
- The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated through clear experimental results and visualizations.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental dataset and models are limited, with a narrow focus on specific datasets and tasks, which may affect generalizability.
- The pseudo-code for the algorithms lacks clarity and detail, hindering reproducibility.
- There is insufficient analysis of watermark robustness against attacks, such as paraphrasing and copy-paste attacks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental coverage by including additional datasets and models to enhance the generalizability of their findings. Additionally, providing a more detailed explanation of the pseudo-code would aid in reproducibility. We suggest that the authors evaluate the robustness of the watermark under the two reweight framework, addressing potential vulnerabilities to attacks. Furthermore, clarifying the implications of the experimental protocol and acknowledging its limitations would strengthen the paper's contributions.
