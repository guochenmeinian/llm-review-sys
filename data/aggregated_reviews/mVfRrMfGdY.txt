Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework utilizing optimal transport theory to derive mechanism-specific and mechanism-agnostic guarantees for subsampling mechanisms in differential privacy. The authors propose a principled approach to analyzing group-privacy amplification through subsampling, generalizing coupling arguments to extend analysis from $1$-neighboring to $K$-neighboring datasets. The framework allows for stronger mechanism-specific guarantees while still recovering mechanism-agnostic ones, particularly for group privacy, where tighter bounds are established. The experiments evaluate privacy guarantees under various mechanisms, including Gaussian, Laplace, and randomized response.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study addresses an important and relevant problem in differential privacy.
- The framework is general and broadly applicable, providing novel insights into privacy amplification due to subsampling.
- The paper demonstrates significant interplay between subsampling and grouping, contributing to the privacy community.

Weaknesses:
- The manuscript is excessively long at 100 pages, lacking concise theoretical analysis in the main text.
- The authors only demonstrate improvements in privacy bounds for group privacy, leaving other practical areas unaddressed.
- The results are not presented in closed form, complicating operationalization.
- Several technical definitions and results, such as Definition 2.2 of RÃ©nyi divergence, are misleading or unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and conciseness of the manuscript, potentially reducing its length. It would be beneficial to provide a more comprehensive theoretical analysis in the main text and address the limitations of the framework in other practical areas. We suggest including closed-form solutions for the privacy amplification results to facilitate operationalization. Additionally, the authors should clarify the implications of their results for group size 1 and provide examples demonstrating the benefits of tailoring analysis to specific mechanisms. Finally, we encourage the authors to enhance the presentation of technical definitions and results for better readability.
