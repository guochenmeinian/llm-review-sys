### Key Points
This paper presents the use of Fourier neural operators (FNO) to solve the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for polariton condensates. The authors provide an extensive introduction to the topic, detailing the standard solving method (SSFM) and the neural operator approach. The training setup is well described, and the method achieves good accuracy with significantly faster computing times, making it a promising approach for simulating complex nonlinear systems in exciton-polariton condensates.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well written, featuring clear figures and good experimental results.  
- It provides a thorough introduction and detailed explanation of the training setup, contributing to reproducibility.  
- The proposed method demonstrates high accuracy and faster computation compared to traditional GPU solvers.  

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty of the approach is questionable, with a lack of clear, intuitive explanations as to why FNO is superior.  
- Some reviewers feel that the paper does not sufficiently address the underlying intuition behind the method's advantages.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the novelty of their approach by providing clearer, more convincing arguments for why FNO is intuitively better than traditional methods. Additionally, enhancing the explanation of the underlying principles could strengthen the paper's impact and clarity.
