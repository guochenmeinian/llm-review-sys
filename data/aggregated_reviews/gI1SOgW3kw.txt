Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of identifiability theory for nonlinear independent component analysis (NICA) by introducing the concept of "structural sparsity" to enhance identifiability without the restrictive assumption of conditional independence among observed variables. The authors propose several theoretical contributions, including identifiability under structural sparsity in undercomplete settings, relaxation of structural sparsity to partial sparsity, and consideration of known dependencies among sources. The work builds upon Zheng et al. (2022) and provides numerical examples to illustrate the applications of the proposed identifiability theorems. The authors employ a sparsity regularizer within a flow-based generative model and validate their approach through experiments on visual datasets, demonstrating improved performance metrics when theoretical assumptions are satisfied.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The manuscript is well-organized and clearly written, addressing foundational issues in nonlinear ICA and making significant contributions to identifiability theorems.
2. The authors effectively remove limitations of previous works, extending the applicability of structural sparsity to more realistic data scenarios.
3. The motivation for relaxing assumptions is well-articulated, addressing common limitations in existing literature.
4. The results are achieved with fewer additional assumptions, making them more likely to hold in practical applications.

Weaknesses:
1. The presentation lacks clarity, particularly regarding the core assumptions and their motivations, making it difficult to evaluate the paper's contributions.
2. Theoretical advances are limited, with few new algorithms or comprehensive experimental validations.
3. The identifiability results in Theorems 4.1 and 4.3 are potentially misleading, as they suggest identification only up to invertible transformations, which may not constitute true identifiability.
4. The experimental validation is limited to visual datasets, lacking breadth in application to other modalities.
5. There is insufficient empirical evaluation comparing the proposed approach to existing methods in terms of source disentanglement or feature extraction.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the core assumptions and their motivations to facilitate a better understanding of the contributions. Additionally, we suggest providing code to replicate the results, as this would enhance the practical utility of the findings. The authors should consider conducting a more thorough ablation study, including various configurations such as the number of samples and grouping structures, to strengthen the empirical validation of their theorems. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to perform statistical tests to compare the proposed methods with baseline methods. We also recommend improving the empirical evaluation by including experiments across a wider range of datasets and modalities to better demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach. Clarifying the relationship between their results and those of Zheng et al. (2022) regarding undercompleteness in the introduction would ensure proper attribution. Additionally, providing a clearer explanation of "block-wise identifiability" in relation to Theorems 4.1 and 4.3 would enhance reader understanding. Lastly, addressing minor writing issues, such as the use of "irreducible subgroup" and sentence structure, would improve clarity.
