### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to learning in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) with non-negativity constraints, introducing the concept of M-kernels derived from M-matrices and positive semidefinite kernels. The authors propose that M-kernels facilitate the solution of non-negative constrained least squares problems in RKHS. The method is theoretically novel and is applied to univariate regression, density estimation, and intensity estimation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The idea of M-kernels is novel and elegantly combines concepts from linear algebra and kernel learning theory.
- The problem addressed is well-motivated and relevant, particularly in applied Bayesian optimization.
- The experiments are thorough and demonstrate the theoretical contributions effectively.

Weaknesses:
- The applicability of M-kernels is limited, as few kernels are known to be M-kernels, primarily in one-dimensional cases.
- The role of the function \(s(N)\) is inadequately discussed, appearing as a compromise rather than a necessity.
- The method is restricted to univariate non-negative functions, limiting its significance compared to existing techniques.
- The presentation contains numerous small grammar and writing errors, affecting clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the function \(s(N)\), possibly categorizing inverse M-kernels in big-O terms to clarify their significance. Additionally, we suggest including multidimensional examples in the experiments to enhance the paper's impact. The authors should also address the limitations of existing non-negative spline fitting methods and consider demonstrating the method on larger datasets, such as long time-series, to showcase its practical utility. Lastly, a thorough spell-check and revision for grammatical accuracy would enhance the overall presentation.
