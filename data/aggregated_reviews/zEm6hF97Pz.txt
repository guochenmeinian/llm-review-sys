Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel mechanism for differential privacy using banded matrix factorization (MF), applicable in both centralized and federated training settings across all privacy budgets. The authors propose a $b$-min-sep-participation schema that generalizes the $(k, b)$-participation from prior work, demonstrating that their approach can outperform DP-SGD in centralized settings and achieve competitive results in federated learning. The mechanism effectively reduces memory and time complexity while addressing the sensitivity of participation schemes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The problem of Matrix Factorization for differential privacy is well-motivated, and the results appear correct.
2. The proposed mechanism shows significant improvements over existing methods, particularly in centralized settings.
3. The paper is well-structured, with a clear flow of arguments and detailed experimental results supporting the claims.

Weaknesses:
1. The presentation is not self-contained, relying heavily on appendices, which may hinder reader comprehension.
2. The results for the federated learning setting are not clearly summarized, leaving ambiguity regarding their implications.
3. Some technical aspects, such as the notation for $\hat{b}$-banded matrices and the definitions in Theorem 1, are confusing and lack clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by ensuring that key definitions, such as $\hat{b}$-banded matrices, are introduced early and consistently throughout the paper. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a clear summary of results for the federated learning setting to enhance understanding. It would also be beneficial to include a table comparing the proposed methods with existing ones to directly convey the advantages of their approach. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify technical details in Theorem 1 and the implications of their findings regarding the sensitivity of the mechanism.
