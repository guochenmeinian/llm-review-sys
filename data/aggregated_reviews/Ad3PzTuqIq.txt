### Key Points
This paper presents SpelsNet, a novel point-to-BRep adjacency representation learning method that integrates conventional Linear Algebraic Representation of B-Rep graph structures into the point cloud domain. SpelsNet comprises a supervised 3D spatial segmentation head for classifying B-Rep element types and memberships, and a graph-based head utilizing topological supervision. The authors extend two existing CAD datasets with necessary annotations and conduct extensive experiments, demonstrating SpelsNet's effectiveness and superiority in achieving accurate and topologically consistent segmentation results compared to existing baselines and state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper effectively uses boundary information through a Linear Algebraic Representation, integrating it into a neural network framework with clear explanations.  
2. The method leverages GNN to learn from the edge and face matrix, which is well-suited for handling sparse graph structures.  
3. SpelsNet achieves impressive improvements over existing baselines in most cases.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The focus on CAD models, which lack noise and distortions, raises concerns about the lack of validation on more realistic data.  
2. Several parts of the paper are confusing and require clarification, including the connectivity matrix prediction in Eq. (4), the use of leaky ReLU for sparsity, and the redundancy in segmentation loss predictions.  
3. The training duration of 10 days on 4 A100 GPUs seems excessive for the SparseCNN model, warranting further explanation.  
4. The rationale for predicting edges alongside surfaces is unclear, as engineers may primarily need surface design.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the validation of SpelsNet on more realistic datasets that include noise, occlusions, and shape variations. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the methodology regarding the connectivity matrix in Eq. (4) and reconsidering the use of leaky ReLU for sparsity. The authors should also address the redundancy in segmentation loss predictions and provide a detailed explanation for the prolonged training time. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the necessity of predicting edges in practical applications.
