### Key Points
This paper presents an experimental comparison of various AI-Generated Text Detection (AGTD) techniques across multiple Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors introduce the AI Detectability Index, which ranks LLMs based on how easily their generated text can be identified as AI-generated. The study highlights the ineffectiveness of current detection methods and provides empirical evidence on their limitations, utilizing a substantial dataset of human and machine-generated text (CT^2).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a critical issue in AI text detection and introduces a much-needed benchmark for evaluating detection methods.  
- The experiments are well-designed, covering 15 LLMs and demonstrating the brittleness of existing AGTD techniques.  
- The writing is clear and comprehensive, with significant implications for future AI policies and regulations.  
- The creation of the open-sourced CT^2 dataset and the AI Detectability Index offers valuable resources for researchers.

Weaknesses:  
- The presentation of the paper is disorganized, which detracts from its overall impact.  
- The limitations section is excessively lengthy and could be better integrated into the main body or an appendix.  
- The conclusions focus solely on English, without addressing the generalizability of findings to other languages.  
- The naming of the AI Detectability Index may be misleading, as a higher score indicates easier detection.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization of the paper to enhance clarity and coherence. Additionally, we suggest condensing the limitations section and relocating some content to the main body or an appendix. It is essential to include a discussion on the generalizability of findings to other languages. Furthermore, we advise clarifying the naming of the AI Detectability Index to avoid confusion regarding its implications. Lastly, please ensure that references are properly formatted and check for any duplicates.
