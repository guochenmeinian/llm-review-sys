Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Rank DETR, a method for object detection that integrates rank-awareness into transformer-based detectors at both the architecture and loss levels. The authors propose four rank-oriented designs: a rank-adaptive classification head (RCH), a query ranking layer (QRL), a GIoU-aware classification loss (GCL), and a high-order matching cost (HMC). Experimental results indicate that Rank DETR improves performance over existing DETR models, such as DINO and H-DETR, although some components show limited novelty and effectiveness compared to recent methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant issue in DETRs: the misalignment of class and localization scores.
- It is well-written and presents clear statistical plots, enhancing comprehension.
- The experiments are robust, with detailed ablation studies validating the proposed components.

Weaknesses:
- The engineering approach appears somewhat straightforward, particularly with the introduction of learnable biases.
- The GIoU-aware loss lacks novelty, as it has been explored in prior works like Varifocal loss and Align-DETR, necessitating a more thorough discussion.
- The complexity of the method, including multiple components, does not yield the expected performance improvements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the title to reflect the technical contributions more accurately. Additionally, please clarify the performance degradation associated with the RCH module, particularly its impact on AP_L. Further explanations or illustrations of the learnable logit bias vectors S and the content query C would enhance understanding. We also suggest addressing discrepancies in results between Tables 1 and 3, and providing a more comprehensive comparison with significant ranking-based object detectors, including AP Loss and Rank & Sort Loss. Lastly, a clearer definition of ranking criteria in DETR and a more detailed discussion of the relationship between the proposed method and IoU-related methods are essential.
