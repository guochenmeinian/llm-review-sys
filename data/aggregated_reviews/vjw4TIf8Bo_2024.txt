Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to reduce generation latency in Named Entity Recognition (NER) using Large Language Models (LLMs) through Parallel Decoding in LLM for NER (PaDeLLM-NER). The authors address the high latency from the sequential decoding process by enabling simultaneous decoding of all mentions, which significantly improves inference speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PaDeLLM-NER achieves speedups ranging from 1.76x to 10.22x compared to traditional autoregressive methods while maintaining or enhancing prediction quality across multiple datasets and languages.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The parallel decoding strategy is innovative and effectively addresses a significant bottleneck in LLM inference speed.
- The authors conduct comprehensive experiments across various datasets, languages, and settings, demonstrating the method's effectiveness.
- The reported speedups are substantial, indicating practical implications for NER applications.

Weaknesses:
- The method does not improve inference speed when predicting only one type of entity.
- The performance metrics in Table 3 lack efficiency comparisons with zero-shot and supervised methods, and the performance of AutoReg_aug and AutoReg_struct is not reported.
- The paper lacks clarity on the training resource usage, particularly the base language models used in Tables 4 and 5.
- The writing quality requires improvement, with specific issues such as typos and unclear definitions in the text and tables.
- The aggressive deduplication strategy may overlook critical context in cases of polysemous words and nested structures.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing, addressing typos and providing clear definitions for terms used in the tables. It would be beneficial to report both inference speed and performance metrics in Table 3, including comparisons with zero-shot and supervised methods. Additionally, we suggest including the base language models used in Tables 4 and 5 to enhance understanding of training resource usage. The authors should also consider discussing the implications of their deduplication strategy and how it handles nested structures and polysemous words. Finally, comparing their method with fixed few-shot in-context learning could provide further insights into potential improvements in inference speed.
