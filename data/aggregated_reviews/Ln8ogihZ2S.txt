Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a deep state-space model (DSSM) for state inference and system identification in non-linear dynamical systems, utilizing a smoothing formulation based on the evidence lower bound (ELBO). The authors propose a novel approach to variational inference that enhances scalability and predictive performance, particularly in causal filtering for large state-space scenarios. The model employs a low-rank approximation of the likelihood for computational efficiency and is evaluated on synthetic and neuroscientific data. However, the introduction lacks a comprehensive overview of the existing research landscape, particularly regarding the limitations of methods like DVBF and DKF, which rely on diagonal approximations. The authors compare their approach against older baselines, primarily from before 2016, but do not convincingly address the limitations of previous work, especially concerning VAE-based approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and mostly easy to follow.
- Supplementary material provides detailed hyperparameter, notation, and algorithm information.
- The proposed method demonstrates solid scalability and predictive performance, particularly in causal filtering for large state-space models.
- The authors' variational inference network structure and the associated novel ELBO (Eq. 22) are significant contributions.
- The model is theoretically principled, flexible, and capable of handling missing data, which may impact the NeurIPS community.

Weaknesses:
- The limitations of previous work are not convincingly addressed, particularly regarding the challenges of VAE-based approaches.
- The introduction does not effectively outline the problems in the research area or how the current work addresses the limitations of previous approaches.
- The related work section is outdated, lacking references to more recent advancements that share ideas with this work.
- Technical soundness issues arise from incorrect equations and unclear definitions, particularly regarding pseudo-observations and their role in the model.
- The use of pseudo-targets in the formulation, particularly in Eq. (12), is confusing and lacks clarity regarding their necessity and instantiation.
- The experimental evaluation lacks depth, with insufficient benchmarks against recent works and unclear figure presentations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by clearly articulating the limitations of previous works such as DVBF and DKF, and how their approach addresses these shortcomings. Additionally, we suggest addressing the technical soundness issues by correcting Eq. (6) and providing clearer definitions for pseudo-observations. We encourage the authors to clarify the role and necessity of pseudo-targets in their formulation, particularly in Eq. (12), and consider simplifying the notation to reduce confusion. Furthermore, we recommend improving the clarity of the experimental section by restructuring figures and ensuring all are adequately referenced in the text. Lastly, we suggest including more recent related works in the literature review and enhancing the experimental evaluation with better benchmarks and discussions on the model's performance.
