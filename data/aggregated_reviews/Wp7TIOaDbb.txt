Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Lipschitz loss function aimed at computing approximate interior Nash equilibria in normal-form games, facilitating unbiased Monte Carlo estimation and enabling scalable stochastic optimization techniques. The authors also introduce a loss function for quantal-response equilibrium (QRE) and provide illustrative experiments to support their claims. Additionally, the paper discusses the significance of well-isolated equilibria in achieving polynomial rates for general-sum multi-player games, clarifying the limitations of classical solvers, such as gambit, in scaling to large game instances. The authors distinguish their algorithmic approach from the solution concept used to evaluate performance and acknowledge the potential extension of their techniques to extensive-form games (EFGs).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper offers a unique approach to equilibrium computation in multi-player games, deriving loss functions that enhance scalability in stochastic optimization. The proposed unbiased estimator addresses limitations of existing loss functions in constrained settings. The writing is clear, and the authors effectively contextualize their results within existing literature. The paper also effectively addresses concerns regarding experimental evaluation and the limitations of classical solvers, providing a clear distinction between their algorithmic approach and performance evaluation methods. Furthermore, the acknowledgment of potential extensions to EFGs demonstrates a forward-thinking perspective.

Weaknesses:  
The assumption of an interior Nash equilibrium is overly strong, as such equilibria can be computed in polynomial time via linear programming, undermining the paper's motivation. The claim of a new FPTAS for polymatrix games appears to be known, and the paper lacks evidence of practical benefits from the proposed methodology. The experiments are limited to small games, failing to demonstrate scalability, and the benchmarks compared against are not state-of-the-art. Additionally, the proof of Corollary 1 raises concerns about the convergence guarantees. The focus on normal-form games may limit the paper's impact in the broader context of computational game theory, particularly regarding extensive-form games. Some theoretical results, such as Theorem 1, rely on dimensions that may seem artificial and disconnected from practical applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding the assumption of interior Nash equilibria, explicitly stating its implications in the abstract and preliminaries. It would be beneficial to provide evidence supporting the practical applicability of the proposed methodology. We suggest conducting experiments on larger games and including more relevant benchmarks, such as the Lemke-Howson algorithm. Furthermore, we advise clarifying the oracle used in the BLiN method and explicitly stating conditions for strong convexity of the loss function. Additionally, we recommend improving the applicability of their proposed theory to extensive-form games to enhance the paper's relevance. We suggest that the authors clarify the assumptions underlying Theorem 1 to strengthen its connection to practical applications in game theory. Finally, addressing the concerns regarding the artificiality of certain theoretical constructs and the missing punctuation and overfull equations in the appendix will enhance the paper's presentation.
