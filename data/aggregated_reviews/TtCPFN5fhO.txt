Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel parameter and neuron pruning strategy aimed at enhancing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. The authors propose a method that utilizes a sensitivity metric based on the gradients of energy scores to identify and remove near-zero and high-sensitivity parameters. The empirical results indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves superior performance in OOD detection tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is well-motivated and demonstrates promising empirical results.
- The proposed algorithm is simple and effective, showing consistently high performance in OOD detection tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical connection between sensitivity and OOD performance lacks clarity, and the reliance on intuition for sensitivity usage may limit understanding.
- The writing quality is subpar, with numerous typos and grammatical errors that hinder readability.
- The method's performance is heavily dependent on pruning thresholds, which can adversely affect accuracy on the original in-distribution classification task.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the theoretical explanations connecting sensitivity to OOD performance. Additionally, addressing the writing quality by correcting typos and grammatical issues is essential for better readability. It would be beneficial to provide a more detailed discussion on the selection of hyper-parameters and the potential use of alternative statistics for pruning. Furthermore, we suggest exploring the impact of using a fixed threshold for pruning sensitivity values and considering pruning based on a subset of the training set to enhance efficiency. Lastly, an explicit explanation of how to combine OPNP with ReAct should be included.
