Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents RL4CO, a comprehensive benchmark and modular framework for applying reinforcement learning (RL) to combinatorial optimization (CO) problems. The authors emphasize scalability, generalization capabilities, and a unified implementation that simplifies the development and comparison of neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) solvers. Key contributions include a benchmark suite covering 23 state-of-the-art methods and over 20 CO problems, a focus on autoregressive sequence generation, and the introduction of novel metrics for performance assessment. The authors clarify that RL4CO is distinct from the ML4CO competition, positioning it as a standardized benchmark aimed at solving a broader class of CO problems without relying on traditional solvers or labeled datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses critical topics such as zero-shot generalization, sample efficiency, and adaptability, appealing to a broad audience in the research community.
2. The modular design enhances flexibility and allows for easy modifications and comparisons, supported by well-known libraries like TorchRL and PyTorchLightning.
3. The authors have made significant revisions to clarify the model structure, experimental results, and the significance of the library, including detailed examples and documentation.
4. The inclusion of classical solvers' performance in benchmarks adds value to the evaluation of RL4CO.

Weaknesses:
1. The experimental scope is limited, primarily focusing on small instances (20/50 nodes) of TSP and CVRP, which may not yield significant insights or contributions to the field.
2. The framework description is succinct, lacking detailed explanations of its capabilities and the rationale behind the chosen methodologies.
3. The paper tends to be overly descriptive, lacking focus on technical contributions, and important details about the implementation and datasets are insufficiently described.
4. Some figures are too small to convey necessary information, and Python commands should be relegated to the appendix to save space.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors include a comparison with benchmark studies in related fields to better contextualize their contributions and improve the scope of their experimental processes to provide more compelling evidence for the necessity of the library.
2. The authors should expand the evaluation to include more baseline methods and larger, more diverse environments to enhance the robustness of their findings and the overall contributions of the paper.
3. We suggest that the authors clarify the unique contributions of their modular framework compared to existing implementations, particularly in relation to Jumanji, and provide more detailed explanations of the metrics introduced.
4. Improving the clarity and organization of the writing, particularly in the preliminaries and framework descriptions, will enhance reader comprehension. Additionally, the authors should address concerns about the library's community engagement by demonstrating ongoing efforts in development and maintenance.
5. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide clearer explanations of the library's claims regarding being "extensive," "efficient," and "modularized," and to select one or two "home-grown examples" to highlight in the main paper to mitigate the overwhelming nature of the extensive appendix.
