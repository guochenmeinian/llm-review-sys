Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an efficient algorithm for generating local cuts in integer programming relaxations, utilizing a variant of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm. The authors demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness through a case study on the multidimensional knapsack problem. The proposed method aims to replace traditional LP/IP-based separation routines with an optimization-based approach, showcasing its potential for generating strong cuts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper contributes to solving the generic integer programming problem efficiently.
- It includes experimental results that validate the usefulness of the proposed algorithm.
- The writing is clear and precise, making complex ideas accessible.

Weaknesses:
- There is a lack of discussion regarding the relevance of the studied problem to the NeurIPS community, raising concerns about its appeal to a broader audience.
- The computational study results are somewhat underwhelming, with limited comparisons to existing methods in the knapsack domain.
- The paper does not sufficiently clarify how the proposed method can be applied to other types of integer programming problems.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the relevance of their work to the NeurIPS audience, providing motivation for its inclusion in the conference. Additionally, we suggest including more detailed comparisons to existing lifting methods for knapsack inequalities and clarifying the differences between their approach and traditional lift-and-project methods. It would also be beneficial to provide a clearer explanation of how the proposed method can be adapted to other integer programming problems, along with a more comprehensive evaluation against multiple existing algorithms.
