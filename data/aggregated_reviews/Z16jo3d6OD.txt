Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a unified framework for minimizing rank-based losses using an ADMM algorithm, incorporating a pool adjacent violators (PAV) algorithm for one of the subproblems. The authors develop a proximal alternating direction method of multipliers for optimizing rank-based loss and analyze the convergence under specific conditions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms traditional methods in efficiency and effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is mathematically robust and technically sound.
- The proposed methods improve upon existing ADMM approaches and provide a new perspective on an important problem.
- The clarity of presentation and organization enhances understanding, with adequate theoretical and empirical results supporting the claims.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution may not seem significant enough, and the applicability of the results to real-world machine-learning problems is not clearly demonstrated.
- The representation of the loss vector function is unclear, and the theoretical basis for the discrete form of spectral risk requires further explanation.
- Potential practical limitations of the proposed method are not elaborated upon, particularly regarding its efficiency in non-linear settings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the loss vector function representation and provide a detailed theoretical basis for the discrete form of spectral risk. Additionally, we suggest including a comparison of the proposed method with similar-purpose frameworks to highlight performance differences. It would be beneficial to elaborate on the potential practical limitations of the method and clarify how the algorithm can be generalized to non-linear models. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explicitly discuss the applicability of their results to real machine-learning problems.
