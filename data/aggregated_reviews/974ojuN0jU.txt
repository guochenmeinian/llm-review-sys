Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method, RandNet-Parareal, for accelerating the simulation of partial differential equations (PDEs) by converting them into systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The authors propose a framework that integrates random neural networks with the parareal approach, demonstrating improved computational efficiency through various numerical experiments involving complex PDE systems. The paper claims theoretical guarantees for the method and showcases significant speed-ups compared to traditional solvers. Furthermore, the authors enhance existing Parallel-in-Time (PinT) methods for solving ODEs and PDEs, emphasizing that their method's relevance extends beyond generating training data for machine learning, impacting fields such as atmospheric dynamics, biomedical processes, earthquake engineering, and financial modeling.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and organized, providing clear descriptions of the algorithm and numerical results.
- The proposed method effectively combines random neural networks with parareal concepts, showing significant speed-ups in simulations.
- The evaluation includes a variety of PDEs, demonstrating the method's applicability.
- The paper clarifies misconceptions about its contributions to PinT methods and highlights the broad applicability of numerical methods for solving differential equations across multiple scientific and engineering domains.
- The use of random neural networks for modeling correction terms is a notable innovation that enhances speed.

Weaknesses:
- The problem studied is domain-specific, potentially limiting its appeal to the broader scientific machine-learning community.
- There is a lack of discussion on the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost, which is crucial for high-fidelity simulations.
- The paper does not adequately compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art neural PDE solvers, restricting the evaluation of its effectiveness.
- Some reviewers still hold misconceptions regarding the paper's focus on ODE solvers.
- Sections 2 and 3 could be condensed, with some content moved to the appendix, while the robustness study should be included in the main text.
- The paper lacks trade-off results, which could provide additional insights into the performance of the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost, providing quantitative metrics for performance comparison. Additionally, the authors should include comparisons with other neural PDE solvers to better contextualize their contributions. To enhance the paper's relevance to the AI community, we suggest incorporating a GPU implementation of the proposed method and exploring its application in the context of diffusion models. Furthermore, we recommend improving clarity regarding the distinction between their work and traditional ODE solvers to address lingering misconceptions. Finally, restructuring the paper to include a dedicated "Related Work" section and including trade-off results would improve clarity and organization.
