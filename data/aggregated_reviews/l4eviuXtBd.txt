### Key Points
This paper presents HadSkip, an adaptive layer-skipping method for fast pre-trained language model inference, specifically targeting Transformer architectures. The authors propose a three-stage training process involving fine-tuning, freezing parameters while adding discrete binary gates, and jointly training gates and parameters with knowledge distillation. Experimental results indicate that HadSkip outperforms various early exit strategies, particularly on GLUE tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is novel and combines techniques in an interesting way.
- Empirical results demonstrate superior performance compared to early exit methods.
- The approach is straightforward and can integrate with other model acceleration techniques.

Weaknesses:
- The introduction of the gating module adds complexity and parameters without sufficient analysis of its impact.
- Limited dataset diversity in experiments and lack of efficiency metrics like FLOPs or latency.
- Comparisons with relevant baselines, such as LayerDrop and dynamic token pruning, are missing.
- The novelty is questioned due to the complexity of the method compared to existing dynamic neural network approaches.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the gating module's additional parameters and computational complexity. It would be beneficial to include results on a broader range of datasets and report efficiency metrics such as FLOPs and latency. Additionally, we suggest incorporating comparisons with LayerDrop and dynamic token pruning to strengthen the evaluation. Finally, clarifying whether the code will be open-sourced would enhance transparency.
