Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a visual prompt tuning method aimed at addressing source-free domain adaptation in semantic segmentation. The authors propose a prompt adapter for stage-wise prompt tuning, allowing the adaptation of a frozen pre-trained model to a target domain. Additionally, an adaptive pixel pruning method is introduced to compute KL divergence for selecting valuable pixels during training. The method is validated through experiments on various tasks, demonstrating its efficacy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for applying prompt tuning to source-free domain adaptation is clearly articulated.
- The proposed visual prompt tuning approach is novel and represents the first work of its kind in this context.
- The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with experiments that effectively demonstrate the benefits of the proposed method.
- The design of the adaptive pseudo-label correction is innovative and can be applied to other unsupervised and semi-supervised tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed method, while intended to be parameter-efficient, requires significantly more learnable parameters compared to previous methods like CPSL and VPT.
- The performance improvements are modest, particularly in the standard single-source setting, with enhancements over VPT being minor.
- The computational cost of the proposed method is not adequately discussed, raising questions about its efficiency.
- Comparisons with commonly used convolutional networks are lacking, limiting the assessment of the method's performance against state-of-the-art techniques.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on computational costs to clarify the efficiency of their method compared to others. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments to verify the benefits of fixing the backbone during adaptation and to address the potential issue of knowledge forgetting. It would be beneficial to include a parameter comparison among the proposed methods in the ablation study to identify which components significantly impact memory efficiency. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide a comparison of their method's performance with convolutional neural networks to strengthen the evaluation of their approach.
