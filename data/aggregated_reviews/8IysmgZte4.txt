Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach called Generalized Occupancy Models (GOMs) for model-based reinforcement learning (RL) that facilitates the transfer of learning across tasks with varying reward functions. GOMs learn a distribution of successor features from a stationary dataset, allowing for the rapid selection of optimal actions in new tasks while mitigating compounding errors. The authors propose a method for zero-shot policy optimization using distributional successor features, emphasizing efficient planning under deterministic dynamics. The paper evaluates the method in an offline setting, comparing it against baselines and providing a theoretical analysis and empirical validation in simulated robotics problems, demonstrating its potential effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and presents a compelling theoretical analysis of GOMs, supported by empirical validation in various simulated robotics scenarios.  
- The approach of modeling distributions over successor features is novel and addresses the policy-dependence issue of traditional methods.  
- The proposed method demonstrates strong performance in zero-shot policy optimization and offers a versatile framework compatible with various planners.  
- The authors have conducted additional experiments with 10 seeds, reinforcing the robustness of their results.  
- The theoretical framework is clear, and the experimental results are encouraging, indicating practical applicability.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper may overstate the generalization capabilities of GOMs, particularly regarding the assumption of a shared state space across tasks, which is often unrealistic.  
- The statistical significance of the results is limited, as experiments report averages over only four seeds with one standard deviation, raising concerns about reliability.  
- The reliance on a pre-specified feature function that linearly expresses rewards is a limitation, and the paper lacks clarity on why Fourier features perform better than others or if this is task-dependent.  
- The term "generalized occupancy model" is considered misleading and does not adequately highlight the unique contributions of the work.  
- The naming conventions may cause confusion regarding the method's focus on features rather than states.  
- The framing of GOM in relation to other models may detract from the distinctiveness of the proposed approach.  
- The experimental design could be improved by including tasks with fundamentally different reward functions rather than variations of the same task.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental setup by increasing the number of seeds to at least 10, ideally 20-30, to enhance the statistical robustness of the findings. Additionally, the authors should consider including a broader range of tasks that involve distinct reward functions to better demonstrate the generalization capabilities of GOMs. Clarifying the role of Fourier features and providing insights on their applicability across different tasks would strengthen the paper. We also recommend improving the clarity of terminology by renaming the method to better reflect its unique contributions, such as emphasizing "zero-shot policy optimization" in the title and method name. Consider changing the title to "Zero-Shot Policy Optimization via Distributional Successor Features" and naming the method "Diffusion Distributional Successor Features (DDSF)." Finally, ensure that the final revision incorporates the additional experiments and discussions to solidify the paper's contributions.
