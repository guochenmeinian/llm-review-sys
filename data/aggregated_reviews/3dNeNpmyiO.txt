### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for zero-shot drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction, termed TextDDI, which utilizes textual information from drug descriptions. The proposed model integrates a large language model (LLM)-based DDI predictor with a reinforcement learning (RL)-based information selector to enhance prediction accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that TextDDI outperforms baseline models on the DrugBank and TWOSIDES datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The authors propose an innovative approach that effectively combines LLMs with RL for information selection, addressing a critical healthcare issue regarding adverse DDIs.  
- The experimental design is robust, with detailed reporting on datasets and computational costs, and the results indicate significant performance improvements over prior work.  

Weaknesses:  
- The rationale behind the model's superior performance remains unclear, particularly as the method without detailed descriptions also yields promising results.  
- Concerns exist regarding potential data leakage and the adequacy of the input length, which may limit the model's effectiveness in real-world applications.  
- The greedy nature of the information selector could lead to suboptimal predictions, and the evaluation metrics used may not fully capture the model's performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the dataset construction process and address potential data leakage issues. Additionally, an ablation study comparing the DDI predictor with and without textual features should be included to substantiate the results. The authors should also consider expanding the input length beyond 256 tokens to evaluate the RL selector's performance under more realistic conditions. Finally, we suggest exploring alternative methods, such as beam search, to optimize the information selection process and mitigate the risks associated with greedy approaches.
