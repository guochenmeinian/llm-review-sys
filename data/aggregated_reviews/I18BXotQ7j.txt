Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative approach to the image geolocalization problem by framing it as image-to-GPS retrieval, rather than traditional image retrieval or classification. The authors propose a method that utilizes Random Fourier Features (RFF) to encode geospatial locations and align them with features from a CLIP visual encoder, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. The method demonstrates potential applications in text geolocalization and classification, showcasing its versatility.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant problem in vision, with a novel approach that directly relates images to locations through contrastive learning.
- The proposed method requires less training data than traditional approaches and allows for a flexible GPS gallery during inference.
- Extensive evaluation shows state-of-the-art performance on various datasets and scales, with compelling results in related applications.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation of the GPS gallery is limited to locations sampled from the training set, which undermines the global localization theme and raises questions about the location encoder's true global applicability.
- Some sections lack clarity, such as missing dataset information in experiments and insufficient detail on the text query-based geolocalization results.
- The presentation quality could be improved, particularly in the introduction and conclusion, which lack adequate motivation and flow.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation of the GPS gallery by exploring different sampling distributions and granularity to assess their impact on performance. Additionally, please clarify which datasets were used in specific experiments and enhance the presentation quality by providing more motivation in the introduction and refining the conclusion for better coherence. It would also be beneficial to include quantitative comparisons of runtime and memory footprint against existing approaches, and to explore the performance of text encoding at smaller scales. Lastly, consider addressing the societal implications of the approach regarding privacy and surveillance concerns.
