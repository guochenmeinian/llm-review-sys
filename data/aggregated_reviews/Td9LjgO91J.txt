### Key Points
This paper presents a pre-training framework for learning representations of nodes and words in text-attributed graphs, termed Node Representation Update Pre-training Architecture (NRUP). The authors construct a hierarchical text-attributed graph that integrates original nodes and word nodes, applying four self-supervised tasks for pre-training. The experimental results on the ogbn-arxiv dataset demonstrate the method's effectiveness and competitive performance compared to baseline approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The writing is clear and easy to follow.
2. The hierarchical text-attributed graph construction is reasonable and novel.
3. The multi-task graph pre-training framework addresses the underutilization of relationships between nodes and words.
4. The proposed framework can be applied to various language models (LM) and graph neural networks (GNN).

Weaknesses:
1. The construction of the hierarchical text-attributed graph appears costly.
2. The evaluation relies solely on one dataset, which raises concerns about the model's universality.
3. The pre-training objectives heavily depend on textual attributes, neglecting second-order relationships crucial for understanding graph structure.
4. The experiments do not include comparisons with methods that utilize both LM and GNN.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical robustness by evaluating the model on multiple datasets to demonstrate its universality. Additionally, we suggest addressing the memory cost problem explicitly and comparing the space complexity. Clarifying the meaning of the "words" column in the results and ensuring that the hyper-parameters for the coefficients of different losses are specified would enhance the paper's clarity. Finally, incorporating edge weights and considering second-order relationships in the graph structure would strengthen the framework's effectiveness.
