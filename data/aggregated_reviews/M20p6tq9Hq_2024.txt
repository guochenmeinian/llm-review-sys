Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for identifying causal and exogenous variables in Gaussian Additive Noise Models using purely observational data. The authors propose that causal variables can be identified up to a layer-wise transformation, leveraging score functions derived from the log-likelihood. The technique is validated through numerical simulations, although the identifiability results appear weaker compared to prior works that assume interventional data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant problem in causal representation learning without relying on interventional data, which is a more practical setting.
- The notion of identifiability up to layer-wise transformations is novel and could have broader applications.
- The proposed method is practical and well-presented.

Weaknesses:
- The claim of being the first to establish identifiability guarantees in the purely observational setting lacks nuance, as prior works have made similar claims with weaker assumptions.
- The assumption of linearity in the mixing function is a significant restriction, undermining the paper's claims.
- The computational expense of optimizing the Jacobian is not adequately discussed.
- The experiments are limited to synthetic data, necessitating validation on real-world datasets to assess practical applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the precision of their claims regarding identifiability guarantees, particularly in relation to prior works. Clarifying the assumptions made about the mixing function and discussing the computational challenges of optimizing the Jacobian would enhance the paper's rigor. Additionally, we encourage the authors to include real-world data applications to validate their theoretical results and to provide a more detailed discussion on the limitations of identifiability up to upstream layers.
