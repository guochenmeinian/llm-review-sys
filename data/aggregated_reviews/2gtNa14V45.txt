Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a generation paradigm called “OneActor” for consistent subject generation in text-to-image tasks, utilizing a “cluster-guided score function” to enhance image consistency. The authors propose a one-shot tuning approach that incorporates auxiliary samples and two inference strategies—semantic interpolation and cluster guidance—to improve generation quality. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the method's effectiveness, showcasing superior subject consistency and faster tuning speeds compared to existing techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors provide a novel insight into clustering different subjects, which serves as the foundation for their method.
2. The derivation of formulas is thorough and error-free, with code provided for reproducibility.
3. The experiments are extensive, including both qualitative and quantitative analyses, with sensible ablation studies and user evaluations.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of splitting scores into target and auxiliary components is somewhat straightforward; comparisons with multi-concept text-to-image research, such as Kumari et al., would strengthen the contribution.
2. There are typographical errors, such as the repeated notation for conditional and unconditional scores in line 119.
3. Some experimental results lack consistency, as illustrated by the beard of an old man in Figure 4 and the comparative quality of a hobbit generated by DB.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty aspect by comparing their results with existing multi-concept text-to-image methods. Additionally, addressing typographical errors will enhance clarity. We suggest refining the experimental results to ensure consistency across all generated images, particularly in complex scenarios. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore the connection between their insights and score-SDE, as well as to clarify the advantages of their method over attention-based approaches in neural networks.
