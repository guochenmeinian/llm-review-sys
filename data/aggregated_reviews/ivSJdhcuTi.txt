### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive survey on out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in natural language processing (NLP). The authors propose a novel taxonomy categorizing OOD challenges into data perspective (domain generalization) and feature perspective (shortcut learning). They summarize various methods for enhancing OOD generalization, emphasizing its significance in high-stakes applications and the implications for social biases. The paper also discusses the evolving definition of OOD in the context of large language models (LLMs) and reviews recent evaluations of their OOD capabilities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a crucial problem in NLP, making it highly relevant to current research.
- It provides a well-structured overview of OOD issues and a novel taxonomy that aids understanding.
- The comprehensive coverage of tasks, datasets, and evaluation metrics related to OOD generalization stimulates further discussion on model robustness.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks concrete solutions or strategies for addressing OOD generalization.
- Some key concepts, particularly regarding LLMs, are not clearly defined, leading to confusion.
- There is insufficient quantitative analysis comparing the effectiveness of different methods on benchmark datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of concepts related to "Pretrained Language Models" and "Large-scale Language Models," ensuring consistent definitions throughout the paper. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide more detailed discussions on the limitations of current OOD datasets and evaluation practices. Empirical comparisons of the effectiveness of various methods on benchmark OOD tasks should be included to enhance the paper's practical insights. Finally, we encourage the authors to better highlight recommended strategies for addressing different OOD issues throughout the text.
