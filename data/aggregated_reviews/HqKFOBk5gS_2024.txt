### Key Points
This paper presents a novel watermarking technique called Shallow Diffuse, which effectively decouples watermark embedding from the diffusion sampling process. By utilizing low-dimensional subspaces, the authors address significant challenges such as vulnerability to attacks and lack of flexibility, supporting both server-side and user-side watermarking. The method is validated through extensive experiments, demonstrating superior robustness, consistency, and detectability compared to existing techniques. The writing is clear and coherent, effectively conveying the study's motivation and methodology.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The method is novel and provides a fresh perspective on watermarking by leveraging low-dimensional subspaces, enhancing robustness and invisibility while maintaining image quality.  
- Shallow Diffuse is backed by rigorous theoretical guarantees, establishing bounds (Theorems 1 and 2) that ensure watermark reliability, which is rare in the field.  
- The approach is flexible, applicable in both server-side and user-side scenarios, making it practical for various applications.  
- Extensive experimental validation supports the method's effectiveness, with well-organized tables and figures enhancing clarity.

Weaknesses:  
- The reliance on DDIM inversion introduces errors into the watermarking process, necessitating a more detailed investigation into these errors and their impact.  
- The paper lacks detailed performance benchmarks regarding computational costs and scalability in real-world scenarios.  
- There is limited exploration of potential downsides, particularly the method's performance under extreme adversarial conditions or complex corruption scenarios.  
- The motivation for a unified method applicable to both user and server scenarios is not fully articulated, raising questions about its necessity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on related works to provide a clearer context for their contributions. Additionally, a more detailed investigation into the errors introduced by DDIM inversion, including alternative methods to minimize these errors, would strengthen the paper. We also suggest including performance benchmarks related to computational costs, memory usage, and execution time to clarify the trade-offs of using Shallow Diffuse. Finally, addressing the method's vulnerabilities under extreme adversarial conditions and articulating the motivation for a unified approach would enhance the paper's depth and clarity.
