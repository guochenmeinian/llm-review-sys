Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to decision-making by analyzing outcome control and benefit fairness. The authors introduce new definitions of fairness related to benefits and propose algorithms that ensure fair outcomes. They utilize causal analysis to support their framework, particularly in clinical decision-making contexts, and provide theoretical guarantees for their algorithms' optimality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper proposes new fairness notions for outcome control, which is significant in various decision-making scenarios.
- A simple example enhances the paper's readability by illustrating different aspects of the proposed framework.
- The algorithms are theoretically analyzed, demonstrating their optimality and fairness satisfaction.

Weaknesses:
- The main paper lacks extensive results across diverse settings, relying heavily on a single running example.
- There is insufficient discussion on the limitations of causal knowledge, particularly regarding the computation of counterfactuals.
- Some definitions and notations, such as those in Definition 3, are unclear, potentially confusing readers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the limitations of causal knowledge, particularly when computing counterfactuals and path-specific counterfactuals. Additionally, we suggest providing clearer definitions and notations throughout the paper, especially in Definition 3, to enhance reader comprehension. Expanding the evaluation to include more diverse experimental settings would strengthen the paper's contributions. Lastly, clarifying the relationship between benefit fairness and traditional fairness notions, as well as the role of the budget in the decision-making process, would be beneficial.
