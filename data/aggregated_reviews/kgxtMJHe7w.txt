### Key Points
This paper presents a method called "selective labeling" aimed at reducing the cost of acquiring human-annotated labels for visually rich documents such as invoices and receipts. The authors propose simplifying the labeling task to a binary "yes/no" format for extraction candidates identified by a model trained on partially labeled documents. The method leverages active learning to focus on uncertain predictions, demonstrating through experiments that it can decrease labeling costs by up to 10 times while maintaining comparable performance across various document types.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed method is straightforward and easily applicable, addressing a significant problem in information extraction from visually rich documents.  
- Extensive evaluation reveals insightful results regarding the method's performance under different conditions.  
- The study provides sufficient support for its claims, contributing to the understanding of cost-effective labeling strategies.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks a comprehensive discussion of the candidate generator and scorer model, which could enhance its self-containment.  
- There is a notable limitation regarding the inability to generate candidates for rare fields not present in the initial document set.  
- Reproducibility is hindered by the use of private datasets, and the absence of a codebase limits broader adoption and benchmarking.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by providing additional details on the candidate selection model and exploring the synergy between different models and the proposed selective labeling method. Additionally, conducting experiments on public datasets would enhance reproducibility and facilitate wider dissemination of the work. Clarifying how the model extrapolates to fields not present in the initial set of documents and providing an algorithmic description of the selective labeling steps would also strengthen the paper. Finally, we encourage the authors to consider releasing the codebase to support further research and validation of their approach.
