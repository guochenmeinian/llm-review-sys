Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a unified dataset for LANDSAT, specifically designed for self-supervised learning (SSL) in Earth Observation, comprising 5 million images across five generations of the satellite constellation. The authors propose improvements over existing methodologies, particularly in sampling strategies and dataset construction, and created two new datasets for evaluation while revitalizing existing datasets. They emphasize the differences between their dataset and others, such as SSL4EO-S12, and clarify the technical aspects of their sampling methods and decoder architecture. The authors also address concerns regarding the validity of benchmarks derived from automatic processing and the implications for model training, providing a comprehensive resource for training and benchmarking models on four distinct tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
- The dataset's scale (5 million images) and global coverage make it a valuable resource for pre-training Earth Observation models.
- The authors provide a clear explanation of their methodology and improvements over previous works, enhancing the dataset's utility.
- The revitalization of existing datasets demonstrates a commendable and resource-efficient approach.
- The manuscript has been revised to address reviewer concerns, improving clarity and detail.
- The authors propose four distinct benchmarks, which add value to the dataset.

**Weaknesses:**
- Concerns arise regarding the benchmarks' ground truth labels, which are derived from automatic processing with low accuracy, potentially undermining the validity of training large deep learning models.
- The rationale behind the inclusion of 138 foundation models is unclear, raising questions about their necessity and leading to some imprecise terminology.
- The analysis of results lacks depth, primarily reporting outcomes without sufficient interpretation, although it has been expanded upon since initial reviews.
- The paper could benefit from a more comprehensive comparison with existing SSL datasets in remote sensing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the benchmarks by addressing the implications of the low accuracy of ground truth labels and providing a more detailed analysis of the results. Specifically, an ablation study would help elucidate the value of the pre-training dataset. Additionally, please clarify the rationale behind the number of foundation models and consider using stratified random sampling across land cover and land use (LCLU) classes to avoid biases in dataset representation. More explicit differences between your dataset and SSL4EO-S12, particularly regarding the spectral bands and spatial resolution of the sensors, should be provided. We suggest including a detailed explanation of the seasonal attributes in the dataset and enhancing the analysis of results to provide deeper insights. Furthermore, consider reporting the performance of models trained from scratch to give perspective on the benefits of pre-training, and explore the use of LoRa to facilitate fine-tuning. Lastly, a summary table comparing existing SSL datasets in remote sensing would strengthen the introduction and enhance clarity.
