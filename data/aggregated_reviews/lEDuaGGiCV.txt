Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents LUCY, a framework for converting text-to-SQL queries aimed at databases with numerous tables and complex relationships. The authors propose a three-phase workflow: MatchTables for identifying relevant tables and attributes, GenerativeView for constructing a view using a constraint solver, and QueryView for generating the final SQL query. The approach leverages LLMs (GPT-4) and demonstrates improved execution accuracy over existing state-of-the-art techniques on standard datasets like ACME and BIRD, as well as a new benchmark dataset, Cloud Resources.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The literature review is comprehensive, clearly defining the problem.
- The novelty lies in the task decomposition, effectively reducing the reasoning burden on LLMs.
- Empirical results show LUCY outperforms existing methods on various benchmarks.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a clear conclusion and comprehensive details on the new benchmark.
- Practical utility is limited due to multiple LLM calls, increasing latency and cost.
- Error analysis is insufficient, particularly regarding the handling of semantically meaningless entity names and conflicts in descriptions.
- The motivation for zero-shot text-to-SQL is questioned, and the paper does not adequately situate itself within existing research.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the conclusion to provide a comprehensive summary of findings. Additionally, a detailed overview of the new benchmark queries should be included, along with an analysis of their distinctiveness compared to standard benchmarks. The authors should also address the performance versus cost tradeoff and examine the sensitivity of the technique to semantically meaningful entity names. Furthermore, we suggest enhancing the error analysis to consider scenarios with similar entity descriptions and implementing mechanisms to handle hallucinations from the MatchTables phase. Lastly, a more thorough discussion of related work, particularly schema linking and other relevant methods, would better situate the proposed approach within the field.
