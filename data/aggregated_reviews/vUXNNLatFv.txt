Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a unified framework for uniform signal recovery in nonlinear generative compressed sensing, specifically addressing 1-bit generative compressed sensing (GCS) and single-index models (SIM). The authors obtain uniform recovery guarantees for various scenarios, including 1-bit GCS with dithering and Lipschitz-continuous SIM. The contribution includes a theoretical framework that allows for lower sample sizes through the use of generalized Lasso and Lipschitz approximation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper proposes a general framework for uniform signal recovery in nonlinear generative compressed sensing.
2. It achieves uniform recovery guarantees for multiple cases, including 1-bit GCS and Lipschitz-continuous SIM.
3. The use of generalized Lasso and Lipschitz approximation significantly reduces the required sample size.

Weaknesses:
1. The main results rely on the strong assumption that the target signal is exactly generated by a known generative model, which may not reflect real-world scenarios.
2. The experiments do not adequately demonstrate the theoretical claims, particularly regarding sample complexity and error evaluation.
3. Some notations are introduced before being defined, and the mathematical explanations lack clarity, making the paper difficult to follow.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writeup by defining notations before their use and enhancing the explanations surrounding mathematical transitions. Additionally, we suggest that the authors address the practical applicability of their results by discussing how their framework can be adapted when the target signal does not exactly belong to the assumed generative model. It would also be beneficial to provide a corollary for handling Gaussian noise and to clarify how the experiments relate to the theoretical framework, ensuring that they demonstrate the unique contributions of the paper. Finally, we encourage the authors to include rigorous proofs for the case of unknown observation models to strengthen their claims.
