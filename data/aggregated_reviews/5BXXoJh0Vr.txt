Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CausalStock, a novel framework for news-driven multi-stock movement prediction. The authors tackle two significant issues in existing methods: the unidirectional nature of stock relations and the noise present in news data. CausalStock features a lag-dependent temporal causal discovery module and an LLM-based Denoised News Encoder. Experimental results indicate that CausalStock outperforms strong baselines across six datasets while providing good explainability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of causal discovery and news denoising for stock movement prediction is innovative.
- The model's explainability is emphasized, which is crucial for financial applications.
- Detailed ablation studies are included, showcasing the contributions of various model components.

Weaknesses:
- The Lag-dependent Temporal Causal Discovery module lacks comparative ablation studies against traditional methods like PC and GES regarding performance and time efficiency.
- Concerns exist regarding the distinction between the learned causal graph and a correlation matrix; a comparison in Figure 3b would enhance clarity.
- There is a lack of complexity analysis and time cost comparison.
- Minor issues include the absence of explicit representation for MIE and Lag-dependent TCD in Figure 2, and insufficient detail on the structures of the DNE, Price Encoder, and FCM.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison of the Lag-dependent Temporal Causal Discovery module with traditional causal discovery methods to address performance and efficiency. Additionally, incorporating a comparison with a correlation matrix in Figure 3b will clarify the differences between the learned causal graph and correlation matrix. A complexity analysis and time cost comparison should also be included to provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's efficiency. Lastly, we suggest explicitly showing MIE and Lag-dependent TCD in Figure 2 and providing more detailed structures for the DNE, Price Encoder, and FCM.
