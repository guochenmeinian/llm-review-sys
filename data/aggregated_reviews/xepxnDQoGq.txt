Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a large dataset of enzyme-reaction pairs (178,463) curated from SwissProt and Rhea databases, encompassing 178,327 unique enzymes and 7,726 unique reactions. The authors propose a benchmarking task focused on accurately predicting the mapping between enzymes and their catalyzed reactions. The manuscript is well-written, with clear results and figures, and adequately discusses relevant methodologies and related works. The work is original and fills a significant gap in the literature, demonstrating potential for advancing biochemical computational sciences.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The curation of a large, diverse dataset.
2. A unique double-ended retrieval task.
3. Novel methodologies, including a cross-attention mechanism and structure-aware sequence tokens.
4. Utilization of negative data samples.
5. Comprehensive benchmarking across various data splits.
6. Appropriate evaluation metrics and baseline methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The inclusion of molecular conformations and structural information has minimal impact on performance.
2. The article is poorly organized, affecting clarity.
3. Lack of rationale for the choice of encoder-decoder architecture over other methods.
4. Formatting discrepancies in figures and tables.
5. Insufficient discussion of limitations and potential societal impacts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization of the manuscript for better clarity. Specifically, consider presenting the dataset before the model approach. Additionally, we suggest including the mandatory submission checklist to ensure compliance with guidelines. The authors should provide a rationale for their choice of encoder-decoder architecture and explore the potential application of contrastive learning networks. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to evaluate the benchmark quality more thoroughly by comparing it with classical annotation methods and other enzyme-reaction prediction models. Lastly, we recommend exploring alternative encodings for atom and bond features beyond one-hot encoding, such as those generated by the RDKit python library.
