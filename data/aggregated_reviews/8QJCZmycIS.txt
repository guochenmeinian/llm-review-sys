### Key Points
This paper presents PGCR (Policy-Guided Causal Representation), a two-stage framework designed to enhance state representation learning in offline reinforcement learning-based recommender systems. The first stage involves learning a policy to identify Causally Relevant Components (CRCs) using a reward function based on Wasserstein distance. The second stage trains an encoder for state representation learning, guided by the previously learned policy. The authors provide a theoretical analysis of their method and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Solid theoretical analysis of causal effect identifiability.
- Innovative application of Wasserstein distance for the reward function.
- Successful integration with various existing reinforcement learning frameworks.

Weaknesses:
- Inadequate problem motivation, lacking concrete examples or empirical evidence to illustrate the impact of non-causally relevant components on recommendation performance.
- Limited evaluation metrics, relying solely on cumulative and average rewards rather than traditional recommendation metrics like Recall, NDCG, or MRR, which hampers the assessment of recommendation quality.
- Issues with the experimental setting, including unclear data splitting methodology and lack of justification for the choice of GRU as the state encoder.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the problem motivation by providing concrete examples of how non-causally relevant components negatively impact recommendation performance, supported by empirical analysis. Additionally, the authors should include traditional recommendation metrics in their evaluation to assess the practical effectiveness of PGCR in real-world scenarios. If traditional metrics are not applicable, we suggest incorporating A/B testing or user studies to validate user satisfaction improvements. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the data splitting methodology and provide justification for the choice of GRU as the state encoder, including details on the hyperparameter selection process and optimization methodology used.
