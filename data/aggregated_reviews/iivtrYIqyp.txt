### Key Points
This paper presents a model called BPoP (Burst-induced Poisson Process) designed to differentiate between stable and curious media audiences based on time series data. The authors propose a methodology that combines a non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP), a self-feeding process (SFP), and a meta Poisson process (MPP) to capture the dynamics of audience engagement. The experimental results indicate BPoP's effectiveness across various datasets, demonstrating its superiority over traditional models like the Hawkes process.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper offers a novel perspective on audience engagement, clearly distinguishing between stable and curious audiences.
2. BPoP is validated on multiple datasets, showcasing its robust performance.
3. The manuscript is well-written and accessible.

Weaknesses:
1. The methodology is difficult to follow due to complex notations; a summary table of notations is recommended for clarity.
2. The experimental evaluation lacks numerical assessments due to the absence of ground-truth labels in the datasets.
3. The paper does not adequately explain how the SFP module generates various bursty events or how the popularity of time series can be evaluated using BPoP.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology by including a table summarizing the notations used. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed explanation of the SFP's capabilities in generating bursty events. To strengthen the evaluation, the authors should consider including more baseline models and conducting an ablation study to elucidate the impact of different model assumptions. Furthermore, a thorough description of the data collection processes for the datasets used is necessary, especially for those not sourced from prior literature.
