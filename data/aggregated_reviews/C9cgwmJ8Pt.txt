Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel algorithm for estimating precision matrices in Gaussian distributions with MTP2 constraints, formulated as a sign-constrained log-determinant program with disconnectivity constraints. The authors propose a carefully designed search direction and variable partitioning scheme, providing theoretical convergence analysis and demonstrating better computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. The algorithm is shown to converge to the global optimum and is significantly faster than existing approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and clear, with a strong theoretical foundation supporting the approach.  
- The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the algorithm's superior performance.  
- The originality of the techniques reduces computational complexity and may inspire future research.  

Weaknesses:  
- Some quantities, such as $D_k$, require further elaboration in the main text.  
- The authors should discuss the special case of the algorithm without the disconnectivity constraint and its comparison with existing methods.  
- The role of the regularization parameter $\lambda_{ij}$ in Theorems 4.4 and 4.5 needs clarification.  
- The paper does not adequately motivate the problem or address relevant literature, particularly the omission of a key reference [A].  
- The empirical study lacks a comparison to the algorithm presented in paper [A].  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by addressing the following questions:  
1. What features of the data lead to the inverse covariance matrix structure?  
2. What is the exact "reduction on the number of observations" for a model with the MTP2 structure?  
3. What is the role of the disconnectivity set Epsilon in terms of data/applications?  
4. Why is problem (1) preferred over other alternatives?  

Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the implications of using the PSD set instead of the PD set in their algorithm, as this distinction may not alter the computational process. Furthermore, a more prominent discussion regarding the non-convex nature of the estimator pipeline and the computational burden of the line search method would enhance the paper's clarity. Lastly, the authors should elaborate on the convergence rate result in Theorem 4.5 and discuss the implications of using the exact Hessian for superlinear convergence.
