Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method of adversarial neural degradation (AND) for blind image super-resolution, focusing on learning to degrade high-resolution (HR) images to synthesize real-world degradations. The authors propose using a degradation network to construct low-resolution (LR) patches from HR patches during training, which is claimed to outperform existing methods on common datasets. The effectiveness of the proposed model is supported by experimental studies, although some results require further clarification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is generally well written and easy to follow.
- The proposed ANDNet and ANDGAN demonstrate promising performance on multiple datasets, outperforming existing works.
- The idea of using a degradation network for synthesis is novel and shows effectiveness in capturing real-world degradation.

Weaknesses:
- The concept of learning degradation for blind image super-resolution is not new, with prior works already addressing similar ideas.
- Claims regarding the novelty of adversarial learning in signal restoration are inaccurate, as existing literature has explored this area.
- The working mechanism of the proposed approach lacks clarity, particularly regarding the relationship between the degradation and restoration networks.
- The experimental results need more detailed explanations, and the ablation studies are confusing and poorly presented.
- The paper does not adequately address the limitations of the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the working mechanism of the degradation and restoration networks, specifically addressing why the degradation network corresponds to real-world degradations. Additionally, we suggest providing a clearer explanation of the ablation studies and including comparisons with full-supervised methods to highlight the performance gap. It would also be beneficial to visualize the degradation system's filters and compare them with real-world degradation effects. Finally, the authors should ensure that all claims made in the paper are accurately supported by existing literature.
