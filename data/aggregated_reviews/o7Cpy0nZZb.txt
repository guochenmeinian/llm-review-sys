### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into biases affecting conversational recommendation systems (CRS) and proposes a data augmentation technique based on generative language models. The authors extend the formalization of selection and popularity biases, introducing metrics such as Initial Item Coverage (IIC) and evaluating their methods on two datasets, ReDial and TGReDial. The results indicate effectiveness on ReDial, though performance decreases on TGReDial.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and clearly conveys the key ideas.
2. It addresses significant biases in the recommendation area and proposes a novel metric for quantifying selective bias.
3. The data augmentation strategy is simple yet effective, showing performance improvements in certain evaluations.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks clarity in terminology and formulation, making it difficult to understand.
2. There is limited novelty in the proposed methods, and the evaluations focus solely on recommendation aspects, neglecting the conversational component.
3. The experiments do not compare the proposed method with other bias mitigation techniques or state-of-the-art CRS baselines, which weakens the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of terminology and formulation to enhance understanding. Additionally, consider incorporating comparisons with other bias mitigation methods and state-of-the-art CRS baselines, such as UniCRS, to strengthen the experimental results. It would also be beneficial to address the conversational aspects of the system more thoroughly, as this is crucial for a dialogue and interactive systems track. Lastly, ensure that all symbols and terms are clearly defined to avoid confusion.
