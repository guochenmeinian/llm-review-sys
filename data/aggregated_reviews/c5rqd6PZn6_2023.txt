Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents BuildingsBench, a large-scale dataset for short-term load forecasting (STLF), comprising 900K simulated buildings and over 1,900 real-world data points from both residential and commercial buildings. The authors explore the pretrain-then-finetune paradigm, demonstrating that synthetically pretrained models generalize well to real commercial buildings. The benchmark analysis reveals that increasing dataset size and diversity yields diminishing returns on zero-shot commercial building performance. Additionally, the paper includes an updated version of the Buildings-900K dataset, addressing concerns regarding seasonal bias and representation of U.S. commercial buildings. The authors clarify that the dataset includes two distinct years and that the last two weeks of the year are represented in the validation set. They correct an error in the aggregation of 15-minute consumption values to hourly values, which previously led to underestimations of maximum hourly consumption. The authors implement an outlier removal scheme and conduct hyperparameter tuning, resulting in minor improvements in model performance metrics. The paper also provides detailed documentation on data collection, evaluation metrics, and experimental results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is large and well-structured, facilitating research in STLF.
- The authors provide comprehensive documentation, including data and code links.
- The paper is well-written and organized, making it accessible to readers.
- The authors provide a thorough response to reviewer comments, enhancing the clarity and accuracy of the paper.
- The updated dataset and methodology improve the representation of U.S. commercial buildings.
- The implementation of outlier removal and hyperparameter tuning contributes to improved model performance.

Weaknesses:
- There are typos present in the manuscript, such as missing periods.
- The significance of the dataset compared to existing ones is insufficiently explained.
- The evaluation metrics could be enriched, particularly with extreme statistical metrics.
- The selected baselines do not include some state-of-the-art models in time series forecasting.
- The initial error in the aggregation of consumption values raises concerns about the reliability of earlier results.
- The model's generalizability to regions outside the U.S. remains a limitation due to cultural differences in occupancy behavior.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the manuscript by proofreading for typos and ensuring all sentences are complete. Additionally, the authors should provide a more thorough explanation of the dataset's significance relative to existing datasets. Enriching the evaluation metrics with extreme statistical measures would enhance the analysis. We also suggest incorporating classic recurrent neural networks into the baseline comparisons to provide a broader perspective on model performance. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors explore the implications of cultural differences on model generalization, particularly in non-U.S. regions. Enhancing the discussion on the limitations of the occupancy model used in the simulations and considering integrating more diverse datasets would improve the model's applicability across different geographic locations. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide more specific metrics for evaluating extreme forecasting errors, as this could offer deeper insights into model performance.
