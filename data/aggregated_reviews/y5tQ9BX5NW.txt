### Key Points
This paper presents DecETT, a dual decouple-based semantic enhancement method designed to improve application fingerprinting (AF) accuracy under encrypted tunnels. The authors propose a novel approach that utilizes TLS traffic as a semantic anchor, decoupling protocol features from app-specific features to counteract the challenges posed by tunnel obfuscation. Extensive experiments across five widely-used encrypted tunnels demonstrate DecETT's effectiveness compared to existing methods, particularly in complex obfuscation scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a dual decouple-based method is a significant contribution to application fingerprinting, addressing encrypted tunnel challenges.
- Comprehensive experiments provide a solid empirical foundation, showing DecETT's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

Weaknesses:
- Reliance on TLS traffic as a semantic anchor may limit applicability in scenarios where such traffic is unavailable or further obfuscated.
- The dataset primarily consists of volunteer-generated traffic, which may not accurately reflect real-world network diversity and noise. The assumption of a single active application per session oversimplifies multi-tasking environments.
- DecETT may lack robustness against adaptive and adversarial example attacks, which could compromise its feature extraction and classification accuracy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the applicability of DecETT in real-world environments, particularly regarding its performance in noisy, mixed-application traffic scenarios. Additionally, the authors should address the robustness of DecETT against adaptive or adversarial example attacks and explore mechanisms to enhance its resilience. Clarifying the selection criteria for the dataset and providing more detailed descriptions of the applications used would strengthen the paper's generalizability. Finally, we suggest validating the mathematical formulas presented in the methodology and conducting further experiments to assess performance under varying flow sequence lengths.
