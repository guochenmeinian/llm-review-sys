### Key Points
This paper presents a novel discrete diffusion method for 3D human pose estimation (HPE), addressing the limitations of continuous diffusion models that require extensive training data and may produce non-anthropomorphic poses. The authors propose a VQ-VAE for quantizing human poses and modeling joint dependencies, alongside a discrete diffusion model that operates in a quantized latent space. Additionally, they introduce an "Occlude and Replace" strategy to handle occlusions, which aims to simulate the transition of a 3D pose from occluded to recovered states. The authors acknowledge that this mechanism shares similarities with the "Mask and Replace" technique from prior work but emphasize their contribution lies in the effective application of the discrete diffusion model to this specific task. They also highlight the importance of learning quantized tokens that represent sub-structures of 3D poses. The main contributions include the integration of discrete diffusion into HPE, the effective quantization of poses, and the simulation of occlusion effects.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach is innovative, being the first to apply discrete diffusion for HPE, and shows promising results, particularly in occluded scenarios.
- The paper is well-written, clearly articulating the weaknesses of prior works and how the proposed method addresses them.
- Detailed mathematical formulations and experiments validate the effectiveness of the approach, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
- The integration of a discrete diffusion process with a pose quantization step is a notable contribution.

Weaknesses:
- The methodology section lacks clarity, particularly regarding the dimensions of $F$ and $T$, and the rationale for using cross-entropy loss for VQ-VAE training is unclear.
- The novelty of the methodology is questionable, as some components appear to replicate prior works without sufficient distinction, particularly the "Occlude and Replace" mechanism compared to existing techniques.
- The term "continuous diffusion" may cause confusion among readers, as it primarily refers to the time variable rather than the spatial sampling of joints.
- The single-frame-based method may not capture as much coherent information as continuous-frame-based methods.
- The fairness of experiments is compromised due to the use of a ViT backbone, while other methods utilize CNN or GCN backbones with fewer parameters, complicating comparative evaluations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology section by explicitly stating the dimensions of $F$ and $T$ from the beginning. Additionally, they should clarify the choice of cross-entropy loss for training the VQ-VAE, as reconstruction loss is typically used. It would be beneficial to differentiate clearly between novel contributions and adaptations of prior works, particularly in the "Occlude and Replace" strategy, and to clarify the differences between "Occlude and Replace" and "Mask and Replace" to strengthen the argument for the novelty of their contribution. To enhance the fairness of experiments, consider testing other backbones to quantify their impact on results. Furthermore, we recommend improving the clarity of the term "continuous diffusion" in the paper to avoid confusion among readers, specifically by emphasizing that it refers to the time variable rather than the spatial domain of joints. Finally, the authors should include running times for experiments and provide statistical significance information, including error bars, to strengthen the evaluation of their approach.
