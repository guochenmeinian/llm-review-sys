Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a key-centric approach to learning over semi-structured sequences, specifically focusing on key-value pairs. The authors propose two models: the temporal modeler (TVM) for time-series data and the key aggregator (KA) for key-centric representation, advocating for interleaved training of both representations. Experiments conducted on three datasets—Cloud Service Logs, LogHub, and Instacart—demonstrate that the proposed method (TVM-KA) outperforms competitive baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The topic is relevant and well-motivated, addressing the inefficiencies of flattening semi-structured data.
2. The proposed method effectively combines key-aggregation and temporal modeling, enhancing training efficiency.
3. The paper is well-structured, with clear figures and a persuasive ablation study.

Weaknesses:
1. The main baseline, a flattened encoding (BERT), performs comparably on most datasets, raising questions about the necessity of the key-centric and record-centric approaches.
2. The performance improvements are modest, with only two out of three datasets showing consistent gains, and the record-centric approach performing best on LogHub.
3. The evaluation lacks comprehensiveness, covering only three datasets, and the results on the Instacart dataset are not convincing.
4. The rationale behind the effectiveness of interleaved training over joint training is not sufficiently explained.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including results on text-only benchmarks to assess the flexibility of TVM-KA in handling diverse data forms. Additionally, exploring a key-centric baseline by using the same models for record-centric representation with adjusted parameters would provide further insights. A more detailed analysis discussing the differences between joint modeling and interleaved training is necessary to clarify their respective impacts. Lastly, visualizations of outputs and failure cases should be included in the supplementary materials to enhance understanding.
