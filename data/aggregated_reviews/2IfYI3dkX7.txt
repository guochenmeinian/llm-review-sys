### Key Points
This paper presents RexUIE, a novel approach for Universal Information Extraction (UIE) that enhances extraction capabilities by introducing an Explicit Schema Instructor (ESI). The authors redefine UIE to encompass extraction of complex schemas with multiple spans/types and employ a recursive method for querying schema types. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across 17 datasets and 6 tasks, including entities, relations, events, sentiment analysis, and complex schemas like quadruples and quintuples.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The recursive method and explicit schema instructions are intuitive extensions that improve universal extraction.
- Extensive experiments validate RexUIE's effectiveness, particularly for complex schemas.
- The model shows strong empirical performance and is well-written, making it accessible.

Weaknesses:
- The approach's complexity, with many components, complicates ablation analysis.
- Performance improvements over prior models are marginal in some cases, and zero-shot capabilities are limited to NER and RE.
- The interpretation of performance gains is challenging due to the use of a different base model (DeBERTa).

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the reasons for performance improvements, particularly regarding the contributions of the recursive extraction techniques versus the completeness of the schema. Additionally, we suggest clarifying whether the explicit schema information is provided to compared methods and addressing potential limitations of the method in cases of incomplete schemas. The authors should also explore the implications of overlapping relations in extraction tasks and consider incorporating missing references to CasRel and TPlinker in Section 2. Finally, we encourage the authors to analyze how schema size and richness affect RexUIE's performance and to investigate the use of external knowledge bases during pre-training to enhance semantic understanding.
