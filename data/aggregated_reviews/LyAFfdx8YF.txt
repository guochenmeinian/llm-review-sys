Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) algorithm called Pre-trained Embodiment-Aware Control (PEAC), aimed at addressing cross-embodiment tasks by considering the influence of different embodiments to enhance exploration and skill discovery. The authors propose a novel intrinsic reward derived from a minmax objective, encouraging agents to explore common areas of the state space across embodiments. Experimental results indicate that PEAC significantly improves adaptation performance in both simulated and real environments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper is well-written, with intuitive figures and a logically structured presentation of PEAC.  
2. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PEAC, showing strong results compared to various baselines.  
3. The introduction of the CEURL framework and the focus on cross-embodiment research contribute meaningfully to the field of embodied intelligence.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The comparison with baselines lacks persuasiveness, as those not utilizing embodiment information exhibit poorer performance. It remains unclear if PEAC's success stems from embodiment information or cross-embodiment intrinsic rewards.  
2. The paper's clarity suffers due to insufficient explanations of key implementation details, such as the "embodiment context encoder" and the training of the discriminator.  
3. The experiments primarily involve simple tasks, limiting the demonstration of PEAC's capabilities in more complex scenarios.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing detailed explanations of the "embodiment context encoder" and the training process for the discriminator. Additionally, we suggest modifying some baselines to naively incorporate embodiment information for more persuasive comparisons. Expanding the experimental tasks to include more complex scenarios, such as those suggested in the literature, would also enhance the demonstration of PEAC's effectiveness. Finally, addressing the distinction between CEURL and multi-task/meta RL more explicitly could clarify the unique contributions of this work.
