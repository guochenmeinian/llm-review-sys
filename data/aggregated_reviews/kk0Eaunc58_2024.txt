Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a training scheme called stochastic dropout training, resulting in models termed HydraViT. The authors propose sampling a subnetwork of a larger Vision Transformer (ViT) to allow flexible inference size based on hardware specifications. The method demonstrates improved performance through qualitative and quantitative experiments. Additionally, the authors build on Matryoshka Representation Learning to enhance quality-speed trade-offs by training on subsets of embedding dimensions and attention heads ordered by importance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The motivation for training a subnetwork of ViT is well-founded, and the flexible dimension choice during inference is practical.  
- The paper is well-presented, with clearly defined contributions and a strong experimental section that includes both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.  
- The methodology is straightforward and modular, addressing the efficiency of Vision Transformers effectively.

Weaknesses:  
- Concerns arise regarding the consistency of ViT behavior when changing dimensions, particularly in self-attention operations, and whether scale calibration akin to Dropout is necessary.  
- The qualitative gains over baselines are limited, and the paper lacks extensive discussions on the implementation of stochastic training on modern hardware.  
- There is insufficient exploration of the model's performance across different hardware platforms, and the limitations of dynamic model rebuilding are not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on how different dimensions are incorporated into the self-attention layers to ensure consistent behavior. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include a thorough examination of the impact of stochastic training on training time and hardware utilization. We suggest that the authors conduct experiments beyond the ImageNet-1k validation set, including segmentation and object detection tasks, to strengthen their findings. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of dynamic model rebuilding and providing error bars in the experimental results would enhance the paper's robustness.
