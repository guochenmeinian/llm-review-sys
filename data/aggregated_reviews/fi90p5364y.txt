### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to relation extraction by leveraging Commonsense Counterfactual Generation (CCG), which aims to improve data augmentation through counterfactuals. The authors propose a method that includes three steps: causal terms identification, relation expansion, and controlled editing. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that CCG enhances model robustness across various settings, including low-resource and adversarial scenarios. The paper provides a good overview of related work and identifies unsolved issues, contributing to the field of relation extraction.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well organized and clearly defines the requirements for counterfactual data augmentation.
- The proposed method is grounded in previous work and effectively addresses two significant challenges in relation extraction.
- Multidimensional experiments show CCG's advantages across different scenarios.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks structure, making it difficult to follow, and terms are not clearly defined before use.
- Generated outputs in case studies reveal grammatical issues, undermining the integrity of sentences.
- The performance gain of CCG diminishes with increased training data, and comparisons with existing methods like CoCo are limited.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper's structure and clarity by defining key terms such as "invariant entity constraint" and "commonsense constraint" early on. Additionally, we suggest conducting a human evaluation to assess the grammatical correctness and semantic readability of generated outputs. To enhance comparisons, we recommend including experiments that align with the settings used in CoCo. Lastly, we advise the authors to clarify the relationship between their method and causal theory or to use more appropriate terminology.
