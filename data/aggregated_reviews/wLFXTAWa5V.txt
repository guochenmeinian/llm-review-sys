Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approximate nearest neighbor search framework that integrates attribute constraints through a single composite index, contrasting with existing two-stage solutions. The authors propose a new distance function that combines feature vector distances and attribute vector distances, leading to the development of several proximity graph-based ANNS methods. An ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of these methods, with experimental results on multiple landmark datasets showing superior performance compared to baseline methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed fusion distance is an innovative concept that facilitates the construction of a single composite index, offering advantages over traditional two-stage models.
- Each method step is thoroughly explained, with most components supported by theoretical proofs or analyses.
- The paper includes comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, reinforcing the validity of the findings.

Weaknesses:
- Key details regarding configurations or setups for some baselines, such as the parameters for FAISS, are lacking, complicating the understanding of its performance at recall 80%.
- The paper does not address potential challenges related to increasing attribute diversity, which could impact the efficiency of the proposed method.
- Limitations of the work are not discussed, and the presentation could be improved for clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the configurations and setups for baseline methods, particularly regarding FAISS parameters. Additionally, it would be beneficial to address potential challenges associated with high attribute diversity and discuss possible solutions. We also suggest including a section on the limitations of the proposed approach. Lastly, enhancing the clarity of the presentation by simplifying notation and providing algorithm boxes for key methods would significantly improve readability.
