### Key Points
This paper presents an inference-time approach to controlling gender inflections in speech translation systems by replacing the internal language model (ILM) with gender-specific external language models (ELMs). The authors address the bias in speech translation systems towards masculine forms, which degrades performance, particularly for female speakers. The proposed method shows significant improvements in gender accuracy and computational efficiency across multiple language pairs (en->it/es/fr) without requiring retraining of existing systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The task addressed is crucial, and the proposed method is an inference-time solution that can be applied universally to any end-to-end speech translation system.
- The results demonstrate significant improvements in gender accuracy and coverage, outperforming baseline models.
- The paper is well-structured, with a clear presentation of the problem, methodology, and results, including a solid ablation study.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed system may lead to degradation in BLEU scores in certain settings, raising concerns about overall translation quality.
- There are ambiguities regarding the selection of ELMs based on speaker gender, particularly in scenarios with multiple speakers or when the speaker's gender is unknown.
- The reliance on the MuST-C corpus may limit the generalizability of the findings, as it may not be the most suitable dataset for this task.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on how to select the gender-specific external language model, particularly in cases where the speaker's gender is not known beforehand. Additionally, addressing the observed degradation in BLEU scores when gender control is activated would strengthen the paper. Clarifying the implications of using the MuST-C corpus and exploring alternative datasets could also enhance the robustness of the findings.
