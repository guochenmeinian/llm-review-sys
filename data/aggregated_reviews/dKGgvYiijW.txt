### Key Points
This paper presents a new ensemble method aimed at reducing the computational cost of training classifiers while maintaining uncertainty quantification. The authors propose a last-layer committee machine that supervises the mean prediction of the ensemble to enhance computational performance. The method is evaluated on two datasets: MNIST and German Bank 2010, and addresses the issue of low network diversity in ensemble methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Introduces a new ensemble method targeting computational efficiency while quantifying uncertainty.
- Tests on both a simple dataset (MNIST) and a more complex one (German Bank 2010).
- Discusses low network diversity and conducts experiments to address this concern.

Weaknesses:
- Lacks discussion of existing related work, failing to contextualize the contribution within the literature.
- Does not adequately address the implications of neural collapse in relation to uncertainty quantification.
- Clarity issues in writing, particularly in section 2.2 and Figure 3, which hinder understanding of the method and metrics.
- The proposed technique is already present in the state of the art, with prior works providing more thorough evaluations.
- Results on MNIST are inconclusive due to the dataset's simplicity, and the coefficient of variation is questioned as a measure for comparing model weights.
- Supervising only the mean prediction may decrease performance due to the oversmoothing effect, as noted in the literature.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review to include existing related works, highlighting similarities and differences to better motivate their contribution. Additionally, a discussion on neural collapse and its relevance to uncertainty quantification should be included. The authors should clarify the writing in section 2.2 and provide better explanations for Figure 3, particularly regarding the axes and metrics used. We also suggest comparing their method against a full ensemble and various ensemble performance improvement techniques. Finally, the authors should reconsider the approach of supervising only the mean prediction, as it may negatively impact performance.
