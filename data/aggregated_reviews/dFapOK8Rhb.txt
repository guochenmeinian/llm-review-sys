### Key Points
This paper presents ExoLLM, a method that leverages large language models (LLMs) for time series forecasting with exogenous variables. The authors propose innovative components such as Meta-task Instructions, Multi-grained Prompts, and Dual TS-Text Attention to effectively capture complex external influences. Experimental results indicate that ExoLLM enhances forecasting performance across various scenarios, including long-term, short-term, few-shot, and zero-shot tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-structured and easy to understand, with clear logical coherence.
2. It addresses a critical challenge in time series forecasting by incorporating complex, multi-grained exogenous information.
3. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the method's effectiveness across diverse scenarios.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty primarily stems from integrating existing mechanisms rather than developing fundamentally new techniques.
2. The related work section lacks a comprehensive review of LLM-based time series forecasting methods.
3. The model does not explicitly handle interdependencies among exogenous variables, which may have synergistic or offsetting effects.
4. Scalability analysis is insufficient, lacking comprehensive experiments on datasets of varying scales.
5. The effectiveness of ExoLLM relies heavily on the quality of pre-trained LLMs, limiting its applicability in scenarios where such models are unavailable.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section by including a more comprehensive review of LLM-based time series forecasting methods, potentially referencing 'Large Language Models for Time Series: A Survey.' Additionally, the authors should elaborate on how LLMs understand and correlate textual descriptions with numerical time series features, ensuring semantic consistency between text prototypes and temporal patterns. It is crucial to incorporate explicit mechanisms to model interdependencies among exogenous variables. Furthermore, we suggest conducting comprehensive scalability experiments and evaluating the model's robustness in challenging cross-domain scenarios. Lastly, please update the invalid source code link and provide more examples of meta-task instructions and multi-grained prompts for different datasets to enhance reproducibility.
