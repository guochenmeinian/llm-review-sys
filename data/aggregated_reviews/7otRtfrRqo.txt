Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of deep feedback control (DFC) learning to develop a more biologically realistic model of synaptic plasticity. The authors introduce a feedback control mechanism utilizing targeted, neuron-specific inhibition, which aligns more closely with experimentally observed plasticity phenomena, such as BCM. They demonstrate that their model achieves performance comparable to backpropagation on benchmarks like MNIST and FMNIST, while also discussing the testable predictions of their extended model.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively reduces an algorithm derived from optimization principles to replicate LTD/LTP experiments, a challenging task that many prior algorithms have not accomplished.
- The algorithm performs well on image classification tasks, even with biophysically motivated modifications.
- The writing is clear and well-organized.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution appears incremental, as previous studies have shown that related algorithms can resemble BCM-like learning, suggesting that the key improvement is merely the addition of tweaks to DFC algorithms.
- The current learning scheme relies on a complex Jacobian, requiring different feedback weights for each stimulus, which complicates the model compared to simpler controllers used in prior studies.
- The 1-1 mapping between inhibitory and excitatory neurons raises questions about the biological plausibility of the controller feedback.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the relationship between their algorithm and that proposed in Payeur et al. 2021, particularly regarding the differences in testable predictions. Additionally, the authors should address the functional and computational benefits of including inhibitory neurons compared to previous models. It would be beneficial to relate their work to other computational studies on inhibitory neurons and clarify the implications of their findings on biological systems. We also suggest enhancing the experimental evaluation by testing the learning rule on a broader range of tasks and increasing the number of seeds in simulations for robustness. Finally, addressing the identified typos and unclear sections will improve the overall presentation.
