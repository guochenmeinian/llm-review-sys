### Key Points
This paper presents the DYAD layer as an alternative to the Dense layer, aiming to enhance efficiency in modern transformer models. The authors propose a method that rewrites matrix multiplication in a 3D shape and utilizes batched matrix multiplication for speed improvements. However, concerns arise regarding potential quality loss due to the sparsity assumption of the matrices and the limited applicability of the approach, which seems effective primarily when the weight matrix is significantly larger than the input tensor.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
* The paper addresses a relevant problem and introduces a straightforward, easy-to-implement approach.
* It provides a theoretical foundation for the DYAD layer structure, enhancing its credibility.

Weaknesses:
* There is no comparison to matrix factorization techniques, which could also reduce multiplication runtime.
* The results section is disorganized, with tables and figures not positioned near the relevant text.
* The approach appears practical only when the weight matrix is much larger than the input tensor.
* Clarity issues exist, such as unspecified metrics in section 3.4.1 and grammatical errors that hinder readability.
* Several omissions are noted, including a missing table at line 217 and an empty section 5.3.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the notation, particularly by renaming n_in and n_out to better reflect their meanings. Additionally, we suggest including a comparison with matrix factorization techniques to strengthen the evaluation. The authors should reorganize the results section to ensure tables and figures are near the relevant text and address the missing elements, such as the table at line 217 and section 5.3. Furthermore, we advise replacing the PyTorch implementation of DYAD with pseudocode to emphasize essential details and consider adding figures to sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 to clarify the reshaping and block multiplication processes.
