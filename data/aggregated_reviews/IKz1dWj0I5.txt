### Key Points
This paper presents an experimental investigation into the impact of quality estimation (QE) and back translation (BT) on physicians' decision-making when translating discharge instructions for non-English-speaking patients. The authors conducted a study with 65 English-speaking physicians, revealing that QE significantly improved decision accuracy, while BT enhanced the detection of critical errors. The authors propose that QE and BT can be used complementarily.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The study is well-motivated, addressing the critical implications of translation errors in the medical field.  
- It provides valuable insights into the practical application of QE and BT in real-world scenarios, demonstrating their effectiveness in supporting physicians.  
- The paper is clearly written and presents convincing results.

Weaknesses:  
- The content may not align with the EMNLP conference's focus, as it lacks exploration of technical aspects related to language models and primarily addresses practical applications.  
- The limited dataset, consisting of only 6 discharge instructions and 28 sentences, raises concerns about the robustness of the conclusions.  
- The study only examines the English-Chinese language pair without justification for this choice, limiting its generalizability.  
- There is a missed opportunity to explore the combined use of QE and BT, which could have strengthened the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by providing a rationale for the choice of the English-Chinese language pair and considering a broader range of languages. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments that include both QE and BT to assess their combined effectiveness. It would also be beneficial to include detailed data statistics in Section 4.1 to support the experimental findings. Finally, we advise using a different machine translation tool for back translation to mitigate the risk of propagating translation errors.
