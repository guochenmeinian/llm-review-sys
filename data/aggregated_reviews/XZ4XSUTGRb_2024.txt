Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical framework linking tropical algebraic interpretations of ReLU-based neural networks to surfaces represented by signed distance functions (SDFs). It proposes a surface extraction algorithm based on this framework and extends the extraction of polyhedral complexes from ReLU networks with trilinear positional encodings. A modified edge subdivision algorithm is introduced to approximate neural implicit surfaces. The evaluation compares the proposed method to marching cubes (MC64 and MC256) in terms of mesh size, accuracy, and computational time, reporting averages for MC64 and MC256 at 2308 x 1e-9 and 66 x 1e-9, respectively, which are higher than the authors' method at 31 x 1e-9. The authors also discuss the implications of their findings on model size, decision boundaries, and the impact of positional encoding on surface meshes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The mathematical notation is well-executed, with appropriate symbol choices.
- The theoretical framework is compelling, showcasing a novel application of tropical algebra.
- The attempt to generalize insights from piecewise linear networks to those with positional encodings is well-motivated and promising.
- The paper is deemed interesting and worthy of acceptance, with a commitment to addressing reviewer concerns.
- The authors have provided additional data on runtimes for different model sizes, enhancing the clarity of their results.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation is overly focused on lower abstraction details, making it niche for NeurIPS and difficult for readers to grasp the core ideas. The empirical results are relegated to the appendix, and the method lacks an overview image.
- The clarity of the figures, particularly Figure C, is criticized as misleading.
- The evaluation is limited, primarily comparing against marching cubes without considering recent improvements or alternative methods, and is performed on a limited set of meshes, raising concerns about statistical significance.
- The rationale for not reporting results for smaller models is questioned.
- The extracted surfaces exhibit noise and discretization issues, likely due to the grid-based approach.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the overall presentation by providing a clearer overview of the method early in the paper. Including graphical intuitions, such as plots of tropical polynomials and schematic images of the subdivision scheme, would enhance understanding. We urge the authors to improve the clarity of Figure C to accurately depict the decision boundaries, possibly by visualizing intermediate steps or using suggested references. Additionally, we suggest expanding the evaluation to include comparisons with more recent methods and conducting evaluations on a larger set of meshes to strengthen the statistical significance of their findings. It would also be beneficial to include qualitative comparisons between "MC + QEM" and "Ours + QEM" for both smaller and larger meshes to better illustrate the advantages of the proposed approach. Finally, please reconsider the justification for not reporting results for the smaller models and ensure that all claims are substantiated to avoid misleading information.
