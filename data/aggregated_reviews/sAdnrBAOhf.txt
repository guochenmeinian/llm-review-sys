Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an explainable vision-language model (VLM) framework for personalized medicine, integrating advanced mathematical techniques like the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Bilateral Laplace Transform to analyze gene expression data, particularly focusing on circadian drug metabolism and treatment responses. The authors propose a novel framework that aims to enhance drug discovery and personalized medicine by leveraging multimodal data for improved clinical decision-making.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Clear and Practical Motivation: The integration of VLMs with mathematical transforms aims to improve clinical decision-making.
- Fluent Writing: The paper is well-written, with intuitive figures that support the content.
- Open-Source Code: The provided code facilitates reproducibility and encourages further research.

Weaknesses:
- Inconsistent Figure Sizing: Some figures are not appropriately sized, affecting visual consistency and readability.
- Limited Practical Applications: The absence of real-world clinical use cases leaves the framework's effectiveness unverified.
- Lack of Performance Comparisons: The study does not include quantitative comparisons with existing methods, hindering assessment of performance improvements.
- Insufficient Technical Detail: Key technologies like FFT and BLT are not adequately explained, and descriptions are too superficial for reproducibility.
- Layout Issues: Images exceed layout boundaries, formulas lack necessary symbolic notation, and descriptions do not match actual content.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization of the introduction to clearly explain the rationale behind the use of key technologies such as FFT. Additionally, the authors should enhance the scientific contributions by providing more in-depth technical details on FFT, BLT, and VLM components to ensure reproducibility. We also suggest addressing layout issues by resizing figures, ensuring formulas have proper notation, and aligning descriptions with actual content. Expanding the literature review in the introduction to provide more context on prior work related to integrating mathematical transforms with AI in medicine would be beneficial. Finally, discussing potential biases or limitations in the datasets used could strengthen the paper's arguments.
