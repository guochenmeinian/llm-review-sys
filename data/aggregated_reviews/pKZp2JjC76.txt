### Key Points
This paper presents an adaptive approach that integrates amortized Bayesian inference into traditional Bayesian workflows, proposing a two-stage method based on amortized inference. The authors aim to produce high-quality posterior samples while minimizing computational time, with empirical demonstrations focusing on a generalized extreme value distribution. The manuscript is well-structured and aligns with the workshop's theme.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The article is of good quality, clearly presenting its contributions and structured logically.  
- Figures in the introduction and method sections enhance reader comprehension.  
- The method illustrates several steps in both stages, demonstrating efficiency improvements without compromising inference quality.  

Weaknesses:  
- The contribution primarily integrates amortized inference into the Bayesian workflow, with the training stage resembling common methods.  
- The need for a sufficient training budget raises concerns about the practical cost of the method in actual DNN applications, despite its speed in experiments.  
- The authors should further improve the method and apply it to more specific deep learning settings to demonstrate its significance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations of their method. Additionally, it would be beneficial to explore more specific deep learning settings to enhance the significance of the proposed approach.
