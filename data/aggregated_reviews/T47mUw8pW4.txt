Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of the Hausdorff stability of the medial axis for closed sets, generalizing previous results by Chazal and Soufflet. The authors prove stability under \(C^{1,1}\) diffeomorphisms without requiring the set to be a manifold or pruning the medial axis, thus broadening the applicability of the results to arbitrary dimensions. The authors argue that this generalization is necessary for unspecified applications in fields such as astrophysics. Additionally, the paper includes a discussion period for author-reviewer engagement, emphasizing the importance of feedback in enhancing the quality of the work.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and accessible, making complex concepts understandable even to those without a mathematics background.  
- The results are significant, removing the manifold assumption and demonstrating stability without pruning the medial axis, which is advantageous for computational geometry and related fields.  
- The theoretical contributions are robust, with clear explanations of key concepts and rigorous proofs.  
- The paper encourages active participation from reviewers, fostering a collaborative environment for improvement.

Weaknesses:  
- The relevance of the medial axis to current AI research is questioned, with a lack of concrete applications provided in the paper.  
- The main result is technical and may be difficult for non-experts to verify, and the connection to practical applications remains tenuous.  
- The assumption that the ambient diffeomorphism preserves a bounded sphere is seen as potentially artificial and inconvenient for practical applications.  
- The review lacks specific critiques or detailed feedback on the content of the paper itself.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the connection to practical applications by providing specific examples of how the medial axis can be utilized in current AI research. Briefly describing 2-3 concrete applications in recent literature would strengthen the relevance of the work. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the necessity of the bounding sphere preservation condition and consider whether this requirement can be relaxed. Finally, including numerical experiments to demonstrate the impact of noise on the stability of the medial axis would enhance the paper's contributions. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their arguments and provide more detailed responses to potential reviewer concerns during the discussion period.
