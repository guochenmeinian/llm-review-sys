### Key Points
This paper presents a method called STRIDE for molecular design, utilizing a diffusion model to generate 3D structures guided by substructures. The authors propose a workflow to Generate, Filter, and Feedback, enabling tailored design with small datasets. The results demonstrate that guiding (and self-guiding) can effectively shift property distributions, although limitations exist when compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses the important challenge of generating molecules in a low-data regime.
- It introduces a novel diffusion model for molecular generation.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation of results is limited, with no significant improvement in ionization energy or bond dissociation energy compared to unguided models.
- The diversity and novelty of generated molecules are not assessed, and comparisons to existing methods are absent.
- The paper lacks critical metrics such as the number of generated molecules and details on how 3D coordinates were derived.
- The complexity of generative diffusion models may not be justified for small molecules, suggesting enumeration and scoring could be more efficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical evaluation by providing statistics on the diversity and novelty of the generated molecules. Additionally, please indicate the number of molecules generated and report the wall-clock time for model execution, discussing the practical implications of runtime. Clarification on how 3D coordinates for training molecules were generated is also necessary. Furthermore, consider using enumeration and scoring as a baseline or justify the need for generative models for small molecules.
