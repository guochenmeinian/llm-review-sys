### Key Points
This paper presents a method based on hypergraph learning for anomaly detection, particularly in detecting anomalous brain activity through dynamic hypergraph representations of functional connectivity using EEG or fMRI data. The authors conduct extensive experimentation against various graph neural network and hypergraph neural network baselines, demonstrating superior performance across multiple datasets related to different neurological disorders.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The methodology for anomaly detection is intriguing and well-executed, with extensive experimentation showing promising results.  
- The paper addresses a significant area of research in detecting anomalous brain activity, contributing to the field of neurological disorder analysis.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks specific details on the four-stage message-passing mechanism and adaptive hypergraph pooling, which are crucial to the proposed solution.  
- There is insufficient context regarding the results related to specific applications of HADiB, and the potential generalizability of the model to other neurological disorders is not discussed.  
- Clarifications are needed regarding the adjacency matrix and the simulation of anomalous connections in the datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by providing more specific details on the four-stage message-passing mechanism and adaptive hypergraph pooling. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include more context on the results related to the specific applications of HADiB and discuss its potential generalizability to other neurological disorders. We also suggest including a brief discussion on future work or next steps for the HADiB model. Furthermore, please clarify the interpretation of the adjacency matrix as defined in Eq. (2), explain the simulation of anomalous connections in the appendix, and formalize the loss functions while clarifying hyperparameter selection for the experiments.
