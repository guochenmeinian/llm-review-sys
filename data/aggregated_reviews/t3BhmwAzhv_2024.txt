Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a 3D Multi-Label Language Model (MLLM) aimed at understanding 3D environments at the object level. The authors propose a method that utilizes object identifiers to convert 3D scenes into distinguishable object tokens, facilitating object-centric representations through foundation models. The approach is evaluated across various 3D scene-language tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Introducing Large Language Models (LLMs) into 3D perception is an innovative direction.
2. The use of foundation models to extract 3D and 2D embeddings shows potential for enhancing the 3D MLLM's capabilities.
3. The paper is clearly presented, with comprehensive experiments demonstrating versatility across multiple tasks.

Weaknesses:
1. The concept of object identifiers lacks novelty, as similar methods exist in prior works.
2. Claims regarding "efficient object referencing and grounding abilities" are not substantiated by experimental evaluations.
3. The proposed method's effectiveness in addressing 3D data scarcity is unclear.
4. Comparisons in Table 2 omit notable works, such as CORE-3DVG, limiting the evaluation's comprehensiveness.
5. The reliance on pretrained models raises concerns about the loss of fine-grained information in 3D scenes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their approach by discussing how their method differentiates from existing object-centric models. Additionally, the authors should provide experimental evaluations on 3D referring expression segmentation to substantiate claims of efficiency. Including comparisons with more state-of-the-art methods in Table 2 would enhance the evaluation's robustness. We also suggest conducting targeted ablation studies to clarify the contributions of object identifiers and the impact of using 2D features. Finally, evaluating the model on diverse datasets beyond ScanNet would provide insights into its generalization capabilities.
