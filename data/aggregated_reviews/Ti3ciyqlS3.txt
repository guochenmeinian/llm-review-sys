Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for analyzing relative encodings through random walk matrices and introduces a new model for temporal link prediction, TPNet. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across various datasets while addressing high time complexity issues inherent in traditional methods. The authors provide a detailed explanation of the model's design and conduct extensive evaluations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper proposes a unified framework for relative encoding, treating them as a function of temporal random walk matrices.
2. The temporal random walk matrix incorporates both temporal and structural information, including time decay effects.
3. An approximation scheme for the temporal random walk matrix is introduced, detailed in Algorithm 1, which reduces computational complexity.
4. The authors conduct thorough axiomatic proofs, providing solid theoretical support for TPNet's effectiveness.
5. The source code is well-commented and includes detailed setup instructions, enhancing usability.

Weaknesses:  
1. Limitations of the approach are only briefly discussed in the appendix.
2. The code did not run out of the box due to missing dependencies and a runtime error in the sampling algorithm.
3. A comparison of memory usage is lacking, which would strengthen the model's credibility.
4. The impact of different functions g on relative encoding is not analyzed.
5. The authors did not compare their model with the latest models published in AAAI 2024 or WWW 2024 in Table 1.
6. The concept of "relative encoding" is introduced late in the article, which may hinder clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the limitations of their approach, providing a more comprehensive analysis. Additionally, please ensure that the code runs smoothly out of the box by including all necessary dependencies in the requirements.txt file. It would be beneficial to include a comparison of memory usage to enhance the model's credibility. We also suggest analyzing the impact of different functions g on relative encoding and updating Table 1 to include comparisons with the latest models. Finally, we advise introducing the concept of "relative encoding" earlier in the article for better clarity and understanding.
