Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an orthogonal non-negative tensor factorization method for multi-view clustering, addressing the limitations of existing NMF-based approaches by directly processing multi-view data and leveraging the spatial structure of the data. The authors propose a tensorized anchor graph factorization model that incorporates a tensor Schatten p-norm regularization to enhance clustering performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method across various benchmark datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method effectively considers the between-view relationship and performs Orth-NTF on a 3rd-order tensor composed of anchor graphs.
2. The construction of anchor graphs reduces algorithmic complexity while exploring the cluster structure of multi-view data.
3. The model exhibits good interpretability due to the orthogonal non-negative constraint on tensorized soft labels.
4. The paper includes a theoretical convergence analysis and substantial experimental results.

Weaknesses:
1. The introduction lacks a clear motivation for the tensor factorization and orthogonal constraint design.
2. Section 5.2 provides insufficient analysis of the method's results, limiting insights for readers.
3. The authors do not clarify how to determine the optimal parameter \(\lambda\) in Eq. (6) or analyze the impact of different parameter combinations.
4. The paper does not address storage and computational complexity, nor does it clarify the selection process for anchor points or the construction of the anchor graph.
5. Some formulas are not clearly written, and specific hyper-parameters for each dataset are not reported.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by providing a clearer motivation for the tensor factorization and orthogonal constraint. Additionally, we suggest that the authors include more in-depth analysis in Section 5.2 to enhance the insights provided. It would be beneficial to add ablation experiments to identify which design elements contribute most significantly to the method's performance. Furthermore, we advise the authors to clarify the process for determining the optimal parameter \(\lambda\) and to analyze the effects of different parameter combinations on performance. Lastly, we encourage the authors to report the storage and computational complexity of their model and to provide specific hyper-parameters for each dataset.
