Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical framework to understand ensemble adversarial defenses, demonstrating that an ensemble of adversarially trained classifiers is more robust than individual classifiers. The authors propose Interactive Global Adversarial Training (iGAT), which includes a probabilistic distributing rule to allocate adversarial examples to appropriate base classifiers and a regularization term to mitigate the weaknesses of the classifiers. Empirical evaluations show that iGAT enhances existing ensemble defense strategies on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper provides a novel error theory that offers insights into the effectiveness of ensemble adversarial defenses.
2. iGAT is developed based on theoretical findings, aiming to improve the robustness of ensemble classifiers.
3. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The designs of the distributing rule and regularization term are somewhat heuristic, lacking justification for the preference of the ranking-based probability in Equation (10).
2. The necessity for hyperparameters \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) to be the same in Equations (7) and (12) is unclear, raising concerns about the number of hyperparameters to tune.
3. Empirical improvements in Table 1 are marginal for some comparisons, and the rationale behind different experimental settings for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 is not provided.
4. Limited validation on larger datasets and a narrow range of attack algorithms restrict the generalizability of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the choice of the ranking-based probability in Equation (10) compared to other alternatives. Additionally, clarify whether hyperparameters \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) must be the same and consider reducing the number of hyperparameters to simplify tuning. It would also be beneficial to provide performance metrics for all four ensemble defense methods in Table 1 and discuss the observed inconsistencies in performance improvements across different methods. Finally, we suggest validating iGAT on larger datasets and a broader range of attack algorithms to enhance the robustness and applicability of the proposed method.
