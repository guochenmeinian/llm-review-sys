Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on diffusion models on Riemannian manifolds, specifically focusing on better approximations of the heat kernel on compact symmetric Riemannian manifolds. The authors propose several numerical strategies for computing the heat kernel and introduce two sampling techniques: a rejection sampling method and a probability flow method. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their methods on various manifolds, including the torus and spheres, and apply them to problems like density estimation and contrastive learning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a comprehensive comparison of techniques for approximating the heat kernel in Riemannian symmetric spaces.
- The proposed sampling techniques are innovative and show promise for high-dimensional applications.
- The results are competitive compared to existing methods, particularly in high-dimensional settings.

Weaknesses:
- Many techniques discussed appear standard and lack novelty.
- The sensitivity of heat kernel estimators requires careful tuning of hyper-parameters, particularly $\tau$ in Algorithm 1.
- The experimental evaluation is limited, lacking comparisons with more previous Riemannian diffusion model works.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of the techniques presented in Section 3 by exploring more innovative approaches. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed comparison of the two sampling techniques in Section 4 to clarify their practical applicability. It would also be beneficial to expand the experimental section to include more baselines, particularly in Figures 3 and Table 1, to strengthen the evaluation of the proposed methods. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the introduction of the transition kernel and its relation to the equations in the Euclidean diffusion context. Lastly, addressing the computational challenges and justifying the added complexity of Riemannian diffusion models with mainstream applications would enhance the paper's impact.
