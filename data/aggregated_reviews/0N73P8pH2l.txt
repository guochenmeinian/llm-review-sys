Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on stabilizing training in U-Net architectures for diffusion models by addressing the instability caused by Long Skip Connections (LSCs). The authors propose two scaling methods: Constant Scaling (CS), which uses exponentially-decaying constants, and Learnable Scaling (LS), which employs a small shared network to predict scaling coefficients. The methods are theoretically grounded and demonstrate improvements in convergence and stability across various models and datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of the instability in U-Net due to LSC coefficients, offering significant insights.
- The proposed scaling methods (CS and LS) are simple yet effective, enhancing training stability and performance.
- Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, with key codes provided for reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a discussion of more recent diffusion model baselines and related works, which could enhance the context of the proposed methods.
- There is insufficient exploration of other potential factors contributing to instability beyond LSCs.
- The explanation of the algorithms, particularly the rationale behind the scaling direction and the learning process in LS, is not intuitive.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related works, particularly those addressing scaling in other architectures, to provide a broader context. Additionally, we suggest including qualitative comparisons with existing methods to complement the quantitative results. Clarifying the rationale behind the scaling direction in CS and the learning process in LS would enhance the understanding of these methods. Finally, addressing the placement of figures for better alignment with their descriptions would improve the overall presentation.
