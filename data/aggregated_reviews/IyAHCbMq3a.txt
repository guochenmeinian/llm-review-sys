Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a unified framework for weakly supervised learning, addressing Learning from Label Proportions (LLP), Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), and Positive and Unlabeled Learning (PU). The authors propose a differentiable count loss based on the probability of a count sum constraint, computed using a dynamic programming algorithm. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The unification of different weakly supervised paradigms under the count loss is a novel contribution, and the dynamic programming algorithm enables efficient computation of the loss.
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, providing a clear explanation of the proposed methodology and its application.
- Strong empirical performance is demonstrated across multiple datasets, enhancing the credibility of the research.

Weaknesses:  
- The loss is currently defined only for binary classification, limiting its applicability; alternatives for multi-class settings should be discussed.
- The novelty of the approach can be questioned, as similar probabilistic logic methods exist in the literature.
- The paper lacks a detailed description of the training algorithm, which is essential for understanding how gradients are propagated from the objective to the instance level.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contribution by providing a more explicit comparison with existing methods and emphasizing the novelty of their approach. Additionally, the authors should discuss the potential for extending the loss to multi-class classification and include a pseudocode for the training algorithm to clarify the optimization process. It would also be beneficial to include a runtime comparison with probabilistic logic engines and to ensure that all figures and tables are correctly labeled and positioned for clarity.
