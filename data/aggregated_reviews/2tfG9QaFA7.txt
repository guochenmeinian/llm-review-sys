Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents R-Blur, a biologically inspired data augmentation technique aimed at enhancing the robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) against adversarial attacks and common image corruptions. The authors propose a method that simulates human visual perception by adaptively blurring and desaturating images based on fixation points. They evaluate R-Blur on datasets such as CIFAR-10, Ecoset, and ImageNet, demonstrating its potential to achieve results comparable to adversarial training.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents a clear motivation for the proposed method, which is unique in its biologically inspired approach.
- The results indicate improvements in robustness against non-adversarial corruptions, suggesting some significance in the findings.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution of individual components, such as noise and adaptive Gaussian blurring, is not clearly articulated, raising questions about their roles in the overall effectiveness of R-Blur.
- Comparisons with baseline methods are limited, particularly regarding adversarial training, which weakens claims about R-Blur's generalization of robustness.
- The ablation study lacks adequate explanation, particularly concerning the dynamic fixation point selection, which appears to degrade performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by explicitly detailing the contributions of each component in the R-Blur framework, particularly the role of noise. Additionally, we suggest including more comprehensive baseline comparisons, such as Gaussian augmentation with varying parameters, to substantiate claims of enhanced robustness. The authors should also address the concerns regarding the fixation model's dependency and its implications for computational efficiency. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to enhance the ablation study by providing clearer explanations of the results and refining the presentation of figures and tables for better comprehension.
