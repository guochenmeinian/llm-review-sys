### Key Points
This paper presents a study on paraphrase identification and generation, introducing 26 fine-grained paraphrase types to enhance traditional binary settings. The authors evaluate several pre-trained language models (PLMs) and the Extended Paraphrase Typology Corpus (ETPC), demonstrating correlations between paraphrase types and their impact on detection and generation tasks. The work aims to provide a more granular analysis of paraphrased text, which could benefit future research in paraphrase identification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-motivated, highlighting the need for paraphrase type generation and detection, which could aid future research.
2. Extensive experiments are conducted, showing performance gains on the ETPC corpus and applicability to other datasets like Quora question pairs.
3. The authors explore diverse models, providing insights into the capabilities of both large and smaller models in transfer learning settings.

Weaknesses:
1. The intuitive assumption that paraphrase type generation and detection will improve identification task performance lacks empirical support; concrete applications should be demonstrated.
2. Statistical significance tests and effect size reports are necessary to validate claims of superior performance.
3. The clarity of the paper is compromised by ambiguities regarding task definitions and the applicability of proposed paraphrase types across different datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by explicitly defining whether tasks are sentence-level or phrase-level and ensuring consistency in terminology. Additionally, we suggest conducting statistical significance tests for reported performance measures and providing more analysis on realistic paraphrasing scenarios involving longer sequences. It would also be beneficial to discuss related works more thoroughly and consider incorporating insights from existing augmentation literature like SSMBA, ROTOM, and UDA. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the results presented in Figure 3 and ensure that the evaluation metrics are fully defined in the captions.
