### Key Points
This paper presents a detailed analysis of uncertainty in question answering, distinguishing between denotational and epistemic uncertainty. The authors propose two resampling-based confidence estimation strategies: one based on the frequency of matching outputs and another on the ratio of unique samples to total samples. The study evaluates these methods against existing approaches, demonstrating that the sampling repetition confidence score performs well across calibration metrics for both ambiguous and unambiguous questions. The paper also discusses the implications of model fine-tuning on confidence scores.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and clearly articulates the breakdown of uncertainty, making it accessible.
- The proposed sampling-based confidence measures are simple, intuitive, and demonstrate superior performance compared to baseline methods.
- The inclusion of various calibration metrics and the self-contained nature of the experiments enhance the paper's robustness.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the proposed methods is somewhat diminished by similarities to existing literature, particularly regarding the resampling mechanism.
- The experimental design raises concerns, particularly regarding the evaluation criteria for ambiguous questions, which may not accurately reflect the model's ability to handle denotational uncertainty.
- The paper lacks a comprehensive discussion of alternative confidence calibration methods from the literature, potentially misrepresenting its contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the evaluation criteria for ambiguous questions, ensuring that the model's performance is assessed based on its chosen interpretation rather than any valid interpretation. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion of the computational costs associated with the proposed methods compared to baseline approaches. It would also be beneficial to provide statistics, such as standard deviations, on the sampling-based results to enhance reproducibility. Finally, addressing the overlap with existing literature more explicitly would strengthen the paper's contributions.
