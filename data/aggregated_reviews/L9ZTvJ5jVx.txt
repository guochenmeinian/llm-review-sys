Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method, Aether, for discovering latent fields within dynamical systems to enhance modeling of their evolutions. The authors propose to disentangle local interactions from global field effects, utilizing equivariant graph networks and neural networks. Their experimental results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in various scenarios, including charged particles, traffic scenes, and gravitational n-body problems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper addresses an important problem of latent field discovery with originality. The presentation is clear, and the method is well-structured, making it accessible to a broad audience. The experiments are comprehensive, covering diverse datasets, which showcases the method's applicability.

Weaknesses:  
The training objective is not explicitly stated, leading to potential ambiguity in understanding the methodology. The deterministic nature of the training objective may not align with the non-deterministic nature of trajectory forecasting. Additionally, the experiments primarily involve simple scenarios, lacking comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, particularly in real-world applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by explicitly stating the training objective and addressing the implications of using a deterministic approach for inherently non-deterministic problems. Including comparisons with more challenging datasets and state-of-the-art methods would enhance the credibility of the proposed approach. Furthermore, we suggest adding references to relevant probabilistic models of neural fields to strengthen the literature review. Lastly, clarifying the notations and providing additional explanations for experimental results would improve the overall presentation.
