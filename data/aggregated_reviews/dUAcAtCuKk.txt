Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents RECKONING, a two-level learning algorithm aimed at enhancing reasoning in transformer-based language models by encoding contextual knowledge into model parameters. The algorithm operates through an inner loop that trains the model via back-propagation (BP) and an outer loop that utilizes these updated parameters for answering questions. Experimental results on multi-hop reasoning datasets demonstrate that RECKONING outperforms the in-context reasoning (ICR) baseline by up to 4.5%, shows improved generalization to longer reasoning chains, and exhibits robustness against distractors.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research topic is significant, enhancing transformer models by integrating in-context knowledge to improve reasoning capabilities.
- RECKONING consistently surpasses conventional ICR methods, supported by comprehensive experiments and ablation studies.
- The algorithm's design is original, allowing the model to autonomously filter irrelevant facts and focus on relevant knowledge.

Weaknesses:
- The inner loop's incremental nature may lead to issues with contradictory facts from different contexts.
- The experimental comparisons with weak baselines like "No-Facts" and "Random-Facts" limit the robustness of the findings.
- The performance improvement in standard settings without distractors is minimal, and the need for on-the-fly parameter updates complicates application to larger models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental design by including more robust baselines and conducting evaluations on a broader range of real-world datasets beyond the synthetic ones used. Additionally, incorporating more complex reasoning tasks and exploring the algorithm's performance on public pre-trained language models like LLaMA would provide further validation. Clarifying the necessity of the two-phase learning process and addressing how the model handles contradictory information would enhance the paper's clarity and depth.
