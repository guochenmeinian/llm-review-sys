### Key Points
This paper presents an entity-aware article generation and retrieval approach, ENGINE, which incorporates named entities into language models to enhance article comprehension tasks. The authors conduct experiments on datasets such as GoodNews and VisualNews, demonstrating that ENGINE improves performance in article generation and retrieval. The framework effectively extracts named entities from both metadata and embedded images, showcasing its utility in recognizing and predicting entity types.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The incorporation of named entities enhances the model's performance in article generation and retrieval.
- Comprehensive experiments validate that ENGINE produces high-quality articles and can contribute to the development of machine-generated text detectors.
- Extensive comparisons with other language models highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Weaknesses:
- The training process of ENGINE lacks clarity regarding the loss function, learning rate, and other training strategies.
- The ablation study is incomplete, missing analyses on specific configurations of the model.
- Human evaluation studies do not align well with the paper's primary use case.
- Concerns regarding the precision of named entities extracted from articles due to the absence of ground truth data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the training process by detailing the loss function, learning rate, and other training strategies. Additionally, the authors should enhance the ablation study by including analyses of Cap-CapNE-ClipNE-EA and Cap-CapNE-ClipNE-NE-EA configurations. It would also be beneficial to address the discrepancies in the human study's relevance to the use case and provide more motivation for the evaluation method. Lastly, the authors should clarify the precision of named entities acquired from articles, considering the lack of ground truth information in the dataset.
