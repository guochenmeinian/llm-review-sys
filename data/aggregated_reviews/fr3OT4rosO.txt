Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the CityRefer dataset, which includes manual annotations and text descriptions of objects in city-scale point clouds, enhancing the previously available SensatUrban data. Key contributions include manual alignment of point clouds with OpenStreetMap (OSM) for access to street names and the provision of instance-wise segmentation masks for 5k objects, including 1.8k landmarks, along with 35k natural language descriptions. The dataset aims to facilitate city-level 3D visual grounding tasks and is supported by a baseline method for performance evaluation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
- The dataset addresses a significant gap in city-level 3D visual grounding, making it a valuable resource for applications like autonomous driving.
- The authors employ a systematic approach to data collection, including rigorous quality control and manual verification of annotations.
- The integration of geographical data from OSM enhances the dataset's utility.

**Weaknesses:**
- The dataset may be specialized for specific urban environments, potentially limiting its generalizability to diverse global cities.
- The initial data construction results in 2D semantic masks rather than 3D masks, which may not fully meet the needs of certain applications.
- There is a lack of evaluation of state-of-the-art methods on the proposed dataset, with limited benchmarks provided.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset's generalizability by annotating additional city-scale 3D datasets from various countries. Additionally, we suggest providing 3D bounding box labels to enhance applicability in fields like autonomous driving. The authors should also discuss the challenges of transferring indoor 3D visual grounding methods to large-scale outdoor scenes, including computation limitations and efficiency. Finally, we encourage the inclusion of more recent state-of-the-art methods in the evaluation benchmarks to strengthen the dataset's relevance.
