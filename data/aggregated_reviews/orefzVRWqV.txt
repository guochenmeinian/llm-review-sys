### Key Points
This paper presents an *NLP engineering experiment* focused on predicting personality dimensions (e.g., Big Five, MBTI) from text using a Psychological Encoder and a fine-tuned BERT model. The authors propose PsyAttention, which optimizes the number of features representing personality in texts and implements a model combining a fine-tuned BERT with a transformer-like model utilizing an attention mechanism for processing feature values extracted from text. The paper identifies the challenge of excessive psychological features and proposes a method to reduce them while integrating them into the training phase of BERT.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper proposes an interesting approach to predicting personality from text.
- It provides a comprehensive overview of methods for extracting personality-related linguistic features.
- The writing quality and methodology are well-articulated, and the reported improvement in accuracy is significant.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation lacks details such as train/test/validation splits and the attention mechanism's functionality on numerical sequences.
- The paper's contributions may be viewed as relatively incremental, given the extensive prior research on psychological feature identification.
- There are inconsistencies in terminology and presentation, including typos and unclear references to Big Five and MBTI.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the description and motivation of the attention mechanism used for the psychological feature encoder. Clarifying how the attention mechanism operates on sequences of discrete numerical values is essential. Additionally, providing details on train/validation/test splits and dataset statistics will enhance reproducibility. We suggest consistently referring to Big Five and MBTI as datasets throughout the paper unless a more detailed explanation is provided. Addressing minor typographical errors and presentation inconsistencies will also strengthen the paper. Finally, including a discussion of the methods, results, and their limitations would provide a more comprehensive analysis.
