Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an unbiased client sampling method called DELTA for Federated Learning (FL), which considers both variance and gradient diversity in client selection. The authors provide theoretical proofs demonstrating that DELTA achieves better convergence rates for non-convex objective functions compared to existing methods. They validate their approach through numerical experiments across various datasets, showcasing its practical advantages.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The consideration of gradient diversity in client sampling is a novel contribution to FL research.
- The paper effectively combines theoretical analysis with empirical validation, presenting clear motivation and methodology.
- The structure and clarity of the paper are generally good, facilitating reader comprehension.

Weaknesses:
- Assumption 4 is a strong condition that may not hold in many practical scenarios, potentially undermining the theoretical results.
- The paper contains excessive content for its length, leading to a lack of intuition regarding key theoretical results.
- The writing quality is inconsistent, with grammatical errors and unclear parameter definitions, which could hinder understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their writing and organization, addressing grammatical issues and providing clearer definitions for parameters used in the analysis. Additionally, the authors should discuss the implications if Assumption 4 does not hold and elaborate on the key intuition behind the theoretical advantages of their new sampling method. A more uniform presentation of thresholds in experiments and a summary of accuracy profiles over communication rounds would enhance the empirical results section. Finally, we suggest that the authors clarify the relationship between their proposed methods and existing algorithms to better highlight their contributions.
