Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the impact of user consent on the accuracy of recommendation systems, particularly in the context of cookie sharing as mandated by GDPR. The authors simulate a recommender system that adapts to users' decisions to share cookies, revealing that non-consenting users may paradoxically lead to higher recommendation accuracy under certain conditions. The study emphasizes the need for new fairness metrics that align with users' privacy choices and the accuracy of recommendations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a novel and relevant topic, providing clear insights into the interplay between cookie consent and recommendation accuracy.  
- The simulation model is well-documented, and the paper is clearly written, facilitating comprehension.  
- The findings have potential implications for future research on fairness in recommendation systems.

Weaknesses:  
- The analysis relies solely on a simplified simulation environment, raising questions about the generalizability of the results to real-world scenarios.  
- The recommendation model used is non-standard and may not reflect common industry practices, which could limit the applicability of the findings.  
- The title may mislead readers into thinking the results stem from a randomized field experiment rather than simulations.  
- There is insufficient discussion of limitations and the significance of the observed effects in practical settings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the robustness of their findings by incorporating real-world datasets to validate the observed effects of cookie consent on recommendation accuracy. Additionally, consider simplifying the simulation setup to clarify the key drivers of the results. It would be beneficial to explore how the model behaves with more than two cohorts and different cookie types. We also suggest revising the title to accurately reflect the nature of the study, and enhancing the discussion of limitations to provide a clearer context for the findings.
