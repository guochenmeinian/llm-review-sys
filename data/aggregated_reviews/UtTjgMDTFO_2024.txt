Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for learning surrogate models of complex simulations, specifically focusing on interventionally consistent models that maintain simulation behavior under changes in structural parameters. The authors treat both the simulation and surrogate as causal models, utilizing interventional consistency to ensure that interventions in the simulation are accurately represented by the surrogate. The method is demonstrated through an epidemiological agent-based model, showcasing theoretical and empirical results. Additionally, the authors critique a method proposed in [R3.1], highlighting its limitations in scalability and applicability to complex systems. They argue that [R3.1]'s approach requires an impractical number of parameters for large-scale models, making it unsuitable for epidemic simulations. In contrast, the authors' method learns both the $\omega$ map and the mechanisms governing high-level variables, offering a more scalable and interpretable solution while minimizing reliance on domain expertise.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it accessible to readers.
- The mathematical formalism is well-defined and easy to follow.
- It bridges the gap between theoretical causal abstraction and practical applications, providing a solid theoretical foundation.
- The authors provide a detailed experimental comparison demonstrating the superior scalability and performance of their method over [R3.1].
- They emphasize the importance of integrating domain knowledge in a way that aligns with responsible AI practices.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution to existing literature is unclear, as many core elements have been previously introduced with only minor differences.
- Empirical evaluations are limited to a single domain, lacking broader applicability to other complex simulations.
- The paper does not adequately compare the proposed method to state-of-the-art surrogate modeling techniques.
- Scalability to larger simulations and guidance on selecting appropriate interventions for training are not thoroughly addressed.
- Some reviewers express concerns about the reliance on domain expertise, suggesting it limits the method's applicability to practitioners without strong domain knowledge.
- There are claims of limited novelty, with some reviewers arguing that the contributions overlap with prior work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of results to provide clearer insights into the framework's contributions compared to existing literature. Expanding empirical evaluations to include more complex scenarios would enhance understanding of the method's benefits. Additionally, a thorough comparison with existing surrogate modeling techniques should be included to demonstrate the proposed method's advantages. We suggest addressing scalability concerns and providing guidance on how to choose appropriate interventions for training the surrogate, as these are critical for practical application. Furthermore, we recommend improving the clarity regarding the role of domain knowledge in defining the $\tau$ map and providing more detailed practical examples of how to select $\tau$ in various contexts to enhance accessibility for a broader audience. Addressing the concerns about the novelty of their contributions more explicitly could also strengthen their position against critiques regarding the originality of their work.
