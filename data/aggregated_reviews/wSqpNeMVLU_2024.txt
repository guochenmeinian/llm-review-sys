Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical study on speculative decoding and batch speculative decoding, demonstrating that speculative decoding is unbiased and optimal within its defined family of algorithms. The authors characterize the expected rejection rate and analyze the trade-offs between efficiency and effectiveness, providing insights into the optimal rejection threshold. Theorems 1 and 2 establish the optimality and unbiased nature of the sampling method, while Theorem 3 introduces a multi-candidate approach to enhance acceptance rates.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors provide a robust theoretical foundation, illustrating practical implications such as improved rejection accuracy.
- The writing is clear, with effective takeaways under each theorem, enhancing understanding.
- The theoretical analysis offers valuable insights into inference efficiency and is supported by simulation experiments.

Weaknesses:
- The main figure fails to clearly communicate the core concept of speculative decoding, potentially misleading readers regarding its advantages.
- The experimental results are insufficiently highlighted, lacking a clear connection to the theoretical analysis.
- The assumption that the computation complexity of the small model is negligible may not hold in practical scenarios, and empirical evidence is needed to justify this.
- The paper primarily reiterates existing findings, with only Theorems 4 and 5 presenting novel insights, leaving questions about the design of the rejection threshold and the potential for new speculative algorithms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the main figure to better convey the core concept of speculative decoding. Additionally, the authors should enhance the presentation of experimental results, explicitly linking them to the theoretical analysis. To strengthen the validity of their assumptions, we suggest providing empirical evidence regarding the computational complexity of the small model. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to discuss the design of the rejection threshold more comprehensively and consider summarizing a new speculative algorithm based on Theorems 4 and 5, including experiments comparing it to vanilla speculative decoding.
