### Key Points
This paper investigates the influence of knowledge graph completion (KGC) on knowledge graph question answering (KGQA), proposing a benchmark that utilizes existing datasets to evaluate this relationship. The authors demonstrate that while effective KGC can enhance KGQA, improved KGC performance does not always correlate with better KGQA outcomes. The study includes empirical comparisons of popular KGC techniques and their effects on KGQA methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and clearly motivated, making it easy to follow.
- The experimental design is sound, and the task is novel, addressing an overlooked area in the literature.
- The authors utilize a widely recognized benchmark (GrailQA), enhancing the empirical weight of their findings.

Weaknesses:
- The concept of incompleteness in the KGC task is somewhat artificial, potentially misleading readers regarding the performance of KGC models.
- There is a lack of thorough analysis explaining why better KGC performance does not always lead to improved KGQA performance, including both quantitative and qualitative insights.
- The choice of KGC techniques, specifically DecAF and Pangu, lacks justification, and the absence of semantic parsing techniques is concerning given their relevance to KGQA.
- The experimental setting's incompletion ratios (20%, 50%, 80%) may not reflect realistic KG systems, requiring further justification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the correlation between KGC and KGQA by including quantitative factors such as entity types and qualitative aspects like challenging questions. Additionally, the authors should consider incorporating more popular semantic parsing techniques to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of KGC's impact. Justifying the selection of DecAF and Pangu beyond their status as state-of-the-art techniques would strengthen the paper. Lastly, providing context for the chosen incompletion ratios would enhance the credibility of the experimental setting.
