### Key Points
This paper investigates the functional form of the surprisalâ€“reading time (RT) relationship across seven languages, focusing on whether this relationship is linear or superlinear. The authors employ likelihood ratio tests to compare various mixed effect models, finding that surprisal predicts RTs and that surprisal squared further predicts RTs in three languages. The study contributes valuable cross-linguistic data to an ongoing debate about the connection between surprisal and reading time, expanding beyond previous English-centric analyses.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a timely and relevant topic in cognitive modeling.
- It provides important cross-linguistic contributions that advance the field.
- The methods are sound, and results are clearly presented.

Weaknesses:
- The analysis does not control for frequency effects, which may significantly impact results.
- The corpora used differ in size and genre, complicating the interpretation of findings across languages.
- The conclusions drawn regarding linear versus superlinear effects may not be statistically robust.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis by including frequency effects as a baseline feature, as this could alter the overall results. Additionally, conducting robustness analyses that vary corpus size and genre, as well as spillover effect windows, would strengthen the findings. We also suggest re-evaluating the model training process to ensure that all languages are treated equitably, potentially by training models to convergence rather than stopping early. Finally, clarifying the relationship between first fixation and gaze duration metrics, as well as addressing the mischaracterization of Surprisal Theory, would enhance the paper's clarity and rigor.
