### Key Points
This paper presents a framework, PLIA_t, to address the scalability of probabilistic inference in integer arithmetic using the fast Fourier transform (FFT). The authors propose a novel approach leveraging tensor operations to compute probability distributions over integer-valued random variables, significantly reducing computational complexity from quadratic to logarithmic time. The method incorporates the log-sum-exp trick to enhance numerical stability and facilitates gradient-based learning, which is crucial for neurosymbolic AI applications. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in inference and learning times.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is well-detailed, with a clear mathematical foundation and effective discussion of the Fast Log-Conv-Exp trick.
- The innovative use of tensor operations and FFT represents a significant advancement in the field.
- The paper is well-written, with a logical structure that enhances readability and accessibility for a broad audience.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental section is limited, lacking depth in showcasing the method's potential and limitations.
- The framework PLIA_t is not clearly defined, raising concerns about reproducibility and transparency regarding inputs, outputs, and algorithms.
- There is insufficient discussion on the practical implications of the #P-hardness of probabilistic inference and the algorithmic complexity beyond time complexity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by extending it to better illustrate the method's capabilities and limitations, particularly regarding scalability. Additionally, we urge the authors to provide a formal characterization of PLIA_t, including its inputs, outputs, and representations, to enhance clarity and reproducibility. A more detailed discussion on the practical limitations and potential computational bottlenecks of the proposed method would be beneficial. Furthermore, including specifics about the computational environment, libraries used, and parameter settings would aid in reproducibility. Lastly, addressing potential underflow or overflow issues during computations and their impact on accuracy would strengthen the paper.
