Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SocialGPT, a modular framework for social relation reasoning that integrates Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors propose a Greedy Segment Prompt Optimization (GSPO) algorithm to enhance prompt tuning. The framework demonstrates strong performance in zero-shot settings on benchmarks like PIPA and PISC, supported by extensive empirical results, including ablation studies that validate the effectiveness of the Social Story design.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized, with a logical flow and clear explanations.
- The innovative combination of VFMs and LLMs achieves competitive zero-shot performance and provides interpretable reasoning.
- The GSPO algorithm significantly improves the performance of LLMs in social relation reasoning tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The direct technical contributions are somewhat limited, lacking an obvious breakthrough beyond the GSPO technique.
- The use of the generic semantic segmentation model (SAM) may not be optimal; stronger Human Instance Segmentation methods could enhance performance.
- The reliance on LLMs for generating social stories raises questions about the effectiveness of this approach, especially given LLMs' challenges with numerical reasoning.
- The method's performance may be constrained by the specific models used, as indicated by varying results across different LLMs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the technical contributions by exploring more innovative techniques beyond GSPO. Additionally, consider utilizing more robust Human Instance Segmentation methods instead of SAM. It would be beneficial to address the potential challenges of using LLMs for social story generation, perhaps by investigating alternative approaches. Finally, we suggest expanding the experimental evaluation to include a broader range of datasets to enhance the generalizability of the findings.
