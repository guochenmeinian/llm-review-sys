Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a deep graph generative model called GenStat that emphasizes privacy through the use of Edge Local Differential Privacy (Edge-LDP). The authors propose an inference model that learns latent variables from aggregate graph statistics, ensuring permutation invariance within the probabilistic framework. The model aims to generate graphs that maintain similar statistics to the training data while addressing privacy concerns associated with traditional adjacency matrices. The work highlights the limitations of existing graph anonymization techniques and argues for the advantages of their method in decentralized settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a novel approach to learning deep models for statistics-based graph generation, specifically focusing on privacy.
2. GenStat guarantees Edge-LDP, providing a stricter privacy assurance compared to existing methods.
3. The proposed model effectively generates graphs that exhibit closer statistical resemblance to training sets compared to previous parametric models.
4. The model is permutation invariant and significantly faster than benchmarks, with training and generation times improved by up to two orders of magnitude.
5. The empirical study is thorough, demonstrating the model's performance in generating realistic graphs and indicating that GenStat ranks highly among models in real-world datasets.

Weaknesses:
1. The task setting lacks clarity regarding the practical applications of the generated graphs and the datasets supporting these applications.
2. The technical contribution appears minor, as the model resembles a basic variant of a VAE without significant innovations.
3. The evaluation metrics are insufficiently detailed, and the model's dependency on specific graph statistics raises concerns about its ability to capture complex dependencies.
4. The assumption of independence for latent variables may limit the model's expressiveness, and the method is not suitable for graphs with node features.
5. The paper does not sufficiently clarify why accessing the adjacency matrix poses privacy risks, particularly when node identifiers and edge features are omitted.
6. The results presented in Figures 3 and Table 1 are deemed excessive and not surprising, as traditional graph generative models lack the capacity to model the example graphs.
7. There is a lack of detailed comparison between the proposed methods and standard graph generative models, leaving unclear the advantages of choosing GenStat over traditional approaches.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the task setting by explicitly stating the potential applications of the generated graphs and providing supporting datasets. It is essential to include evaluation results on downstream tasks to demonstrate the usefulness of the generated graphs. Additionally, the authors should enhance the technical depth of the model by addressing the limitations of the current approach and clarifying the determination of graph statistics. We also suggest improving the explanation of privacy concerns related to accessing the adjacency matrix, particularly in the context of existing de-anonymization algorithms. Furthermore, we recommend trimming Figures 3 and Table 1 or relocating them to the appendix to enhance conciseness. Finally, more discussions comparing the proposed methods with standard graph generative models should be added, including a runtime complexity comparison to clarify the advantages of GenStat.
