Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents R2-Gaussian, a framework for tomographic reconstruction utilizing 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) to overcome limitations in traditional volumetric reconstruction methods, particularly for X-ray computed tomography (CT). The authors propose modifications to the rendering equation, correct integration biases, and introduce a CUDA-based differentiable voxelizer. The framework aims to achieve high reconstruction performance with a limited number of views, validated through simulated X-ray comparisons against state-of-the-art techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper identifies and addresses integration bias in standard 3DGS formulations, contributing valuable insights to the field.
- The R2-Gaussian framework employs tailored Gaussian kernels and rectified projection techniques, enhancing volumetric reconstruction.
- The evaluation includes extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons, demonstrating a favorable trade-off between volume accuracy and reconstruction time.

Weaknesses:
- The performance of the proposed method in real-world clinical or industrial scenarios is not thoroughly examined, raising questions about its practical applicability.
- The distinction between sparse-view reconstruction and the number of X-ray views (75, 50, and 25) is unclear, questioning their practicality for CT reconstruction.
- The kernel formulation's inability to model scattering effects in X-ray imaging is a significant limitation.
- The clarity of certain figures and the implementation details, such as the voxelization process, require further elaboration.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation of their method by including real-world data to demonstrate its applicability in clinical settings. Additionally, clarifying the practical implications of using 75, 50, and 25 views for sparse-view reconstruction would strengthen the paper. We suggest providing a more detailed explanation of the kernel formulation's limitations regarding scattering effects and enhancing the clarity of figures, particularly Fig. 7, to better illustrate the voxelization process. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to augment the discussion on existing works, such as X-Gaussian and C^2RV, to contextualize their contributions more effectively.
