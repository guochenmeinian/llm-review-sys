### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of using LLM-generated data to address issues of scarcity and imbalance in medical datasets, specifically focusing on the detection of Alzheimer's signs and symptoms. The authors propose a method that combines a gold standard dataset with text generated from large language models, demonstrating improved performance in information extraction tasks. However, the paper lacks a rigorous assessment of data quality, ethical considerations, and comparisons with existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a compelling case for the use of LLM-generated data in clinical NLP, particularly in addressing data imbalance.
- The writing is clear, and the authors validate their approach with human evaluations.
- The study shows that the bronze dataset generated by GPT-4 is more accurate than the silver dataset, which is an interesting finding.

Weaknesses:
- Limited novelty, as the concept of combining synthetic text to enhance NLP performance is not new, despite its application to Alzheimer's disease being novel.
- The sample size for human evaluation is small, and the study relies on data that may not be reproducible outside the authors' institution.
- The presentation is incomplete, with a need for clearer figures and tables, and a more thorough analysis of errors in the generated datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the rigor of their assessment of data quality and address ethical considerations more thoroughly. Additionally, expanding the related works section to include missing references and providing a more comprehensive comparison with existing methods would strengthen the paper. We also suggest that the authors conduct a broader evaluation across different datasets and tasks to validate their findings further. Enhancing the clarity of figures and tables, as well as including error bars and a concept figure, would improve the overall presentation. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore the methodological novelty of their approach in relation to previous work.
