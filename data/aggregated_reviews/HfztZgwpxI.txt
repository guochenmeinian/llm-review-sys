Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel intervention-based metric, OMES, for assessing disentangled representation learning and investigates the transfer of disentangled representations from synthetic to real-world datasets. The authors conduct extensive experiments to validate OMES against other metrics and explore the retention of disentanglement properties during transfer. The study reveals insights into the behavior of disentangled representations across different datasets and emphasizes the importance of fine-tuning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a comprehensive explanation of the OMES metric.
- Extensive experiments cover various application scenarios and datasets, providing valuable empirical insights into disentanglement properties.
- The formulation of research questions is clear and guides the paper's logic effectively.

Weaknesses:
- The readability of the results section is hindered by large blocks of text, particularly in Section 3.3.
- The presentation of the OMES metric lacks clarity and structure, making it difficult to follow.
- The implications of transferring disentangled representations to complex real-world datasets are not thoroughly discussed.
- The authors do not adequately address the comparison between their transfer learning approach and training from scratch on the target dataset.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the readability of Section 3.3 by restructuring the results into more digestible paragraphs. Additionally, please clarify the presentation of the OMES metric by adding headlines or rephrasing content for better flow. We suggest including more complex synthetic datasets in the experiments to assess the generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explicitly discuss how to select appropriate source datasets for given target datasets, including defining and measuring structural similarity. Lastly, we recommend providing a clearer comparison of performance between the proposed method and training from scratch on the target dataset to evaluate the impact of the transfer learning approach.
