Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for reconstructing 3D shapes from noisy point clouds using neural signed distance functions (SDFs). The authors propose a novel approach that combines data-driven and overfitting-based techniques, employing local statistical reasoning to refine SDF estimations without requiring clean point clouds or signed distance supervision. The method is validated against multiple baselines and datasets, demonstrating improved reconstruction accuracy and faster convergence times. Additionally, the paper includes ablation studies on shape codes, examining code length and initialization methods, and discusses the use of Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) over Chamfer Distance (CD) for evaluating their method, emphasizing the advantages of EMD's one-to-one correspondence. The authors explain the rationale behind using averaged shape codes, highlighting their ability to stabilize optimization and inherit geometric details from the training dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The integration of data-driven and overfitting-based methods effectively enhances robustness against noise, improving accuracy in surface reconstruction and denoising tasks.
2. Extensive experiments across various datasets show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms existing methods, with the locality of the loss contributing positively to performance.
3. The paper provides a thorough investigation of shape code initialization methods and their impact on results.
4. The distinction between EMD and CD is well-articulated, clarifying the benefits of EMD for their approach.
5. The explanation of averaged shape codes is comprehensive, detailing their advantages in optimization.

Weaknesses:
1. The manuscript contains numerous typographical errors that detract from its professionalism and clarity.
2. The method's performance appears heavily dependent on the quality of initial data-driven priors, which may limit effectiveness in scenarios where such priors are poorly tuned.
3. The paper lacks a thorough discussion of computational demands and scalability when applied to larger datasets or more complex scenarios.
4. Some ablation study results were not reported due to poor performance, which may limit the understanding of the methods' effectiveness.
5. The discussion on local patches and their benefits could be further elaborated to strengthen the argument.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the manuscript by thoroughly proofreading to eliminate typographical errors. Additionally, a more detailed discussion on the dependency of performance on initial conditions should be included, addressing how the method behaves under limited computational resources and varying noise types. It would also be beneficial to elaborate on the computational demands and scalability of the method when applied to larger datasets. Furthermore, we suggest improving the organization of the ablation study on shape codes and adding a discussion on the advantages of using local patches to enhance clarity. Lastly, consider including more details on the initialization methods that yielded poor results to provide a complete picture of the study's findings.
