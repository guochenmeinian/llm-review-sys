Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the AdaptIR framework, which introduces a mixture-of-expert approach to the image restoration community, facilitating rapid adaptation of pre-trained models to various tasks. The framework consists of three parallel branches: local interaction, channel gating, and frequency affine modules, which collectively extract heterogeneous representations. AdaptIR demonstrates consistent performance improvements on both single-degradation and hybrid-degradation tasks across two baseline models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a parameter-efficient transfer learning paradigm to low-level vision tasks, incorporating the AdaptIR module that adds a few trainable parameters to frozen pre-trained restoration backbones.
2. AdaptIR effectively adapts pre-trained models with heterogeneous representations across tasks through its three parallel branches, excelling in local spatial, global spatial, and channel representations.
3. The framework shows robust performance improvements across various image restoration tasks, validating its effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. The authors should analyze the distribution of feature response intensity across the three branches to evaluate the adaptability and flexibility of the proposed approach in varying tasks.
2. Generalization experiments on new tasks and degradation levels within the same task are encouraged to further validate the approach.
3. The claim that fine-tuning requires 500 epochs raises questions about the efficiency of the proposed method as a transfer learning strategy.
4. A comparison with prompt-based approaches, which utilize task-specific prompts for generalization without a fine-tuning stage, should be discussed to highlight the advantages of AdaptIR.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of feature response intensity distribution across the three branches to better assess adaptability. Additionally, conducting generalization experiments on new tasks and degradation levels would strengthen the validation of their approach. The authors should consider reducing the fine-tuning epoch requirement to enhance the efficiency of their method. Finally, we suggest including a discussion on the advantages of AdaptIR compared to existing prompt-based approaches to clarify its unique contributions.
