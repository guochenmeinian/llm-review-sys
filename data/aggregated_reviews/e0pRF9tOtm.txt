Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a private algorithm for (Stochastic) Non-Convex Optimization that utilizes gradients, differences between successive gradients, and the exponential mechanism for privacy. The authors propose a combination of the Gaussian mechanism and variance reduction techniques, specifically the SpiderBoost algorithm, to find stationary points while maintaining the quality of gradient estimations. The results improve upon existing state-of-the-art bounds for both empirical and population risks, establishing new benchmarks in private optimization literature.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper provides a simple modification of SpiderBoost to enhance gradient estimation quality.  
- It introduces interesting properties, such as the algorithm's ability to escape saddle points with high probability and achieve significant decreases in function values with large drifts.  
- The writing is clear, and the logical flow makes the paper accessible.  
- The authors present robust theoretical insights and contribute valuable new results to the field of private stochastic optimization.  

Weaknesses:  
- There are concerns regarding Algorithm 1, specifically the handling of drift_t, which is set to zero but overwritten later.  
- The paper lacks a conclusion or summary, leading to an abrupt ending.  
- There is a noticeable gap between existing upper and lower bounds that requires further exploration.  
- The absence of numerical experiments and reliance solely on Advanced Composition for privacy accounting limits the practical applicability of the findings.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Algorithm 1 by addressing the handling of drift_t and providing more detailed explanations for technical results, such as those from Lemma 3.4 and Algorithm 2. Additionally, we suggest including a conclusion section to summarize the findings and enhance the overall structure of the paper. Conducting experimental studies to validate theoretical results would also strengthen the work. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore alternative privacy accounting methods, such as the 'Better Privacy Accounting' method, GDP, or tighter composition theorems, to potentially improve performance.
