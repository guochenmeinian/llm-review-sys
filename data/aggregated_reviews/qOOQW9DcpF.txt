### Key Points
This paper presents the FewMNER task, focusing on multimodal named entity recognition (MNER) with limited labeled text-image pairs. The authors propose a framework leveraging the in-context learning (ICL) paradigm to address challenges such as the lack of visual inputs for large language models (LLMs) and the selection of relevant examples for ICL. The framework includes a retrieval module for similarity ranking, a demonstration design module for task understanding, and a prediction module for generating outputs. Comparative experiments indicate that this framework significantly outperforms previous methods, providing insights for future research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, organized, and easy to follow.
- It introduces the FewMNER task and explores the potential of ICL in this context, marking a novel approach in the field.
- Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks innovation, as the FewMNER concept may be considered a consensus in the AI community, and the proposed framework is overly simplistic.
- The reliance on existing techniques, such as image caption models and LLMs, limits the originality of contributions.
- The experimental results are primarily attributed to the LLM used, and the paper lacks a thorough analysis of MNER performance, reducing interpretability.
- The data comparison is limited to a single source, raising concerns about generalizability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their contributions by providing a more distinct methodology for selecting ICL examples in multimodal scenarios, rather than relying solely on cosine similarity. Additionally, we suggest conducting a broader comparison with recent relevant works to strengthen the paper's claims. Clarifying the few-shot sampling process for MNER instances and addressing the impact of image captions on model performance would enhance the paper's rigor. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore alternative metrics for calculating cosine distances and consider the effects of perturbations on ICL effectiveness.
