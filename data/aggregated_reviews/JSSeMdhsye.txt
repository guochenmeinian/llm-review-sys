### Key Points
This paper presents G-Refer, a framework that enhances explainable recommendation systems by combining a hybrid graph retrieval mechanism with retrieval-augmented fine-tuning. G-Refer aims to improve the generation of context-aware and personalized recommendation explanations by extracting explicit collaborative filtering information from user-item interaction graphs. Experimental results validate the framework's effectiveness, demonstrating significant improvements in explanation quality across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem is well-motivated and systematically addressed using a hybrid graph retrieval mechanism that extracts structured and semantically rich collaborative filtering information.
- Extensive experimental validation on multiple public datasets showcases significant improvements in explainability and stability metrics.
- The framework incorporates knowledge pruning and retrieval-augmented fine-tuning, enhancing training efficiency and the quality of generated explanations.

Weaknesses:
- The terminology used may be misleading; the model focuses on "recommendation explanation" rather than enhancing recommendation accuracy, which should be clarified.
- Some metric improvements are marginal, and the percentage improvements in Table 2 are inadequately defined.
- The evaluation metrics primarily assess natural text generation quality, complicating the interpretation of generated text quality. Additional metrics related to coherence, conciseness, and diversity could enhance evaluation.
- The paper lacks a thorough explanation of how the proposed methods directly address gaps in existing approaches, particularly in comparison to models like XRec.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of terminology by emphasizing that G-Refer focuses on "recommendation explanation." Additionally, the authors should define the percentage improvements in Table 2 more clearly and consider incorporating evaluation metrics that assess coherence, conciseness, and diversity. Furthermore, we suggest providing a more detailed theoretical analysis of why G-Refer produces better explanations and clarifying the model's use of user profiles and item attributes, particularly in the context of edge types and weights. Lastly, a more competitive comparison with GCN models that incorporate item information should be included to strengthen the claims of superiority over state-of-the-art baselines.
