### Key Points
This paper presents a strategy to enhance multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) accuracy for language models by first eliminating low-scoring answers and then rescoring the top-scoring options. The authors propose that MCQA requires two skills: eliminating choices and selecting the correct one. Their results indicate that the proposed method, PoE, often performs comparably to or better than the MCP method for various tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is clearly written and presents promising results.  
- The motivation for dividing the MCQA process into two steps is well-founded.  
- The study provides sufficient support for its claims and demonstrates reproducibility of results.

Weaknesses:  
- The scope of the approach is limited to multiple-choice questions, raising questions about its broader applicability.  
- The effectiveness of the proposed method compared to straightforward multiple-choice prompting remains unclear.  
- The experiments with ChatGPT are overly simplistic, lacking depth and variety in datasets.  
- The few-shot performance gains appear minimal, questioning the value of the additional computational step.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of when PoE is expected to outperform MCP, particularly in relation to LD and CC tasks. Additionally, addressing the question of why the scoring order changes after masking is crucial for understanding the contribution's significance. We suggest including results for LD or CC tasks in Table 2 to demonstrate the advantages of PoE over MCP. Furthermore, consider exploring a more detailed decomposition of the solution process into N-1 steps and clarify the necessity of using the "[MASK]" token for eliminated options. Finally, enhancing the ChatGPT experiments with more datasets and providing intuition for varying improvements across datasets would strengthen the paper.
