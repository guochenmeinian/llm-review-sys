### Key Points
This paper presents DynamicsDiffusion, a method utilizing denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) to generate molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories from noise. The authors demonstrate its application using alanine dipeptide, highlighting its ability to sample rare events and generate trajectories conditioned on global parameters like temperature. This approach aims to enhance the speed and efficiency of MD simulations and represents a novel application of deep generative modeling in this field.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written, with clear and easy-to-follow presentation.  
- It effectively addresses the challenge of sampling rare events, which is difficult with conventional MD simulations.  

Weaknesses:  
- The model is limited to single molecule systems post-training, whereas diffusion models typically incorporate multiple molecules during training.  
- There are concerns regarding the validity of the generated molecular structures, as the trajectories seem defined by values derived from molecular conformations rather than the atomic positions.  
- Questions remain about the rotation invariance of the protein structure representation in Cartesian coordinates.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the alignment of trajectories to a reference frame and address whether rotating all trajectories will yield similar paths. Additionally, we suggest the authors estimate the physical plausibility of each generated frame using metrics such as the Discrete Optimized Protein Energy (DOPE) score. It would also be beneficial for the authors to provide a comparison of the training and inference costs of DDPM against GPU-accelerated simulations like OpenMM, detailing the time required for generating training data, DDPM training, and inference. Finally, addressing the concerns about the chemical validity of the generated molecules and the rotation invariance in the camera-ready revision would strengthen the paper.
