### Key Points
This paper investigates spatial deixis within a signaling game framework in emergent communication, focusing on how agents communicate relative positions of integers in a sequence. The authors propose a modified signaling game that requires the sender to convey information about the position of a target integer, using normalized point-wise mutual information (NPMI) to analyze the emergent communication. The findings indicate that spatially-referent messages are frequently utilized, supporting the presence of spatial deixis. Additionally, the paper presents a detailed exploration of deixis in emergent communication (EC) systems, emphasizing generalization across longer sequences. The authors aim to avoid repetition in learned messages, although this may limit the complexity of the messages. The reviewers appreciate the authors' clarifications and the potential for broader application of the results, while also noting the need for a more formalized understanding of deixis to enhance the work's scalability and relevance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The experimental design is robust, aligning with field standards.
- The language is clear and effectively conveys central ideas.
- The provided code is of high quality, facilitating reusability in future research.
- The exploration of deixis and its generalization to longer sequences is commendable, showing potential for broader application.
- The inclusion of a formalized notion of deixis is a positive step towards understanding scalability.

Weaknesses:
- The generalizability of findings is limited due to the simplicity of the environment, raising questions about broader applicability.
- The design to avoid repetition may restrict the complexity of learned messages, limiting the depth of the findings.
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion on how the investigated deixis relates to emergent communication in more complex settings.
- Some hypotheses could be clearer if stated positively rather than negatively.
- Presentation issues exist, particularly in Section 5, where additional tables could enhance clarity.
- The paper's reliance on a simple environment raises concerns about its scalability and integration with existing literature in EC, which often lacks continuity and depth.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of hypotheses by stating them positively. Additionally, consider including tables in Section 5 to aggregate key points for easier reference. To enhance generalizability, we suggest discussing how the findings on deixis can be applied to more complex emergent communication environments. Furthermore, clarify the representation of integers in the neural network and the method of feeding inputs to the receiver agent. A more detailed analysis of the types of composition observed and their frequencies would strengthen the paper's contributions. Lastly, we encourage the authors to formalize a broader notion of deixis to better reflect its implications for generalization and scalability in more complex environments, and to improve the discussion surrounding the limitations of their design, particularly regarding the potential constraints on message complexity.
