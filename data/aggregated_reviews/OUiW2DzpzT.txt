### Key Points
This paper investigates the behavior of language models (LLMs) when faced with conflicting information between memorized knowledge and in-context prompts. The authors conduct experiments using a dataset focused on world capitals, examining how LLMs generate outputs based on factual versus counterfactual prompts. They find that LLMs exhibit a strong preference for memorized information, influenced by term frequencies in pre-training data. Additionally, the authors explore mechanisms for altering model outputs by manipulating attention heads, demonstrating that a single attention head can significantly shift the model's reliance from memory to context.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper presents a valuable investigation into LLM behavior, contributing to the understanding of how these models resolve conflicts between memorized and contextual information.  
- The experimental design is simple yet effective, providing clear insights into the mechanisms at play.  
- The identification of specialized attention heads and their influence on model performance is a significant contribution to the field.

Weaknesses:  
- The findings regarding model behavior alteration are based solely on a single dataset, raising concerns about generalizability to other contexts.  
- Some observations, such as the relationship between term frequency and memorization preference, contradict existing literature, which may require further clarification.  
- Certain sections, particularly 6.2-6.3, are difficult to follow, potentially due to writing clarity or the complexity of the content.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by testing their methods on a broader range of datasets beyond the world capitals. Additionally, addressing the contradictions with existing literature and clarifying the observations related to term frequency would strengthen the paper. We also suggest enhancing the clarity of sections 6.2-6.3 to ensure that readers can easily follow the presented analyses. Lastly, incorporating relevant references from the interpretability literature could provide a more comprehensive context for the study.
