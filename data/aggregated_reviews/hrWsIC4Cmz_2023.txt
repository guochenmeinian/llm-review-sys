Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a dataset that integrates lidar-derived biomass estimates, optical imagery, and SAR imagery for machine learning applications in biomass estimation, alongside a benchmark for estimating above-ground biomass (AGB) from satellite images. The authors create a ground truth using forestry data and LIDAR, addressing the challenges of reliable biomass density acquisition. The dataset is machine-learning ready, featuring clean processing, effective data handling, co-alignment, and temporal analysis. The benchmark has attracted significant interest, evidenced by an active leaderboard with 1000 submissions. The authors effectively introduce a significant environmental issue and provide strong visual communication, particularly in Figure 2, which simplifies complex remote sensing challenges. They also discuss baseline models derived from a DrivenData competition, highlighting their potential in biomass estimation. However, the "train_agbm" folder is currently empty, rendering the dataset unavailable for review.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths include the importance and originality of the task, the well-designed dataset, and the successful contest that generated robust baseline models. The dataset is well-processed and machine-learning ready, which is beneficial for the community. The analysis includes comprehensive metrics and visualizations, enhancing clarity on feasibility. The authors provide detailed evidence of modeling challenges faced during the competition, including the performance of a basic U-Net baseline. However, primary weaknesses are the lack of dataset availability, which is critical since it constitutes the novel contribution of the submission, and the limited spatial coverage of the dataset, which is restricted to a specific region (Finland). Additionally, the manuscript lacks detailed hyperparameters and training specifics for the models, basic baseline comparisons, and clear articulation of limitations regarding the dataset and methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset availability by ensuring the "train_agbm" folder is populated and clarify the dataset distribution links on their GitHub page to avoid confusion. Additionally, we suggest providing context for the 8% error in structural variable estimation and the RMSE values of baseline models to clarify their significance. It would be beneficial to connect the accuracy of structural variables to the baseline models to help readers understand the theoretical limits of the dataset. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to enhance the clarity of their presentation by defining key terms and improving the structure of figures and captions. We also recommend including hyperparameters and training details for the models, incorporating basic baselines for context, and adding a more detailed datasheet for the dataset. A consolidated section discussing limitations would improve clarity and transparency regarding the dataset's applicability, and considering expanding the spatial coverage of the dataset in future iterations would enhance its utility for pre-training and broader applications. Lastly, we advise using a more practical data distribution mechanism, such as a cloud bucket/container, rather than Google Drive.
