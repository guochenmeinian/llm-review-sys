Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents algorithms for sampling connected subgraphs on k nodes, termed k-graphlets, from a massive graph revealed as a stream of edges. The authors propose a semi-streaming model that utilizes linear space relative to the number of nodes, allowing multiple passes over the graph to sample k-graphlets uniformly at random. The computational complexity and sampling guarantees are formally analyzed, with several theorems demonstrating nearly optimal complexity. The paper also extends Uniform Graphlet Sampling (UGS) to the semi-streaming context, addressing challenges in constructing vertex orderings and proposing a heuristic version of the algorithm.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- A strong algorithmic contribution with a solid theoretical analysis, including lower bounds on computational complexity that closely match the proposed approach.
- The framework efficiently samples k-graphlets and provides a near-optimal memory lower bound for streaming algorithms.
- The paper is well-written and presents a compelling algorithmic framework.

Weaknesses:
- The relevance of the results to machine learning applications is unclear, as there is no connection made to potential downstream uses of k-graphlet sampling.
- The semi-streaming model appears to have limited applications for sparse graphs, raising questions about its practical utility compared to offline algorithms.
- The related work section lacks sufficient detail on the UGS algorithm and its connection to the sampling phase.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the connection between their results and machine learning applications, possibly by discussing how k-graphlet distributions could impact graph classification algorithms. Additionally, we suggest comparing their approach to existing heuristics, such as the monochromatic sampling method by Pagh and Tsourakakis, to highlight the advantages of uniform sampling. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the UGS algorithm in the related work section and clarify the relationship between the topological order and the sampling phase. Lastly, we advise enhancing the font size of figure legends for better readability.
