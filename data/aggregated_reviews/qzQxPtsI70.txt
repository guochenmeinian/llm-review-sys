### Key Points
This paper presents a multi-role approach utilizing LLMs for open-domain question answering (ODQA), integrating retrieval and generation methods. The authors propose a novel variational prompt optimization algorithm that enhances the performance of their framework, which effectively combines the retrieve-then-read and generate-then-read paradigms. The method demonstrates significant improvements over traditional baselines on standard benchmark datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method unifies two dominant paradigms and outperforms various baselines.
- The novel prompt optimization algorithm contributes significantly to the overall method and provides insights into prompt optimization techniques.
- The paper is well-written, with a clear storyline and effective experimental results demonstrating the method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity in presenting methods and experimental setups, particularly regarding the prompt optimization algorithm.
- The model's performance is heavily dependent on various components, and the analysis of these components could be more thorough.
- Some aspects, such as the prompt optimization process and query expansion, are inadequately described, hindering understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the prompt optimization step, providing a detailed description of the prompts and the learning process involved. Additionally, the authors should clarify the nature of the query expansion process, specifying whether it produces enhanced search queries or a set of generated texts. 

We suggest that the authors address the statistical significance tests performed in Table 1 and clarify the rationale behind using both a reranker and a reranking evaluator. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to expand on the analyses of query expansion quality and document reranking strategies, providing more comprehensive insights into these components.
