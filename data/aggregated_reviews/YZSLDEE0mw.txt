Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for decoding visual stimuli from fMRI neural responses through a two-phase framework. Initially, the authors pre-train an fMRI feature learner using a Double-contrastive Mask Auto-encoder to extract denoised representations from unlabeled fMRI data. In the second phase, this feature learner is fine-tuned with cross-modality guidance from visual stimuli, enabling the generation of images conditioned on fMRI signals via a latent diffusion model (LDM). The authors claim that their approach achieves significant improvements over baseline methods in generating corresponding images based on fMRI data. Additionally, the paper discusses the fMRI preprocessing pipeline, specifically addressing the use of reshaped 1D vectors for fMRI data. The authors justify the choice of 1D convolution over 3D convolution by emphasizing the relevance of cortical surface information for visual reconstruction tasks, while also noting concerns about model complexity and potential overfitting with 3D convolution.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a compelling topic, with visually appealing results.
2. The proposed framework, which integrates contrastive pre-training, cross-modality fine-tuning, and latent diffusion modeling, is well-structured and effectively communicated.
3. The ablation studies are thorough and clearly presented.
4. The authors provide a clear rationale for using 1D convolution, highlighting its alignment with existing literature and its suitability for the specific visual reconstruction task.
5. The response effectively addresses reviewer queries, demonstrating engagement and willingness to clarify methodological choices.

Weaknesses:
1. The justification for using fMRI over alternatives like EEG is insufficiently discussed, raising questions about its appropriateness for non-invasive brain-machine interfaces (BMIs).
2. Some technical descriptions are unclear or mixed up, particularly regarding the use of VQGAN versus VQ-VAE and the representation of fMRI inputs.
3. The evaluation metrics are limited to n-way top-k accuracy, lacking additional metrics for a more comprehensive assessment.
4. The authors acknowledge that 3D convolution is an interesting avenue for future exploration, indicating a limitation in the current study's scope.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the rationale for choosing fMRI over other methods, such as EEG, to clarify its advantages for non-invasive BMIs. Additionally, please ensure that the technical descriptions are accurate, particularly regarding the VQGAN and VQ-VAE terminology, and provide a consistent narrative throughout the paper. It would be beneficial to include intermediate results that evaluate the accuracy of fMRI representations after phase two. Furthermore, we suggest incorporating additional evaluation metrics, such as FID, SSIM, and MSE, to enhance the qualitative assessment of the results. Lastly, addressing potential ethical concerns related to the use of human data would strengthen the manuscript. We also recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the potential benefits and implications of exploring 3D convolution in future work, and incorporating more detailed justifications for the preprocessing steps taken could enhance the clarity and robustness of the methodology presented.
