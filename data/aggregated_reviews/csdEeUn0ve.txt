Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical analysis of reinforcement learning (RL) in tabular Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with impaired observability due to delayed and missing state observations. The authors propose algorithms based on optimism and demonstrate that these algorithms achieve near-optimal regret bounds that scale optimally with the state and action spaces, as well as polynomially with the horizon length.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The model of RL with impaired observability is novel and relevant, with significant real-world applications.
2. The paper is well-written and effectively conveys the challenges and motivations behind the proposed algorithms.
3. The algorithms are straightforward, and the regret bounds are close to optimal.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the paper is primarily in the model definition, while the algorithmic contributions and regret analysis appear straightforward and lack depth.
2. The algorithms exhibit exponential time complexity in relation to the horizon length, limiting the practical contributions of the work.
3. The regret analysis does not sufficiently explore the dependence on delays or missing observation rates, and the assumptions regarding feedback order and their implications require further discussion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of the algorithmic contributions by exploring more innovative approaches beyond the straightforward application of optimism. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more thorough discussion of the relationship between their work and the existing literature on factored MDPs. It would also be beneficial to clarify the definitions and implications of the assumptions made, particularly regarding feedback order and the impact of delays on regret. Finally, addressing the missing steps in the proof of Proposition 5.1 and correcting any identified typos will enhance the paper's clarity and rigor.
