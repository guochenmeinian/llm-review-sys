Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a causal framework for healthcare programs where individuals cannot be compelled to take treatment, focusing on providing beneficial recommendations. The authors propose a method for treatment recommendations that accounts for the autonomy of individuals and fairness in treatment adoption. The contributions include theoretical results and empirical demonstrations of the proposed approach, which adapts classic cost-sensitive learning techniques while introducing new considerations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an important problem, bridging the gap between treatment recommendations and individual autonomy.
- It is well-written, with a clear outline of the approach and relevant background.
- The mix of theoretical and experimental results is commendable, and the assumptions made are generally reasonable.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental results lack baseline comparisons, which would clarify the benefits of considering agent autonomy.
- There is insufficient discussion on the computational complexity of the proposed methods, particularly regarding running time and the cost of achieving best responses.
- The paper lacks structure and clarity in several sections, including the introduction of notation and concepts, and does not adequately explain the assumptions made.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and structure of the paper by:
1. Adding a background section to better contextualize the introduced methods.
2. Clearly defining notation and concepts, such as the cost function and assumptions, with appropriate references.
3. Including a discussion or limitations section to summarize contributions and address potential shortcomings.
4. Providing baseline comparisons in the experimental results to demonstrate the impact of accounting for autonomy.
5. Clarifying the computational complexity and runtime implications of the proposed methods, particularly in relation to existing techniques.
