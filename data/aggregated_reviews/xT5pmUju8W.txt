Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a benchmark for evaluating mutual information (MI) estimators on unstructured data, moving beyond traditional Gaussian benchmarks. The authors construct artificial datasets with controlled ground-truth MI values, allowing for a thorough evaluation of existing estimators under various parameters. The work aims to provide insights into the performance of MI estimators in realistic scenarios, contributing valuable tools for the research community.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work opens avenues for testing MI estimators in more realistic benchmarks, beneficial for the community.
- The dataset construction method allows fine control over MI, applicable to various datasets.
- The writing effectively motivates the problem and explains the methodology, despite some areas needing improvement.
- Empirical results yield interesting and relevant insights.

Weaknesses:
- Figures and tables are too small, hindering readability.
- Some explanations lack clarity, particularly regarding the use of Resnet in section 5.7 and the MI estimators in lines 78 and 79.
- The claim in line 91 about contradicting results from other work requires validation through their approximated metrics.
- The discussion in section 5.5 is flawed; increasing dimensionality does not necessarily lead to increased sparsity.
- Conclusions in section 5.2 may be overstated; the authors should emphasize training issues or ensure models are properly optimized.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the explanations regarding the non-invertible network in section 5.7. In section 5.6, clarify the criteria for labeling nuisances as "severe," as none affect the MI. Additionally, restate how dimensionality is increased in section 5.5 and ensure proper citations (e.g., `\citet`) are used throughout the text. The notation in equation 1 should be clarified, particularly regarding the entropy of a fixed variable $\beta$. Lastly, consider reducing the number of plots in the main body to enhance clarity and move supplementary results to an appendix.
