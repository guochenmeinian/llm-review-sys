Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the list-decodable mixture learning problem, extending the list-decodable mean estimation problem. The authors propose a meta-algorithm that utilizes existing algorithms for robust mean estimation and list-decodable mean estimation to compute a compact list of means from a mixture of inlier distributions and an adversarial outlier distribution. The algorithm operates in two stages: the outer stage separates inlier clusters and outliers, while the inner stage refines mean estimates using the cor-kLD algorithm. The paper provides theoretical lower bounds for error and demonstrates that the proposed algorithm achieves matching performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study is innovative, addressing mixture learning challenges where outliers dominate small inlier groups.
- The problem setting is practical, relying only on the lower bound of inlier group fractions.
- The theoretical contributions are robust, with the proposed meta-algorithm achieving significant error guarantees.

Weaknesses:
- The two-stage meta-algorithm may be time-consuming.
- The paper lacks a presentation of time complexity and experimental results related to computational efficiency.
- It does not include real-world datasets for validation or comparisons with other robust learning methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation of time complexity and include experimental results to enhance understanding of computational efficiency. Additionally, validating the algorithm on real-world datasets would demonstrate its practical utility and robustness. Clarifying the impact of assumptions and providing a detailed analysis of the algorithm's performance in non-separated mixture scenarios would strengthen the paper. Finally, addressing the contextualization with respect to prior work on finite covariance mixtures and providing a clearer comparison with existing robust learning methods would be beneficial.
