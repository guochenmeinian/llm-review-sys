Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Neuronal Competition Group (NCG) architecture, which utilizes a two-compartment threshold mechanism to enhance Winner-Takes-All (WTA) competition in spiking neural networks (SNNs) through supervised Spike Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP). The authors demonstrate that this approach improves classification capabilities and accuracy on datasets such as CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 by promoting balanced intra-class competition.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The focus on local learning and time-to-first-spike coding enhances energy efficiency, which is crucial for neuromorphic hardware applications.
2. The extensive experiments validate the proposed framework's effectiveness, showing better performance compared to other local learning rules.
3. The paper is well-written, with a solid foundation in neuroscience concepts, and includes compelling ablation studies supporting design choices.

Weaknesses:
1. The proposed method's accuracy lags behind global learning methods, such as surrogate gradient techniques, raising concerns about its attractiveness.
2. The scalability of the NCG architecture to larger and more complex datasets beyond CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 is not thoroughly explored.
3. The method's reliance on previously explored ideas limits its contributions to merely combining existing concepts.
4. The experiments focus solely on static image classification tasks, which may not be the most suitable for SNNs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the quantitative comparison between global learning methods and their proposed approach across various aspects, such as energy efficiency and hardware implementability. Additionally, the authors should explore the scalability of the NCG architecture to larger datasets and provide analyses on the trade-offs between performance and computational cost. Clarifying the rationale for using STDP in the classification layer and discussing its advantages over simpler methods, such as the delta rule, would enhance the paper's depth. Finally, including more detailed analyses of the method's properties and extending experiments to sequential tasks could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach.
