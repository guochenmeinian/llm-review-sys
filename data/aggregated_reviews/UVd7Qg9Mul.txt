### Key Points
This paper presents a scalable web crawling framework that optimizes freshness while utilizing noisy Change-Indicating Signals (CIS). The authors propose Greedy-NCIS, a policy that adjusts crawling decisions based on signal quality, balancing freshness and resource efficiency. They validate their approach through experiments with semi-synthetic datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms baseline methods in managing noisy signals. The work emphasizes the integration of signal reliability into crawling policies and offers solutions for large-scale web systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively addresses the challenge of balancing cached page freshness with bandwidth limitations, which is crucial for search engine performance.
- It provides a solid theoretical foundation for incorporating noisy CIS into crawling policies, deriving optimal strategies for both continuous and discrete settings.
- The proposed discrete crawling algorithm is highly scalable and suitable for decentralized implementation, essential for managing vast numbers of web pages.
- Extensive experiments validate the algorithmâ€™s performance under various conditions, showcasing its robustness.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on semi-synthetic data raises concerns about the generalizability of findings to real-world scenarios, as there is a lack of validation in live web crawling environments.
- The computational demands of the algorithm for large-scale implementations are not fully addressed, particularly regarding the complexity of processing noisy CIS.
- Ethical considerations, such as respecting website owners' preferences and managing server load impacts, are not explicitly discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- We recommend that the authors improve the paper's structure for clarity, particularly in the discussion of previous methods and the scalability claims in Section 5.
- We suggest adding a dedicated section on ethical implications, including privacy concerns and resource allocation fairness among web pages.
- We encourage the authors to provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of their algorithm, especially for large-scale applications, and propose strategies to mitigate overhead.
- We recommend using visual aids, such as diagrams or flowcharts, to clarify complex algorithmic details and enhance readability.
