### Key Points
This paper presents a quantum algorithm for market equilibrium computation, specifically through the introduction of faulty proportional response (FPR) dynamics. The authors claim that FPR achieves a quadratic speed-up compared to classical proportional response (PR) algorithms, focusing on computing the allocation of a specified good to a specified buyer. The theoretical framework indicates that FPR has a square-root speed-up over classical methods, and experimental results suggest it outperforms classical algorithms, albeit with quantum steps simulated by classical methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper effectively combines quantum computing techniques with market equilibrium computation, demonstrating significant theoretical and empirical advancements.  
- The clarity of presentation and the detailed discussion section enhance the paper's accessibility and depth.  
- The algorithm's ability to achieve quadratic speed-up and reduced memory usage using quantum random access memory (QRAM) is noteworthy.

Weaknesses:  
- The focus on computing the allocation of a single good to a single buyer is seen as limited compared to classical algorithms that address all goods and buyers.  
- The reliance on QRAM, which is not yet widely available, raises concerns about the algorithm's practical applicability.  
- The experimental results are based on specific conditions, and the implications of noise and error rates in quantum hardware are not sufficiently addressed.  
- The paper lacks clarity regarding the primary goal of FPR, leading to confusion about its intended application in market equilibrium computation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the primary goal of FPR in the introduction, explicitly stating whether it aims to compute the "equilibrium allocation profile," "part of" the equilibrium, or provide query access to the allocation. Additionally, we suggest that the authors address the practical limitations posed by current quantum hardware, particularly regarding QRAM, and discuss how their algorithm could be adapted for more complex, real-world scenarios. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide a more detailed explanation of the data preparation process for quantum query access, as this could impact overall efficiency.
