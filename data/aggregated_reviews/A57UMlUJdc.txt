Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a reinforcement learning framework called MEX, which integrates exploration and exploitation through an unconstrained optimization objective. The authors establish regret upper bounds under low generalized eluder coefficient assumptions and provide both model-based and model-free algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in sparse reward environments, showing promise in continuous control tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-crafted, theoretically sound, and empirically impactful, providing a clear and accessible presentation despite its dense nature.  
- The proposed framework is original and offers a novel approach to designing RL algorithms, with practical implementations based on existing deep RL baselines.  
- The thorough review of prior work enhances the paper's clarity and context.

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty of maximizing to explore is questionable, as previous works have not been adequately cited, and the theoretical contributions may not be sufficiently distinct.  
- The optimization objective's complexity, particularly in the model-free setting, raises concerns about its practical implementation.  
- The paper lacks a detailed discussion of limitations, particularly regarding the assumptions made and their applicability in practice.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of prior work to accurately position MEX within the existing literature, acknowledging its roots and contributions. Additionally, clarifying the practical implications of the low generalized eluder coefficient assumption and addressing potential optimization challenges would strengthen the paper. We also suggest revising the title to reflect a more precise representation of the framework's contributions and ensuring that the limitations of the proposed methods are explicitly discussed in the main text.
