Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a value-based intervention assistance method for shared autonomy, where a copilot intervenes only when its actions are deemed more valuable than those of the human pilot. The method involves training an expert policy using privileged goal information, which is then used to train a diffusion copilot without this information. A copilot advantage score is proposed to determine when the copilot's actions should be preferred over the pilot's. The efficacy of this approach is validated through experiments with both simulated and real human pilots.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is novel, introducing a value-based intervention system that is well-cited and compared against relevant baselines.
- The experimental setup adheres to established standards in deep reinforcement learning for shared autonomy, incorporating both simulated and human experiments.
- The submission is generally well-written and clear.

Weaknesses:
- Section 2 lacks a broader overview of shared autonomy literature, which could enhance context.
- The practical implementation of the method is challenging due to the need for prior expert policy training and full goal space knowledge for advantage computation.
- Marginalizing all goals at each timestep for advantage computation is computationally expensive, particularly in higher-dimensional spaces.
- Figure 3c would benefit from additional quantitative evaluations to strengthen its findings.
- The small sample size of five participants in user studies limits the generalizability of results; expanding this and reporting significance metrics is recommended.
- Minor comment: renaming $Q^{\pi_e}$ to $\mathbf{I}$ seems unnecessary.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve Section 2 by providing a more general overview of shared autonomy literature, including foundational works. Additionally, addressing the practical challenges of implementing the proposed method, particularly regarding expert policy training and goal space knowledge, is crucial. We suggest that the authors conduct further quantitative evaluations for Figure 3c and consider expanding the user study sample size while reporting significance metrics. Clarifying the meaning of "exploring starts" for training the SAC expert and investigating how variations in goal space size affect usability would also enhance the paper. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore evaluations of the intervention selection mechanism with other architectures beyond the diffusion-based policy.
