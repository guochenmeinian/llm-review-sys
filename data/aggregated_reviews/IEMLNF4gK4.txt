Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a unified approximation technique for Shapley interaction indices, specifically through the novel method SHAPley Interaction Quantification (SHAP-IQ). The authors reformulate various Shapley interaction methods to enable efficient Monte Carlo integration, providing theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and efficiency. They also introduce a new representation for the Shapley value, demonstrating SHAP-IQ's effectiveness across multiple machine learning models and datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The unified formulation of several interaction attribution methods as Cardinal Interaction Index (CII) is a novel contribution to the X-AI literature.
- Clear writing and well-structured presentation make the paper accessible.
- Theoretical foundations for SHAP-IQ are rigorous, including proofs of unbiasedness and consistency.
- Empirical results show SHAP-IQ outperforms existing methods in approximation quality and computational efficiency.

Weaknesses:
- Some aspects of the Faith-Shap method are not fully addressed, which may limit the applicability of the proposed method.
- The reproducibility of experiments may be hindered by high computational resource requirements.
- The contributions, while solid, may not be particularly surprising, and the theoretical analysis could benefit from deeper insights into key quantities affecting performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of specific notations, such as defining \(\mathcal{G}_D\) and ensuring proper definitions for symbols like \(k_0\). Additionally, we suggest providing a measure to select specific feature subsets to enhance interpretability, especially given the exponential growth of feature combinations. Lastly, we encourage the authors to expand their theoretical analysis beyond classical results and clarify the full computational complexity of SHAP-IQ in comparison to existing methods.
