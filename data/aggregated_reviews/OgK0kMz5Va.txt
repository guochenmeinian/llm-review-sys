### Key Points
This paper presents a method to convert scientific names into universal names during model inference, enhancing the accuracy of zero-shot species recognition using Vision Transformer (ViT) models by 2-5 times. The authors propose translating Latin names in fine-grained datasets to common language, which aids Vision Language Models (VLMs) in better accommodating zero-shot learning (ZSL) tasks. The method is validated on four benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming baselines and achieving retrieval results that exceed state-of-the-art performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is simple yet effective, demonstrating significant improvements over existing techniques.
- The idea of using VLMs for fine-grained datasets is innovative and opens new research avenues.
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with sufficient support for its claims.

Weaknesses:
- The approach is relatively simplistic and lacks innovative techniques or algorithms.
- There is no horizontal comparison of prompt templates, which could provide insights into the model's efficacy.
- The method's generalizability in real-world scenarios with numerous species lacking common names is questionable.
- The authors do not adequately address the implications of ambiguities between scientific and common names.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the depth of their analysis regarding the implications of their results, particularly concerning the ambiguities in common names. Additionally, the authors should conduct a horizontal comparison of prompt templates to enhance the understanding of their method's efficacy. It would also be beneficial to test their method against traditional ZSL methods to provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Finally, including additional results in the final version would strengthen the paper.
