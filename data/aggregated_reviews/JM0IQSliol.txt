Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) method for time series data (TS-LDDMM), which represents time series as deformations of a reference series. The TS-LDDMM can manage irregularly sampled multivariate time series of varying lengths, providing shape-based representations of temporal data. The authors demonstrate the model's advantages through simulations and real-world biomedical applications, highlighting its robustness to missing samples and classification performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method effectively handles irregularly sampled multivariate time series with variable sizes.
- The adaptation of LDDMM to time series may benefit applications of other time series methods.
- The paper is well-written and presents an interesting idea of deforming time and space together within the LDDMM framework.
- The method is evaluated on diverse datasets, showcasing its interpretability and usefulness in clinical settings.

Weaknesses:
- Comparisons primarily focus on robustness to missing data and classification, lacking an analysis of the "shape" detected by different methods to illustrate the interpretability advantage of TS-LDDMM.
- The method's complexity may hinder its practical application, as it relies heavily on mathematical concepts that could be challenging for medical professionals.
- The paper contains numerous typos and grammatical errors, which detract from clarity and comprehension.
- The novelty of the proposed framework appears limited, primarily altering the existing LDDMM framework for time series analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by addressing the numerous typos and grammatical errors throughout the paper. Additionally, we suggest that the authors justify the choice of their model more thoroughly, particularly regarding the dependence of the learned diffeomorphism on model parametrization. It would also be beneficial to include a comparison of the shapes detected by different methods to better illustrate the interpretability of TS-LDDMM. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to simplify the technical content to enhance accessibility for medical professionals and to provide insights into the computational demands of the model, including training time on specified hardware.
