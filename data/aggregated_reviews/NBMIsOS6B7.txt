### Key Points
This paper presents a model of online linear optimization (OLO) motivated by alternating gameplay in two-player games, where the learner suffers loss defined by $(c^t + c^{t-1})x^t$. The authors demonstrate that the classical lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ regret does not hold, achieving $O(T^{1/3})$ regret for the $n$-dimensional simplex and $O(\log T)$ regret for a radius-$\rho$ ball. The results indicate that the alternating OLO model allows for improved regret bounds compared to standard OLO.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed alternating OLO model is intriguing and relevant for two-player games.  
- The results extend beyond previous works by achieving $o(\sqrt{T})$ regret in more general settings, with non-trivial proofs.  
- The paper is well-organized and generally easy to follow, providing helpful intuition and high-level ideas.

Weaknesses:  
- The results are limited to the simplex and ball constraints, lacking generalization to other convex sets.  
- The analysis is confined to linear losses, with no exploration of general convex losses or lower bounds.  
- The connection between the alternating loss structure and gameplay is not sufficiently motivated, and the paper lacks discussion on broader implications in game theory.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for the alternating loss structure by discussing its relevance in the context of well-studied game theory models, such as extensive-form games or Stackelberg games. Clarifying the intuition behind the differing results for the simplex and ball constraints would enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest providing a discussion on potential generalizations of the algorithm to broader convex domains and addressing the lack of lower bound results. Finally, a thorough proofreading pass is necessary to correct typos and improve overall clarity.
