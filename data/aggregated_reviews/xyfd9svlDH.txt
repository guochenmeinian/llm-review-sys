### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of the impact of data biases on machine learning models for drug synergy, constructing 145 classification models with 4,577 unique drugs and 75,276 pairwise combinations. The authors identify variability in model performance due to distributional biases in training-validation-test sets, highlighting factors such as synergy spread, class separation, and combinatorial label entropy that significantly affect outcomes. They emphasize the importance of inspecting data-specific artifacts and biases in the drug synergy modeling community and advocate for clear reporting of statistical biases to enhance model reliability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- Comprehensive analysis with a large dataset, providing valuable insights into the effects of data biases on model performance.  
- Identification of key factors influencing outcomes, which is crucial for understanding model variability.  
- Timely relevance given the rise of deep models in synergy prediction, addressing a significant gap in interpretability and comparability.

Weaknesses:  
- Lack of clear delineation between intertwined dataset attributes and insufficient actionable guidelines for addressing biases.  
- Formatting issues in Figures 1 and 2, including width and caption clarity, detract from presentation quality.  
- The flow of certain sentences, particularly regarding heterogeneous effects of drugs, is unclear and could benefit from rewording or examples.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of delineations between intertwined dataset attributes and provide more actionable guidelines for mitigating observed biases. Additionally, addressing the formatting issues in Figures 1 and 2, including fixing captions and ensuring appropriate widths, would enhance the paper's presentation. We suggest rewording the sentence about heterogeneous drug effects for better flow and clarity. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to propose improvements to datasets for evaluating models and consider the implications of initial dataset attributes on performance benchmarking. Exploring the potential of a "balanced" benchmark and the use of deep baselines like DeepSynergy could also enrich future work.
