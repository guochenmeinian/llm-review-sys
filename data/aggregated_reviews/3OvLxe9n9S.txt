### Key Points
This paper presents a multi-task learning approach for backchannel prediction in dialogues, enhancing textual representations and utilizing self-supervised pre-training for audio encoders. The authors propose a multi-task loss to jointly model dialogue act classification and backchannel prediction, achieving a 3% improvement in WF1 over previous models. The study demonstrates that dialogue actions are relevant to backchannel prediction and includes extensive experiments and ablation studies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed approach creatively challenges traditional views on audio encoding superiority for backchannel prediction.
- The paper includes thorough experimental results, demonstrating competitive performance and clear methodology.

Weaknesses:
- Innovations appear limited, relying heavily on existing work, with improvements from multi-task learning being marginal (0.6% accuracy increase).
- Lack of in-depth analysis, particularly regarding model complexity and significance testing for performance improvements.
- The focus on a single corpus (Switchboard) may narrow the applicability of findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of model complexity to clarify the computational burden introduced by multi-task learning. Additionally, conducting significance tests, such as a single-tail t-test, is essential to validate the reliability of the reported performance improvements. The authors should also provide a detailed distribution of the 42 dialogue act classifications and compare their approach with traditional methods to strengthen their claims. Lastly, focusing on original contributions rather than established techniques will enhance the manuscript's impact.
