Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Target Charging Technique (TCT), a privacy analysis framework inspired by the Sparse Vector Technique (SVT). TCT focuses on privacy loss through queries targeting specific sets, introducing the concept of q-targets to model the distribution of privacy mechanism outputs. The authors demonstrate TCT's applicability in various scenarios, including one-shot k-top selection and conditional releases, and theoretically show that TCT's parameter degradation surpasses existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The problem addressed is significant, and the proposed algorithm is natural and flexible, accommodating applications like one-shot k-top selection and conditional releases.
2. The framework offers a tighter privacy-utility trade-off by considering amortized overheads, improving classical differential privacy algorithms.
3. The technical aspects of the paper are solid, with clear motivation and methodology.

Weaknesses:
1. The absence of numerical experiments is a major limitation, hindering the demonstration of TCT's practical benefits.
2. The assumption in the q-target definition appears stringent, raising questions about the feasibility of satisfying such conditions in randomized algorithms.
3. The related work section is lacking, and the effectiveness of the proposed approach remains unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including numerical experiments to showcase the practical advantages of TCT. Additionally, clarifying the assumptions in the q-target definition and providing illustrative examples would enhance understanding. We also suggest expanding the related work section to better contextualize TCT's contributions and explicitly detailing the improvements over prior methods.
