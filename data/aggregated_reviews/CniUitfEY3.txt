Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Reusable Slotwise Mechanism (RSM) for modeling temporal dynamics of objects using a slot representation. The core idea is to extract Central Contextual Information (CCI) from past frames to stochastically select mechanisms for updating slots at each time-step. RSM is evaluated against strong baselines across various tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in dynamics modeling, question answering, and task planning, while maintaining a comparable parameter count and computational cost.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem of modeling temporal dynamics from raw video is significant, with ample room for advancement.
- The concept of RSM is straightforward and well-justified.
- RSM achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks, marking a crucial step towards unsupervised learning of dynamics models from video.
- The paper is well-presented, providing all necessary information for experiment replication.

Weaknesses:
- The ablation studies in section 4.5 lack quantitative results in the main paper, which are relegated to the appendix.
- The inference-time ablations may misrepresent the model's learning capabilities, as they indicate that the model has not learned to disregard CCI and mechanisms during inference.
- The differences between RSM and baseline methods are not sufficiently clarified.
- The citations in the introduction appear biased, favoring certain works while neglecting other influential research.
- Section 2.2 is somewhat repetitive, reiterating similar concepts regarding RSM's components.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation of RSM by including training-time ablations for RSM!2 and RSM!3, as these would provide critical insights into the role of CCI. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the differences between RSM and baseline methods more explicitly. The authors should also consider expanding their citation range to include other relevant works in the field. Furthermore, we advise revising section 2.2 to reduce redundancy and enhance clarity. Lastly, addressing the scalability of RSM in more complex, realistic environments would strengthen the paper's contributions.
