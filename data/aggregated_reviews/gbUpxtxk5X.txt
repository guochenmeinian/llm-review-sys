### Key Points
This paper investigates the price of anarchy (PoA) in generalized second-price (GSP) auctions where bidders act as value maximizers (autobidders). The authors establish that the PoA can be as low as 0 in worst-case scenarios, contrasting with the 1/2 PoA of the VCG mechanism in autobidding contexts. The analysis emphasizes the relationship between discount factors and auction efficiency, providing both tight and slightly looser bounds on PoA.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Original Contribution: The paper characterizes the PoA of GSP auctions for value maximizers, contributing to a growing area of research.
2. Fine-Grained Analysis: The detailed examination of PoA concerning discount factors enhances understanding of GSP auction efficiency.
3. Tight Bounds: The establishment of tight PoA bounds offers a nuanced perspective on GSP auction performance.

Weaknesses:
1. Complexity: The complexity of the bounds may limit accessibility for readers unfamiliar with the subject. Simplifying the presentation or adding explanations could enhance clarity.
2. Practical Relevance: While the paper discusses the worst-case PoA of 0, it lacks elaboration on the practical implications of these findings in real-world auctions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by simplifying complex analyses and providing additional explanations. Furthermore, elaborating on the practical relevance of the findings and discussing potential real-world applications would strengthen the paper. Additionally, we suggest providing a more intuitive interpretation of the assumption regarding deterministic bidding in Section 3 and addressing the likelihood of such scenarios in realistic auction settings.
