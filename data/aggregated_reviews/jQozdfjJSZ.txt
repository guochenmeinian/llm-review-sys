### Key Points
This paper presents MingOfficial, a multi-modal dataset focused on officials from China's Ming Dynasty, which includes structured career records and unstructured text for representation learning. The authors propose a GNN-based method to analyze social structures and identify nuanced identities. Experiments validate that the learned representations exhibit historical significance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a significant topic in Chinese studies, appealing to historians and linguists.  
- The MingOfficial dataset is a valuable resource for future research, providing guidelines for annotation and analysis.  
- The authors conducted extensive experiments to evaluate their GNN-based framework, demonstrating its capabilities.  

Weaknesses:  
- The reliance on a single dataset limits the generalizability of the proposed method.  
- The method appears to lack sufficient innovation, primarily building on existing research.  
- There are several issues, including missing figures, incomplete limitations discussion, and various spelling errors.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the manuscript by addressing the following points:  
- Expand the limitations section to provide a more comprehensive discussion.  
- Clarify the motivation for stage 1 training and the choice of using only P-O relations.  
- Conduct an ablation study to explore the impact of military power as a learning attribute and consider incorporating additional attributes.  
- Address the identified typos and ensure all figures referenced are correctly labeled.  
- Consider framing the paper primarily as a dataset contribution to mitigate critiques regarding the novelty of the method.
