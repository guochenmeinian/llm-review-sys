Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a reconstruction-based method for multivariate time series anomaly detection using a memory-guided Transformer that incorporates a gated memory module. The authors propose a two-phase training paradigm to address training instability caused by random initialization of memory items. Anomaly scores are computed based on both input and latent spaces, achieving state-of-the-art results on five benchmark datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The exploration of leveraging a memory module for multivariate time series anomaly detection is commendable, providing effective solutions for the task.
2. The paper includes sufficient experimental results and ablation studies across five datasets to substantiate its claims.
3. The methodology is well presented, and the manuscript is generally well-written.

Weaknesses:
1. The writing quality requires improvement, with grammatical errors and typos present. For instance, "there exist video representation learning" should be "there exists video representation learning," and a typo appears on line 234 as "32.56p%." Citations in the related work could be enhanced by including authors' names with 'et al.' instead of just numbers.
2. The font size in figures is notably small, affecting readability.
3. The authors should clarify whether other methods compared in the experiments share the same data split (ratio and files) and how many times experiments were repeated, especially given discrepancies in reproduced results for Anomaly Transformer.
4. The literature review lacks coverage of graph-based anomaly detection techniques, such as those by Deng et al. (2021).
5. An ablation study demonstrating the significance of the memory gate and K-means clustering should be included in the main paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the writing quality by addressing grammatical errors and typos, and consider enhancing the citation format in the related work section. Additionally, increasing the font size in figures would enhance readability. It is crucial to clarify the data split methodology used for comparisons and ensure consistency across experiments. We also suggest including a discussion on the relevance of K-means clustering for initializing memory items and its computational efficiency. Finally, an ablation study should be incorporated to illustrate the contributions of the memory gate and K-means clustering to the overall performance.
