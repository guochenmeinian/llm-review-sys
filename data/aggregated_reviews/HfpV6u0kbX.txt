Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents LoRA-Inlaid, an innovative system for quantizing and serving large language models (LLMs) in multi-task environments. The authors propose the Multi-LoRA GPTQ (MLGPTQ) algorithm, which enables sharing a unified quantized model across various LoRA adapters, thereby significantly reducing memory usage for model deployment. Additionally, the system features a dynamic task addition mechanism and a novel multi-task scheduling approach based on predicted output lengths and task grouping, enhancing stability and efficiency. Experimental results indicate that LoRA-Inlaid outperforms current state-of-the-art LLM serving systems in throughput, average request latency, job completion times, and service level objectives while maintaining model quality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel approach to multi-task fine-tuning and deployment of LLMs, addressing a critical gap in the field.
- The innovative MLGPTQ algorithm allows joint quantization across multiple tasks and supports incremental quantization for new tasks.
- Comprehensive experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing systems, including higher throughput and lower latency.
- The paper is well-structured and clearly presents methodologies and results, enhancing clarity and accessibility.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks an analysis of the computational overhead introduced by multi-task quantization and scheduling techniques.
- There is no absolute accuracy comparison with the unquantized model, limiting the evaluation of performance.
- Some content is relegated to appendices, affecting the clarity of key methods and formulas.
- The paper acknowledges the need for improved detection of malicious tasks and fairness considerations but does not provide detailed strategies to address these issues.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the computational overhead associated with the introduced techniques. Additionally, the authors should include absolute accuracy comparison experiments with the unquantized model to provide a clearer evaluation of performance. It would be beneficial to formalize descriptions of dynamic task addition and multi-task scheduling in the main text, along with a brief outline of specific methods. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors elaborate on strategies for detecting malicious tasks and ensuring fairness among tasks, possibly through dynamic scheduling algorithms. Finally, including more comparative experiments on the multi-task scheduling strategy would strengthen the paper's claims of innovation.
