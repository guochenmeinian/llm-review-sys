### Key Points
This paper presents a study on distributed data placement and content delivery in peer-to-peer networks, specifically addressing the non-metric data placement problem. The authors propose a novel game-theoretic decomposition that aligns global objectives with agents' selfish behavior, proving the NP-hardness of approximating the problem within a logarithmic factor. The work includes theoretical contributions such as bounds on the objective value of pure Nash equilibria and trade-offs between computational cost and solution optimality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is easy to follow and presents a reasonable core idea of non-metric data placement.
2. The game-theoretic decomposition is a novel approach that contributes to the understanding of the problem.
3. The work provides the first distributed algorithm for the non-metric version of the data placement problem.

Weaknesses:
1. The draft lacks impressive empirical results and strong baselines, with some state-of-the-art methods not tested.
2. The practical usefulness of the proposed method remains unclear, and the technical novelty is not well established in the context of related work.
3. The presentation is heavy on notation and lacks intuitive explanations, making it difficult to grasp the concepts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical validation by incorporating real-world data sources and comparing their approach with state-of-the-art methods such as "Distributed Clustering of Linear Bandits in Peer to Peer Networks" and "Fast Distributed Bandits for Online Recommendation Systems." Additionally, we suggest introducing motivating examples, tables of frequently used notations, figurative illustrations, and informal descriptions to enhance clarity. It may also be beneficial to move theoretical proofs to the appendix to allocate space for these improvements. Finally, providing bounds on the suboptimal solutions and clarifying the computational complexity of the proposed algorithms would strengthen the paper.
