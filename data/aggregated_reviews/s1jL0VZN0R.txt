### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into click-through rate (CTR) prediction, highlighting a strong positive correlation between feature frequencies and the largest Hessian eigenvalues associated with these features. The authors propose a novel optimizer, Helen, which aims to regularize these eigenvalues based on feature frequencies to mitigate the convergence towards sharp local minima. The paper includes experiments across various CTR benchmarks to validate the effectiveness of Helen compared to existing optimizers like SGD and ADAM.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The discovery of the correlation between feature frequencies and Hessian eigenvalues is insightful and relevant to CTR prediction.
2. The paper is well-written, maintaining clarity and logical flow throughout.

Weaknesses:
1. The experimental results show only minor improvements, raising questions about the significance of the findings.
2. Key descriptions, particularly regarding Equation (7), are unclear, hindering comprehension of the methodology.
3. The paper lacks sufficient baseline comparisons, notably omitting Cowclip, which also addresses skewed feature distributions.
4. The hyperparameter tuning appears limited, potentially affecting the conclusions drawn.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Equation (7) to better align with its intended purpose in the context of frequency-based regularization. Additionally, it is crucial to include comparisons with Cowclip and the latest WSAM method to strengthen the baseline analysis. We suggest conducting significance tests for performance differences among optimizers across various datasets to validate the findings. Furthermore, exploring the impact of feature frequency on performance and providing a detailed analysis of the training costs associated with Helen compared to other methods would enhance the paper's contributions. Lastly, we advise repositioning Table 5 in the appendix for better accessibility and clarity regarding the bolded terms in the tables.
