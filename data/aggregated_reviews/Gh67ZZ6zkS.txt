Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents PreDiff, a latent diffusion model for precipitation nowcasting that incorporates a knowledge control mechanism to enforce physical constraints during the generation process. The authors demonstrate the model's effectiveness through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, achieving promising results compared to existing deep learning models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a practical method for precipitation nowcasting, leveraging diffusion models to enhance prediction skill.
- The knowledge control mechanism is well-designed and effectively integrates auxiliary prior knowledge.
- The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it accessible to readers.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the approach is questionable, as it primarily applies established diffusion model techniques to precipitation nowcasting without sufficient differentiation from existing methods.
- The experiments lack comprehensive ablation studies and comparisons with recent state-of-the-art models, such as MetNet2 and DGMR, which are crucial for validating the proposed method's effectiveness.
- Insufficient model efficiency comparisons, including GPU memory usage and running time, are provided.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty aspect by clearly articulating how PreDiff differs from existing methods and addressing the limitations of the knowledge control mechanism, particularly its reliance on manually designed parameters. Additionally, we suggest including more comparative baselines, particularly advanced deep models, and conducting thorough efficiency comparisons. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide detailed metrics, such as CSI at various thresholds, to substantiate the claims of superior performance.
