### Key Points
This paper presents a comparison of the performance of two unsupervised sub-segmenters, Morfessor and StateMorph, against BPE in training language models and downstream tasks, specifically focusing on Finnish and Russian. The authors demonstrate that Morfessor and StateMorph are more effective than BPE for smaller model sizes, which is beneficial for practical applications. The study includes extensive experiments and clearly defined research questions, contributing to the understanding of sub-word segmentation algorithms in language modeling.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper provides a thorough experimental analysis of sub-word segmentation algorithms.  
- It sets clear research questions and includes detailed performance comparisons with dedicated systems.  
- The linguistic quality and exposition are commendable, and the system parameters are provided for reproducibility.  
- The findings indicate that smaller models with morphological segmenters can perform comparably to larger models with BPE.

Weaknesses:  
- The study is limited to only two morphologically rich languages, raising questions about the applicability of results to other languages.  
- Some experimental details, such as the specific version of Morfessor used and the rationale behind the instance size, require clarification.  
- The paper lacks discussion on the statistical significance of performance differences and does not reference the widely used Sentencepiece algorithm.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by including additional languages and segmentation algorithms in their study. Clarifying the specific version of Morfessor used and elaborating on the choice of instance size would enhance the paper's rigor. Additionally, we suggest discussing the statistical significance of performance differences observed and considering the inclusion of Sentencepiece in their comparisons. Finally, addressing minor editorial issues, such as punctuation and verb agreement, would improve the overall presentation.
