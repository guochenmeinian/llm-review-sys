### Key Points
This paper evaluates defenses against canvas fingerprinting, a prevalent online tracking method, and introduces attacks targeting randomization-based mechanisms in browser extensions. The authors analyze 18 browser extensions and built-in protections from five major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Tor, and Safari), revealing vulnerabilities in current defenses and providing recommendations to enhance privacy protections. The study highlights that randomization techniques are the most widely adopted defense mechanism but are susceptible to attacks such as Pixel-Recovery and Statistical Attacks. Additionally, the paper investigates the effectiveness of various defense mechanisms, including randomized output, fixed output, API blocking, and filter lists, while proposing two novel attack vectors that exploit significant gaps in the robustness of popular randomization-based defenses.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Comprehensive analysis of defenses across multiple browser extensions and major browsers, providing a broad view of existing defense technologies.
2. Effective evaluation of the vulnerabilities in randomization-based defenses, including the Brave browser's "Farbling" mechanism, supported by experimental results.
3. The introduction of novel attack vectors that highlight vulnerabilities in existing defenses is a significant contribution.
4. The recommendations for improving defenses are relevant and timely, addressing a significant issue in privacy protection.

Weaknesses:
1. The rationale for including Tor in the analysis of popular browsers is unclear, as its primary focus is anonymity rather than mainstream usage.
2. The paper lacks concrete examples of real-world applications of canvas randomization, leaving practical implications ambiguous.
3. Usability issues caused by canvas randomization are acknowledged but not quantitatively analyzed, making it difficult to assess the practicality of implementing these defenses.
4. The potential of machine learning as a defense mechanism is mentioned but not explored in depth, leaving a gap in the evaluation of adaptive defenses.
5. The broader implications of the proposed attacks on other tracking techniques beyond canvas fingerprinting are not fully addressed.
6. Section 3's background information may confuse readers, as it could be misinterpreted as the authors' proposed design; relocating it to the background section would enhance clarity.
7. The study compares browser extensions without evaluating their performance against the browsers' default protections, limiting the assessment of privacy enhancements.
8. Transitions between sections are unclear, affecting the overall narrative flow and coherence.
9. Figures 2–4 present numerical results of successful attacks without detailed insights into their workings or implications, limiting the findings' practical significance.
10. The reliance on previously documented vulnerabilities results in incremental findings rather than novel approaches, with recommendations that do not significantly advance the field.
11. The broader impact of identified flaws on large-scale tracking ecosystems is not explored, missing an opportunity for deeper insights.
12. The focus on randomization-based techniques excludes alternative methods, and experiments are conducted in controlled environments, limiting generalizability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their rationale for including Tor in the analysis and provide a more systematic approach to evaluating the effectiveness of defense mechanisms. Additionally, the authors should include concrete examples of canvas randomization applications and conduct a quantitative analysis of usability trade-offs associated with enhanced privacy measures, such as strict API blocking or aggressive randomization. Relocating Section 3 to the background section would enhance clarity, and a more explicit articulation of the paper's unique contributions is necessary. Evaluating browser extensions against default protections would provide a clearer picture of their effectiveness. Improving transitions between sections and providing interpretive context for Figures 2–4 would enhance readability. We also suggest exploring broader impacts of identified flaws on tracking ecosystems and considering the feasibility and effectiveness of machine learning in detecting and mitigating advanced canvas fingerprinting techniques. Finally, validating findings in real-world environments and exploring whether the proposed attack methodologies have broader applicability to other fingerprinting techniques would strengthen the paper's applicability and comprehensiveness.
