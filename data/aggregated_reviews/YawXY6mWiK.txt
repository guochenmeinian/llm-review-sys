Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for utilizing language model assistants, enabling real-time interactions in a full-duplex setting. The authors achieved this by training the Llama-3-Instruct model and integrating it with ASR and TTS modules, resulting in a complete pipeline system that outperforms commercial models in voice dialogue. The work also proposes evaluation metrics for assessing real-time dialogue quality, demonstrating advantages over existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper provides technical details for achieving full-duplex interaction with language models, offering unprecedented specifics not available in open-source models like GPT-4o.  
- It introduces a quick response method for handling user queries, showing clear advantages in responsiveness to interruptions.  
- The integration of multiple tasks into a single next token prediction task is an original idea that minimizes training time.

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty of motivation is questionable, as the paper heavily relies on concepts from GPT-4o, which was the first to achieve full-duplex communication.  
- Performance degradation is noted, as indicated in Table 3, where the proposed method reduces inference performance.  
- Code readability is poor, making it difficult to operate; a refactor in the Huggingface format is recommended.  
- The proposed method's reliance on external ASR/TTS systems complicates implementation and may lead to information loss, particularly regarding emotional nuances.  
- Evaluation metrics are limited, focusing primarily on latency and interruption without assessing the relevance or helpfulness of machine responses.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the code readability by refactoring it into a more concise style, such as the Huggingface format provided in the review. Additionally, consider building an end-to-end model that integrates ASR and TTS with the LLM to enhance response times. It would also be beneficial to expand the evaluation metrics to include measures of response relevance and helpfulness, as well as to conduct real-world example testing to assess model capabilities. Finally, addressing the questions raised regarding the timing of the idea's conception and the adequacy of training steps for the Llama-3-Instruct model would strengthen the paper.
