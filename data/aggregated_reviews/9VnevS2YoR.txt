Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel post-hoc optimization strategy for existing Vision Mamba architectures, termed Vision Mamba Mender, aimed at enhancing the performance of Mamba models in visual recognition tasks. The authors propose a state correlation analysis method to identify and rectify flaws in the Mamba modelâ€™s mechanisms, focusing on both external and internal hidden states. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed optimization strategy across several Vision Mamba architectures.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces an intriguing method to enhance state space models from a post-hoc perspective for Mamba, with systematic identification and rectification of flaws.
2. The experiments are well-designed and executed, demonstrating the method's applicability to mainstream Mamba architectures and performance improvements.
3. The writing is clear and well-structured, effectively articulating the background, motivation, and methodology.
4. The paper provides insights into Mamba's mechanisms, potentially inspiring future research.

Weaknesses:
1. The description of "certain modules of Mamba" may confuse readers due to vagueness.
2. The performance improvement range stated lacks precision, as results show a 1% to 5% enhancement, not the claimed 3% to 5%.
3. Claims about crucial states influencing model decisions are not supported by observed variations in the provided figures.
4. The authors should include more visual comparisons of state correlation for better reader intuition.
5. The focus on post-hoc analysis may limit the method's applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of terminology, particularly regarding "certain modules of Mamba," to avoid confusion. Additionally, the authors should ensure precise performance descriptions and provide more visual comparisons of state correlations. Expanding the evaluation to include detection and segmentation benchmarks is crucial to assess the generalizability of the learned features beyond image classification tasks. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the specific algorithms or mathematical formulations used in their methodology to enhance reproducibility.
