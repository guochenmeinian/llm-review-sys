Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CoBEVFlow, a novel system for collaborative 3D perception that effectively addresses temporal asynchrony among multiple agents. The authors propose a robust detection algorithm utilizing a BEV flow map generation algorithm to align perception information from different time frames. They introduce the first asynchronous collaborative perception dataset, IRV2V, and validate their algorithm against this dataset and the DAIR-V2X dataset, demonstrating its superiority in handling asynchronous collaboration messages.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles a significant issue in multi-agent collaborative perception, proposing a concise and effective 3D detection framework that reduces bandwidth consumption.
- CoBEVFlow can manage irregular time stamps without discretization and transports original perceptual features, minimizing noise.
- The creation of the IRV2V dataset provides a valuable resource for future research, and extensive experiments show CoBEVFlow's robust performance in asynchronous settings.

Weaknesses:
- The writing could be improved for clarity, particularly regarding the formulas and methods.
- The evaluation is limited, primarily focusing on the introduced dataset without testing on other datasets like V2XSet.
- The training process is complex and time-consuming, which may hinder practical applications.
- The algorithm's reliance on known communication delays raises questions about its applicability in real-world scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing to enhance readers' understanding of the methodologies. Additionally, including a comparative results table in the main experiments would facilitate easier reference. To strengthen the evaluation, we suggest testing the proposed methods on additional datasets, such as V2XSet. Furthermore, addressing the concerns regarding the algorithm's performance under varying time intervals and high vehicle density scenarios would enhance the robustness of the findings. Lastly, providing a clearer definition of the "feasible angle range" in the ROI matching section would benefit readers.
