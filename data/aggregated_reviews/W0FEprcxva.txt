Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents GeckoNum, a novel benchmark for evaluating the numerical capability of text-to-image (T2I) models, addressing the significant challenge of generating the correct number of objects in images. The benchmark focuses on three aspects of numerical reasoning: exact numbers, linguistic approximate numbers, and conceptual quantitative numbers, utilizing 1386 text prompts. The results indicate that while T2I models demonstrate basic numerical reasoning abilities, they struggle with approximate numbers and conceptual reasoning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The benchmark addresses a critical gap in evaluating numerical reasoning for T2I models, which is often overlooked.
2. The diversity and coverage of prompts in the benchmark are robust, making it difficult for models to overfit.
3. The design of the numerical tasks is intuitive and reflects how children learn numbers, enhancing the benchmark's relevance.

Weaknesses:
1. The evaluation lacks a comprehensive range of T2I models, such as stable diffusion v3 and Meta Chameleon, and does not consider multimodal in-context learning for LLM-based T2I models.
2. The paper does not sufficiently analyze the underlying factors affecting model performance, such as architecture and training methodologies.
3. The writing quality requires improvement, particularly in clearly outlining the numerical evaluation procedure.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including more open-source and closed-source T2I models, such as stable diffusion v3 and Meta Chameleon, and consider multimodal in-context learning as an evaluation pattern. Additionally, we suggest investigating the correlation between numerical reasoning and human preference using model-based metrics like LLMScore or GPT4V-Eval. The authors should also provide a deeper analysis of the factors influencing model performance and consider testing a wider range of models and datasets for a more comprehensive evaluation. Lastly, enhancing the clarity of the writing, particularly in the introduction of the numerical evaluation procedure, would benefit the overall presentation.
