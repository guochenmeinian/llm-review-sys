Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for modeling the full covariance matrix of aleatoric uncertainty in per-pixel image restoration tasks through a low-rank approximation, estimated by a separate end-to-end trained network. The authors propose a novel approach to visualize posterior uncertainty using principal components (PCs) and demonstrate its effectiveness across various applications, including denoising and super-resolution. The method is noted for its speed, producing estimates comparable to diffusion models but significantly faster.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The approach is fast and architecture agnostic, allowing for efficient inference.
2. The visualization of posterior uncertainty using PCs is innovative and addresses a gap in existing literature.
3. The method is widely applicable, leveraging existing conditional-mean estimation networks.
4. Experimental results show competitive performance across multiple tasks, with impressive numerical results.

Weaknesses:
1. The requirement to train a separate model raises concerns about stability and training dynamics.
2. The method's focus on diffusion models overlooks the speed and performance of modern conditional GANs and normalizing flows.
3. The generated images are often blurry, lacking the quality of high-fidelity image recovery methods.
4. Evaluations are limited, with insufficient comparisons to ground truth and other datasets, particularly regarding uncertainty quantification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by comparing the predicted principal components and variances to ground truths for datasets such as MNIST. Additionally, the authors should address the training dynamics of their approach and provide insights into the stability of parallel training compared to sequential methods. Clarifying the implications of location invariance in their results would also enhance the paper. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors elaborate on the necessity of the right biases for the error prediction model and consider a broader range of comparisons with modern conditional GANs and normalizing flows to substantiate their claims of speed and performance advantages.
