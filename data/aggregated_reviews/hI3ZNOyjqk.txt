### Key Points
This paper presents the Effective and Semantic-Aware Negative Sampling (ESANS) method, aimed at enhancing negative sampling in recommendation systems. ESANS integrates two components: the Effective Dense Interpolation Strategy (EDIS) for generating diverse virtual samples and Multimodal Semantic-Aware Clustering (MSAC) to minimize false negatives while maintaining semantic consistency. The authors conduct extensive offline and online experiments, demonstrating that ESANS outperforms traditional sampling methods in recommendation performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The novelty of ESANS lies in its explicit semantic guidance for negative sampling, which enhances sample diversity and allows for adjustable difficulty levels.
- The innovative approach of learning a multimodal space that incorporates images, text, and user behavior is compelling.
- Comprehensive evaluations through both offline and online experiments validate the effectiveness of ESANS.

Weaknesses:
- The baseline model is limited to a classical two-tower architecture; testing on other architectures would strengthen the findings.
- There is no evaluation of computational cost or convergence; the impact of negative sampling on convergence speed remains unaddressed.
- The choice of the #A2 dataset for ablation studies is unclear, and an ablation study excluding one modality at a time would be beneficial.
- The paper lacks additional metrics like NDCG and does not provide code or detailed model structure, impacting reproducibility.
- Readability issues exist in mathematical formulas, and hyperparameter tuning details are insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by testing ESANS on various architectures beyond the two-tower model. Additionally, an analysis of computational costs and convergence speed should be included. Clarifying the rationale for selecting the #A2 dataset for ablation studies and conducting an ablation study that excludes one modality at a time would enhance the paper. We also suggest presenting other metrics, such as NDCG, and providing code and detailed model descriptions to improve reproducibility. Lastly, enhancing the clarity of mathematical formulas and including hyperparameter tuning details would benefit readers.
