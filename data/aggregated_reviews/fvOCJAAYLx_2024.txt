Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Twigs, a score-based diffusion framework designed to enhance conditional generation tasks through a central trunk diffusion process for graph structure and stem processes for graph properties. The authors propose two types of diffusion processes: multiple Stem processes for single property interactions and a Trunk process that combines contributions from the stem processes. The innovative loop guidance strategy facilitates information flow between these processes. Empirical studies demonstrate that Twigs significantly outperforms contemporary baselines, particularly JODO and MOOD, in inverse molecular design, small molecule generation, and property optimization across diverse datasets, including notable improvements in MAE values for single and multiple properties from the QM9 dataset, as well as docking scores and hit ratios on the ZINC250k dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The introduction of a new guidance strategy that explicitly models the coupling effects between condition and data.  
2. Comprehensive experimental results showcasing the method's effectiveness against various baselines, including significant improvements over JODO and MOOD.  
3. Clear presentation of methods and results, making the paper easy to follow.  
4. The hierarchical model enhances the representational power of the neural network, leading to richer conditional representations.  

Weaknesses:  
1. Limited flexibility of the proposed method, as the loop guidance necessitates joint training of \(s_{\theta}\) and \(s_{\phi}\), restricting guidance for unseen conditions.  
2. Insufficient clarity in some experimental settings and evaluation pipelines; details should be specified in the appendix.  
3. Lack of empirical evidence regarding computational costs and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods, including a comparison of training times with JODO and MOOD.  
4. Absence of ablation studies or hyperparameter analysis.  
5. Some terminologies and mathematical symbols are not clearly defined or organized.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental settings by explicitly detailing dataset preprocessing, training/test data splitting, evaluation metrics, and hyperparameter choices. Additionally, we suggest including a comparison of computational costs and training times with both MOOD and JODO, as well as conducting an ablation study to enhance the empirical evidence supporting the proposed method. Furthermore, addressing the flexibility of the loop guidance to accommodate unseen conditions would strengthen the framework's applicability. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the definitions of key terms and symbols used throughout the paper.
