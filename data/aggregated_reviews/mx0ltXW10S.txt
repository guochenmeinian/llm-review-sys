### Key Points
This paper presents an unsupervised Bayesian model for text segmentation and word discovery, specifically tailored for classical Chinese poetry. The authors propose an adaptation of the method by Pan et al. (2022), incorporating the regularity of poetic meter as a Bayesian prior. The method demonstrates effective performance in both segmentation and vocabulary induction tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors provide a detailed empirical evaluation, showing that the proposed method outperforms various existing segmentation tools.
- The paper is well-structured, allowing for replication of the analyses.
- The approach addresses the unique characteristics of classical Chinese poetry, making it valuable for both NLP researchers and digital humanities scholars.

Weaknesses:
- The technical descriptions may be overly complex for younger readers, lacking sufficient intuitive explanations.
- The application scope of the method is somewhat limited, and the added value over existing models is not clearly articulated.
- There is a need for more granular evaluation data to substantiate claims regarding performance on specific lexical items.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the Bayesian formulation to make it more accessible to a broader audience. Additionally, please provide a rationale for the necessity of the segmentation tool and clarify its intended user base. It would be beneficial to distinguish word discovery from text segmentation more explicitly. We suggest including aggregate scores in Figure 3(a) and assessing the statistical significance of performance differences. Furthermore, consider discussing how your method could facilitate new studies of literary allusions, as this could engage readers interested in cultural analytics. Lastly, we recommend splitting Figure 3 into standalone tables for better readability and providing translations of the word clouds to enhance accessibility.
