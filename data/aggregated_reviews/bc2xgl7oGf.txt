### Key Points
This paper presents a position on the significance of human evaluation in Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems, particularly focusing on humor, irony, and sarcasm. The authors conduct a critical survey of recent NLG works, emphasizing the necessity for transparency in reporting evaluator demographics and the overreliance on crowdsourcing for recruitment. They highlight that less than half of the surveyed papers report demographic information, which is crucial for understanding the interpretation of these nuanced forms of language.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper addresses a critical issue regarding the lack of transparency in human evaluation processes, providing valuable insights for the NLP community. It is well-written and informative, raising awareness about the importance of demographic variables in evaluating humor, irony, and sarcasm.

Weaknesses:  
The survey is based on only 15 papers, which may not represent the broader NLP computational humor community. The authors do not provide empirical experiments to validate their claims about the impact of demographics, relying instead on anecdotal examples that may not be convincing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including a list of concrete recommendations for designing future user studies that enhance transparency in reporting assessments. Additionally, we suggest that the authors discuss how their findings could inform the design of user studies in other NLP tasks. To strengthen their position, we encourage the inclusion of empirical experiments showcasing the impact of demographics, perhaps by employing humor-related datasets assessed by diverse groups. Finally, we advise clarifying unclear formulations in the text, particularly regarding "demand characteristics in evaluators" and the implications of "lower power distance."
