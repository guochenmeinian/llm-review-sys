Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents FinBen, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) in the English financial domain, encompassing 36 datasets across 24 tasks. The authors propose a systematic evaluation of 15 representative LLMs, revealing their strengths in information extraction and textual analysis while highlighting challenges in complex tasks. The work aims to advance financial LLMs by integrating a broader range of tasks and datasets than existing benchmarks, including stock trading evaluations and new datasets for summarization and question answering.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The topic of evaluating LLMs in financial knowledge is important and interesting.
2. The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of leveraging LLMs for financial applications, with a sufficient number of tasks, datasets, and baselines.
3. The systematic methodology and thorough analysis of 15 LLMs yield valuable insights.

Weaknesses:
1. The main contribution is limited as the manuscript primarily reorganizes and classifies existing datasets without introducing new ones.
2. The FinBen 2.0 leaderboard is invalid, and more representative LLMs should be included.
3. The organization of the paper is scattered, making it difficult to remember all details.
4. The standard NeurIPS2024 format is not adhered to, lacking line numbers and misplacing content after the checklist.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and organization of the paper to enhance readability. More detailed descriptions of the new datasets, including data collection frequency for FinTrade, should be provided. Additionally, we suggest including a quantitative comparison of LLM performance with classic non-LLM methods, particularly in forecasting and risk management, to deepen the analysis. Finally, addressing the concerns regarding the contribution of the work and expanding the dataset to include diverse global financial markets would enhance its applicability.
