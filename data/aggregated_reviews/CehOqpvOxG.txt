Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Fair Kernel K-Means (FKKM) framework aimed at addressing fairness issues in kernel k-means clustering. The authors introduce a fairness regularization term that integrates seamlessly into the kernel k-means objective function and extend this to a Fair Multiple Kernel K-Means (FMKKM) method. Theoretical analyses, including a generalization error bound, are provided alongside a strategy for hyperparameter selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in achieving fair clustering results while maintaining competitive performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of a fairness regularization term is a significant innovation addressing fairness in kernel k-means clustering.
2. The methods are simple, elegant, and effective, maintaining the kernel k-means formula while achieving fairness.
3. The paper provides thorough theoretical analysis and a strategy for hyperparameter settings, enhancing practical applicability.
4. Extensive experiments validate the methods, showing their effectiveness in both single and multiple kernel settings.

Weaknesses:
1. The related work on fair clustering is not discussed in sufficient detail.
2. The paper lacks a comprehensive discussion on practical applications and limitations of the proposed methods.
3. The evaluation primarily focuses on fairness, with insufficient analysis of clustering performance, particularly in scenarios where fairness may compromise accuracy.
4. The experimental setup lacks detailed descriptions regarding data selection and computational resources, which are essential for reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related work on fair clustering to provide context for their contributions. Additionally, we suggest that the authors elaborate on the practical applications and limitations of their methods, particularly in scenarios with noisy or inconsistent data. It would also be beneficial to include a more detailed analysis of clustering performance alongside fairness metrics to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide comprehensive details about the experimental setup, including data selection criteria and computational resources used, to enhance reproducibility.
