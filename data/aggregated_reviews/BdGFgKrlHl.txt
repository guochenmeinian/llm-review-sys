Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of the online secretary problem involving candidates from multiple groups, where inter-group comparisons incur a cost and are limited by a budget B. The authors propose a single threshold algorithm that selects candidates based on comparisons, deriving a lower bound on success probability that approaches 1/e as B increases. For two groups, they analyze a double threshold algorithm and an optimal memoryless algorithm, showing that the latter behaves similarly to the double threshold algorithm in large candidate scenarios. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The investigation of costly comparisons in the multi-color secretary problem is novel and relevant to real-world recruitment scenarios.  
2. The algorithms are theoretically sound, simple to implement, and effective.  
3. The paper is well-organized and presented clearly.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The focus on two groups is restrictive, raising concerns about the generalizability of the techniques to more groups.  
2. The title may mislead readers regarding the concept of bias in the context of the multi-color secretary problem.  
3. There are presentation errors, such as an incomplete sentence on line 36 and incorrect citation form on line 73.  
4. The paper lacks empirical analysis on real datasets and does not compare against baseline methods in experiments.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the title to better reflect the content and avoid potential misconceptions about bias. Additionally, we suggest including a brief discussion on the alternate model in the main body, as there is available space. Clarifying the representations of dashed and continuous lines in the figures is essential for reader comprehension. Furthermore, addressing the presentation errors noted, such as the incomplete sentence and citation issues, will enhance the paper's clarity. Lastly, we encourage the authors to consider empirical analysis on real datasets and include comparisons with baseline methods in future experiments.
