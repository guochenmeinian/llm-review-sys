Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comparative analysis of parametric and non-parametric neighborhood embedding methods for dimensionality reduction, emphasizing the challenges parametric methods face in preserving local data structures. The authors propose a new parametric method, ParamRepulsor, which incorporates hard negative mining and a modified loss function to enhance local structure preservation. Empirical results demonstrate that ParamRepulsor outperforms existing parametric methods across various datasets. Additionally, the paper introduces PaCMAP, a dimensionality reduction method designed to simplify the tuning process while preserving global structure. The authors argue that PaCMAP's loss function is simpler than those of t-SNE and UMAP, leading to better performance across various datasets and minimizing user intervention in parameter tuning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Novel Insight: The paper provides a unique perspective on local structure preservation issues in parametric dimensionality reduction methods.
- Technical Contribution: The introduction of ParamRepulsor, featuring hard negative mining and a modified loss function, represents a significant advancement.
- Thorough Evaluation: The comprehensive evaluation of ParamRepulsor against diverse datasets offers strong empirical support for the proposed approach.
- PaCMAP's simpler loss function and reduced parameter complexity are highlighted as advantages over traditional methods like t-SNE and UMAP.
- Clear Presentation: The writing is coherent and accessible.

Weaknesses:
- Limited Generalizability: The focus on shallow neural networks restricts the applicability of findings to other parametric models, such as deep networks.
- Insufficient Theoretical Analysis: The paper lacks a thorough theoretical exploration of why parametric methods underperform compared to their non-parametric counterparts.
- Absence of Non-Parametric Repulsor: The lack of a non-parametric version of ParamRepulsor limits understanding of the proposed modifications' effects.
- Limited Practical Impact: The advantages of ParamRepulsor may diminish with deeper networks, potentially reducing its practical relevance.
- Evaluation Metrics: The chosen metrics may not fully capture the quality of dimensionality reduction, especially for complex datasets.
- The method is perceived as requiring more tuning due to its three-component structure, which some reviewers find complex.
- There is skepticism regarding the theoretical backing of the claims made about the method's performance and its applicability in various contexts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by investigating the behavior of ParamRepulsor with deeper networks. Additionally, developing a non-parametric version of ParamRepulsor would facilitate a direct comparison and clarify the effects of the proposed modifications. A deeper theoretical analysis is necessary to elucidate the performance differences between parametric and non-parametric methods, particularly regarding the impact of network depth on local structure preservation. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of the proposed method and clarifying the computational time compared to other methods would enhance the paper's contributions. Lastly, we suggest comparing the proposed method with non-parametric methods to assess its effectiveness in bridging the gap between parametric and non-parametric approaches. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their introduction by emphasizing parametric methods to avoid confusion regarding the transition from non-parametric to parametric formulations, and to provide more substantial arguments and evidence to support their claims about the advantages of parametric embeddings in statistical analysis, addressing the concerns raised by reviewers regarding the method's complexity and theoretical foundations.
