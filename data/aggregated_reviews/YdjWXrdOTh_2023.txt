Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of various link prediction models across multiple datasets, identifying significant shortcomings in current evaluation methods, such as the use of unrealistic negative samples. The authors propose a new evaluation strategy called Heuristic Related Sampling Technique (HeaRT), which aims to align the evaluation process more closely with real-world scenarios by incorporating relevant negative samples tailored to each positive instance. The authors formalize the prediction tasks and evaluation metrics, including definitions for link prediction, negative sampling, and various evaluation metrics such as Hits@K, Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and AUC. They emphasize that HeaRT personalizes negative samples for each positive sample, mitigating unfair comparisons between methods by ensuring that negative samples are more relevant and challenging. The authors also address concerns regarding hyperparameter tuning and the relationship between link prediction and knowledge graph completion (KGC), proposing the use of a full grid search for consistent model evaluation while acknowledging the computational demands of message passing methods like GCNs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper uncovers critical issues in link prediction evaluations and offers suitable solutions.
2. The proposed evaluation setting aligns better with real-world applications.
3. Extensive experiments reveal new insights and potentials in the link prediction domain.
4. The paper provides formal definitions and clarifications for link prediction tasks and evaluation metrics, enhancing clarity.
5. HeaRT's personalized negative sampling approach offers a more realistic evaluation framework, addressing issues with existing methods.
6. The authors effectively address reviewer concerns and demonstrate a commitment to improving their work.

Weaknesses:
1. The preliminary study lacks clarity, particularly in formalizing prediction tasks and evaluation pitfalls.
2. The rationale behind the heuristic sampling methods is not sufficiently convincing, raising concerns about potential biases.
3. The quality of the code is subpar, lacking adequate documentation and clarity on dependencies.
4. The evaluation setting may introduce additional complexity, potentially affecting efficiency during testing.
5. The reliance on a full grid search may be seen as excessive, with suggestions that Bayesian or random search could suffice.
6. Some clarifications regarding the relationship between KGC and link prediction were initially unclear, necessitating further explanation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the preliminary study by providing formal formulations of the prediction tasks and evaluation pitfalls. Additionally, the authors should clarify the rationale behind the heuristic sampling methods to ensure they do not introduce biases that could skew comparisons. Enhancing the code quality is essential; we suggest providing comprehensive documentation, including installation instructions and a detailed explanation of classes and functions. Furthermore, we advise the authors to publish their selected negative samples and datasets in a clear, accessible format, ideally on platforms like Zenodo, to facilitate reproducibility and future research. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the "corruption of positive sample" concept by providing a more detailed explanation in the main text. Additionally, we suggest that the authors address the efficiency concerns associated with the HeaRT evaluation process, perhaps by exploring methods to optimize negative sample generation. Finally, we urge the authors to further elaborate on the similarities and differences between KGC and link prediction in the paper to enhance reader understanding and ensure that all citations are accurately referenced and clarified in the revised manuscript.
