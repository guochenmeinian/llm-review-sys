Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the MathWriting dataset, the largest online dataset for handwritten mathematical expression recognition, comprising 230,000 human-written samples and 400,000 synthetic samples, each paired with corresponding LaTeX expressions. The dataset aims to facilitate training and evaluation of handwritten mathematical expression recognition models. The authors also provide baseline performance results using standard models like OCR, CTC Transformer, and Vision-Language Models such as PaLI.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The MathWriting dataset is the largest of its kind, significantly advancing research in handwritten mathematical expression recognition.
2. The dataset includes a normalized version of LaTeX expressions, enhancing evaluation robustness.
3. The paper is well-structured and clearly written.

Weaknesses:
1. The experimental section lacks comprehensive baseline testing, omitting commonly used models like TAP and WAP.
2. The writing style is overly informal and requires revision to meet academic standards.
3. The synthetic data generation method lacks detail, particularly regarding bounding box extraction from DVI files and the potential inconsistency in writing styles due to random symbol selection.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and formality of the writing style to align with academic publishing standards. Additionally, we suggest including more detailed metrics commonly used in mathematical expression recognition, such as exact accuracy and character error rate (CER), to enhance baseline evaluations. It would also be beneficial to add metadata like writer ID and device information to the dataset labels. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to conduct experiments with a wider range of models, including classic ones like WAP and TAP, and to clarify the comparison between their dataset and existing ones, particularly regarding unique features and performance insights.
