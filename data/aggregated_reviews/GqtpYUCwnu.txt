Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the concept of $\epsilon$-fractional core stability, a relaxation of core stability in hedonic games that permits at most an $\epsilon$ fraction of coalitions to core-block. The authors demonstrate that for sufficiently small $\epsilon$, this stability can be guaranteed and computed in polynomial time for specific subclasses of hedonic games, including simple fractional and anonymous hedonic games. They also introduce learning algorithms with PAC-type guarantees for identifying $\epsilon$-fractional core-stable outcomes across various coalition distributions, while providing negative results for arbitrary distributions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper contributes significantly to the algorithmic study of core stability in hedonic games, addressing the limitations of traditional core stability definitions.
- It is well-structured and clearly written, with sound technical results and proofs.
- The proposed relaxation of core stability is justified and relevant, potentially leading to further research opportunities.

Weaknesses:
- The central definition (Definition 3.1) may not be universally applicable, as the relaxation could fail to provide meaningful stability guarantees in certain scenarios.
- Many results appear to derive directly from existing work, which, while not a basis for rejection, may limit the novelty of the contributions.
- The introduction dives into technical details too quickly, which may overwhelm readers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation and applicability of the $\epsilon$-fractional core stability definition, particularly in scenarios where it may not provide adequate guarantees. Additionally, we suggest contextualizing this new stability notion with respect to classic definitions, especially regarding individual rationality. Clarifying the uniform selection of coalitions and its implications would also enhance the paper's clarity. Lastly, addressing the minor technical issues, such as citation style and punctuation in equations, would improve the overall presentation.
