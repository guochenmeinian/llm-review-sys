Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new acquisition function, BEBBO, for batched Bayesian optimization (BO), inspired by statistical physics. BEBBO aims to balance exploration and exploitation through a hyper-parameter \( T \), enabling gradient-based optimization and effective control under heteroskedastic noise. The authors demonstrate its effectiveness through various experimental comparisons, although the novelty of the approach is questioned.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The acquisition function is novel and well-motivated, drawing from statistical physics, which aligns well with Bayesian approaches.  
2. The paper provides extensive empirical results, particularly highlighting the method's performance under heteroskedastic noise.

Weaknesses:  
1. The novelty of the method is limited, as it combines common components—entropy reduction and weighted value sums—without addressing unique cases.  
2. The paper lacks a thorough discussion on the use of BEBBO with other surrogate models, particularly regarding the loss of advantages when not paired with Gaussian Processes (GP).  
3. Experimental results primarily focus on large batch sizes (e.g., \( q=100 \)), raising concerns about performance in smaller batch settings.  
4. The statistical significance of the results is questionable due to the absence of confidence intervals and limited replicates.  
5. The theoretical analysis is shallow, lacking a regret bound, and the parameter \( T \) is not well-defined for practical use.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of the paper by addressing unique cases that BEBBO can solve compared to existing methods. Additionally, the authors should expand the experimental evaluation to include smaller batch sizes (e.g., 5 and 10) and compare against state-of-the-art methods like TURBO. To enhance the statistical robustness of the findings, we suggest including confidence intervals in the results tables and increasing the number of replicates. Furthermore, a deeper theoretical analysis, including a regret bound, would strengthen the paper. Lastly, clarifying the interpretation of the parameter \( T \) and discussing its practical setting would be beneficial.
