### Key Points
This paper presents a land-use segmentation dataset featuring bi-temporal images and segmentation masks, with 17 land-use categories. The dataset is collected using Google Earth for high-resolution images and Google Earth Engine for low-resolution images. It includes approximately 65,000 labeled locations, each containing two high-resolution images and 25 low-resolution images. The authors propose a method to fuse these images for semantic segmentation and change detection.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper provides a significantly larger and higher-quality dataset for land use classification, which is a valuable resource for the community.  
- It is well-written, with clear figures that enhance understanding.  
- The dataset includes both Very High Resolution (VHR) bi-temporal images and Sentinel-1/Sentinel-2 time series, supporting both semantic segmentation and change detection.

Weaknesses:  
- Notations in Section 4.1 are confusing, with unclear definitions and missing elements in equations.  
- The dataset cannot be downloaded without registration, compromising accessibility.  
- The baseline code is not publicly available, which limits reproducibility.  
- The dataset is limited to two regions, raising concerns about geographical transferability and the arbitrary definitions of land use categories.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of notations in Section 4.1, specifically addressing the definitions of $\mathcal{I}$, $|$, and the use of $\mathcal{I}_1$ and $\mathcal{I}_2$. Additionally, please ensure that the dataset is made easily accessible for reviewers without registration. We suggest that the authors provide the baseline code in the repository to enhance reproducibility. 

To address geographical transferability, we recommend including a discussion on the accuracy drop observed in the inter-dataset split and exploring the definitions of land use categories. It would be beneficial to add a third region to the dataset and clarify the acquisition process of VHR data sources. Furthermore, we suggest discussing the implications of using monthly data for change detection and how it can benefit downstream urban studies. Lastly, consider hosting the dataset on a cloud platform to simplify access and include code for a data loader.
