### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive security measurement study of the Docker image ecosystem through a proposed framework called DITector. The authors analyze over 12 million Docker Hub repositories to investigate five types of security threats: software vulnerabilities, secret leaks, misconfigurations, malicious files, and sensitive parameters. They construct an image dependency graph (IDEA) to understand threat propagation patterns and identify critical images based on pull counts and dependency weights. The evaluation covers 33,952 critical images, revealing widespread vulnerabilities (93.7%), numerous secret leaks (4,437 images), misconfigurations (50 images), and malicious images (24) primarily used for cryptocurrency mining. The study also tracks threat propagation, identifying 334 downstream images affected by malicious images.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Analyzes over 12 million repositories, representing the largest dataset in this field.
- Covers multiple dimensions: image descriptions, content, and metadata.
- Introduces DITector, a security analysis framework.
- Identifies concrete security issues affecting real-world systems.
- Promises to open-source part of the dataset and framework code.

Weaknesses:
- No clear rationale for focusing on these specific five types of threats.
- DITector primarily integrates existing tools (TruffleHog, Anchore, antivirus engines) without significant technical innovation, making the main contribution appear to be integration rather than novel solutions.
- Results focus on statistical findings without deeper insights or analysis of interesting patterns.
- Recommendations are too general and lack specific, actionable solutions.
- Misconfiguration analysis is limited to four popular containerized database applications, overlooking other types of applications and their distinct security requirements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the rationale for selecting the five types of threats and consider including additional security threats that may be relevant. It would be beneficial to provide a more detailed comparative analysis of DITector against existing tools, highlighting its innovations and advantages. We suggest discussing defense strategies for the identified security threats, including potential novel mechanisms. Additionally, expanding the scope of misconfiguration analysis beyond just four database applications would enhance the credibility of the evaluation results. Finally, including a breakdown of the responses received regarding secret leakage issues could add value to the findings.
