Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents MolPhenix, a framework for contrastive phenomolecular retrieval that integrates phenomic data and molecular structures into a joint embedding space. The authors propose a novel contrastive loss function that addresses challenges such as batch effects, inactive molecular perturbations, and variable concentrations. Experimental results indicate significant performance improvements over existing methods, particularly in zero-shot settings, supported by comprehensive evaluations and ablation studies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and clearly structured, with a strong motivation for the research.
- It tackles a relevant problem in drug discovery, showing substantial improvements in predictive performance.
- Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the proposed method, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential applications.
- The integration of molecular and phenomic data into a joint multi-modal embedding offers a fresh perspective.

Weaknesses:
- The source of performance increases for certain baselines remains unclear; an ablation study for each method component would provide more insights.
- The focus on retrieval limits exploration of the latent space, and comparisons with a broader range of state-of-the-art methods are lacking.
- The paper's clarity could be improved, particularly in articulating the significance of the work and adequately introducing related studies.
- Limited reproducibility due to reliance on a private dataset and unclear availability of model weights.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the task and background information, ensuring that related work is adequately introduced. Additionally, conducting an ablation study for each component of the method would clarify the contributions of the S2L loss and other techniques. We suggest expanding comparisons to include a broader range of state-of-the-art methods in molecular-phenotype contrastive learning. Furthermore, providing results for top N accuracy metrics (N = 1, 10, and 100) would enhance the informativeness of the retrieval accuracy results. Lastly, addressing the limitations regarding the private dataset and discussing the potential for generative or mechanistic explorations of the model would strengthen the paper's impact.
