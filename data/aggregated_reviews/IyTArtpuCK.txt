### Key Points
This paper presents an evaluation of causal structure learning algorithms, focusing on their robustness to violations of untestable assumptions commonly made in observational data. The authors particularly examine additive noise model-based methods using score matching, concluding that these methods exhibit greater robustness under assumption violations. The study involves over 2 million experiments across 11 causal discovery methods and 60,000 synthetically generated datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The focus on evaluating assumptions is crucial and often overlooked in the field.
- The experimental design is extensive, providing a solid foundation for the findings.
- The inclusion of a random baseline enhances the contextual understanding of results.
- The authors release code for data generation and methods, promoting reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- The diversity of methods is limited, with a predominance of additive noise model-based methods, which skews the comparison.
- Key algorithms like FCI and DirectLiNGAM are mentioned but not adequately evaluated, leading to a lack of representation of different method types.
- The choice of Gaussian processes as the nonlinear mechanism is not justified, and other nonlinear mechanisms should be considered.
- The evaluation metrics used (false-positive and false-negative rates) overlook recent advancements in error measurement, which could provide a more nuanced understanding of performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the diversity of methods evaluated by including a broader range of causal discovery algorithms, particularly those not based on additive noise models. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the absence of sections I.4 and I.5 in the appendices, ensuring that all referenced results are accessible. It would also be beneficial to justify the choice of Gaussian processes as the nonlinear mechanism and consider alternative mechanisms to enhance the analysis. Finally, we encourage the authors to incorporate more recent error measures in their evaluation to provide a comprehensive assessment of the algorithms' performance.
