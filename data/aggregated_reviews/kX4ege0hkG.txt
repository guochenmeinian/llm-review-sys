### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of the security flaw associated with phantom domainsâ€”URLs that contain errors in the domain name, often due to human oversight. The authors measure the prevalence of these domains, focusing on their potential for exploitation. While the methodology is commendable, the paper's scope is limited to measuring potentially exploitable domains without assessing actual exploitation. The authors utilize the Common Crawl dataset for their analysis but face criticism regarding the completeness and accuracy of their filtering process.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant security issue related to erroneous hyperlinks, presenting a novel angle compared to previous work on expired domains.
- The measurement methodology is well-executed, and the writing is clear and coherent.
- The extensive list of proposed countermeasures goes beyond technical solutions, indicating a thoughtful approach to the problem.

Weaknesses:
- The filtering process is incomplete, potentially leading to an overestimation of phantom domains, as it relies on a single snapshot of the .com zone file.
- The analysis lacks depth, particularly regarding the traffic to phantom domains and the potential for actual exploitation.
- The paper does not adequately explore the psychological or design factors contributing to the creation of phantom domains.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the filtering process by incorporating WHOIS information to accurately determine domain registration status and consider using multiple zone file snapshots. Additionally, the authors should provide the exact number or percentage of unregistrable domains among the phantom domains identified. A more detailed traffic analysis, possibly utilizing passive DNS data, would enhance the understanding of phantom domain visibility. We also suggest exploring whether any phantom domains have been exploited in the wild and clarifying the distinction between phantom domains and other domain name attacks. Finally, a more realistic assessment of the proposed mitigations, characterized by their feasibility and likelihood of adoption, would strengthen the paper.
