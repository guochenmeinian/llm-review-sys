### Key Points
This paper presents PFCon, a tool designed to detect permission-functionality consistency issues in trigger-action integrations (TAIs). The authors analyze 427 services from IFTTT, revealing that nearly one-third request excessive permissions. PFCon employs large language model prompts to identify required and requested permissions, utilizing a lattice-based approach for modeling their relationships. The study includes a user evaluation with 64 services to validate the findings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with a clear and logical structure.
- It provides a comprehensive evaluation of permission excess issues in TAIs.
- The methodology is systematic, revealing significant findings regarding excessive permissions.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for addressing permission excess in TAIs is unclear.
- The rationale behind the selection of resources and methodology lacks detail.
- The adopted lattice system requires better illustration and justification.
- The sample size for user evaluation is limited, raising concerns about the robustness of the findings.
- The paper does not analyze applets, which may affect the reliability of results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the motivation for their work, emphasizing the importance of addressing permission excess issues. Additionally, provide detailed information on how services were selected and the statistics of the collected data. The authors should enhance the explanation of the lattice system and its effectiveness in capturing permissions. We also suggest increasing the sample size for user evaluation to strengthen the findings. Furthermore, consider including an analysis of applets to improve the reliability of PFCon's results. Lastly, we urge the authors to disclose their findings to IFTTT and include any feedback received in the paper, as well as to release the source code and dataset used in the evaluation.
