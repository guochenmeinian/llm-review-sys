Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to video editing that addresses the issue of temporal consistency through a hybrid deformation field architecture and a diffusion prior update scheduling. The authors propose using a trainable homography matrix H(u, v, t) and a residual deformation MLP to represent object variations, aiming to generate natural canonical images that enhance editing performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The results demonstrate relatively temporal coherence and faster convergence speed compared to other methods.
2. The use of homography provides a strong foundation for generating accurate canonical images.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks clarity and is poorly written, with vague expressions and insufficient introduction of key concepts like diffusion loss.
2. The Method section lacks detailed information supporting claims, such as the structure of the Residual MLP and the criteria for noise addition.
3. Limitations of the method are not adequately addressed, particularly regarding its handling of various video types and motion blur.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing and provide detailed explanations in the Method section, including the structure of the Residual MLP and the basis for noise addition. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explicitly address the limitations of their approach, particularly regarding the types of motions their method can handle. It would also be beneficial to clarify the connection between diffusion prior and the generation of natural images, as well as the rationale behind the chosen update scheduling for noise and diffusion.
