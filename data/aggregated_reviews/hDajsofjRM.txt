Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Gradient-based Adaptive Policy Selection (GAPS) algorithm for online adaptive policy selection in nonlinear time-varying discrete-time dynamical systems. The authors demonstrate that GAPS achieves optimal regret bounds in convex cases and local regret bounds in non-convex settings, utilizing a general analytical framework based on contractive perturbation properties. The algorithm's performance is validated through numerical experiments, showing its superiority over existing baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized and clearly written, effectively presenting significant insights and results.
- GAPS achieves optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret in convex cases and provides the first local regret bound for non-convex scenarios.
- The proposed contractive perturbation property and analytical framework are general, potentially benefiting future research.

Weaknesses:
- The algorithm requires $\Omega(\log T)$ memory, which is a limitation compared to constant complexity.
- The assumptions regarding the dynamics, particularly the strong conditions on stability and contractive perturbation, may be overly restrictive.
- The numerical experiments do not compare GAPS with existing algorithms in online nonstochastic control, limiting the evaluation of its performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their assumptions, particularly regarding Definitions 2.6 and 2.7, and provide more examples of dynamics that satisfy these conditions. Additionally, the authors should consider including comparisons with existing algorithms in the numerical experiments to better contextualize GAPS's performance. It would also be beneficial to discuss the implications of the buffer length $B$ on the gradient estimation and its role in the proof more explicitly. Finally, enhancing the writing style by integrating key theoretical insights into the main text rather than relegating them to the appendix would improve overall comprehension.
