Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a post-processing algorithm aimed at achieving true positive rate (TPR) parity in multi-class classification, extending the binary class equalized odds framework. The authors derive finite-sample guarantees and provide empirical evaluations demonstrating the algorithm's effectiveness on real-world datasets. Additionally, the paper includes a detailed analysis of the relationship between the `meo` constraint in the source code and the authors' TPR parity metric, establishing that `meo` (code) is equivalent to TPR parity. The authors clarify that while the $\textsf{MEO}$ metric differs from TPR parity, TPR parity serves as a relaxation of equalized odds (EqOdds), which is not applicable in multiclass settings, as demonstrated through counterexamples. The discussion on adversarial debiasing as an in-processing method aimed at achieving EqOdds is also included, emphasizing the necessity of first satisfying TPR parity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed approach is novel and technically sound, with guarantees for fairness based on sample complexity.
- The paper is well-written, and the presentation is generally clear, effectively addressing the problem of fairness in multi-class classification.
- The paper provides a clear and rigorous comparison between the `meo` constraint and TPR parity, enhancing the understanding of fairness metrics.
- The authors effectively use counterexamples to illustrate the limitations of the $\textsf{MEO}$ metric in multiclass scenarios.
- The discussion on adversarial debiasing is insightful, highlighting its relationship with TPR parity and EqOdds.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a thorough comparison with state-of-the-art methods, with significant works not mentioned, raising questions about the novelty and significance of the contribution.
- The presentation becomes dense in certain sections, particularly in the algorithm's description, which may hinder reader comprehension.
- The significance of studying fairness in multi-class classification is not convincingly justified, as many existing binary classification fairness methods could be adapted.
- The distinction between TPR parity and the $\textsf{MEO}$ metric could be elaborated further for clarity.
- The implications of the findings on practical applications are not sufficiently explored.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by including and comparing their approach with relevant state-of-the-art methods, particularly those from binary classification and regression contexts. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the clarity of the algorithm's description, especially in Section 3, to facilitate reader understanding. It would be beneficial to justify the importance of fairness in multi-class classification more robustly and to address the runtime complexities of the proposed method transparently in the limitations section. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the distinction between TPR parity and the $\textsf{MEO}$ metric, possibly by providing additional examples or visual aids. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors explore the practical implications of their findings in greater depth, discussing how these metrics can be effectively applied in real-world scenarios. Finally, we encourage the authors to formulate explicit theorems regarding the optimal fair classifier and discuss the computational complexity of their method in detail.
