Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a graph-based semi-supervised framework, the Graph of Circuits Explorer (GCX), aimed at optimizing circuit design by predicting performance parameters such as Gain, Bandwidth, and Noise. The authors propose a semi-supervised learning approach that creates a comprehensive feature vector integrating various technology nodes and topologies, enhancing generalizability in zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through simulations under 180nm CMOS technology, with generalizability tested on 65nm and 45nm CMOS process nodes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel approach to circuit design optimization using graph representation and semi-supervised learning, reducing reliance on extensive labeled datasets.
- The presentation is solid and clear, with well-illustrated figures and comprehensive validation across different GNN model variants and circuit performance prediction methods.

Weaknesses:
- The performance of the surrogate model is low, raising questions about its practicality compared to conventional SPICE simulations. The method's accuracy is insufficient for practical applications.
- The contribution of the paper could be better articulated, particularly regarding the inherent characteristics of GNNs and their limitations in transductive learning scenarios.
- There is a lack of validation in real-world scenarios, and the paper does not adequately address potential limitations of the proposed methods or the significance of the results in practical EDA tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the training process for the semi-supervised learning framework and provide more details on defining node weights and stopping criteria. Additionally, the authors should address the potential for over-smoothing in GNNs and include tests on various GNN frameworks. It would be beneficial to clarify the significance of the tested metrics in actual applications and explore the feasibility of conducting experiments in real circuits. Lastly, the authors should enhance the discussion on the practical implications of their results and the limitations of their approach.
