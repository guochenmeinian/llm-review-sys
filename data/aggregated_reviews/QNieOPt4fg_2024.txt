Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SelectIT, a novel instruction tuning (IT) method that utilizes the intrinsic uncertainty in large language models (LLMs) to select high-quality IT data without needing additional resources. The authors introduce a curated dataset, Selective Alpaca, derived from the Alpaca-GPT4 dataset, demonstrating significant improvements in model performance across various tasks. SelectIT employs three levels of uncertainty—token-level, sentence-level, and model-level—to effectively rate and select IT data, showcasing its robustness and efficiency compared to traditional methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The innovative approach of leveraging LLMs' intrinsic uncertainty for IT data selection is cost-effective and widely applicable.
- The methodology is clearly explained, with robust empirical results supporting its effectiveness across various benchmarks.
- The paper is well-written, making the concepts accessible, and it emphasizes the practical impact of the research by providing a public dataset.

Weaknesses:
- The clarity of Figure 2 is lacking; a brief description of each selection stage in the caption is recommended for better understanding.
- The reliance on the foundational LLM's capacity may limit the effectiveness of the selection method compared to external resource methods.
- The paper claims not to use extra resources but later mentions using different sizes of LLaMA 2 models, which contradicts this assertion.
- The evaluation is based on a single dataset, raising questions about the generalizability of the method to other datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Figure 2 by adding a brief description of each selection stage in the caption. Additionally, we suggest exploring the performance of SelectIT on instruction tuning datasets beyond Alpaca-GPT4 to assess its broader applicability. The authors should also consider providing detailed examples or case studies comparing data selected by SelectIT with other methods, as well as clarifying the overhead of the data selection model, including processing times on larger datasets. Finally, addressing the dependency on tuning the parameter \( K \) and the implications of using multiple base models would enhance the paper's robustness.
