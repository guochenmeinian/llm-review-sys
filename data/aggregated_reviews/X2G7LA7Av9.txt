Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the vulnerabilities of digital watermarking techniques to steganalysis attacks, demonstrating through extensive experiments that content-agnostic watermarking methods are particularly susceptible to detection and removal. The authors propose a steganalysis-based attack that exploits repeating patterns in watermarked images, effectively compromising these watermarks without needing access to the original watermarking algorithm.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and organized, with clear explanations of watermark detection and removal methods.
- The method of estimating watermark disturbance through image averaging is innovative.
- The proposed attacks effectively target content-agnostic watermarking methods, highlighting their vulnerabilities.

Weaknesses:
- The linear assumption that watermarked images result from adding perturbations to original images lacks clarity regarding its generality, particularly concerning methods like Tree-Ring.
- The definition of steganalysis is inadequately addressed, which is crucial for understanding the paper's context.
- Inconsistencies in performance metrics presented in figures raise questions about the validity of results.
- The quality of figures, particularly font size, could be improved for better readability.
- The practical applicability of the steganalysis method is limited due to its reliance on a large number of watermarked images.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the generality of the linear assumption used in their model, particularly in relation to the Tree-Ring method. Additionally, we suggest explicitly defining steganalysis to enhance comprehension. The authors should address the inconsistencies in performance metrics in Figure 2 and improve the quality of figures for better readability. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to discuss the practical limitations of their method, particularly regarding the necessity of a large dataset of watermarked images for effective application.
