Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel uncertainty quantification (UQ) scheme for hyperparameter optimization (HPO) in machine learning, particularly for iterative learners. The authors argue that their approach prevents the premature discarding of promising configurations by quantifying uncertainty in candidate configurations. The evaluation demonstrates that the UQ scheme can identify similarly performing configurations while significantly reducing exploration budgets. The work includes theoretical analysis, examples, and experiments across various algorithms, showcasing the potential applicability of the UQ-guided scheme in HPO.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces an original approach to HPO that incorporates uncertainty, enhancing decision-making.
- The theoretical framework is robust, and the methodology is well-supported by empirical results.
- The UQ method shows improved performance compared to traditional methods that do not consider uncertainty.

Weaknesses:
- The claim that the method is applicable to all iterative learners is not substantiated, as experiments focus solely on deep learning methods.
- The writing contains linguistic issues and could benefit from clearer explanations, particularly regarding the terminology used.
- Limitations of the UQ scheme, particularly its applicability to non-iterative learners and the assumptions made, are insufficiently addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the limitations of the UQ scheme, particularly regarding its applicability to non-iterative learners and the impact of different assumptions on its effectiveness. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons against recent related works that also account for uncertainty, such as Mendes et al. (2023) and Swersky et al. (2014). The authors should clarify the specific parameters that the UQ approach requires users to set and how these parameters influence the method's performance. Furthermore, we advise enhancing the clarity of the writing, particularly in sections where technical terms are introduced, and providing pseudo-code to illustrate the integration of UQ into iterative learners. Lastly, we encourage the authors to consider a more intuitive explanation of complex mathematical concepts to improve accessibility for a broader audience.
