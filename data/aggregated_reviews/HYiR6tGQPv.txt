Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a probability-based contrastive learning framework aimed at addressing false positive and negative pairs in molecular representation learning. The authors propose a learnable weighted approach that utilizes Bayesian modeling to automatically identify and mitigate these false pairs. The effectiveness of the method is validated through experiments on the MoleculeNet and QM9 datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to strong baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The probability-weighted contrastive learning mechanism is innovative, treating model weights as random variables and employing Bayesian inference for optimal weight sampling.
2. The experimental results are comprehensive, showing significant performance improvements across various property prediction tasks.
3. The method is presented clearly, making it easy to understand.

Weaknesses:
1. The related works on false labels and weighted contrastive learning are inadequately discussed, limiting the paper's novelty.
2. The data splitting methodology in experiments is unclear, which could significantly impact performance.
3. The relevance of 3D structures is overstated, as they are not a key component of the proposed approach.
4. Justification for using the Gamma prior is necessary, as it is crucial to the method's technical soundness.
5. The algorithm presentation lacks elegance and clarity, particularly in Algorithm A.
6. Some figures contain elements copied from cited works, raising concerns about copyright permissions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related works on false labels and weighted contrastive learning to enhance the paper's novelty. Clarifying the data splitting methodology in the experiments is essential to ensure reproducibility. We suggest that the authors justify the use of the Gamma prior more thoroughly, as it is a critical aspect of their approach. Additionally, we encourage the authors to present Algorithm A more elegantly and to address the copyright concerns regarding figures. Lastly, considering the inclusion of larger datasets and additional baselines in their experiments could strengthen the overall findings.
