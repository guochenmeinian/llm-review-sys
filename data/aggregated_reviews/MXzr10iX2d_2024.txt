Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into topological reasoning for lane graph prediction in autonomous driving, focusing on enhancing the prediction of lane graph structures. The authors propose two mechanisms: a geometric approach that estimates connectivity based on the distance between lane endpoints, and a semantic approach that evaluates lane query similarities in high-dimensional space. These methods contrast with existing approaches that primarily utilize MLPs for lane connectivity prediction. The authors demonstrate that integrating these approaches into a lane graph network significantly improves topological reasoning results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, highlighting the significance of geometric cues in predicting lane connectivity.
- The proposed geometric approach can be integrated into existing networks, enhancing lane topology prediction.
- Both the geometric and semantic approaches are clear and effectively improve topological metrics.

Weaknesses:
- The absence of a comparison with TopoMLP is notable, as relevant data could be extracted from existing literature.
- The paper's contributions appear marginal, raising questions about its suitability for NeurIPS.
- The proposed methods are relatively simple post-processing techniques, leading to limited academic contributions.
- There are inconsistencies in the experimental setup, such as the use of different metric versions and unclear dataset splits.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with TopoMLP to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of their methods. Additionally, clarifying the dataset split used for experiments and ensuring consistency in metric versions would enhance the paper's rigor. We suggest addressing the technical concerns raised, such as the normalization in Equation 10 and the implications of using a batch size of 2 on 8 GPUs. Furthermore, the authors should provide a deeper analysis of the impact of their methods on traffic element detection and clarify the relationship between lane similarity and topology reasoning performance. Finally, a thorough proofreading to correct typos and improve clarity is essential.
