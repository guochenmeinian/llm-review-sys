Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper introduces a modification to the EF21-SGD algorithm by incorporating momentum, resulting in the new algorithm EF21-SGDM. The authors theoretically demonstrate that EF21-SGD cannot converge with small batch sizes and propose momentum as a remedy, proving that EF21-SGDM can achieve linear speedup in distributed non-convex optimization without assumptions on bounded gradient similarity. The analysis reduces sample complexity from $\Omega(\sigma^2/\epsilon^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\sigma^2/(L\delta_0))$, and the experiments focus on non-convex logistic regression problems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper presents a novel algorithm for distributed settings with compressed gradients and provides a solid theoretical analysis.
- It identifies and addresses the issue of weak sample complexity guarantees in EF21 with stochastic gradients.
- The proposed method requires only standard smoothness and bounded variance assumptions, and the sample complexity is free of $\alpha$ and batch-free.

Weaknesses:
- The dependence of sample complexity on the variance term $\sigma$ should be explicitly stated for clarity.
- The algorithm's implementation is straightforward, merely combining existing methods, and the experiments are limited to logistic regression, lacking broader applicability.
- There are minor inaccuracies in the experimental comparisons, such as the characterization of NEOLITHIC's batch size and the need for additional comparisons with other communication-efficient methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the sample complexity dependence on $\sigma$ and address the consistency of batch size terminology in Algorithm 1. Additionally, we suggest expanding the experimental validation beyond logistic regression to include larger models, such as CIFAR, and providing comparisons with other communication-efficient methods based on wall clock time rather than bits communicated. Finally, a discussion on the memory consumption implications of momentum in EF21-SGDM would enhance the paper's comprehensiveness.
