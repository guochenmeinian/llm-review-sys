### Key Points
This paper presents a novel pivot-based framework called HCSPivot for counting hereditary cohesive subgraphs (HCS), extending the classic clique model by relaxing its conditions while maintaining heredity and cohesiveness. The authors propose two algorithms that utilize innovative pruning techniques to efficiently count specific HCS types, such as s-defective cliques and s-plexes. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- HCSPivot is the first framework specifically designed for counting HCS, addressing limitations of the classic clique model.
- The paper provides a clear review of current literature and extensive experimental evaluations on multiple real-world datasets.
- The research methods are well articulated, supporting the correctness of the proposed ideas.

Weaknesses:
- The discussion in Section 3 lacks depth regarding key design choices and pruning techniques.
- The paper does not thoroughly address the robustness and scalability of the proposed method.
- There is limited technical innovation, relying on simple strategies without clear examples of practical applications.
- The experimental evaluation is narrow, focusing primarily on internal baselines and lacking comparisons with mainstream algorithms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the depth of the discussion in Section 3 by providing a more comprehensive analysis of design choices and pruning techniques. Additionally, including a toy example could enhance accessibility for readers unfamiliar with counting problems. It would be beneficial to expand the experimental comparisons to include recent enumeration algorithms or heuristic methods, as well as state-of-the-art clique counting approaches. Furthermore, we suggest including statistical results in Table 2 that show counts obtained for different methods under various q values, and addressing how different s-values impact memory usage in the HCSPivot framework. Lastly, we advise correcting grammatical errors and ensuring clarity in expression throughout the manuscript.
