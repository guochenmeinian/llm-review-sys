### Key Points
This paper presents a study on designing and analyzing randomized algorithms for Metrical Task Systems (MTS) using limited randomness, specifically a number of random bits that depends only on $n$ (the number of states in the MTS). The authors demonstrate that $2\log n$ random bits are sufficient to achieve a competitive ratio comparable to the best fully randomized algorithms, up to a factor of 2, and establish that $\log n - O(\log \log n)$ bits are necessary for this purpose. The work also introduces a collective MTS setting, where $k$ algorithms run in parallel, and connects the approach to optimal transport theory, utilizing techniques such as the Birkhoff-von Neumann theorem.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written, with rigorous proofs and intuitive explanations.  
- The solution is non-trivial, leveraging complex ideas and connecting theoretical results to practical applications.  
- The use of optimal transport theory appears novel in this context.  

Weaknesses:  
- There is a lack of experimental analysis, which could enhance the practical understanding of the application discussed in Remark 2.3.  
- The paper may not be suitable for NeurIPS, as it is more aligned with theoretical computer science venues.  
- No upper bounds for $k < n^2$ are provided, which is a mild weakness.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including an experimental evaluation of the application discussed in Remark 2.3. Additionally, please clarify whether the use of the optimal transport theorem is novel in the competitive analysis of MTS problems. In Section 3, consider providing a rough pseudocode statement of the algorithm. We also suggest expanding on the similarities with descent methods mentioned on line 400. Lastly, please ensure appropriate citations are added throughout, particularly in lines 141-148, and address the repeated word "tight" in lines 82-83.
