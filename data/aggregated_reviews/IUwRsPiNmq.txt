Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents HD-KT, a robust framework for Knowledge Tracing (KT) that aims to enhance the performance of existing KT models by addressing anomalous learning interactions. The authors introduce two detectors: a knowledge state-guided anomaly detector and a student profile-guided anomaly detector, which help identify and mitigate the impact of noise in student interactions. Experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in improving predictions of student performance and its generalizability across different KT models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and clearly presents the rationale behind the model design and evaluation results.
- The proposed method is sound, with comprehensive technical coverage and a clear experimental setup that supports its claims.
- The experiments cover multiple datasets, showcasing the framework's robustness and potential applications in analyzing learning behaviors.

Weaknesses:
- The performance improvements reported are marginal compared to baseline models, raising questions about the practical significance of the gains.
- The motivation for the choice of anomaly detectors is insufficiently explained, and the paper lacks a clear definition of what constitutes an anomalous interaction.
- Some sections, such as the experiment in Sect. 5.4.3, feel rushed and lack adequate explanation, while figure descriptions could be more detailed to enhance understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and motivation for the choice of the two detectors by providing a robust rationale for their necessity. Additionally, a more comprehensive definition and exploration of abnormal interactions would enhance the paper's clarity. We suggest that the authors consider conducting a more extensive error analysis and provide insights into the frequency of positive impacts from the proposed framework. Furthermore, including detailed parameter settings and comparisons with baselines would enhance reproducibility and transparency. Lastly, discussing the challenges of implementing the HD-KT framework in real-world educational settings, including scalability and ethical considerations, would strengthen the paper's practical implications.
