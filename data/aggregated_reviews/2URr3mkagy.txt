Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for efficiently differentiating through constrained discrete-time optimal control systems, focusing on the computation of derivatives of optimal trajectories with respect to system parameters. The authors demonstrate that the computational complexity can be reduced to linear with respect to the trajectory length, leveraging the block structure of matrices involved. The proposed approach is evaluated against existing methods, showing at least a 2x improvement in speed and enhanced numerical stability across various tasks. Additionally, the authors address numerical issues commonly encountered in differentiable trajectory optimization methods and propose incorporating further discussions on iLQR/DDP literature from robotics and control to enhance the paper's depth. They emphasize that their method's derivation is independent of the solver used, justifying their choice of IPOPT for its robust convergence properties.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized and clearly written, effectively motivating the study of differentiable optimal control.
- The analysis of the sparse structure of implicit function theorem (IFT) equations leads to significant improvements in computational efficiency.
- The proposed algorithm demonstrates clear advantages over existing methods, particularly in terms of speed and stability.
- The authors have effectively responded to reviewer feedback, leading to an increased appreciation of the paper's contributions.
- The choice of IPOPT as a solver is well-justified, highlighting its global convergence properties.
- The intention to include additional discussions on relevant literature and methods strengthens the paper's relevance.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the method is questioned, as it appears to rely heavily on existing numerical techniques without introducing new tools.
- There is a lack of large-scale problem evaluations, which limits the demonstration of the method's effectiveness in more complex scenarios.
- The writing could be improved for clarity, particularly in sections discussing technical details and results.
- The paper could benefit from improved presentation and clarity.
- There is still room for enhancement in the experimental section, particularly regarding comparisons to DiffMPC.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty claims by clearly articulating how their method differs from existing techniques and providing more context on the application of results from previous works. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments on larger-scale problems to better illustrate the advantages of the proposed method. Profiling the time cost of each computational step, particularly those that can and cannot be parallelized, would also enhance the paper's clarity. Furthermore, we recommend improving the presentation of the paper to enhance clarity and engagement. We suggest including a more comprehensive discussion on shooting methods like DDP and iLQR, particularly their backward pass and closed-loop correction gain matrices. While comparisons to DiffMPC are not strictly necessary, incorporating them along with computation time and performance metrics would further strengthen the paper. Finally, we encourage the authors to refine the writing for better readability, especially in technical sections, and to include visualizations of the environments used in experiments for better context.
