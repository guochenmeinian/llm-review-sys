Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of AUC optimization techniques to pixel-level long-tail semantic segmentation, proposing a novel pixel-level AUC loss function. The authors decompose the loss into inner-image and inter-image terms to address interdependencies and theoretically prove its effectiveness. They also introduce a Tail-Classes Memory Bank to manage memory demands. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is clearly organized and well written.
2. The general idea and motivation are compelling.
3. The authors provide detailed theoretical proofs and a novel perspective by utilizing AUC as the loss function.

Weaknesses:
1. The design of the Tail-Class Memory Bank raises questions about ensuring pasted tail pixels do not obscure other categories.
2. The argument against stratified sampling techniques appears flawed; grouping images by category could allow for effective sampling.
3. Clarification is needed on how the Tail-Class Memory Bank stores data and the rationale behind using ground truth versus predictions.
4. Pasting tail-class pixels may occlude original classes, potentially affecting performance.
5. The method relies heavily on SegNeXt, yet there are significant performance gaps compared to original results.
6. Limited performance improvements on datasets other than ADE20K suggest poor generalizability.
7. The authors should provide results with large-scale pretrained models like SAM/CLIP to demonstrate broader applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the Tail-Class Memory Bank design and its operational rationale. Additionally, the authors should clarify experimental outcomes related to the memory bank's effectiveness and address the concerns regarding stratified sampling. An ablation study on batch size's impact on performance is also suggested. Finally, the authors should consider empirical verification of other surrogate losses for AUC optimization and provide results using large-scale pretrained models to enhance generalization potential.
