Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel gradient-based algorithm for sampling from complex multimodal discrete distributions using differentiable energy functions. The authors propose a discrete Langevin sampler with automatic cyclical scheduling, incorporating a cyclical step size, balancing schedule, and hyperparameter tuning scheme. The method is theoretically analyzed with non-asymptotic convergence guarantees and is empirically validated through experiments on RBMs, EBMs, and text infilling tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The algorithm appears novel and potentially impactful, especially if an "easy-to-use" implementation is provided.
- The cyclical scheduling method is well-motivated and enhances the original local self-balancing MCMC approach.
- The theoretical results offer non-asymptotic convergence guarantees, supporting the method's robustness.
- Extensive empirical studies demonstrate the method's superiority in sampling from high-dimensional discrete spaces.

Weaknesses:
- A significant amount of content is relegated to the appendix, hindering the logical flow and intuition in the main paper.
- The complexity of the algorithm is high, and the paper lacks sufficient intuition for its functioning, particularly regarding the selection of initial and final balancing factors.
- The only real-world experiment is inadequately detailed, lacking clarity on the task's difficulty.
- The theoretical analysis relies on strong assumptions that may not hold in practical applications, such as LLMs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the logical flow by moving some details to the appendix while enhancing the main text with more intuitive explanations of the method's components. Additionally, we suggest providing a more thorough description of the real-world experiment to clarify its challenges. It would be beneficial to discuss the implications of the theoretical assumptions and explore how the method behaves on unimodal or mildly multimodal distributions. Finally, including error bars in the experimental results and addressing discrepancies with previous studies would strengthen the paper's empirical validation.
