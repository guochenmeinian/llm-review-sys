Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents X-ClusterLink, a framework aimed at efficient cross-cluster communication in multi-Kubernetes environments, focusing on low latency, high throughput, and strong robustness. The authors detail the technologies utilized, including eBPF/XDP and Bucket-Based ECMP, and provide a well-structured methodology alongside thorough experimental validation. The framework's significance lies in addressing critical issues in distributed systems, although a clearer distinction from existing solutions would enhance its originality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a detailed analysis of related work, establishing a solid foundation for the proposed approach.
- Experimental validation is thorough, demonstrating the framework's advantages effectively.
- The writing is clear and well-organized, making the framework and its components easy to understand.

Weaknesses:
- The originality of the approach is questionable, as it appears to efficiently utilize existing technologies rather than introduce novel concepts.
- The experimental setup is idealized, lacking variations in network conditions that are relevant for cross-cluster communication.
- There is insufficient analysis of the algorithm's performance under varying network delays and dynamic environments.
- The connection to the conference's scope is weak, as the problem addressed may not be directly related to Web applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how X-ClusterLink differs from existing frameworks, particularly Zeta, and provide a comparative analysis. It would be beneficial to highlight the outcomes of the proofs in the results section and analyze the algorithm's performance under varying network conditions. Additionally, incorporating a more dynamic experimental environment and addressing the limitations of the current work would strengthen the paper. Finally, providing more implementation details and ensuring consistency in experimental figures would enhance clarity and usability.
