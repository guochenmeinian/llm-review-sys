### Key Points
This paper presents a method for matching handwritten strings using contrastive learning to compute similarity across various fonts. The authors propose a novel algorithm for linking instances of the same entity in historical documents using OCR text, addressing character recognition errors. The algorithm employs renderings of characters in multiple fonts for contrastive training, utilizing cosine distance as a substitution penalty in the Levenshtein distance computation. The method is tested on curated datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to existing string matching algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach is novel, well-argued, and effectively addresses inherent difficulties in record linking.
- The method shows improved performance over previous algorithms and is straightforward to reproduce, with a package for distribution mentioned.
- Limitations are clearly discussed, and the authors acknowledge the potential of more sophisticated methods.

Weaknesses:
- The technical contribution appears limited as the application of contrastive learning is straightforward.
- The paper lacks detailed descriptions of string matching over the proposed similarity metric, impacting reproducibility.
- The content is somewhat repetitive, and the paper could benefit from clearer organization and additional visual aids.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the technical contribution and provide more details on string matching to enhance reproducibility. Additionally, we suggest reducing redundancy throughout the paper and including an architecture diagram in section 2.1 to clarify the algorithm's structure. The abstract should be rewritten for conciseness and divided into 2-3 paragraphs. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explicitly address the limitation regarding the focus on a single script and discuss potential generalization to other alphabets.
