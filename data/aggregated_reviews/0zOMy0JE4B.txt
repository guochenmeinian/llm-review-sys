### Key Points
This paper presents GLMAb-BO, an antibody design framework that utilizes a language model for candidate generation and Bayesian optimization for selection. The framework demonstrates advantageous performance compared to selected baselines using Absolut! as a computational ground truth. However, the motivation for the method and its empirical evaluation raise concerns, particularly regarding the efficiency of Gaussian processes in measuring uncertainty for large sequences.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed framework shows promising performance in antibody design.  
- The integration of a language model with Bayesian optimization is innovative.  

Weaknesses:  
- The motivation for using Bayesian optimization lacks clarity and correctness regarding Gaussian processes' computational complexity.  
- The empirical evaluation does not adequately address key questions, with similar performance across methods and a lack of reported variation metrics.  
- The algorithmic contribution of the "risk aware" acquisition function appears to be a re-scaled version of UCB, raising questions about its novelty and effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the connections between the proposed risk-aware acquisition function and UCB, as well as its relation to risk-averse Bayesian optimization approaches. Additionally, it would be beneficial to expand on the applicability of Gaussian processes to sequence data, particularly regarding the subsequence string kernel's complexity with long sequences. Including a "Bag of Amino Acids" baseline would serve as a useful sanity check. Finally, we suggest reporting measures of statistical variation in Tables 1 and 2 to enhance the empirical evaluation.
