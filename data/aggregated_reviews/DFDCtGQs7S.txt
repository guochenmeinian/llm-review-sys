Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a curated dataset comprising approximately 134.6 million labeled images of 326,888 species, sourced from the iNaturalist community science platform. The dataset spans seven taxonomic classes and includes scientific and common names, along with taxonomic details. The authors claim this dataset is the largest of its kind, significantly surpassing the TreeOfLife-10M dataset in image count while maintaining comparable species diversity. Additionally, the authors introduce a benchmark foundation model, ArborCLIP, and provide experimental results demonstrating the dataset's utility for zero-shot and few-shot learning. The dataset enhances the size of biodiversity datasets and employs an interesting evaluation paradigm, although clarity of results and additional evaluations (e.g., genera vs. species results) are noted as areas for improvement.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is extensive and well-curated, offering a significant resource for biodiversity research.
- The paper is well-organized, clearly written, and includes meaningful contributions such as a data preparation pipeline.
- Evaluation across diverse datasets (balanced, unseen, and life stages) is commendable, and careful curation and partitioning of the dataset are evident.
- Experimental benchmarks are well-constructed, providing useful baselines for future research.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset lacks representation of mammals, which could limit its applicability.
- The title is misleading as it suggests multimodal data, while only images and constrained captions are included.
- The dataset may be excessively large, raising questions about the necessity of half a million images for certain species.
- Clarity issues exist regarding the filtering process and evaluation protocols, as well as inconsistencies in training epochs and statistical analyses.
- The claim that metadata is vetted by domain experts is unsubstantiated, raising concerns about the quality assurance process.
- The dataset relies on iNaturalist for image hosting, which may affect accessibility and usability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the vetting process for the dataset's metadata, providing details about the experts involved. Additionally, we suggest improving the title to accurately reflect the dataset's content by removing the term "multimodal." Consider renaming the dataset to something more representative, as "Arboretum" is misleading; alternatives like "Biosphere" or "Compendium of Nature" could be more appropriate. We recommend consolidating the description of the Arboretum-40M subset to clarify its filtering process and maximum sample limits. It would also be beneficial to provide performance metrics for Arboretum-Unseen at the genus level and to include statistical analyses over evaluation datasets. We encourage the authors to enhance the clarity of figures and tables, ensuring consistent formatting and alignment, and to address typographical errors throughout the manuscript. Lastly, we advise softening claims regarding data vetting to avoid misleading implications about the expertise involved.
