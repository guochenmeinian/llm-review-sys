### Key Points
The paper presents a domain adaptation method aimed at enhancing object detection in autonomous vehicles through unsupervised learning and dynamic frame selection. It introduces a two-stage unsupervised data acquisition process that focuses on selecting informative unlabeled frames to address class imbalance and reduce computational costs. The empirical results indicate improved performance across multiple datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths include the innovative approach to selecting informative frames, which is practical for resource-constrained environments, and the comprehensive evaluation across various datasets. However, weaknesses are evident in the clarity of the method's presentation, particularly regarding the definitions of "informative frames," "weak adaptation," and "strong adaptation." The lack of a related work section raises questions about the novelty and contribution of the proposed method. Additionally, the empirical results do not sufficiently explore generalizability across different scenarios, and the paper lacks clarity on the computational complexity and the rationale behind certain experimental setups.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We suggest providing clearer definitions for key terms such as "weak adaptation," "strong adaptation," and "rare category." An analysis of computational complexity related to the number of centroids should be included. A literature review would help contextualize the proposed method within existing works. We recommend elaborating on how the percentage of key frames is adjusted based on latency and computational resources. Furthermore, including ablation studies for hyper-parameters and clarifying the results in Tables 1-3 would enhance understanding. Lastly, improving the clarity of table captions and ensuring consistency in terminology throughout the paper would benefit the overall presentation.
