### Key Points
This paper presents a general on-chain attack transaction detection method that enhances recognition accuracy through transaction reconstruction and transaction-comment contrast tasks. The authors propose training an autoencoder to reconstruct non-offensive transaction data, identifying offensive transactions as anomalies. Additionally, contract comment embeddings are extracted to ensure consistency between reconstruction results and comments, mitigating model overfitting. The effectiveness of this method is validated through experiments demonstrating a 13% AUC improvement over state-of-the-art methods and the successful identification of over 1,700 real-world attack transactions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach requires few or no new vulnerability samples and does not depend on traditional expert-provided labels.
- The innovative pre-training framework based on TXR and TCC components contributes significantly to the field.
- The model generalizes well to detect various new vulnerabilities and has shown high effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Weaknesses:
- The TCC component's description lacks clarity, particularly regarding the selection of supervised information.
- The ablation study is insufficiently detailed, failing to explain the distinct roles of TXR and TCC modules in different learning modes.
- There is a lack of analysis regarding the sampled transaction data's rationality and completeness.
- The complexity of constructed transaction graphs and the extraction of valuable information from duplicate data are not addressed.
- The relationship between input comments and transaction graphs is poorly explained, raising questions about the necessity of comments in the detection process.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the TCC component's description, particularly how comments are selected as effective supervisory information. Additionally, the ablation study should be expanded to detail how TXR and TCC modules influence performance in supervised and semi-supervised scenarios. We suggest including an analysis of the sampled transaction data to verify its rationality and completeness, as well as discussing the complexity of transaction graphs and the filtering of valuable information from duplicate data. Furthermore, we advise placing the appendix after the references and providing more statistics about the comments used for training, such as total token counts and distribution metrics. Lastly, we encourage the authors to address the potential for misleading comments and their implications for the reliability of comment-based features.
