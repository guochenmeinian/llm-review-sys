Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel data augmentation paradigm for IoT sensing applications, introducing fine-grained control to generative models by defining a metric space with statistical metrics. The authors propose a mechanism for selecting metrics tailored to specific tasks, acknowledging the limitations of their current metric selection. Their approach enables tailored augmentation of spectrogram characteristics in the time-frequency domain, enhancing model robustness against data distribution shifts. The authors empirically validate the versatility of their method across various generative models and IoT tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional and prior generative augmentation techniques. They also discuss the potential for domain shifts between generated and real samples and introduce a filtering method to refine generated samples based on metric value boundaries.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a novel data augmentation paradigm that leverages domain-specific knowledge, showcasing originality and applicability across various IoT tasks.
2. Extensive experiments validate the proposed method's effectiveness, demonstrating high reliability and robustness in enhancing model performance.
3. The authors demonstrate a clear understanding of data efficiency in IoT tasks and provide empirical evidence supporting their approach.
4. The proposed filtering method for low-quality synthetic samples shows promise in improving model performance.
5. The organization and clarity of the paper facilitate understanding of the problem, methodology, and results, while the inclusion of statistical measures, such as mean and standard deviation of spectrogram magnitudes, adds depth to the analysis.

Weaknesses:
1. The balance between the original generative model loss and the designed metric loss is inadequately discussed, with a ratio of 10:1 suggesting marginal contribution from the metric loss.
2. The selection of metrics is limited, and the authors acknowledge the need for a broader range of metrics in future work, potentially introducing noise and requiring further analysis to justify their impact on the generative process.
3. The evaluation settings are trivial, limiting the demonstration of high-quality data generation efficacy, particularly with datasets that do not present significant complexity.
4. There is an inherent domain shift between generated and real samples, which may affect the model's performance.
5. The response lacks a detailed statistical significance analysis of performance differences between various metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on how to balance the generative model loss and the metric loss, providing deeper analysis on the implications of different weightings. Additionally, the authors should justify their choice of metrics more thoroughly and explore a wider range of options, potentially developing a custom metric set tailored to specific IoT tasks. To enhance the evaluation, we suggest testing on more complex real-world datasets to better demonstrate the method's efficacy in generating high-quality data. Furthermore, including statistical significance tests, such as paired t-tests, for performance differences would strengthen the claims made in the paper and clarify whether observed performance differences are statistically significant or due to random chance.
