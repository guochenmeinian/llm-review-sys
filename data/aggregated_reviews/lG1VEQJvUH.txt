Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents two unitary graph convolution operators, UniConv and Lie UniConv, aimed at mitigating over-smoothing in deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). UniConv is defined as \( f_{Uconv} = \exp(iAt)XU \), while Lie UniConv is expressed as \( f_{Uconv} = \exp(g_{conv})(X) \), where \( g_{conv}(X) = AXW \) and \( W \) is a skew-symmetric matrix. The authors clarify that the exponential of a real-valued antisymmetric matrix results in an orthogonal transformation. They approximate the exponential map using a truncated Taylor series to avoid eigen-decomposition. Experimental results indicate that GNNs using UniConv perform well across various datasets, while Lie UniConv excels in a toy example with long-range dependencies compared to traditional GNNs. However, the effectiveness of the Lie UniConv approach remains unclear, as it lacks comprehensive experimental validation beyond a single toy example.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with a clear introduction to the over-smoothing issue and how unitary convolutions can address it.
- The paper demonstrates strong novelty in its approach to oversmoothing and provides a solid theoretical foundation for its claims.
- Experimental results demonstrate good performance of UniConv on benchmarks, including those with long-range dependencies and heterophilic graphs.
- The authors effectively address reviewer concerns and clarify complex concepts, enhancing the manuscript's clarity.

Weaknesses:
- The rationale for why the exponential of the operator \( g_{conv} \) results in an orthogonal map is not adequately justified, and further clarification on the orthogonality of \( f_{Uconv}(X) \) is needed.
- The effectiveness of the Lie UniConv approach remains unclear due to a lack of empirical evidence comparing its performance with UniConv, particularly regarding its advantages.
- The results in Table 2 are incomplete, and comparisons with existing methods are insufficient, particularly regarding the performance of UniConv versus Lie UniConv.
- Some reviewers find the presentation and clarity of certain sections lacking, particularly in guiding the reader through key definitions and theorems.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the rationale behind the Lie UniConv approach, specifically addressing why the exponential of \( g_{conv} \) yields an orthogonal map and providing a more detailed proof of the orthogonality of \( f_{Uconv}(X) \). Additionally, we urge the authors to include more experimental results for Lie UniConv, particularly in realistic datasets, to substantiate its advantages. It would also be beneficial to include empirical comparisons of the performance and running times of Lie UniConv versus UniConv to justify the inclusion of both methods. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors report all relevant results from existing literature to ensure fair comparisons, particularly regarding the performance of UniConv against other methods. Lastly, enhancing the overall presentation and organization of the paper, especially in the experimental section, would greatly aid reader comprehension, and we encourage the authors to consider moving section 3.2 to the appendix to allow for a more focused discussion on essential results in the main text.
