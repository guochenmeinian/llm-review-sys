Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework called "Concept Space" for analyzing the learning dynamics of generative models, particularly focusing on compositional generalization. The authors propose that concept signal levels govern the rate of concept learning and influence generalization dynamics. They validate their hypotheses using a diffusion model trained on a simplified synthetic dataset, revealing that model capabilities often emerge before observable behaviors. The paper also discusses the impact of underspecification on compositional generalization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The framework of Concept Space and the notion of concept signals provide a fresh perspective on learning dynamics in generative models.
- The claim that "capability consistently emerges before behavior" is well-supported and offers novel insights into model training.
- The paper is well-structured, and the findings are clearly articulated with supportive figures.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental setup is overly simplistic, relying on a synthetic dataset with binary concept variables, which limits the applicability of the findings to more complex real-world scenarios.
- The rationale for the concept signal's formulation and its relationship to the data-generating process is unclear.
- The presentation quality of figures is poor, with low resolution and unclear labeling, making it difficult to interpret the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the relationship between the concept signal and the data-generating process, particularly in relation to equation (1). Additionally, the authors should consider conducting experiments on more complex datasets beyond the synthetic setting to validate the findings' applicability. Enhancing the quality and clarity of figures, particularly in terms of labeling and resolution, is essential for better comprehension. Finally, a more comprehensive discussion of related work on compositional generalization would strengthen the manuscript's context and relevance.
