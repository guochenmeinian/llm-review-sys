### Key Points
This paper evaluates the potential of applying ChatGPT for data augmentation (DA) in dataset construction and model performance improvement. The authors conducted experiments on five classification tasks, comparing ChatGPT's paraphrasing and zero-shot data generation against seven baseline methods. The paper identifies limitations in using ChatGPT for DA, such as challenges in generating class-specific sentences and the necessity for data reparation. While the authors conclude that GPT can lead to some improvements, they note that the overall enhancement is not significant, and the high cost of training GPT limits its suitability for DA tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper explores ChatGPT's performance on DA, an area that has not been thoroughly investigated.
- The experimental setup is reasonable and sufficiently detailed.
- The authors identify key limitations of applying DA for text classification and using ChatGPT, which can inform future research.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution is limited as the paper primarily evaluates ChatGPT's ability without providing deeper analysis.
- The conclusions may be one-sided, lacking integration with existing methods for better results.
- The analysis is shallow, requiring more detailed examination of augmented examples and stronger supporting evidence.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis by conducting a more detailed examination of the augmented examples and providing stronger evidence to support their conclusions. Additionally, please include brief explanations of the baseline algorithms such as CBERT, CBART, and CGPT in the algorithms section for clarity. We suggest discussing the performance of DA by GPT or other methods in the related work section. Furthermore, consider maintaining a consistent ratio between augmented and original data, as generating only one augmentation for larger training sizes may not yield significant benefits. Lastly, ensure that references to relevant works on EDA, CBERT, CBART, and CGPT are included.
