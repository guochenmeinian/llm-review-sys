Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents NeuPRINT, an unsupervised method that learns a dynamical model of neural activity and a time-invariant embedding of individual neurons using transformers. The authors demonstrate that the learned embedding space contains relevant information about neuron identity through a downstream transcriptomic classification task, achieving improved performance over various baseline methods. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The method effectively models the dynamical systems of individual neurons and links temporal motifs to time-invariant embeddings, representing intrinsic properties like conductance and capacitance.  
- The approach is conceptually interesting and adaptable across various architectures, leveraging transformers for more informative embeddings than traditional models.  
- The model shows impressive performance on a multi-modal dataset and utilizes all provided features effectively.

Weaknesses:  
- The method's description lacks sufficient detail for reproducibility, and the writing quality is subpar.  
- Key statistics for building $C_t$ and $S_t$ are undefined, and only pseudo-code is provided.  
- There is excessive focus on Hodgkin-Huxley equations, which do not contribute technically to the paper.  
- The distinction between losses in Section 4.2 is unclear, and Section 1.1 fails to adequately relate NeuPRINT to existing approaches.  
- The dataset used is limited to spontaneous neural activity, which may restrict the method's applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and detail of the method description to enhance reproducibility. Specifically, define the statistics used for $C_t$ and $S_t$, and provide more than just pseudo-code. We suggest minimizing the focus on Hodgkin-Huxley equations and instead linking the time-invariant neural embedding to intrinsic properties without introducing unnecessary variables. Additionally, clarify the differences between the losses in Section 4.2 and rewrite Section 1.1 to better relate NeuPRINT to existing techniques. To strengthen the analysis, consider evaluating the model's dynamics $f$ and how they compare with linear dynamical systems. Lastly, address the limitations of the dataset and explore the potential for applying the method to more complex neural dynamics associated with task engagement.
