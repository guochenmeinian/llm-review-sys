Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for localized visual commonsense reasoning that generates global, local, and dynamic descriptions. The authors propose using ChatGPT to create question-and-answer pairs based on specific image regions, filtered through a critic model, and fine-tuned on a vision-language model. The framework aims to enhance the model's ability to answer localized visual commonsense questions, achieving promising zero-shot performance across three tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively acquires localized commonsense knowledge, demonstrating an impressive engineering workload.
- The fine-tuned vision-language model shows strong zero-shot performance on localized visual reasoning tasks.
- The dataset collection method is well-designed, utilizing global, local, and QA descriptors to prompt LLMs.

Weaknesses:
- The framework lacks scientific novelty, as the method for generating localized data pairs is straightforward and resembles engineering work.
- The numerous tricks employed, such as filtering and prompt design, reduce reproducibility and robustness, complicating the pipeline.
- Limited experimental results and comparisons with other methods raise concerns about the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
- The reliance on a critic model with a low acceptability score (70%) for filtering raises questions about the quality of the generated data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of how the quality and quantity of generated data impact the final performance of the vision-language model. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include a more extensive comparison with other baselines, particularly with models like Sherlock and VisualCOMET, to clarify the advantages of the proposed method. We also suggest exploring the contribution of each descriptor (global, local, QA) in the prompting process and providing a clearer definition of knowledge-related questions. Finally, enhancing the visual recognition capacity of the critic model could improve the filtering process and increase the acceptability score.
