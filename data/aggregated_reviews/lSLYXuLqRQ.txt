Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the masked space-time hash encoding (MSTH) method for efficiently reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from multi-view or monocular videos. The authors propose a decoupled representation of static and dynamic parts of a scene, utilizing an uncertainty mask modeled by a voxel grid to enhance reconstruction quality while reducing training time. Experiments conducted on the Plenoptic Video Dataset, Google Immersive Dataset, and a self-collected dataset demonstrate that MSTH outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic NeRF methods in reconstruction quality and efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is technically solid, showcasing a novel approach that improves reconstruction quality and reduces training time.  
- The use of uncertainty to differentiate static and dynamic components is an innovative idea with strong intuitive rationale.  
- The experiments are comprehensive and effectively highlight the benefits of the proposed method.  
- Clarity in the presentation of MSTH facilitates reproducibility.

Weaknesses:  
- Some static parts in Figure 3(c) exhibit high uncertainty values, raising questions about the accuracy of the uncertainty modeling.  
- The paper lacks an in-depth discussion of the newly created dataset, which is crucial for understanding the algorithm's applicability.  
- The definition of uncertainty deviates from common interpretations, potentially confusing readers.  
- The term "dynamics of a point" is ambiguous and should be clarified.  
- Missing definitions for specific terms, such as $\tilde{m}(\cdot)$ and "large $m$," hinder comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the newly created dataset to emphasize its significance. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the definition of uncertainty to align it with common interpretations and avoid confusion. The authors should also clarify the term "dynamics of a point" to prevent misconceptions. Furthermore, we advise including definitions for terms like $\tilde{m}(\cdot)$ and "large $m$" to enhance clarity. Lastly, addressing the high uncertainty values in static parts shown in Figure 3(c) would strengthen the paper's argument.
