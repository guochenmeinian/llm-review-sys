### Key Points
This paper presents methods for approximating the resistance diameter of a graph and minimizing it by adding a fixed number of edges. The authors propose FastRD, a fast ùúñ-approximation algorithm, and define the resistance diameter minimization problem, which is NP-hard. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments validate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. The work also explores estimating the graph resistance diameter (ERD) and reducing it (RRD) through heuristic approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel algorithm, FastRD, which provides scalable solutions for large graphs.
- Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms.
- The manuscript is well-structured and clear, with a solid theoretical foundation.

Weaknesses:
- The distinction between ApproxER and ApproxRD is unclear.
- The experiments could be improved, particularly regarding the error threshold for GEER and the comparison of baseline methods.
- The reliance on existing methods may diminish the technical novelty of the work.
- The performance on real datasets raises concerns about practical reliability, as relative errors increase with graph size.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the differences between ApproxER and ApproxRD to avoid confusion. Additionally, please improve the experiments by addressing how the error threshold is set for GEER and including comparisons of the running times of baseline methods for minimizing resistance diameter. We also suggest providing more background information on the significance of resistance diameter and its applications to enhance reader understanding. Furthermore, consider discussing the generalizability of the methods to other graph metrics and their performance on dynamic or streaming graphs.
