Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a pruning-based defense method against backdoor attacks in federated learning (FL) by isolating model updates within a restricted subspace for each client. This approach aims to mitigate the "poison-coupling" effect, which complicates the identification of malicious updates. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method through empirical evaluations against state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, showing improved communication efficiency and reduced model complexity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The use of model pruning techniques to detect and defend against backdoor attacks is innovative.
- The concept of "poison-coupling" is a valuable contribution to the field.
- Comprehensive evaluation against multiple SOTA baselines enhances the credibility of the findings.

Weaknesses:
- Some design assumptions and intuitions require further clarification, particularly regarding defenses against adaptive attacks and the rationale behind "consensus fusion."
- The evaluation could be expanded to include more non-IID scenarios and additional datasets, such as NLP datasets.
- The paper lacks discussion on related work and theoretical aspects of the proposed defense, which raises questions about its long-term security guarantees.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of design assumptions, particularly regarding how to defend against malicious clients faking masks and launching adaptive attacks. Additionally, the intuition behind "consensus fusion" should be elaborated and verified, especially in non-IID contexts. We suggest enhancing the theoretical analysis to provide a deeper understanding of the method's effectiveness. Furthermore, the evaluation should include more diverse scenarios and datasets to strengthen the results. Lastly, addressing minor writing issues and ensuring alignment in classification categories will improve the overall presentation of the paper.
