### Key Points
This paper presents MILEAGE, a framework for evaluating hypergraph expansion methods by quantifying information loss. The authors propose a method that reconstructs the original hypergraph from a vector representation of the expanded graph and measures dissimilarity to assess expansion quality. The research is significant due to its implications for downstream tasks like node classification and hyperedge prediction. The framework identifies three types of information loss: non-recoverability, tie-weakening, and multi-cloning, and demonstrates a strong negative correlation between the MILEAGE score and downstream accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- MILEAGE introduces a novel approach to evaluate hypergraph expansion methods.
- The framework provides a measurable way to assess information loss.
- The paper is well-written and organized, with a clear structure and logical flow.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a detailed discussion on the advantages of the MILEAGE framework and its direct correlation with downstream task performance.
- There is insufficient analysis on the limitations of the framework, particularly regarding the reconstruction of hypergraphs.
- The evaluation could benefit from additional comparisons with other hypergraph expansion evaluation methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors elaborate on their method for reconstructing the hypergraph to enhance the paperâ€™s self-sufficiency. Additionally, incorporating and analyzing the performance of contemporary deep learning models for downstream tasks could provide further insights. In Tables 4 and 5, ranking the results starting with the best might more clearly highlight MILEAGE as a reliable predictor of accuracy. Furthermore, we suggest exploring ways to approximate or speed up parts of MILEAGE for scalability, especially for large hypergraphs.
