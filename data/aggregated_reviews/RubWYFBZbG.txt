### Key Points
This paper presents a new intersectional fairness definition called $\alpha$-Intersectional Fairness, addressing the "leveling down" issue in existing fairness measurements. The authors demonstrate the necessity of their proposed definition through rigorous empirical analysis and comparisons with differential fairness. They benchmark multiple popular in-processing fair machine learning approaches, revealing that previous methods did not improve according to this new metric.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with a clear structure and rigorous explanation of the proposed measurement.
- It effectively demonstrates the harmful impact of the leveling down issue, providing compelling motivation for the new definition.
- The comparison with differential fairness is thorough, and the experiments are comprehensive.

Weaknesses:
- The method for adding sensitive axes is unclear, raising questions about the selection process.
- The introduction of the hyper-parameter $\alpha$ lacks guidance on how to choose it, and there is insufficient evidence showing how $\alpha$-IF improves model performance.
- Result visualization, particularly in Table 1, is difficult to interpret, suggesting a need for improved graphical representation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method for adding sensitive axes and provide a concrete guideline for choosing the hyper-parameter $\alpha$ in the evaluation of intersectional fairness. Additionally, enhancing the visualization of results, possibly through bar charts, would help highlight differences between the best-offs and worst-offs. Including an NLP task in the evaluation is also suggested to broaden the applicability of the findings.
