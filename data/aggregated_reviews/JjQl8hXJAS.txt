### Key Points
This paper presents a mathematical proof demonstrating that transferring an "exploration strategy" in sim2real scenarios results in an exponential improvement in the samples needed to learn the real task compared to transferring a learned policy. The authors propose a method where exploratory policies are learned in the simulator and then transferred, aiming to enhance efficiency in real-world exploration, particularly in low-rank MDP settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The theoretical results confirm and substantiate the idea of biasing exploration, which has been informally explored in the literature.
- The authors provide a practical and comprehensible exploration method that significantly outperforms a simple policy transfer method in a complex sim2real robotic evaluation.
- The topic is timely and relevant, aligning well with current efforts to apply reinforcement learning to novel practical domains.

Weaknesses:
- The introduction of a new basic "sim2real" formalization is questionable, as it is equivalent to Multi-Fidelity MDPs, which were not cited. This suggests a lack of engagement with existing literature.
- The experimental evaluation lacks baselines from previous works, limiting the robustness of the findings.
- The assumption of one-shot transfer neglects the potential for iterative learning and adaptation between the simulator and the real world, presenting an incomplete view of the transfer process.
- The method relies on several assumptions that may not hold in all real-world scenarios, and its generality to a wider range of RL tasks remains unproven.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by rewriting it to describe the problem as an MF-MDP for standardization and ensuring that relevant literature is cited. Additionally, incorporating comparisons with established baselines from previous research would strengthen the experimental evaluation. The authors should also consider addressing the limitations of the one-shot transfer assumption by exploring iterative learning processes. Finally, providing clearer definitions for key terms and concepts, such as Low-Rank MDP and the parameters used in their theoretical framework, would enhance comprehensibility and rigor.
