Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method, Radar dEtection TRansformer (RETR), for indoor object detection and segmentation using multi-view radar heatmaps. RETR builds upon the DETR framework, incorporating modifications tailored for radar perception, such as depth-prioritized feature similarity via TPE, a trip-plane loss, and a learnable radar-to-camera transformation. The authors validate RETR's effectiveness through experiments on two datasets, demonstrating its potential for privacy-aware indoor sensing and monitoring.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The use of multi-view radar heatmaps for indoor human perception has significant applications in privacy-aware sensing.
2. RETR establishes a new baseline for radar-based human detection and segmentation, with an interesting proposal for tunable positional embedding.
3. The experiments are comprehensive, covering two tasks with adequate hyperparameter and implementation details, serving as a good reference for future work.

Weaknesses:
1. The choice of radar antenna arrays is questionable, as most commercial radars utilize 2D virtual arrays. The explanation of multi-view radar heatmap generation does not align with standard practices, necessitating clarification on the radar types used in the dataset.
2. The experiments lack comparisons with radar point cloud-based and camera-based methods, limiting the completeness of the evaluation. The related work survey is also insufficient, omitting recent radar-based detection studies relevant to autonomous driving.
3. The impact of the Top-K feature selection on network performance is unclear, and there is no ablation study to validate the choice of K.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of why radar heatmaps are preferred for challenging perception tasks and clarify the radar antenna configurations used. Incorporating comparisons with radar point cloud-based and camera-based methods would provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Additionally, we suggest conducting an ablation study to explore the effectiveness of the Top-K feature selection and reporting the computational cost of the proposed RETR model. Further discussion on the challenges and benefits of applying transformers for indoor segmentation, as well as a detailed description of the Top-K selector design, would enhance the paper's clarity and depth.
