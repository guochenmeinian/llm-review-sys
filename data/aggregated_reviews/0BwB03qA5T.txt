Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Gaussian process probes (GGP), a probabilistic method for evaluating uncertainty in binary classification tasks using a pre-trained feature extractor. The authors propose using Gaussian processes (GP) instead of linear probes to estimate aleatory and epistemic uncertainties. The performance of GGP is validated through experiments on synthetic and real images, demonstrating its capability to estimate uncertainty effectively.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The formulation of GGP provides a novel approach to evaluating uncertainty in linear probe problems.
2. The paper is well-written, with illustrative figures that enhance understanding of key concepts.
3. The derivation of the GP model and uncertainty estimation is solid.

Weaknesses:
1. Experimental results, particularly in Fig 5, appear inconsistent, especially regarding the LPE results, which do not align with expectations given the noise conditions.
2. The paper lacks explicit explanations for multiclass cases, and the claim of straightforward extension is not substantiated with experiments.
3. Some technical descriptions are unclear, leading to confusion about specific terms and procedures.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental results, particularly addressing the discrepancies observed in Fig 5 regarding LPE. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed discussion on multiclass scenarios, including experiments to support their claims. We also suggest refining technical descriptions to eliminate ambiguities, particularly regarding the kernel definitions and training procedures. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to enhance the overall writing quality, especially in the introduction and experimental sections, to improve readability and comprehension.
