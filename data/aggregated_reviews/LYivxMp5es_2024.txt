Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into intervention planning for disseminating accurate information within dynamic opinion networks. The authors propose a novel ranking algorithm to identify influential nodes and develop a reinforcement learning (RL)-based dynamic planning framework. The framework is tested on networks governed by two propagation models, enhancing its applicability. The performance is demonstrated through simulations on synthetic networks, revealing the method's potential to control misinformation spread.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The manuscript is well-written and engaging, addressing a significant issue of misinformation in social networks.
- The analysis of the proposed methods is thorough, providing insights into their effectiveness under various conditions.
- The introduction of a novel ranking algorithm and an RL-based framework offers a robust approach to intervention planning.

Weaknesses:
- The limited size of networks analyzed in the simulations raises concerns about the scalability and real-world applicability of the proposed methods.
- The methodologies appear to be incremental improvements rather than groundbreaking innovations, lacking sufficient comparison with state-of-the-art techniques.
- The computational feasibility of the proposed ranking algorithm, described as a brute force search, is questionable.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the scalability analysis by increasing the network size beyond 50 nodes and providing detailed statistics of the graphs, such as the number of edges and graph diameter. Additionally, the authors should clarify how “exerting control” is defined in the context of their work and consider including real-world networks in their evaluations. A comparison with state-of-the-art methods is essential to assess the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Furthermore, the authors should provide an analysis of the time complexity of their method and address how varying the number of states affects inference results. Lastly, we suggest a thorough proofreading to correct any typographical errors and clarify the calculations related to infection rates in the figures.
