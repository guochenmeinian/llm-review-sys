### Key Points
This paper presents ARIA, an automatic task-specific logic rules-distilling framework that utilizes a large language model (LM) to generate high-quality rules for labeling relations in relation extraction tasks. The authors argue that traditional supervised and distant supervision methods are inadequate in low-resource settings, advocating for logic rules as a more explainable alternative. ARIA learns from seed data to annotate unlabeled data, which is then used to enhance a relation extraction classifier. The framework includes a reasoning rule generator, a compound rule compiler, and a relation extractor, demonstrating effectiveness on SemEval and TACRED datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem statement is well-motivated, and the ARIA framework is ingeniously described.
- The approach yields improved state-of-the-art results on SemEval and TACRED datasets, supported by meaningful qualitative and quantitative analysis.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity, making it difficult to follow; several sections require additional information for better comprehension.
- Specific modules within ARIA are introduced without adequate motivation, leading to confusion regarding their relevance and necessity.
- The paper does not adequately address key methods for low-resource relation extraction, missing several relevant baselines and citations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing more detailed explanations of the methodology, particularly regarding the instantiation of compound rules and the rationale for using a GAT in data selection. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with other key methods for low-resource relation extraction, such as prompt-based and indirect supervision methods. It would also be beneficial to conduct statistical significance testing on the results to strengthen the findings. Finally, addressing the missing references and semi-supervised baselines would enhance the paper's comprehensiveness.
