Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for learning to de-corrupt datapoints for generative modeling, proposing a sampling method that applies iterative updates, significantly outperforming a naive sampling algorithm. The authors introduce a generalized forward diffusion process and a novel Transformation Agnostic Cold Sampling (TACoS) process for image generation. They demonstrate that TACoS can effectively handle various corruption processes, although the performance in terms of sample quality is a concern.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper extends the concept of generative modeling from corrupting data and learning to reconstruct it, appealing to many researchers in the field.
- The proposed sampling algorithm shows promise in generating new data through iterative updates, which is crucial for the method's effectiveness.
- The clarity of presentation and the novelty of applying diffusion processes to arbitrary image-to-image translations are commendable.

Weaknesses:
- The initial performance of the method is inadequate regarding sample quality, raising concerns about its fundamental limitations.
- Issues arise when the deterministic corruption transformation is not 1-1, leading to reduced diversity in generated samples.
- The lack of rigorous theoretical analysis and the unclear practical value of the proposed algorithm limit its impact.
- The generated samples exhibit low diversity and quality, particularly in comparison to established generative models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the performance of their method by addressing the fundamental limitations related to sample quality and diversity. A thorough investigation into the diversity of samples is necessary, especially given the issues with deterministic corruption transformations. We suggest including rigorous theoretical analysis to bolster the empirical findings and discussing the connections to flow matching methods, particularly in the context of similar corruption processes. Additionally, clarifying the introduction of sections on deblurring and inpainting would enhance the coherence of the paper. Lastly, including baseline values in the sample generation experiments would provide a clearer context for evaluating the proposed method's performance.
