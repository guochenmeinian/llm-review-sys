Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach called **GLinSAT** for enforcing general linear and bounded constraints on neural network outputs through a differentiable method. The authors leverage entropy-regularized linear programming, transforming it into an unconstrained convex optimization problem that is efficiently solvable on GPUs using accelerated gradient descent. Experimental results demonstrate GLinSAT's effectiveness across various constrained decision-making applications, showing improved efficiency in GPU memory usage and running time compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses the significant challenge of imposing general linear constraints on neural network outputs in a differentiable manner, which is crucial for complex decision-making tasks.
- The transformation of the problem into an unconstrained optimization problem enhances both differentiability and computational efficiency, as evidenced by the experimental results.
- The diverse set of applications tested, including the traveling salesman problem and portfolio allocation, showcases the method's versatility and effectiveness in constraint satisfaction.

Weaknesses:
- GLinSAT's inference time is longer than LinSAT when using its default 100 iterations, which should be discussed with practical tips for method selection.
- The motivation for using a dot product in the objective function is unclear, and further clarification on its advantages and scenarios where it is beneficial would enhance understanding.
- The authors do not adequately discuss how integer constraints are satisfied in the context of the numerical experiments, particularly given that some tasks involve optimization over integer variables.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion section to include practical tips for choosing between GLinSAT and LinSAT, particularly regarding inference time. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the rationale behind the choice of a dot product in the objective function and its implications for the method's performance. A more extensive literature review on neural network feasibility over linear constraints would also strengthen the paper. Finally, the authors should provide detailed information on the problem sizes used in experiments and explain how GLinSAT is applied to discrete problems, ensuring that the feasibility of GLinSAT is clearly addressed in the context of integer constraints.
