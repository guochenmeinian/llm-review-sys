Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical comparison of the Rubin causal model (RCM) and the structural causal model (SCM) frameworks, focusing on their logical connections through the concept of *representability*. The authors demonstrate that any RCM can be represented by an SCM, and they model assumptions for causal inference applicable to both frameworks. The paper emphasizes the relationship between RCMs and SCMs without favoring one over the other.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper contributes significantly to the theoretical understanding of RCMs and SCMs by comparing them at a fundamental level.
2. The examples provided are helpful for comprehension, although further elaboration is needed.
3. The writing is clear and concise, utilizing neutral language that avoids bias towards either framework.
4. The results offer valuable insights into the mathematical foundations of causal frameworks.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper would benefit from additional examples and clarifications to enhance understanding, potentially in an appendix.
2. Certain notations are inadequately explained, leading to confusion in some sections.
3. The findings regarding the relationship between RCMs and SCMs may not be surprising, although the theoretical framework remains useful.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of notation throughout the paper, particularly in sections where terms like "SUTVA," $B$, and the inverse of a projection are introduced. Additionally, we suggest including more straightforward examples, akin to Example 1, to illustrate key concepts and intuitions. A longer journal version could provide a more comprehensive discussion of the implications of their findings, particularly regarding the connection to single world intervention graphs (SWIGs) and the broader context of causal inference literature.
