Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on fair clustering from a novel perspective, focusing on the Pareto front of clustering solutions, which includes all solutions that are not dominated by others in terms of clustering cost or fairness value. The authors define necessary characteristics of fairness notions their framework can capture and provide a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm for the assignment version of the problem, which runs in exponential time. They also demonstrate how to combine any approximation algorithm for the vanilla clustering problem with their DP algorithm to approximate the Pareto front. Notably, they show that for a specific fairness notion, the Pareto front can be computed efficiently.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The new perspective on fair clustering is interesting and contributes to the literature.
- The theoretical results are solid and supported by experimental evaluations.
- The presentation of the paper is clear and well-structured.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks motivation regarding the practical applications of the Pareto front in fair clustering.
- The main results are not practical due to their runtime.
- The framework does not seem to capture individual fairness notions.
- The definitions of fairness notions may not be sufficiently general, and the authors should clarify their applicability to other popular definitions in the literature.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for the relevance of the Pareto front in real-life applications of fair clustering. Additionally, the authors should address the practicality of their main results and explore ways to enhance runtime efficiency. It would be beneficial to expand the framework to capture individual fairness notions and provide a more comprehensive discussion on the generality of their fairness definitions, including how they relate to other established notions in the literature. Lastly, consider using more recent datasets for experiments to avoid issues with the Adult dataset.
