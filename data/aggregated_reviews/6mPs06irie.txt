### Key Points
This paper presents GlobalBench, a multilingual benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of NLP systems across various languages and tasks. GlobalBench is characterized by its ever-expanding nature, multi-faceted evaluation criteria—including automatic metrics, utility, and equity—and its ambition to encompass all datasets. The authors propose that this benchmark can highlight performance disparities among languages and tasks, ultimately serving as a valuable resource for underserved languages in the NLP community.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- GlobalBench evaluates not only automatic metrics but also the utility and equity of datasets, addressing the needs of marginalized languages.
- The initiative encourages community collaboration for dataset contributions, potentially improving inclusivity in language technology.
- The design choices, particularly the integration of utility and equity metrics, are novel and well-articulated.

Weaknesses:
- The technical contribution is limited, with concerns about the reliance on automatic evaluation metrics that may not reflect real user satisfaction.
- The analysis is based on a single snapshot of the benchmark, leading to findings that may not be particularly novel or insightful.
- There is a lack of clarity regarding the definitions of utility and equity, particularly in relation to dataset size and quality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how utility and equity metrics are defined and measured, particularly in relation to the size and quality of datasets. Additionally, addressing the potential for bad actors in an incentive-based platform is crucial for maintaining the reliability of the benchmark. We suggest that the authors provide a more intuitive presentation of figures and tables, ensuring they are placed closer to their references in the text. Lastly, we encourage the authors to consider the implications of their definitions of language, particularly regarding dialects and varieties, to avoid excluding certain communities.
