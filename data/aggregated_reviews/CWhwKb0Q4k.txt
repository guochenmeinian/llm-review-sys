Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a quantum version of Deep Equilibrium Models (QDEQ) aimed at enhancing the performance of parameterized quantum circuits (PQC) while addressing circuit depth and parameter scalability issues. The authors demonstrate QDEQ's effectiveness on classification tasks using MNIST-4, MNIST-10, and FashionMNIST-10 datasets, showing competitive performance compared to existing baseline models while requiring fewer resources. The technique is compared against direct solvers and baseline algorithms (VAE and PCA), with the proposed scheme consistently outperforming direct solvers but only occasionally surpassing baseline algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The introduction of Deep Equilibrium Models to quantum machine learning is a novel approach that has not been previously explored.  
- The paper effectively demonstrates that high performance can be achieved with significantly shallower quantum circuits, which is crucial for near-term quantum devices.  
- The theoretical framework is detailed and solid, and the presentation is clear, balancing equations and explanations well.  
- The empirical evidence supports the practical applicability of QDEQ models, showcasing resource efficiency.

Weaknesses:  
- All datasets used are classical, raising questions about the necessity of quantum circuits for such data.  
- The analysis of results is relatively weak, with only a modest accuracy improvement at the cost of increased processing time and memory requirements.  
- The effectiveness of QDEQ depends on the assumption that quantum models admit fixed points, which may not hold in practice.  
- Empirical validation is limited to a few datasets, and additional baselines could strengthen the results.  
- The code is not publicly available, which hinders reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of results to better justify the proposed model's utility, especially considering the overhead in processing time and memory. It would be beneficial to explore quantum datasets to assess potential advantages in their analysis. Additionally, we suggest including more baselines in the experiments to enhance validation. Finally, we encourage the authors to make the code publicly available sooner to facilitate reproducibility and further research.
