Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel two-stage method called SampDetox to defend against backdoor threats in third-party Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) applications. The authors propose using diffusion models to introduce noise into samples, effectively destroying backdoors and recovering clean samples. The method strategically combines lightweight and high noise to handle varying visibility and robustness of backdoor attacks. The paper includes mathematical proofs supporting SampDetox's effectiveness and comprehensive experiments demonstrating its superiority over existing defense methods across various datasets and models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. **Innovative Defense Mechanism**: SampDetox introduces a significant two-stage approach for black-box backdoor defense.
2. **Theoretical Foundation**: The paper provides solid mathematical proofs validating the method's effectiveness.
3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Extensive testing against state-of-the-art backdoor attacks showcases the method's reliability.
4. **Thorough Analysis**: Ablation studies offer insights into the impact of different stages and parameters of SampDetox.

Weaknesses:
1. **Dependency on Pre-trained Models**: The effectiveness of SampDetox relies on the quality of pre-trained diffusion models, which may limit real-world applicability.
2. **Trigger Recovery Assumption**: The assumption that clean regions in poisoned samples can be easily restored may not hold against sophisticated attacks.
3. **Omission of Experimental Details**: Critical experimental details regarding baseline defense methods and specific configurations are lacking.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental details, particularly regarding baseline defense methods and the configurations used for the diffusion models. Additionally, the authors should address the limitations associated with the dependency on pre-trained diffusion models by exploring the robustness of SampDetox with models trained on varied datasets. It would also be beneficial to provide specific performance metrics for SampDetox when augmented with DDIM to substantiate claims of comparable inference times. Lastly, we suggest including evaluations against more complex backdoor attacks that utilize semantic features to enhance the robustness of the findings.
