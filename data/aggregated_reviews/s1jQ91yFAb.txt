Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a PAC-Bayesian risk bound for structured prediction, assuming data is generated by the Knothe-Rosenblatt rearrangement of a factorizing reference measure. The authors derive generalization bounds using a Wasserstein dependency matrix, which allows for improved risk certification in generative models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The method is novel, utilizing triangular measure transport and KR rearrangement, enabling flexible distillation of random output variables.  
2. The bounded set of bad inputs enhances risk certification.  
3. The approach has potential applications for computing risk certificates in various downstream discriminative tasks.  
4. The paper provides a rigorous theoretical analysis and detailed comparisons to existing work, aiding reader comprehension.

Weaknesses:  
1. The assumption that samples are drawn from a distribution via KR rearrangement raises concerns; empirical validation through toy experiments with popular generative models is needed.  
2. The discussion on existing work lacks clarity, particularly regarding the necessity of Markov random fields in prior PAC-Bayesian bounds.  
3. The absence of theoretical examples, simulations, or real-world experiments limits the demonstration of the proposed framework's superiority.  
4. The paper's clarity suffers; more detailed explanations of technical notions and definitions are necessary for reader understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the discussion on existing work, specifically addressing the role of Markov random fields in prior PAC-Bayesian bounds. Additionally, the authors should consider including empirical results or theoretical examples to validate their claims and demonstrate the practical implications of their findings. More detailed explanations of technical terms and concepts, particularly those that confuse readers, should be incorporated to enhance comprehension.
