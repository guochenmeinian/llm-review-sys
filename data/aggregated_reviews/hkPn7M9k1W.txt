Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study of dynamic sparse training (DST) methods, analyzing various pruning criteria and their effects across different models and settings. The authors find that, under stable hyperparameter configurations, most pruning methods yield similar performance, with magnitude-based pruning outperforming more complex methods in ultra-sparse scenarios. The study also investigates the influence of topology update frequency on pruning effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents key research questions supported by extensive experiments.
- It is the first systematic study combining various pruning and growing strategies in DST, providing valuable insights into their interplay.

Weaknesses:
- The primary concern is the lack of novelty, as the findings largely confirm existing knowledge, particularly regarding the superiority of magnitude-based pruning in high sparsity.
- The scope is limited to mostly image classification tasks, with a need for broader model coverage, including mid-to-large-scale architectures and diverse datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their work by extending the study to mid-to-large-scale models and incorporating a wider variety of datasets, including text data. Additionally, analyzing the growth trajectory and connections that remain pruned or are consistently removed across different strategies would enhance the paper's contribution. To improve clarity, we suggest presenting important hyperparameters, such as prune and growth ratios, in tabular format within the main draft. Furthermore, addressing the potential influence of batch size on pruning effectiveness and clarifying the claims regarding the comparative study of pruning and growth methods would strengthen the analysis. Lastly, consider adjusting the title to reflect the empirical nature of the study more accurately.
