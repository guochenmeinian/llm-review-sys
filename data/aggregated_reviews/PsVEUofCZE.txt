### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework named MoDiCF, which addresses the challenges of data incompleteness and visibility bias in multimodal recommendation systems through a modality-diffused data completion module and a counterfactual multimodal recommendation module. The authors introduce fairness evaluation metrics and incorporate both accuracy and fairness into experimental evaluations. The overall structure is clear, with comprehensive experiments and well-analyzed baseline comparisons, demonstrating strong originality in studying data incompleteness and fairness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The writing is clear and the related work is adequately covered.
- The proposed model aligns well with the identified challenges and motivations.
- Comprehensive baselines and experiments are presented, supported by visually appealing charts and figures.

Weaknesses:
- The conclusion regarding "the prioritization of items’ multimodal data over user preference alignment" lacks detailed exploration.
- The rationale behind the fairness evaluation metrics is inadequately explained.
- Some technical elements, such as the mathematical notations in Section 4.2, are overly complex and could benefit from simplification or additional examples.
- The observed large differences in counterfactual coefficient values between datasets are not sufficiently analyzed.
- The proposed fairness metric in Section 5.2.2 appears inappropriate, focusing solely on predicted scores rather than discrepancies in accuracy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the exploration and discussion surrounding the conclusion on "the prioritization of items’ multimodal data over user preference alignment." Additionally, further elaboration is needed in Section 4.2.2 to clarify the connection with Equations 9 and 10. We suggest simplifying the mathematical notations in Section 4.2 or providing illustrative examples to enhance readability. The authors should also analyze the discrepancies in counterfactual coefficient values between datasets more thoroughly. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to reconsider the appropriateness of the new fairness metric proposed in Section 5.2.2, ensuring it reflects the model's treatment of different groups equitably. Lastly, clarifying the baseline performance discrepancies and the complexity of adapting the proposed method to new datasets would strengthen the paper.
