### Key Points
This paper presents the concept of calibrated forecasts in repeated Stackelberg games (SG) and introduces two key ideas: calibrated Stackelberg games (CSG) and adaptive calibrated forecasts. The authors propose a principal's learning algorithm that converges the average utility of the principal to the Stackelberg value and a forecasting algorithm that enables agents to perform calibrated forecasts of the principal's actions. The work demonstrates that even in continuous Stackelberg games, the principal's learning algorithm can achieve the best possible average utility.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The notion of calibrated forecast is well-founded, generalizing the original definition through a binning function that aids in determining agents' best responses. The proposed forecasting algorithms successfully meet adaptive calibration conditions, and the learning algorithms for the principal achieve asymptotic optimality in average utility.

Weaknesses:  
The connection between the proposed concepts and their claimed applications, such as Stackelberg security games and strategic classification, is unclear, suggesting an artificial setting in Stackelberg games. Additionally, the results regarding optimal utility are only asymptotic, which may limit practical applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the connection between the proposed concepts and their applications, particularly in the Appendix. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors provide a detailed description of the binning formula and its significance in the main article, as it is currently only mentioned in the Appendix. Additionally, addressing the implications of the principal needing to know the calibration rate and clarifying the role of adaptivity in achieving Stackelberg properties would enhance the manuscript. Finally, we encourage the authors to refine the presentation, particularly in Section 3, to alleviate notational complexity and improve overall readability.
