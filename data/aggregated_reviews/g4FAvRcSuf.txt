### Key Points
This paper presents a method for generating self-supervised trajectories to train a decision-transformer style agent for text-based games. The authors propose an iterative expansion technique for creating training data, utilizing a path crawler to explore short paths, which are then grouped and evaluated by training small T5-style agents. Experiments demonstrate that this self-supervised method outperforms a DRRN baseline across three games and approaches the performance of an agent trained on gold trajectories. The method is intuitive and potentially applicable to more complex game settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The method is simple, intuitive, and shows solid empirical results across all three games.  
- The writing is clear and easy to follow, enhancing the paper's accessibility.  
- The proposed technique is generalizable with appropriate modifications.

Weaknesses:  
- The comparison in Table 1 is limited, as the self-supervised method is only evaluated against an oracle and two baselines that are not directly comparable.  
- The generalization of the method may be poor, as it heavily relies on specific game forms and grouping heuristics.  
- The description of the method lacks clarity and formal rigor, making it difficult for readers to adapt it to their contexts.  
- Important baselines, particularly regarding GPT-4, are inadequately evaluated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison in Table 1 by including a baseline that ablates the effect of the data creation using the iterative method, such as a random path crawler generating an equal number of synthetic paths. Additionally, clarifying the method's description and formalizing it would enhance understanding. The authors should also evaluate recent prompting techniques for GPT-4 to ensure a proper baseline comparison. Finally, addressing the potential sacrifice of diversity in trajectory selection through experiments varying group sizes would be beneficial.
