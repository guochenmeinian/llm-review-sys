Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a single-pass semi-streaming algorithm for correlation clustering, achieving a $(3+\epsilon)$-approximation using $O(n/\epsilon)$ words of memory. This improvement is notable compared to previous algorithms that provided a 5-approximation with $O(n)$ words and a $(3+\epsilon)$-approximation with $O(n \log n)$ words. The algorithm is a variant of the PIVOT algorithm, utilizing a random ranking of vertices and retaining a list of $k=O(1/\epsilon)$ highest-ranked neighbors during the streaming phase.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper enhances space efficiency for a significant problem in correlation clustering.  
- The algorithm is simple and the presentation is clear, with all proofs fitting within six pages.  
- The analysis is elegant and simpler than previous works, contributing to the literature on adapting the PIVOT algorithm to various computational models.  

Weaknesses:  
- The improvement over prior results appears marginal, reducing the approximation factor or space per vertex only slightly.  
- There is a lack of empirical evaluation comparing the algorithm's clustering output with prior works, which could strengthen the contribution.  
- Some minor writing issues and terminological confusion regarding "singleton" clusters were noted.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including experimental results to compare the quality of clustering output from their algorithm against prior works. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the terminology used for "singleton" clusters to avoid confusion and providing more background on how their algorithm compares to existing methods in the semi-streaming setting. Furthermore, addressing minor writing issues, such as the definition of $U_t$ and the clarity of certain equations, would enhance the overall presentation.
