### Key Points
This paper presents the Adaptive Neighborhood Enhancement Layer (ANEL), a novel, model-agnostic module aimed at addressing fact sparsity in Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs). The authors conduct rigorous experimentation across four benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of ANEL through comprehensive analyses, including ablation and sensitivity studies. The integration of latent neighborhood mining and adaptive information adjustment offers a fresh approach to enhancing sparse entity representations. However, the performance improvements are sometimes modest, and the integration with only two base models limits the scope of the findings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Innovative solution to the sparsity problem in TKGs.
- Thorough experimentation and validation, showcasing improvements in metrics like MRR and Hits@10.
- Clear articulation of contributions and systematic evaluation.
- The adaptive mechanism in ANEL effectively handles entities with varying degrees of sparsity.

Weaknesses:
- Limited integration with only two base models, restricting broader applicability.
- The complexity of some concepts and equations may hinder accessibility for a wider audience.
- Performance improvements are modest, raising questions about the limitations of enhancement.
- Certain technical sections oversimplify complex relationships in TKGs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for ANEL's relevance specifically to temporal KG completion, as well as the definition of key terms such as "latent neighbor information." Additionally, we suggest that the authors explore the interactions between ANEL components in the ablation study and clarify the implications of the increased complexity introduced by ANEL, including the number of parameters and training time. It would be beneficial to conduct statistical significance tests to support claims of performance improvements. Finally, we encourage the authors to enhance the integration of ANEL with more recent baselines and to provide a more detailed discussion of the results to better convey the model's impact on the tasks presented.
