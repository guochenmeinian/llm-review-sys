Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on multi-view clustering, specifically addressing the view cooperation issue by treating deep multi-view clustering (DMVC) as an unsupervised cooperative game. The authors propose a novel Shapley-based Cooperation Enhancing Multi-view Clustering (SCE-MVC) method, which evaluates view contributions using cooperative game theory. The paper is well-organized, and the experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper introduces a novel perspective by framing multi-view collaboration as a cooperative game, which is both innovative and well-founded.  
2. The experiments are comprehensive and convincingly validate the proposed method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:  
1. Figure 2 lacks clarity regarding the structure of the View Cooperation Enhancing Module.  
2. The abundance of formulas and symbols necessitates the addition of a notation table for better understanding.  
3. The explanation of the Shapley Value in model (1) is insufficient, and many variables remain inadequately defined.  
4. The marginal improvement of the SCE module in alignment-based frameworks raises questions about its effectiveness.  
5. The classification criteria for DMVC methods are unclear, and the representation of joint methods is limited.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Figure 2 to better illustrate the View Cooperation Enhancing Module's structure. Additionally, we suggest adding a notation table to define the numerous formulas and symbols used throughout the paper. To enhance understanding, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the Shapley Value and clarify all variables in model (1). Furthermore, the authors should address the implications of the SCE module's performance in alignment-based frameworks and clarify the criteria used for classifying DMVC methods.
