Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an optimal asymmetric graph structure for the label inference phase in graph-based semi-supervised learning (GSSL), emphasizing the distinct roles of labeled and unlabeled nodes. The authors propose an efficient block-wise graph learning algorithm with a global convergence guarantee, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art (SOTA) graph construction methods through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. The work addresses the critical challenge of high-quality graph construction, which significantly impacts label prediction performance, and offers theoretical motivations and benefits, including enhanced robustness to noisy node features.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is of high quality, featuring rigorous theoretical motivations and comprehensive experiments, including a detailed implementation of the block-wise graph learning algorithm (BAGL) and a thorough convergence analysis.
- The structure is well-organized and clear, with logical progression and accessible explanations of complex concepts, although some appendix content could be moved to the main body for better context.
- The work makes significant contributions to GSSL by focusing on the often-neglected graph construction step, achieving a SOTA global convergence rate.

Weaknesses:
- The background knowledge on the unified label inference framework needs elaboration, particularly details behind Eq.(1), which should be included in the main body.
- There is a lack of discussion or comparison with recent graph structure learning methods.
- The conclusion is brief and could benefit from additional future work insights.
- The experimental results in Table 2 show only marginal improvements over baselines.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the background context by elaborating on the unified label inference framework and integrating relevant appendix content into the main body. Additionally, consider discussing recent state-of-the-art methods in graph structure learning for a more comprehensive evaluation. The authors should also expand the conclusion to include more future work directions. Furthermore, we suggest providing a detailed discussion on the computational complexity of the proposed method and its implications for large-scale datasets, as well as examples of potential real-world applications. Lastly, addressing the limitations of the proposed method and how they plan to tackle these in future work would enhance the paper's depth.
