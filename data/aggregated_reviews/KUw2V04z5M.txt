Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Open-Corpus Multi-Object Tracking (OCMOT), an extension of open-vocabulary multi-object tracking (OVMOT) that identifies, tracks, and recognizes a wide range of known and unknown object categories without a predefined list. The authors develop OCTrackB, a comprehensive benchmark for OCMOT, which includes a balanced mix of object classes to mitigate biases. They introduce a new multi-granularity recognition metric and validate OCMOT's effectiveness through extensive evaluations with state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The benchmark improves upon previous open-vocabulary MOT by requiring models to suggest categories, representing a natural progression.
2. The construction of the benchmark is principled and solid, with comprehensive and convincing baseline experiments.
3. The paper is well-written, with clear articulation of the principles guiding benchmark construction and a significantly larger dataset.

Weaknesses:
1. The reliability of the multi-granularity recognition metric (mgReA) could be quantitatively demonstrated by comparing results from the CLIP matching approach with human annotators.
2. The proposed OCTracker's performance is inferior to OVTrack, raising questions about its necessity.
3. The dataset creation process relies heavily on existing datasets without manual verification, which may limit its novelty.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the quantitative demonstration of the mgReA metric's reliability by comparing it with human annotations. Additionally, the authors should provide more detailed explanations of how to apply WordNet for multi-granularity evaluation. It would also be beneficial to discuss how OCMOT assigns labels to images from TAO and LV-VIS, as this is a critical aspect not thoroughly covered. Lastly, consider addressing the limitations of relying on existing datasets and the implications of using a balanced dataset in real-world scenarios.
