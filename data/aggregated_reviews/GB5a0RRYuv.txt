Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Materials Knowledge Graph (MKG), a novel graph database for materials science that utilizes advanced NLP methods and Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract and organize extensive research into structured triples. The MKG enhances data integration and accelerates materials research by predicting material applications through algorithms. The methodology includes annotating scientific articles for training LLMs, employing various NLP techniques for entity resolution, and constructing the MKG for link prediction. The authors claim significant advancements in materials research through this approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper demonstrates a systematic methodology, ensuring a robust knowledge graph through thorough data preparation, model training, and graph construction.
2. The MKG effectively structures vast scientific literature, significantly advancing materials research.
3. The application of link prediction algorithms is a strong method for identifying new material applications.
4. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the MKG and the employed models, enhancing credibility.

Weaknesses:
1. Maintaining the MKG's currency and accuracy as materials science evolves presents a complex challenge requiring ongoing updates and curation.
2. The paper lacks sufficient experimental comparisons, particularly with non-LLM baselines and sophisticated knowledge graph completion methods.
3. Clarity issues exist in figure captions and the presence of typos and syntactic errors detracts from the overall presentation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including more experiments to compare the MKG with non-LLM baselines and sophisticated knowledge graph completion methods. Additionally, the authors should provide a detailed discussion on strategies for continuously updating and curating the MKG to ensure its relevance and accuracy. Addressing the clarity of figure captions and correcting typographical errors would also enhance the manuscript's presentation.
