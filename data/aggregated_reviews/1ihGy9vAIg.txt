Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an efficient entropy model aimed at improving the trade-off between performance and complexity in learned image compression. The authors propose a correlation loss to spatially decorrelate latents, enhancing the fit to an independent probability model. The method serves as a plug-in for existing hyperprior-based techniques, demonstrating significant performance gains, particularly in low bit-rate scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The correlation loss introduces a novel approach to decorrelating latents, which is flexible and can be integrated into various hyperprior-based methods.
2. The combination of the proposed method with the checkerboard technique yields an impressive performance gain of approximately 85% compared to the auto-regressive model, while significantly reducing inference time.

Weaknesses:
1. The results indicate that the correlation loss primarily benefits low bit-rate scenarios, with minimal or no gains at higher bit rates. This discrepancy necessitates further analysis to clarify its effectiveness across different bit rates.
2. The organization of figures and equations lacks coherence, making it difficult to follow references throughout the paper.
3. The analysis of Figure 4 is unclear; providing the input image would enhance understanding of the visualizations.
4. The claim regarding the correlation loss's efficacy in reducing latent space correlation requires more robust evidence, as current visualizations may not convincingly demonstrate this effect.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of performance gains at higher bit rates to provide a comprehensive understanding of the method's applicability. Additionally, we suggest reorganizing the figures and equations for better clarity and coherence. To enhance the analysis of Figure 4, including the input image would aid in correlating the visualizations with the original data. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to substantiate the claim regarding the correlation loss's effectiveness with more detailed evidence, possibly including comparisons with auto-regressive context models. Lastly, we advise that the authors consider reporting performance metrics on more recent efficient learned image compression methods to strengthen the evaluation.
