### Key Points
This paper presents a novel self-supervised learning method called Denoised Neighborhood Aggregation (DNA) for fine-grained category discovery from coarsely labeled data. The authors propose modeling semantic structures instead of instance-level learning to create compact cluster representations. They introduce three principles (label, reciprocal, rank constraints) to filter false neighbors, providing a theoretical analysis that shows the learning objective mimics clustering loss. The experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements on three benchmark datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an important problem in fine-grained category discovery and offers a practical solution.
- The proposed principles for filtering false neighbors are effective, as evidenced by improved neighbor accuracy and clustering metrics.
- The theoretical analysis provides good justification for the objective function, interpreted as generalized EM.
- Strong experimental results validate the effectiveness of the model across multiple datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed ideas, such as the loss function and dynamic queue, represent incremental improvements over existing methods like nearest neighbor contrastive learning.
- Additional memory is required for neighborhood retrieval, and filtering principles increase training time.
- The paper lacks sufficient details on hyper-parameter choices, which hinders sensitivity analysis.
- The experiments are limited in scope, lacking broader ablation studies and control groups for visual experiments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of term definitions, particularly regarding "compact" representations and their implications for separability. Additionally, the authors should address how to handle cases where no neighbors remain after applying the filtering principles. We suggest conducting a broader range of ablation studies across multiple datasets to enhance the generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, providing more details on hyper-parameter settings would improve transparency and allow for better analysis of model sensitivity. Lastly, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the importance of the "uniform" component in the objective function.
