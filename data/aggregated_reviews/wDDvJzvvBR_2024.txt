Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ELSA (Embeddings for Language and Spatial Audio), a model designed to learn spatially-aware audio and text embeddings through multimodal contrastive learning. The authors propose a method that synthesizes spatial audio data and augments text captions with spatial information, addressing limitations in existing audio foundation models. The model is evaluated on tasks such as audio captioning, retrieval, and localization, demonstrating its ability to capture both semantic meaning and spatial attributes of audio.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of spatial reasoning and audio representation, addressing an underexplored area.
2. The experimental setup is rigorous, with well-designed experiments validating the model's performance.
3. The paper is well-written and organized, providing clear explanations of methodology and results.
4. The findings have important implications for enhancing spatial language understanding across various applications.

Weaknesses:
1. The reliance on synthetic datasets may limit the generalizability of the findings; exploring training on in-the-wild data is recommended.
2. The interpretation experiments focus on a limited four-class classification, which may not reflect real-life scenarios; a broader range of spatial attributes should be considered.
3. The paper lacks a detailed error analysis, which would help identify common failure cases and improve the model.
4. The spatialization implementation is not adequately explained, and qualitative analysis of results is minimal.
5. The citation format is inconsistent and requires standardization.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by training the model on real-world datasets. Additionally, the authors should extend the classification experiments to include a wider range of spatial attributes, such as distance perception, using prompts like "xxx is making a sound in the distance" and "xxx is making a sound nearby." A more detailed error analysis should be included to identify common failure cases. Furthermore, the authors should provide a clearer explanation of the spatialization implementation and include qualitative analyses of results. Lastly, standardizing the citation format is essential for clarity.
