Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical framework for multi-agent debate (MAD) among large language models (LLMs), addressing the critical issue of echo chambers. The authors propose three interventions—diversity pruning, quality pruning, and refuting misconceptions—to mitigate problems such as the tyranny of the majority and shared misconceptions. The effectiveness of these interventions is demonstrated through experiments on four benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper tackles the significant issue of echo-chamber effects in multi-agent debates.
2. The authors provide a theoretical foundation with well-structured models, assumptions, and theorems that are accessible to readers.
3. Empirical results confirm the theoretical claims, showing clear improvements in system performance.

Weaknesses:
1. The theoretical foundation is underdeveloped, with some theorems appearing trivial or obvious.
2. Ambiguities exist in parameter representation and the shared latent space among LLMs.
3. The methodological approach is simplistic, failing to fully utilize the potential of a multi-LLM ensemble.
4. There is a disconnect between theory and implementation, particularly in the use of KL divergence and outdated model selection.
5. An explicit limitations section is missing, which is critical for transparency.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical foundation by ensuring that all proposed theorems provide substantial insights. Clarifying the representation of parameters, particularly θ in Assumption 4.1, is essential. We suggest enhancing the multi-agent dialogue setup to leverage the capabilities of a multi-LLM ensemble more effectively. Additionally, the authors should address the disconnect between theoretical concepts and practical applications, particularly in Section 6, and consider using more recent models in their experiments. Finally, we strongly advise including a dedicated limitations section to enhance the paper's transparency and rigor.
