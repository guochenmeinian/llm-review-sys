Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of the Online Budgeted Matching (OBM) problem without the small bid or Fractional Last Matching (FLM) assumptions. The authors propose a novel meta-algorithm called MetaAd, which utilizes a discount function to score nodes and adapt to varying bid-to-budget ratios, achieving provable competitive ratios. The paper establishes an upper bound on the competitive ratio for deterministic algorithms and extends MetaAd to the FLM setting, demonstrating its effectiveness through theoretical proofs and numerical experiments. Additionally, the authors introduce a learning-augmented algorithm, LOBM, which enhances performance while maintaining competitive ratio guarantees.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is original in addressing the OBM problem without relying on traditional assumptions, introducing the MetaAd algorithm and its extensions.
- It features rigorous theoretical analysis and comprehensive proofs, validating the competitive ratios of the proposed algorithms.
- The writing is clear and well-organized, effectively presenting complex ideas.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty primarily arises from the adaptation of existing techniques rather than entirely new methodologies; the authors could clarify how their contributions differ fundamentally from prior work.
- Empirical validation is limited to a single application (online movie matching), restricting the generalizability of results; broader experimental evaluations are needed.
- Certain complex concepts could benefit from more intuitive explanations or visual aids to enhance accessibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the discounting function $\phi$ by providing a step-by-step derivation or illustrative examples to clarify its construction and effectiveness. Additionally, expanding the empirical validation to include diverse applications, such as online advertising or resource allocation, would strengthen the paper's claims. Including visual aids to illustrate the decision-making process of the MetaAd algorithm and clarifying technical terms and mathematical notations would enhance understanding. Finally, discussing potential societal impacts and strategies to maintain a balanced competitive environment would enrich the paper's significance.
