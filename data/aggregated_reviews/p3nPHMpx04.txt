Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method called base-class mining (BCM) for generalized few-shot segmentation (GFSS) that avoids previously utilized techniques. The authors propose that their method maintains performance for base classes while achieving decent results for novel classes, supported by experiments on datasets such as COCO-20i, PASCAL-5i, and PASCAL-10i. The approach leverages feature pre-processing and model ensembling to enhance performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The article is well-written and easy to understand.
2. The proposed method is simple yet effective, with commendable performance and efficiency.
3. The approach maintains base class performance by design, which is a novel perspective in GFSS.

Weaknesses:
1. The overall novelty is limited, as the concept of classifying novel classes as similar base classes has been previously explored in continual semantic segmentation.
2. Improvements across different settings are marginal, and the computational cost is about 1.5 times that of CAPL, warranting further explanation for this increase.
3. Clarification is needed on whether the co-occurrences matrix and BNM are calculated per-dataset or per-batch, and the written language could be improved.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the combination of final predictions for novel classes when s > 1. Additionally, we suggest that the authors include comparisons with few-shot fine-tuning techniques proposed in FSOD, specifically regarding the finetuning of the last linear layers, to enhance the experimental part's credibility. A brief discussion on the limitations of continual CSS in relation to GFSS should also be included in the related works.
