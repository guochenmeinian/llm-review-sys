Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Slot State Space Models (SlotSSMs), which enhance traditional State Space Models (SSMs) by integrating modular structures and inductive biases to improve sequence modeling. The authors propose a framework where independent slot vectors undergo state transitions independently, with sparse interactions managed through self-attention. The architecture includes components like Slot Encoder, SlotSSM, and Slot Mixer, demonstrating effectiveness in object-centric video understanding and long-range reasoning tasks. The authors also introduce Object-Centric SlotSSMs (OC-SlotSSMs) to further enhance modular structure discovery.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The design of SlotSSMs is original, utilizing independent slot vectors with sparse interactions through self-attention.
- The paper is well-structured and easy to read, with clear definitions of SlotSSM components and robust experimental evaluations across multiple challenging tasks.
- The authors provide valuable insights into the emerging modularity in SlotSSMs, supported by visual aids.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation of the method raises concerns, as predictions in figures do not appear satisfactory, suggesting the chosen datasets may not effectively showcase SlotSSMs' strengths.
- The paper lacks detailed experimental information, which could hinder reproducibility, and does not adequately compare with recent methods in the literature.
- The authors' claim of sparse interactions between slots is questionable given the use of QKV self-attention, which typically facilitates dense interactions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation settings to ensure SlotSSMs are tested on datasets that highlight their strengths. Additionally, including more recent methods in the comparison and providing detailed experimental information in the appendix would enhance reproducibility. We suggest conducting an ablation study to investigate the effect of the number of slots used in experiments. Furthermore, clarifying the nature of slot interactions and addressing the concerns regarding the modular architecture's complexity would strengthen the paper. Lastly, we encourage the authors to include preliminary results or theoretical discussions on applying SlotSSMs to other modalities, such as text and audio.
