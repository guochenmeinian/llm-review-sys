### Key Points
This paper presents a method for estimating uncertainty in closed-source language models (LLMs) through multiple rephrasings of a base query. The authors propose a practical rephrasing technique and a theoretical framework that explains how these rephrased queries yield calibrated uncertainty estimates. The paper includes experiments validating this approach across various datasets and models, demonstrating significant improvements in uncertainty calibration.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The proposed method employs intuitive rephrasing strategies, making it accessible to users without advanced technical skills.  
2. It shows substantial improvements in uncertainty calibration across multiple models and datasets, outperforming baseline methods.  
3. The rephrasing methods achieve results comparable to logit-based uncertainty estimation, despite lacking direct access to model logits.

Weaknesses:  
1. The method's effectiveness may diminish for more complex open-ended tasks that lack clear answers.  
2. Empirical validation is limited to a few models (Llama-2 and Mistral), necessitating further exploration of broader applicability to other architectures or use cases.  
3. Calibration improvements sometimes come at the expense of accuracy, particularly in smaller models, where performance may noticeably decline.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical justification for Proposition C.2, as the assumption regarding the Gaussian approximation may be overly bold. Additionally, we suggest including results from more recent models, such as llama3-8b, or providing a clear explanation for their exclusion. This could clarify whether the proposed method's performance is limited by the capabilities of newer models or if experiments simply have not been conducted.
