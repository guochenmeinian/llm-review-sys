Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Depth-Aware Hybrid Feature Fusion (DH-Fusion) strategy for multimodal 3D object detection, which dynamically adjusts feature weights based on depth encoding. The authors propose two modules: Depth-Aware Global Feature Fusion (DGF) and Depth-Aware Local Feature Fusion (DLF), enhancing feature integration and robustness against data corruptions. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that DH-Fusion outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of Novelty Detection Score (NDS) and shows impressive performance, particularly for distant object detection.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-structured, with clear communication of complex ideas and comprehensive illustrations.
2. The depth-aware multimodality feature fusion concept is reasonable and effectively validated through extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the Depth Encoder in DH-Fusion is questioned, as it resembles existing methods like PETR and IS-Fusion, leading to concerns about the contribution being limited.
2. The performance improvement over state-of-the-art methods is not significant, with some comparisons showing only marginal gains.
3. The algorithm's effectiveness for small object detection remains uncertain, particularly due to the reliance on LiDAR at near distances.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty aspect by clearly differentiating DH-Fusion from existing methods and providing a more comprehensive analysis of its unique contributions. Additionally, we suggest including results using larger image sizes and different backbones, such as the ConvNeXtS, to strengthen the validation of the proposed method. It would also be beneficial to conduct experiments on other datasets, like KITTI, to assess the generalizability of the approach. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to analyze the theoretical reasons for DH-Fusion's robustness against various corruptions and to include additional metrics in their results, such as mATE, mASE, mAOE, mAVE, and mAAE. Lastly, clarifying the computational complexity and resource usage of DH-Fusion compared to other state-of-the-art methods would enhance the practical applicability of the work.
