### Key Points
This paper presents GTSinger, a comprehensive dataset of 80 hours of singing voice recordings from 20 singers across nine languages, featuring extensive annotations such as phoneme-level singing techniques and music scores. The authors emphasize the dataset's utility through benchmark experiments in various singing tasks, including singing voice synthesis and speech-to-singing conversion. The inclusion of realistic music scores aims to enhance real-world composition applications, while the dataset is made freely accessible for research purposes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is large-scale and diverse, with multiple annotations that enhance its applicability.
- The data collection process is transparent and well-documented, supporting reproducibility.
- Benchmark experiments are rigorously conducted, demonstrating the dataset's robustness and versatility.
- The paper is well-structured, making it accessible and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The claim of "All Singing Tasks" in the title may be misleading, as the current evaluations focus primarily on generative tasks, neglecting several relevant discriminative tasks.
- The usability of "fine-grained music scores" in musicXML format is questionable, as it may not align with common practices in singing transcription.
- Each language in the dataset features only 1 to 3 singers, which could introduce bias.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the title and scope by revising the discussion on limitations and related work to reflect a broader range of singing tasks, including singing voice separation and automatic lyrics transcription. Additionally, consider addressing the usability of the "fine-grained music scores" and potentially removing them if they do not serve specific downstream tasks. Including additional baseline systems for each downstream task would enhance the comparative analysis of the dataset's performance. Lastly, expanding the dataset to include a wider variety of singers for each language would mitigate potential bias.
