Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates whether the MoLFormer, a transformer model trained on chemical structures, can predict human assessments of odors. The authors propose that MoLFormer, trained via masked token prediction loss, can classify odors based on expert and non-expert ratings, showing correlations with physiochemical descriptors relevant to olfactory perception. The study compares MoLFormer to baseline models (Open-POM and DAM), demonstrating comparable performance despite MoLFormer being self-supervised.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper explores an understudied area of olfactory modeling using transformer models, suggesting a universal learning mechanism for sensory processing.
2. The reliance on self-supervision for pre-training is both practical and theoretically relevant, as it aligns more closely with human olfactory learning.
3. The inclusion of baseline models enhances the interpretation of results, showing that self-supervised transformers can perform comparably to supervised models.

Weaknesses:
1. The classification methodology in Section 4.1 is unclear, particularly regarding dimensionality reduction and its application to DAM.
2. Sections 4.2 and 4.3 lack noise ceilings, making the correlation analyses less interpretable.
3. Some descriptions, such as the GS-LF dataset and the dimensionality reduction process, are insufficiently detailed.
4. The introduction contains references that seem out of context or irrelevant.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 4.1 by explicitly detailing the dimensionality reduction process and its application to all models. Additionally, including noise ceilings in Sections 4.2 and 4.3 would enhance interpretability. We suggest providing more detailed descriptions of the datasets and the derivation of physicochemical descriptors. Furthermore, consider revising the introduction to include more relevant references and clarify the context of cited works. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore the use of UMAP or t-SNE for visualizations to better represent the relationships between odorants.
