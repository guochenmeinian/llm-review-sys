Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a complex-valued neural architecture, specifically the Complex-valued spectral kernel network (CosNet), which generalizes spectral kernels to include complex-valued representations. The authors provide a generalization error bound and propose a novel initialization scheme, demonstrating that CosNet outperforms existing kernel methods and complex-valued neural networks in time-sequential data analysis. The framework aims to preserve amplitude and phase information, enhancing the representational capability of spectral kernel networks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The proposed method is well-motivated and addresses the critical issue of incorporating the imaginary part in spectral kernel analysis.  
2. The integration of the SKMG and CSKE modules is sound, effectively recovering complex-valued representations and combining them with neural networks.  
3. Theoretical analysis and experimental results indicate state-of-the-art performance.

Weaknesses:  
1. The presentation is poor, making it difficult to extract main claims and verify correctness.  
2. Experimental results lack sufficient evidence to convincingly demonstrate model properties, and the dataset used is limited in diversity, raising concerns about generalizability.  
3. The initialization of CosNet's parameters varies across datasets, necessitating a unified method for consistency and reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the manuscript's presentation to enhance clarity and coherence, ensuring that the main claims are easily extractable. Additionally, we suggest providing more diverse experimental datasets and results to better demonstrate CosNet's performance across various tasks, such as image encoding and decoding. It would be beneficial to include a unified initialization method for CosNet's parameters to ensure consistency. Furthermore, addressing the clarity of the complex-valued weight matrix design and its implications for spectral kernels in Section 3.3 is essential. Finally, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the training procedure and the implications of their theoretical results, particularly regarding the trade-offs between kernel complexity and network depth.
