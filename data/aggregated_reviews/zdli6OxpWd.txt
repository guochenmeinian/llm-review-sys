Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an algorithm for counting the maximum number of unique items contributed by users in a dataset while ensuring user-level differential privacy. The authors propose a method that selects a subset of items for each user to maximize the total unique count, solving the maximization problem through bipartite maximum matching or a linear-time greedy algorithm. The approach utilizes bounded sensitivity and offers lower bounds on the count, evaluated through empirical results demonstrating reasonable performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The problem addressed is well-motivated and the approach of bounded sensitivity is connected to existing literature on Lipschitz extension.  
- The paper introduces a novel user-level privacy formulation and presents rigorous bounds on algorithm performance.  
- Empirical evaluations show good performance, particularly for the greedy algorithm, and the presentation is generally clear.  

Weaknesses:  
- The title does not adequately reflect the focus on user-level privacy, potentially misleading readers.  
- The related work section contains inaccuracies regarding previous studies, which could misinform readers about the state of the field.  
- The empirical results for the greedy algorithm yield a poor bound for practical applications, and there is ambiguity regarding large-scale distributed settings.  
- The basic ideas and techniques are relatively simple, and the experiments section lacks depth.  
- The paper does not adequately discuss limitations or societal impacts, nor does it provide code for reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the title to better reflect the focus on user-level privacy. Additionally, the related work section should be revised for accuracy, particularly regarding the contributions of Desfointaine et al., Smith et al., and Dickens et al. We suggest enhancing the experiments section to provide a more comprehensive analysis of the algorithms' performance and clarifying the implications of the empirical results. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include a discussion on limitations and societal impacts, as well as to provide code for reproducibility. Lastly, we recommend that the authors clarify the distinction between maximal and maximum bipartite matching and address the sensitivity analysis of DC(D;l) more explicitly.
