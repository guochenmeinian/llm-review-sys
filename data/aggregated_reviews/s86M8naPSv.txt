### Key Points
This paper presents DeepSoftLog, a neural symbolic framework that generalizes ProbLog by integrating soft-unification with probabilistic semantics. The authors define essential properties for meaningful semantics and efficient training, demonstrating that existing neuro-symbolic systems fail to satisfy all these properties. DeepSoftLog claims to outperform state-of-the-art baselines in empirical evaluations, although the experimental setup raises concerns.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The theoretical analysis of learnable soft-unification is technically sound and potentially beneficial for other neuro-symbolic systems.
- The writing is generally clear, with examples aiding comprehension, and the authors maintain rigor throughout the paper.
- The proposed framework achieves significant improvements in the first two experiments and includes an ablation study on soft-unification properties.

Weaknesses:
- The idea of soft-unification is not novel, and while the authors propose four properties, they do not sufficiently explore their theoretical implications, such as convergence and learning efficiency.
- The experimental section lacks depth, particularly regarding the evaluation on MNIST-addition, which does not convincingly demonstrate scalability compared to DeepProbLog.
- Technical details, such as the incorporation of soft-unification during inference and knowledge compilation, are unclear, hindering understanding of the probabilistic semantics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical discussion surrounding the four properties of soft-unification, specifically addressing their benefits and implications for performance and computational complexity. Additionally, we suggest expanding the experimental evaluation to provide a clearer comparison with baselines, particularly in Section 5.3, and clarifying the technical details related to soft-unification scores and their integration during inference. Finally, we encourage the authors to enhance the related works section to better contextualize their contributions within the broader field of Neuro-Symbolic AI.
