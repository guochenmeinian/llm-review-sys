Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the AeroEye dataset, a new UAV-based dataset for video scene graph generation (VidSGG), and proposes the CYCLO approach, which utilizes cyclic attention to model object relationships in aerial videos. The authors validate CYCLO on the AeroEye dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness by achieving state-of-the-art performance on two existing scene graph generation benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents key points clearly, making it easy to follow.
- The introduction of the AeroEye dataset fills a significant gap in the field by providing a drone perspective relation dataset.
- The CYCLO method is innovative and shows superior performance compared to previous solutions.

Weaknesses:
- The connection between the UAV-focused dataset and the proposed method's long-range temporal relationships is not clearly explained.
- The paper lacks a statistical comparison between AeroEye and existing VidSGG datasets.
- The claim regarding long-term dependencies in existing methods requires better support.
- The relationship between CYCLO and scene graph generation needs further discussion to clarify its novelty.
- The method's network architecture could be better illustrated for clarity.
- The inference cost of the proposed approach is not reported, and its performance in live video streaming scenarios is unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of how the proposed method relates to the UAV scenario and clarify the connection between CYCLO and scene graph generation. Additionally, we suggest including a statistical comparison table between AeroEye and existing VidSGG datasets. The authors should provide stronger support for their claims regarding long-term dependencies and enhance the discussion of the cyclic attention mechanism to address potential non-differentiability issues. Including an analysis of bad cases would also benefit future research. Lastly, we advise the authors to report the inference cost and clarify the method's applicability in live video streaming contexts.
