Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel cross-modal BEV distillation approach, termed VCD, which utilizes a multi-modal teacher model (VCD-E) based solely on images to achieve comparable performance with multi-modal 3D detectors. The authors propose a trajectory-based feature distillation method to enhance the quality of feature distillation for moving objects. The final model achieves a 63.1 NDS on the nuScenes test leaderboard, setting a new state-of-the-art for camera-based detectors.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper effectively demonstrates that a dedicated image-based detector with future frames temporal fusion and LiDAR-guided depth input can bridge the domain gap between LiDAR and images.
2. The trajectory-based distillation approach is simple yet effective for addressing moving objects, as supported by ablation studies.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks theoretical analysis, focusing primarily on practical implementation.
2. While the trajectory-based distillation is noted as effective, it does not convincingly capture moving objects, suggesting a need for more detailed experimentation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis of the proposed methods to provide a deeper understanding of their contributions. Additionally, conducting more detailed experiments to validate the effectiveness of VCD in capturing moving objects would strengthen the paper. We suggest clarifying that VCD-E utilizes future frames during training in the main text rather than the supplementary material. Furthermore, we advise using \times instead of x in Table 1 for formal consistency. Lastly, addressing the definition of Occupancy in Figure 2 and Section 3 to avoid confusion would enhance clarity.
