### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the effects of cognitive overload and contextual bias in crowdsourced clustering tasks. The authors conduct empirical studies and simulations, revealing that existing models fail to account for cognitive overload and the influence of contextual bias on clustering accuracy. The findings suggest an optimal query size of 4-5 items to mitigate diminishing returns in worker performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and provides a comprehensive examination of cognitive overload and contextual bias, supported by rigorous empirical and simulation-based evidence.
- The findings have practical implications for designing crowdsourcing tasks, emphasizing the importance of query design in enhancing clustering accuracy.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical modeling of contextual bias lacks depth, and the generalizability of findings beyond the specific image datasets used is not adequately addressed.
- The simulation methodology raises concerns, particularly regarding the fixed error probabilities and the justification for new models to capture behavioral noise.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical modeling of contextual bias to provide deeper insights into observed patterns. Additionally, addressing the scalability of multi-item queries in larger datasets is crucial. The authors should explore the generalizability of their findings to other domains, such as text clustering, and consider the impact of varying the number of classes in datasets on cognitive overload. Finally, we suggest incorporating machine learning models, such as pretrained vision transformers, to mitigate contextual bias and cognitive overload in future implementations.
