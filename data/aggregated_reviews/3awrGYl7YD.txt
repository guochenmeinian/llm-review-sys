### Key Points
This paper presents a critical examination of the integration of AI Ethics into AI/ML training for scientists, emphasizing its necessity in the current AI landscape. The authors propose a tailored AI Ethics curriculum designed specifically for scientists, addressing an often-overlooked area in education. The paper articulates the importance of this curriculum and outlines how it can be developed and implemented in various training scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Clear justification for the inclusion of AI ethics in training programs.
2. Timely and relevant topic addressing an urgent need in AI-centric research.
3. Introduction of a tailored AI Ethics curriculum that can serve as a benchmark for educational institutions.

Weaknesses:
1. Lack of empirical data to support the proposed curriculum, which weakens the argument.
2. Insufficient detail on the specifics, challenges, and outcomes of the implementation scenarios mentioned.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by incorporating empirical evidence to substantiate the proposed curriculum, such as feedback from initial implementations or comparisons with existing training modules. Additionally, a more detailed exploration of the implementation scenarios, including specific challenges and outcomes, would enhance the content and provide a clearer understanding of the curriculum's real-world application.
