Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents new learning-based methods for numeric planning, formalized using the PDDL language. The authors propose two heuristics: one based on graph kernels and the other utilizing graph neural networks. The methods are evaluated across various domains, including blockworld and childsnack, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline planners. The paper also discusses the challenges of numeric planning, which involves numeric variables and complex state transitions defined by mathematical expressions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The experimental section is robust, covering standard benchmarks and demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed heuristics.
- The paper addresses an important problem in automated planning, providing novel approaches that show better coverage than domain-independent planners.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation is a major weakness, making it difficult to grasp the details. Sections 3.1 and 3.2 require more comprehensive examples, while Section 4 lacks clarity without supporting examples.
- There is a disconnect between Sections 3, 4, and 5, particularly regarding the use of extracted features for learning heuristics. The notation used does not aid understanding.
- The abstract fails to summarize the novelty and relationship between the proposed approaches adequately.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by expanding the examples in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 and providing a more detailed explanation of Section 4. Adding illustrative examples in Section 5 would enhance comprehension. Additionally, the authors should clarify the terminology used, particularly regarding the distinction between heuristics and planners. We also suggest revising the abstract to better highlight the novelty of the work and the relationship between the proposed methods. Finally, addressing the questions regarding grounding in graphical representations and the theoretical aspects of admissibility and complexity would strengthen the paper.
