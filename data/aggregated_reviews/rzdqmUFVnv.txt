### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative multi-task information interaction framework designed to enhance the utterance infilling task by capturing multi-granularity of semantic information. The authors propose methods including context selection, edit matrix construction, relevance merging, and intention check, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets such as Restoration-200K and CANAND. The methodology aligns well with the objectives of the Incomplete Utterance Rewriting (IUR) task, demonstrating a thoughtful understanding of its requirements.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The methodology shows clear motivation and relevance to the IUR task, indicating a solid grasp of the task's objectives.  
- The framework includes innovative components and effectively combines various loss functions to support its claims.  
- The paper reports state-of-the-art results and includes informative comparative and ablation experiments.  

Weaknesses:  
- The innovations, while present, are not particularly prominent, and the model structure lacks outstanding novelty.  
- The evaluation results on the CANARD dataset are unsatisfactory, and some ablation tests indicate a decrease in performance with the addition of certain components.  
- The paper does not compare its method against large language models, which may limit its relevance in the current research landscape.  
- Reproducibility may be challenging due to the reliance on data not available outside the authors' institution.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including a comparison with end-to-end large language models as a baseline to enhance completeness. Additionally, providing more details on model sizes and computational efficiency would clarify the system's performance. Addressing the dialog state infilling problem in the context of incomplete utterances could further strengthen the contribution. Lastly, the authors should ensure that the evaluation results, particularly on the CANARD dataset, are satisfactory and provide clearer insights into the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
