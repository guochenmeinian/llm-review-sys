### Key Points
This paper presents APPS, a method for data-driven differential model discovery that utilizes active learning to query informative data regions based on phase portraits of candidate ODEs. The authors propose a new active learning approach integrated into ODE discovery, which incorporates active path discovery through informative data assessment.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The integration of active learning into ODE discovery is a notable contribution.  
- The method claims improved accuracy over existing approaches, such as d’Ascoli (2024), by focusing on local informativeness.

Weaknesses:  
- The extension of context-free grammar for ODE representation lacks novelty and requires clearer articulation of the authors' contributions.  
- Generalization properties, particularly for long-term predictions and varying discretization steps, are inadequately explored.  
- The main algorithm and critical explanations are relegated to the appendix, making the main text insufficiently self-explanatory.  
- Experiments addressing the “initial condition” dynamic issue are not presented.  
- The paper requires significant reorganization to meet the 8-page limit.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors better highlight their contributions regarding the extension of context-free grammar. Additionally, the authors should explore and analyze the generalization capabilities of their framework, particularly concerning long-term predictions and different discretization steps. A more detailed analysis of training times related to Algorithm 1 would enhance the paper. We also suggest that the authors include the main algorithm in the main text to improve clarity and provide experimental results addressing the “initial condition” issue. Finally, a thorough reorganization of the content is necessary to adhere to the 8-page limit.
