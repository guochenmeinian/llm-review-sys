Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents HiNeRV, a novel implicit neural representation (INR) model for video compression that utilizes a new upsampling layer combining bilinear interpolation with hierarchical encoding. The architecture incorporates depth-wise convolutional and MLP layers, enhancing the model's capacity. Experimental results indicate that HiNeRV outperforms existing INR models and is the first to surpass HEVC in performance. The authors also propose a unified representation of frame-wise and patch-wise INRs, contributing to significant improvements in compression efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The ideas presented are novel and straightforward, making them easily re-implementable.
- The authors have made substantial technical improvements, achieving competitive coding performance.
- Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and compactness of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- Some figures, particularly Figure 2, lack clarity and summarization in captions.
- The method introduces increased computational complexity, affecting encoding and decoding speeds, which may hinder real-time applications.
- There are errors in references, such as mislabeling reference 9, and the paper lacks a source code provision.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of figures, especially Figure 2, by providing more straightforward illustrations and summarizing captions. Additionally, addressing the computational complexity to enhance real-time application feasibility is crucial. The authors should also ensure accurate citations and provide the source code for reproducibility. A more thorough discussion on the motivations behind the hierarchical encoding and its performance benefits would strengthen the paper. Finally, improving the overall writing quality and addressing typos will enhance readability.
