Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a universal framework for open-vocabulary semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation, utilizing a DETR-like architecture. The authors propose independent decoders for "thing" and "stuff" classes to address their semantic and geometric differences. They benchmark their method across various datasets, achieving notable performance improvements.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The idea is straightforward and comprehensible.
2. The results demonstrate strong performance on several popular datasets, including COCO and ADE20K.
3. The decoupling of thing and stuff decoding is validated through experiments, showing its effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. The contribution appears incremental, with insufficient distinction from existing methods like UNITEXT, which can also extend to open-vocabulary settings. The authors do not clarify the limitations of UNITEXT in this context.
2. The performance comparison with other methods is questionable due to potential dataset overlap, suggesting that the gains may stem from the training data rather than the proposed method. Evaluating on a more challenging dataset is recommended.
3. Claims of hierarchical representation are weak, with minimal discussion in the paper. The hierarchical model's contribution is unclear, and the authors should provide more substantial evidence of its effectiveness.
4. The decision against "feature fusion" for the stuff branch lacks empirical justification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions by explicitly addressing how their method differs from UNITEXT and providing a thorough analysis of the overlap between training and testing datasets. Additionally, the authors should enhance the discussion on hierarchical segmentation, including ablation studies to substantiate their claims. It would be beneficial to include more open-vocabulary results and comparisons with recent models to strengthen their position. Lastly, consider restructuring the experiments section to clearly delineate the Universal, Open-vocabulary, and Hierarchical capabilities for better reader comprehension.
