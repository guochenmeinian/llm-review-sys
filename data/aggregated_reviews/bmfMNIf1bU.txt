Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the EV-Eye dataset, a large and diverse eye tracking dataset that enhances gaze tracking precision by utilizing bio-inspired event cameras and a hybrid eye tracking method. The dataset achieves a sampling frequency of up to 38.4 kHz and includes samples from 48 participants, incorporating ground truth data and compatibility with various devices. The authors detail phases of eye movement, specifically fixation, saccade, and smooth pursuit, aiming to address limitations of traditional frame-based cameras and contribute significantly to the field of eye tracking, particularly with event camera-based datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The dataset's multimodal nature and high temporal accuracy are significant contributions to the field.  
- Inclusion of ground truth data enhances eye tracking precision.  
- Compatibility with various devices is verified, demonstrating utility across different setups.  
- The use of bio-inspired event cameras allows for improved tracking capabilities compared to traditional methods.  
- The dataset offers a larger size and more natural eye movement patterns compared to existing datasets.  
- The dataset is well-documented, organized, and includes a comprehensive ReadMe file.

Weaknesses:  
- The Related Work section lacks depth, with brief subsections that could be expanded.  
- The paper does not explicitly collect ground truth for gaze, relying on a commercial tracker with questionable accuracy at large viewing angles.  
- The dataset's subject diversity is limited, primarily consisting of participants from a single academic institution.  
- The abstract initially misrepresented the contribution of the tracking frequency, leading to potential misunderstandings about the novelty of the method.  
- There is a lack of clarity regarding the utility of high-frequency signals and the novelty of the experimental protocol.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the Related Work section by providing more comprehensive discussions. Additionally, we suggest improving the abstract to accurately reflect the contributions of the dataset and clarify that the high-frequency tracking capability is a feature of the event camera rather than the algorithm itself. Clarifying the phrase “all three types of eye movements” in line 93 would enhance understanding. The figures should have more detailed captions to facilitate comprehension. The authors should elaborate on the limitations of the gaze references from the Tobii tracker and consider including a more diverse range of subjects to improve generalizability. It would also be beneficial to demonstrate the dataset's application in real-world scenarios and provide clearer explanations regarding the nature of event camera data and the claimed tracking frequency. Lastly, adding labels for gaze locations and eye movement types would enhance the dataset's utility for the research community.
