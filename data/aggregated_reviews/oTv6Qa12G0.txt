### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical analysis of concept sets in CLIP-based Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), focusing on their impact on empirical performance in low-resource settings and under distribution shifts. The authors identify two key characteristics that enhance CBM performance: the size of concept sets and the degree of misspecification. Their findings are validated through empirical evaluations on CIFAR-10 and MetaShift datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The theoretical contributions provide valuable insights into the mechanisms behind CLIP-based CBMs, addressing a significant gap in the literature.  
- The framework is clear, with appropriate assumptions and comprehensive definitions that clarify expressiveness and model-aware inductive bias, which are crucial for performance.  
- Empirical results demonstrate that well-chosen concept sets improve sample efficiency and robustness, offering a unique perspective compared to existing works.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks a robust experimental evaluation, relying solely on CIFAR-10, which is less comprehensive than other available datasets.  
- Notations are loosely defined, leading to potential confusion regarding key terms and concepts.  
- The multi-step approach introduced raises practical concerns due to uncertainties from large language models, limiting generalizability.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental evaluation by incorporating additional datasets beyond CIFAR-10, such as those suggested in LaBO's experimental section, to provide a more comprehensive assessment of CBM efficacy. Additionally, clarifying the definitions and notations used throughout the paper, particularly in the introduction and key sections, would enhance readability and understanding. Finally, addressing the practical implications of the multi-step approach and providing performance comparisons with other CBM methods would strengthen the paper's contributions.
