Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Recurrent Trace Units (RTUs), a modified variant of Linear Recurrent Units (LRUs) designed for online reinforcement learning (RL). The authors demonstrate that RTUs, utilizing Real-Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL), perform comparably or better than LRUs and GRUs in various partially observable environments. The work includes comprehensive experiments across multiple tasks, showing the effectiveness of RTUs in improving computational efficiency and accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with a clear theoretical foundation and logical reasoning.
- Extensive ablation studies and experiments validate the proposed algorithm across numerous scenarios.
- The evaluation of RTUs in the context of RL applications is novel and provides significant insights.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution is considered minor, as the work appears to be a natural progression from LRUs.
- Claims regarding outperforming Transformers lack supporting experimental evidence in the main text.
- Some experimental designs and comparisons are seen as artificial or insufficiently rigorous.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of claims regarding the performance of RTUs compared to Transformers, ensuring that all relevant results are included in the main text rather than relegated to the appendix. Additionally, we suggest conducting a thorough ablation study that systematically compares RTUs with LRUs and other architectures, including GRUs and Transformers, to strengthen the paper's contributions. Addressing the clarity of terminology, particularly the differences between "Reinforcement Learning" and "Online Reinforcement Learning," would enhance the paper's accessibility. Finally, we advise proofreading to correct grammatical errors and improve overall presentation.
