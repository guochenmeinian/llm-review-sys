Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method called Customizable and Natural Camouflage Attack (CNCA) for generating customizable and natural adversarial camouflage against vehicle detectors, utilizing a pre-trained diffusion model. The authors propose a unique application of diffusion models to enhance the naturalness and customizability of adversarial patterns while maintaining robust attack performance. The extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate the effectiveness of CNCA in producing natural-looking camouflage across various settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The application of diffusion models for generating natural and customizable adversarial camouflage is innovative and holds practical significance.  
- The experiments are thorough, providing strong evidence of the method's effectiveness in both digital and physical environments.  
- The code is made available, facilitating further research.  

Weaknesses:  
- The clipping strategy lacks novelty, as it has been previously utilized in PGD, warranting less emphasis in the paper.  
- Some expressions are unclear, potentially hindering comprehension for readers unfamiliar with the field.  
- The evaluation in the physical world is limited, focusing primarily on small-scale models and specific conditions, which may not reflect broader applicability.  
- The paper lacks ablation studies to isolate the contributions of different components of the CNCA framework.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of expressions and provide visual evidence to support their claims, particularly regarding the limitations discussed. Additionally, we suggest extending the physical world evaluation to include a broader range of vehicle detection models and datasets, such as KITTI and Waymo Open Dataset, to assess scalability. Conducting ablation studies to demonstrate the impact of each component on overall performance is essential. Finally, we advise the authors to include statistical analyses, such as t-tests or ANOVA, to substantiate the significance of their experimental results.
