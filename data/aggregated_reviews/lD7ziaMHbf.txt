### Key Points
This paper presents ECP-ViT, a framework that optimizes Vision Transformers (ViTs) for mobile devices by employing a core-periphery guided self-attention mechanism. This approach effectively reduces computational demands and eliminates data transformation operations, achieving speedups of 4.6x to 26.9x on mobile GPUs while maintaining high accuracy. The authors propose a hardware-friendly self-attention pruning technique and compiler optimizations that enhance performance across various datasets and devices.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The performance generality of ECP-ViT is demonstrated across multiple datasets (STL-10, CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet) and hardware environments (OnePlus 11, Xiaomi 6).
- The justification for the Core-Periphery Guided Self-Attention is well-articulated, supported by figures and equations.
- The elimination of data transformation operations significantly improves memory bandwidth and reduces network overhead.
- The co-optimization of the compiler and model architecture leads to substantial computational efficiency.

Weaknesses:
- Comparative experiments lack consistency, and overall performance improvements appear marginal compared to existing methods.
- The implementation relies on Fixed Point 16-bit quantization, while current mobile environments typically use 8-bit or higher; experiments addressing this are absent.
- More comprehensive comparisons with other lightweight ViT methods are needed, particularly regarding NAS and advanced token optimization techniques.
- The rationale behind the core/periphery node allocation and the dimension reduction heuristic algorithm requires further elaboration.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the consistency of comparative experiments and provide more comprehensive evaluations against other lightweight ViT methods. Additionally, addressing the quantization issue by including experiments with 8-bit or higher quantization would enhance the relevance of the findings for current mobile environments. We suggest that the authors clarify the criteria for core node specification and provide detailed descriptions and pseudocode for the dimension reduction heuristic algorithm. Furthermore, including analyses of memory access patterns and power/energy consumption would strengthen the evaluation section.
