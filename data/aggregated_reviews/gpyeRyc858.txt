Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach called the Neural Relation Graph framework for identifying label noise and outlier data in large-scale datasets with real-world distributions. The authors utilize a relational structure of data in the feature-embedded space to detect label errors and outlier data, introducing a visualization tool for interactive data diagnosis. Extensive experiments across various tasks demonstrate that their approach achieves state-of-the-art detection performance and effectively debugs real-world datasets. The contributions include a unified method for diagnosing and cleaning datasets, a data relation function, graph algorithms for detection, and the visualization tool.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The originality of the Neural Relation Graph framework provides a unique perspective on identifying label noise and outlier data.
- The paper is of high quality, featuring a well-designed methodology and extensive experiments that are easy to replicate.
- Clarity is a strong point, with clear descriptions and visual aids that enhance understanding.
- The significance of the work is notable, addressing a critical problem in machine learning with practical implications.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a detailed analysis of the limitations of the proposed approach, particularly regarding its performance on diverse datasets.
- There is insufficient discussion on the computational complexity of the approach, raising concerns about scalability for large datasets.
- The practical implications of the proposed method are not thoroughly explored, leaving questions about real-world applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the limitations of their approach by conducting experiments on a wider range of datasets and discussing performance across different domains. Additionally, a more detailed discussion of the computational complexity is necessary, including potential strategies for enhancing scalability. We also suggest that the authors elaborate on the practical implications of their approach, including potential use cases and integration into existing machine learning pipelines. Furthermore, providing more details on the visualization tool and the datasets used in the experiments would enhance the paper's comprehensiveness. Lastly, a discussion on future research directions could provide valuable insights into extending the work.
