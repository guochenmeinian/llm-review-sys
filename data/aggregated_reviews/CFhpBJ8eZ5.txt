Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a semi-supervised learning framework, Dual Mean-Teacher (DMT), for Audio-Visual Source Localization (AVSL). The authors propose a two teacher-student architecture that mitigates confirmation bias and enhances the utilization of both labeled and unlabeled data, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Flickr-SoundNet and VGG-SS with minimal labeled data. The paper includes extensive ablation studies and experimental comparisons, demonstrating that DMT significantly outperforms naive semi-supervised learning (SSL) and other frameworks, particularly in scenarios involving small objects and off-screen sounds. The authors argue that existing methods struggle to leverage unlabeled data effectively, leading to suboptimal performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach of utilizing semi-supervised learning techniques for audio-visual source localization is original and interesting.
- The introduction of DMT effectively tackles confirmation bias and improves data utilization.
- The authors provide thorough ablation studies on semi-supervised learning configurations and backbone selections.
- Comprehensive experimental results validate the superiority of DMT over naive SSL and other methods.
- The paper is clearly written, with detailed experiments that show strong results and potential for becoming a benchmark method in the field.

Weaknesses:
- The technical novelty is limited, as the concept of model aggregation is well-established.
- The performance improvements may be partly attributed to the stronger model architecture rather than solely the proposed method.
- Some results show discrepancies that could raise questions about the robustness of the comparisons made.
- The authors should extend their experiments to include more diverse audio-visual source localization datasets, such as MUSIC-synthetic and AudioSet-instrument-multi, to enhance insights.
- The use of the term "unsupervised" is misleading; the authors should clarify this terminology and properly define existing methods as weakly or partially supervised.
- The paper lacks a limitations section, and the authors should discuss how to improve their method and address the concerns raised regarding the selection of teacher models and their impact on performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their terminology by distinguishing between "unsupervised" and "weakly supervised" methods. Additionally, we suggest that the authors include comparisons with existing semi-supervised AVSL methods to validate the effectiveness of their approach. It would also be beneficial to provide more detailed definitions of small objects, false positives, and open set in Section 5.2. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the performance comparisons by explicitly addressing how architectural differences may influence results. Finally, the authors should consider discussing the limitations of their work and how to address the potential issues raised regarding the robustness of their method in real-world scenarios.
