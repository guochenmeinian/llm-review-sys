Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a certified backdoor detector (CBD) that utilizes a novel statistic called local dominant probability to identify backdoor attacks in machine learning models. The authors propose that the method can effectively detect multiple types of backdoor attacks across various datasets by leveraging the assumption that backdoor triggers exhibit high sample-wise trigger robustness. The approach includes a calibration scheme using shadow models trained on a small set of clean data to derive detection thresholds. Empirical results indicate that CBD achieves high certified true-positive rates and outperforms existing empirical detectors.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper achieves high empirical and certified true-positive rates across different datasets.
2. It provides a certified bound on the false positive rate under mild assumptions, which is not offered by other certified backdoor defenses.
3. The theoretical analysis is sound, and the presentation is clear and intuitive.

Weaknesses:
1. The reliance on a small clean validation set raises concerns about practical applicability.
2. The method's certification may be limited due to the assumption of a moderate \( l_2 \) norm, which may not cover all backdoor attack scenarios.
3. The comparison with existing detectors may be unfair due to the larger sample size required for training shadow models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the discussion regarding the relevance of class imbalance in backdoor attacks, as the current explanation appears insufficient. Additionally, we suggest emphasizing the distinctions between attack models more prominently, as this is crucial for understanding the novelty of the proposed method. The authors should also clarify the definition of "domain" in line 97 and consider providing ROC curves/AUC comparisons for the methods CBD_sup K-Arm and MNTD. Lastly, addressing the efficiency of CBD and the potential detection overhead when scaling to larger models would strengthen the paper's contributions.
