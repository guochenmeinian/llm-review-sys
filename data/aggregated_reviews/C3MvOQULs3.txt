### Key Points
This paper presents two solution concepts for Bayesian games with incomplete information: ex-ante Bayesian k-strong equilibrium and Bayesian k-strong equilibrium, aimed at capturing potential collusion among participants. Truthful reporting is defined as ex-ante Bayesian k-strong equilibrium if no group of k agents can collude to gain higher utility before learning their types, and as Bayesian k-strong equilibrium if this holds after learning their types. The peer prediction mechanism serves as a targeted application of these concepts, with the main results characterizing lower bounds for the number of colluding agents required to gain higher utility. However, while section 4 mentions additional applications, it lacks explicit derivations of bounds.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces the strategic behavior of bounded group sizes in Bayesian games, filling a gap in existing research.
2. It demonstrates practical application value through the peer prediction mechanism, providing a clear threshold for evaluating robustness against collusion.
3. The rigorous mathematical methods employed establish a complete theoretical framework.

Weaknesses:
1. Simplifying assumptions, such as symmetric common priors and finite signal sets, may limit real-world applicability.
2. Discussions on application scenarios are preliminary and lack depth in exploring complex Bayesian games.
3. The focus on static Bayesian games neglects dynamic scenarios, which could introduce more complex collusion issues.
4. The paper does not adequately address the construction or existence of strong equilibrium with bounded group sizes.
5. A lack of experimental verification or simulations limits the practical relevance of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the definition of proper scoring rules, clarifying its significance. Additionally, integrating theoretical explanations into the Theorem section could enhance coherence. The authors should provide clearer distinctions between ex-ante Bayesian k-strong equilibrium and Bayesian k-strong equilibrium, particularly in relation to static versus dynamic games. To bolster the paper's impact, we suggest including examples where k-ESBNE does not exist but k-SBNE does, and exploring scenarios based on agents' knowledge of their types during deviations. Finally, incorporating experimental verification or simulations would strengthen the reliability and applicability of the conclusions.
