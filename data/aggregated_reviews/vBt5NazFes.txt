### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of the ability of a deep diffractive neural network (DDNN) to function as a universal function approximator. The authors claim that a DDNN system with multiple phase plates and two output photodetectors can theoretically learn any one-dimensional function. However, the reviewer disagrees with this assertion, noting that while a single hidden layer feedforward network can be a universal approximator, it requires the ability to set weights as any real value. The reviewer highlights that the first layer of the DDNN, as described by the authors, is not trainable, which undermines the claim of universality. Furthermore, the authors fail to demonstrate the DDNN's capability to approximate functions with higher order frequencies or those outside the cosine family.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The manuscript addresses an interesting topic regarding the capabilities of DDNNs.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical foundation is flawed, as the authors do not provide proof that the DDNN can represent an arbitrary matrix.
- The inability to tune the weight matrix for arbitrary values limits the DDNN's function approximation capabilities.
- The authors do not experimentally demonstrate the DDNN's ability to approximate complex functions.
- There are several grammar and punctuation mistakes throughout the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis by providing rigorous proof of the DDNN's ability to represent arbitrary matrices. Additionally, we suggest that the authors conduct experiments to demonstrate the DDNN's capability to approximate functions with higher order frequencies and those outside the cosine family. Finally, we encourage the authors to thoroughly proofread the manuscript to correct grammar and punctuation errors before submission.
