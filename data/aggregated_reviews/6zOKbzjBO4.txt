Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on multiclass classification with bandit feedback, focusing on the PAC classification framework. The authors propose a novel algorithm that achieves improved sample complexity bounds of \(O(poly(K) + 1/\epsilon^2)\) for finite hypothesis classes, enhancing the previous \(O(K/\epsilon^2)\) bound. They also extend their results to infinite classes with finite Natarajan dimension. The work resolves an open question in the literature regarding the relationship between bandit feedback and sample complexity in the agnostic PAC setting.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The manuscript effectively addresses an open problem in the multi-class learning literature under partial monitoring.
- The writing is clear, and the main ideas are well conveyed, with solid technical contributions and interesting results.
- The use of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm and the exploration distribution techniques are noteworthy and contribute to the paper's impact.

Weaknesses:
- The improvement in sample complexity is limited by a dependency on \(K\), specifically \(K^9\), which may hinder practical applicability for large \(K\).
- The claim of resolving an open problem may be overstated, as the original problem statement regarding the dependency on \(1/\epsilon\) is not clearly identified in the cited work.
- There is a lack of detailed discussion on the realizable bandit PAC setting and its implications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the realizable bandit PAC setting, summarizing known rates and techniques. Additionally, providing concrete scenarios where the bandit agnostic PAC setting is applicable would enhance the paper's relevance. The authors should also address the assumption of finite label spaces and explore the characterization of bandit PAC learnability as \(K\) approaches infinity. Finally, offering intuition regarding the separation between realizable and agnostic settings concerning the price of bandit feedback would strengthen the paper's contributions.
