Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for 3D human pose estimation that incorporates a Biomechanical Pose Generator (BPG) and Binary Depth Coordinates (BDC). The BPG generates plausible 3D poses based on kinematic constraints, while the BDC addresses depth ambiguity by classifying joint positions relative to the camera. The authors conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating that their approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of biomechanical principles in the BPG is intuitive and interesting, enhancing the generation of physically plausible poses.
- Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, particularly the generalization ability of BDC across different techniques.

Weaknesses:
- The paper contains repeated text, particularly in the first paragraph of Section 2, which detracts from clarity.
- The requirement for camera intrinsics in depth estimation may limit the applicability of the method in real-world scenarios.
- Some parts of the paper lack clarity, particularly regarding the integration of BDC and the specifics of the experiments, leading to ambiguities in the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by avoiding repeated text and providing a diagram to illustrate the entire system, including the integration of BDC. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify ambiguities in the experimental section, such as specifying the "source-dataset" and detailing the specific subsets used for evaluations. Addressing the confusion between Table 1 and Figure 4 regarding performance metrics is also essential. Finally, we encourage the authors to discuss the similarities between BDC and existing methods, such as the work by Iqbal et al., to contextualize their contributions more effectively.
