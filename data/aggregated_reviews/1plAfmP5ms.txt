Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a dataset for gait classification based on Doppler radar signals, capturing "micro-motions" of individuals while walking. The dataset, named MVDoppler, is the first public multi-view Doppler dataset for gait analysis applications, totaling over 20,000 seconds of data and including labels for various classes and relevant metadata. The authors propose a multi-view learning approach and establish baseline performance metrics for hand-detection tasks, emphasizing the intentional design to measure the impact of walking location and trajectory. They acknowledge the potential for accuracy improvements and the need for greater dataset diversity, while clarifying the classification latency as the minimum observation window length required for specific tasks. The authors have also added details regarding societal impacts and dataset statistics in supplementary materials, laying the groundwork for future research in radar-based motion analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset offers unique properties not found in existing datasets, making a significant contribution to the field of micro-motion-based perception, with potential applications beyond autonomous driving.
- The experimental design is rigorous, and the analysis provides valuable insights into multi-view Doppler learning, with a clear rationale for the design of tasks and expected accuracy.
- The authors demonstrate a commitment to improving clarity and addressing concerns, as evidenced by their responses to reviewer comments.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset, while larger than some existing works, is still limited in size and diversity of subjects, raising questions about representativeness and applicability to more complex scenarios.
- The motivation for using Doppler systems over traditional camera-based systems is not convincingly articulated, and the societal impact of the research, particularly regarding surveillance implications, is insufficiently discussed.
- Some technical terms and concepts may still be confusing for readers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the dataset's representativeness by providing detailed demographic information about the subjects, including age, sex, and height. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the motivation section to better articulate the advantages of Doppler systems compared to camera-based methods, particularly in challenging conditions. To address dataset limitations, we encourage the authors to consider expanding the range of actions recorded and including more complex scenarios, such as interactions between multiple subjects and various distractions. Furthermore, we recommend improving the discussion on societal impact, particularly in relation to surveillance applications, to provide a more thorough analysis. Clarifying the terminology used in the latency section and providing more implementation details in the supplementary materials would also benefit reader comprehension.
