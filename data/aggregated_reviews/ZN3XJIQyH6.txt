### Key Points
This paper presents a well-structured study focused on developing a dataset for detecting mental health issues related to relationship stress using Reddit posts. The authors propose a methodology that employs natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques, including classifiers trained on the dataset, which achieved an accuracy of 78.43%. The dataset is annotated by psychologists, ensuring reliability and credibility. The study addresses a significant gap in mental health research, emphasizing the potential for real-world applications in mental health interventions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is a novel contribution, specifically targeting mental health issues arising from relationship stress.
- The use of advanced NLP and ML techniques, along with a clear annotation process involving expert psychologists, enhances the study's credibility.
- The paper effectively outlines the motivation and significance of the research, making it accessible and relevant.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset may underrepresent other relationship dynamics, limiting the generalizability of findings.
- The accuracy score of 78.43% indicates room for improvement in model performance.
- Ethical concerns arise regarding data collection methods, particularly compliance with Reddit's User Agreement, which prohibits unauthorized scraping.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the ethical compliance of their data collection methods by obtaining explicit authorization from Reddit and considering the use of official API channels. Additionally, the authors should refine the annotation guidelines or provide more extensive training to annotators to enhance inter-annotator agreement. Expanding the discussion on the limitations, including potential biases in the data collection process and the implications of cultural differences, would strengthen the paper. Finally, we suggest including concrete examples of real-world applications and future research directions to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the study's impact.
