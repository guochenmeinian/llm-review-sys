### Key Points
This paper presents in-context pointwise V-usable information (in-context PVI), a modified metric for assessing instance hardness in in-context learning (ICL). The authors demonstrate strong correlations between in-context PVI and accuracy, validating its reliability through empirical analysis across various exemplar sets and shot numbers. The study emphasizes the efficiency of in-context PVI, which eliminates the need for fine-tuning and provides a new approach to measuring dataset difficulty.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of in-context PVI is a novel contribution that generalizes pointwise v-usable information from fine-tuning to ICL.
- The empirical analysis establishes the reliability of in-context PVI, showing consistent results across different conditions.
- The method is efficient, particularly for large language models, as it does not require fine-tuning.

Weaknesses:
- There is a significant accuracy gap between fine-tuning and in-context learning, raising concerns about the validity of the analysis.
- The paper lacks a direct comparison between in-context PVI and traditional PVI, which is necessary for a robust evaluation.
- Statistical significance for key results is not reported, undermining claims about the effectiveness of in-context PVI.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including a direct comparison between in-context PVI and traditional PVI, along with a thorough theoretical discussion on their relationship. Additionally, it is essential to report statistical significance for results in Table 1, Figure 5, and Table 7 to support claims regarding the effectiveness of in-context PVI. Furthermore, we suggest varying the demonstrations in experiments and reporting the average and standard deviation of accuracy to control for performance variance. Lastly, clarifying the selection process for exemplars and providing a more detailed task description would enhance the paper's clarity and depth.
