Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a differentially private algorithm for quantile estimation that utilizes the AboveThreshold subroutine, addressing the limitations of existing methods that require prior bounds on data. The authors demonstrate improved privacy guarantees and runtime complexity, and their experimental results indicate enhanced accuracy for quantile and sum estimations compared to traditional approaches. The paper also revisits Sparse Vector Techniques to provide new privacy results, making it relevant for real-world applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles an important problem in differential privacy with significant real-world applications.
- The proposed method is a creative adaptation of existing techniques, demonstrating clarity and accessibility.
- The theoretical analysis supports the claims of privacy and complexity, and the experimental results validate the method's utility.

Weaknesses:
- The requirement for O(n) passes through the dataset is a major concern, especially with large data volumes.
- The experimental section lacks sufficient data points and does not address query latency.
- The paper does not provide a theoretical utility guarantee, which is necessary for completeness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by increasing the number of data points beyond 1000 and including results on query latency, such as the time to find the median. Additionally, we suggest providing a theoretical utility guarantee similar to Theorem 3.3 of the cited work by Kaplan et al. (2022) to enhance the theoretical completeness of the paper. Furthermore, addressing the proofs' clarity and correctness is essential, particularly for Lemma B.1 and the references in Lemma 3.1. Lastly, we encourage the authors to highlight related works on quantile approximation in the introduction or related work sections to strengthen the context of their contributions.
