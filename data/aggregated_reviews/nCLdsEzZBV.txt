Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the long-term behavior of no-regret learning algorithms, introducing resilience to strategic deviations as a metric for characterizing these algorithms. The authors propose a connection between regularized learning and club sets, estimating convergence rates to these sets, demonstrating geometric rates for entropic regularizers and finite iterations for projection-based methods. Additionally, the paper discusses convergence to sets defined by closeness under better replies, even with bandit feedback.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper represents a conceptual advancement in regularized learning dynamics, addressing the disconnect between desirable equilibria and those reached by regularized learning. The characterization of club sets as an alternative solution concept is intuitive and robust. The clarity of presentation and the thorough literature survey are commendable. 

Weaknesses:  
The paper is notation-heavy, particularly in the section introducing various algorithms under the regularized learning umbrella, which could be streamlined. Some sections could benefit from more space for extended proof sketches or experimental details. Additionally, there are minor typographical errors, including a corrupted reference and missing elements in equations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the readability of the notation-heavy sections by potentially moving some content to the appendix. Providing basic or toy examples before generalizing could enhance comprehension. We also suggest that the authors address the convergence properties of regularized learners in relation to classical solution concepts, particularly regarding payoff comparisons to Nash equilibrium values. Furthermore, exploring the connection between club sets and chain recurrent sets could enrich the discussion, even if briefly mentioned due to space constraints.
