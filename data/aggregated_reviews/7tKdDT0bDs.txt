### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of GDPR compliance in the privacy policies of Alexa skills within European marketplaces. The authors collected privacy policies, translated them into English, and predicted relevant sentences for GDPR compliance using a classification model. They provided descriptive statistics on GDPR violations and employed ChatGPT to assess whether skills request personal information without adequate notice. The findings indicate that a significant majority of Alexa skills exhibit GDPR violations, which could have substantial policy implications if validated.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized and clearly written, facilitating comprehension.
- It employs robust data collection and analysis methods, including a large dataset of 23,927 privacy policies and the use of BERT for classification.
- The research addresses a relatively unexplored area, providing valuable insights into GDPR compliance in voice assistant platforms.

Weaknesses:
- The necessity of the sentence-level classification task is unclear, given the subsequent keyword search for GDPR categories.
- There is insufficient detail on the sentence classification task, including the labels used and their reconciliation across datasets.
- The methodology may be challenging for readers without a background in AI or data analysis, and the accuracy of the ChatGPT method for identifying data collection instances is questionable.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the sentence classification task by providing detailed descriptions of the labels used and how they were reconciled across datasets. Additionally, we suggest including a quantitative comparison of the performance of the sentence classifier against other models, potentially through fine-tuning. It would also be beneficial to analyze the model's performance and any biases that may affect the GDPR violation analysis. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the validation of the ChatGPT method to distinguish actual data collection instances from false positives. Lastly, we recommend extending the related work section to contextualize their findings within existing studies on privacy policies and GDPR compliance.
