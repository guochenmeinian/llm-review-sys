Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a unification of Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) and Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) through homotopy continuation, demonstrating their equivalence. The authors propose a novel implicit model, HomoODE, which combines the high accuracy of DEQs with the stability of NODEs. They also introduce an acceleration method inspired by DEQ solvers. The experiments indicate that HomoODE performs comparably or better than DEQs across various classification tasks while maintaining a lower memory footprint.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively establishes the connection between DEQs and NODEs, providing significant insights into implicit models.
- HomoODE leverages the advantages of both DEQs and NODEs, avoiding the unique equilibrium issues of DEQs.
- The proposed acceleration method and the experimental results demonstrate improved performance with fewer parameters and faster inference times.

Weaknesses:
- Some theoretical aspects, particularly the claim that DEQs and NODEs are "two sides of the same coin," lack depth in analysis.
- The experiments are limited to small-scale datasets like MNIST and SVHN, which may not adequately represent the method's capabilities.
- Missing details in certain sections, such as the choice of velocity in the neural ODE and the specifics of the homotopy continuation experiment, hinder clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis surrounding the equivalence of DEQs and NODEs to provide a more balanced discussion. Additionally, conducting experiments on larger datasets, such as ImageNet, would enhance the robustness of their claims. Clarifying the choice of velocity in the neural ODE and providing more context for the homotopy continuation experiment would also strengthen the paper. Finally, addressing the baseline comparisons in more detail would help contextualize the performance of HomoODE against existing methods.
