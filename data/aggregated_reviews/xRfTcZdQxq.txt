Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a unified optimization framework for robust model fitting that simultaneously addresses outlier rejection, model selection, and parameter estimation without prior knowledge of the model type. The authors propose a novel Sparse Subspace Recovery (SSR) theory and an alternating optimization strategy with proximal approximation to estimate model parameters and outlier entries. The method is evaluated through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a novel perspective on geometric model estimation, focusing on recovering model parameters without predefined model types.
- The writing is clear and well-organized, effectively conveying the core ideas.
- The experimental results are reliable and convincingly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- The existence and uniqueness of the proposed model are not discussed in detail.
- Proposition 2 is incorrect, as matrix Psi has rank 2 due to linear dependence.
- The formulation lacks conciseness, particularly regarding the rank-term treatment.
- The proposed method relies on several hyper-parameters, which may require fine-tuning, potentially diminishing its advantages over simpler model selection methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the model formulation, particularly regarding the rank-term and the discussion of existence and uniqueness. Please correct proposition 2 to accurately reflect the rank of matrix Psi. Additionally, we suggest providing a convergence analysis for the proposed algorithm and comparing its performance with existing methods like ADMM. It would also be beneficial to include a discussion on the sensitivity and robustness of the model from a theoretical perspective. Lastly, please address the hyper-parameter tuning issue by providing practical guidance for diverse datasets and application settings.
