Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative framework for Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) in multi-task point cloud understanding, termed PCoTTA. The framework incorporates three key components: Automatic Prototype Mixture (APM), Gaussian Splatted Feature Shifting (GSFS), and Contrastive Prototype Repulsion (CPR), aimed at addressing catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation. The authors argue that their approach, which utilizes source prototypes, aligns with recent literature in the field, despite not adhering strictly to traditional CTTA settings. They emphasize that their method focuses on domain-level prototypes rather than class-level, distinguishing it from previous works. The authors claim that PCoTTA demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across various tasks, including reconstruction, denoising, and registration, and highlight the effectiveness of their Gaussian Splatted-based Graph Attention mechanism for adapting unordered 3D data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The framework's design is practical and addresses significant gaps in continual test-time adaptation for multi-task point cloud understanding.
2. The introduction of PCoTTA represents a significant advancement in CTTA for point cloud data, demonstrating improved adaptability and robustness.
3. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, contributing to its overall readability.
4. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showcasing superior performance compared to existing techniques, including meaningful comparisons with baseline methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The integration of CTTA with multi-task point clouds is inadequately developed, and the experimental design lacks robustness.
2. Insufficient explanations and verifications hinder the understanding of how proposed modules prevent catastrophic forgetting and mitigate error accumulation.
3. The method design appears to violate the basic CTTA setting, as it utilizes source prototypes derived from source domain data, raising concerns about fairness in comparison with other methods.
4. The claim that many recent papers utilize source prototypes in CTTA is contested, as some reviewers argue that the cited works do not directly relate to CTTA.
5. The reproduction of baseline models, particularly SANTA, has raised concerns regarding the fairness and accuracy of the experimental setup, particularly regarding the updating of BatchNorm and LayerNorm parameters.
6. The paper lacks a broader range of point cloud tasks for validation and does not adequately discuss real-world applicability or efficiency metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the integration of CTTA with multi-task point clouds and provide a more robust experimental design. Additionally, the authors should offer deeper analysis and effective verification/visualization to elucidate the claimed effects of the proposed modules. It is crucial to address the concerns regarding the use of source prototypes in the CTTA setting and to ensure that comparisons with other methods are fair. We suggest including detailed comparisons with baseline methods that also utilize source features/tokens to validate the advantages of PCoTTA. Furthermore, the accuracy and completeness of the reproduction of baseline methods should be improved, particularly regarding the updating of LayerNorm parameters in their experiments. Expanding the range of point cloud tasks and including discussions on real-world applicability and efficiency metrics would further strengthen the paper. Finally, the ablation study should include individual contributions of the proposed modules to highlight their significance.
