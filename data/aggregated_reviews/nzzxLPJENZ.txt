Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to evaluating large language models (LLMs) by conceptualizing the evaluation process as a decision tree, where each node represents an evaluation action and each path from the root to a leaf node signifies a trajectory of evaluation reasoning. The authors introduce a tree-based data sampling method and preference learning based on the DPO algorithm, aiming to enhance evaluation capabilities while significantly reducing dependency on labeled data and inference costs. The method is tested across various settings, including in-distribution, out-of-distribution, and transfer evaluations, demonstrating improved performance and efficiency. Additionally, the authors leverage additional unlabeled dialogue data in an out-of-distribution (OOD) setting, emphasizing that while this data is accessible, it is insufficient alone for training an evaluation model. They argue that the evaluation tree requires a combination of dialogue data with SFT and DPO data, and they report significant performance improvements when mixing original training data with newly synthesized data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The innovative framing of LLM evaluation as a decision tree problem allows for a more nuanced and adaptable evaluation process.
- The thorough assessment of the model's performance across multiple settings is commendable.
- The approach reduces reliance on human-labeled data by generating supervised data and preference pairs from the evaluation tree.
- The authors provide substantial evidence for their method's design and experimental results, and the reported performance improvements from mixing training data demonstrate the effectiveness of their methodology.

Weaknesses:
- The authors overlook several key related works, including benchmarks like MMLU, Arena-Hard, and Chatbot Arena, which diminishes the contextual grounding of their research.
- The writing lacks clarity, making it difficult for readers to grasp the core focus; misleading captions and the absence of key sections, such as a conclusion, exacerbate this issue.
- The in-distribution performance does not outperform existing baselines, raising questions about the source of performance gains.
- The method's reliance on binary trees for evaluation criteria subtrees is limiting, and the sampling process for multiple evaluation paths is unclear.
- The reliance on dialogue data alone is insufficient for training, which may limit the model's applicability.
- The lack of additional experiments due to time constraints may leave some concerns unaddressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by incorporating relevant benchmarks and related works to provide a more comprehensive context for their research. Enhancing the clarity of the writing is essential; consider using pipeline figures with comprehensive captions to better illustrate the core ideas. Additionally, we suggest expanding the evaluation to include more models to validate the proposed method's effectiveness and addressing the limitations of using binary trees for evaluation criteria. Clarifying the sampling process for evaluation paths and providing a more detailed explanation of the growth/pruning mechanism would also strengthen the paper. Furthermore, we recommend improving the clarity of how the evaluation tree integrates with the SFT and DPO methods to better illustrate its impact on performance. Conducting further experiments with more unlabeled domain-specific data, if possible, would strengthen their findings and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of their approach.
