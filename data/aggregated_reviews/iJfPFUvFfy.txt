### Key Points
This paper presents a method that follows the Encoder-Propagator-Decoder scheme to predict 2D incompressible flow and 3D smoke buoyancy. The authors propose an autoencoder architecture with self-attention and spectral convolution layers, akin to Latent Diffusion models, while utilizing a ResNet as the propagator.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper demonstrates competitive performance compared to the Fourier Neural Operator.  
- It includes ablation studies, addresses both 2D and 3D tasks, and compares time and memory costs during inference.  

Weaknesses:  
- There is a lack of comparison with other competitive EPD methods referenced by the authors.  
- The paper does not adequately explain why spectral convolution, self-attention, and the proposed architecture are suitable choices for the problem, particularly in comparison to FNO and other EPD approaches.  
- Details regarding training time for each method are insufficient.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including comparisons with other competitive EPD methods already referenced. Additionally, the authors should provide explanations for the effectiveness of spectral convolution, self-attention, and the overall architecture in relation to FNO and other EPD approaches. Finally, we suggest that the authors include detailed training time information for each method.
