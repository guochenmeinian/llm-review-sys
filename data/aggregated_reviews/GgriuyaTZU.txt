### Key Points
This paper addresses Ultra-Fine Entity Typing (UFET) and proposes a methodology that utilizes pre-trained label embeddings to group type labels into semantic domains, enhancing recall for low-occurring types. The authors introduce pseudo-labels representing clusters of actual labels and implement post-hoc processing constraints to ensure at least one actual type from a cluster is predicted while avoiding mutually exclusive types, termed conceptual neighbors, learned via a contrastive NLI model. The paper reports state-of-the-art performance on the UFET dataset and includes qualitative analyses of the proposed cluster labels.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method effectively injects prior knowledge into the entity-typing process, improving recall for low-occurring types.
- The ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each proposed module, including clustering labels and post-processing techniques.
- The paper is well-motivated and shows progress in capturing semantic relatedness among labels.

Weaknesses:
- The performance improvement is modest, approximately 1.0 F1 score, and the work is described as incremental.
- The methods are difficult to follow due to omitted details, and there is a lack of empirical results showcasing the benefits for long-tail entity types.
- The paper does not include a comparison against prior work on modeling label dependencies, limiting its contextual understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methods described in the paper by including necessary details and addressing the following questions: 
1. Clarify the intuition behind special tokens P1, P2, and P3 (lines 236–237).
2. Define what constitutes a prototype of a label (y_l in lines 241, 242).
3. Explain how the clustering method ensures mutually exclusive categories (lines 322–324) and assess its accuracy.
4. Detail how conflicts are resolved in pairwise decisions when predicting conceptual neighborhoods.
5. Provide accuracy metrics for the NLI model used for conceptual neighbor prediction on both the BabelNet test set and the UFET dataset.
6. Add a brief explanation for the local linear neighborhood (lines 474–476).
7. Describe the process for computing embeddings for cluster labels.
Additionally, we suggest that the experimental results explicitly demonstrate the system's superior performance, particularly for long-tail types.
