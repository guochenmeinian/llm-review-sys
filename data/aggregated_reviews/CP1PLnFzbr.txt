Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for compressing memory consumption of Key-Value (KV) cache and reducing computation time in decoder Transformer models by utilizing two sentinel tokens. The authors demonstrate that their approach improves throughput while maintaining generation capabilities across various compression ratios. The empirical results indicate that the proposed method outperforms sparse attention baselines in fluency, n-gram matching, and semantic similarity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method introduces a novel approach that effectively reduces memory consumption and increases throughput.
- Extensive empirical data supports the claims of the proposed method's effectiveness.
- The writing is clear and the paper is easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The contributions are seen as marginal, combining well-known algorithms without sufficient theoretical backing.
- Limited experimentation, as the method is tested on only one dataset and a small selection of models.
- Unclear baseline choices hinder comparisons with previous works, and the randomness of span selection may affect robustness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical background by providing a formal definition of the proposed method. Additionally, consider expanding the experimentation to include more datasets and methods to strengthen the claims. Clarifying the rationale behind baseline choices and addressing the randomness of span selection in terms of its impact on performance variability would enhance the analysis. Lastly, we suggest discussing the relationship between compression ratio and throughput across different methods to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
