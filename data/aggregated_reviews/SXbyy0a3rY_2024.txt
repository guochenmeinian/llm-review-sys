Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a zero-shot layout technique for spatially-grounded text-to-image generation using a transformer-based diffusion architecture. The authors propose a method that divides the generation process into two branches: one for generating target image patches of arbitrary sizes within bounding boxes and another for the overall image. The approach leverages the emergent property of semantic sharing in diffusion transformers, allowing for effective handling of spatial relations and the generation of images conditioned on text-labeled bounding boxes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method effectively addresses the limitations of attention-based approaches in generating arbitrary object sizes within bounding boxes by utilizing transformer architecture.
- The paper is well-written and presents the ideas clearly.
- The proposed model demonstrates superior efficacy compared to other methods, as shown in the provided figures and tables.

Weaknesses:
- The exposition of certain concepts, such as the interaction between different branches and the diffusion scheduling, is unclear and inconsistent with the implementation details.
- Key components, like the definition of $\mathcal{L}(x_t, G_i, A_i)$ and the evaluation metrics, are not properly defined.
- The paper lacks a comprehensive comparison of prompt fidelity and does not evaluate certain relevant datasets, which limits the completeness of the work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the exposition, particularly regarding the interaction between the two branches and the diffusion scheduling. It is essential to include definitions for all key components, such as $\mathcal{L}_{AGG}$ and the evaluation metrics. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more thorough comparison of prompt fidelity on the HRS dataset and consider evaluating the MS-COCO subset to enhance the robustness of their findings. Finally, including an ablation study on the direct pasting of object images into the main branch could provide valuable evidence supporting their claims.
