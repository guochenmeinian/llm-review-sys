### Key Points
This paper argues that current evaluations of entity linking (EL) systems lack practical significance due to reliance on coarse metrics and susceptibility to artifacts and biases. The authors propose a new evaluation system that includes detailed error analysis and introduces two new benchmarks, Wiki-Fair and News-Fair, to address the limitations of existing benchmarks. The paper also re-evaluates current entity linking systems using these new benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The authors address a widespread phenomenon in entity linking evaluations that has been overlooked.  
- The paper systematically analyzes the limitations of mainstream benchmarks and provides a comprehensive examination of the field.  
- It presents a novel attempt to create fair evaluations for NER/NEL, introducing new metrics that include false negatives, false positives, and disambiguation error rates.  
- The paper is generally well-written and illustrated, with sufficient details for reproducibility.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper deviates from common terminology, using ER and EL instead of the recognized NERL and NEL.  
- Discussing NER/NEL without the broader context of relation extraction and slot filling is unusual.  
- The proposed benchmarks are relatively small and lack diversity in entity categories, with inadequate responses to issues like entity type imbalance.  
- It remains unclear which overall metric should be adopted for fair evaluations, and there is a lack of evaluation results on separate benchmarks.  
- Some portions of the text are less reader-friendly.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve adherence to common terminology in the field by using NER and NEL instead of ER and EL. Additionally, we suggest consolidating sections in the introduction and reducing the number of subsections in Section 4 for a more compact writing style. The title of Section 3 should be revised to avoid implying the authors are the first to propose fair evaluations. Clarifying the final F1-scores of the fair evaluations and synthesizing results from all systems in a table would enhance clarity. We also recommend addressing the limitations regarding entity type imbalance in the new benchmarks and providing a clear metric to replace the F1 metric. Lastly, improving the readability of certain text sections and figures would benefit the overall presentation.
