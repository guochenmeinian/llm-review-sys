Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the EB-TC algorithm for ε-best arm identification in stochastic bandits, applicable in both fixed-confidence and fixed-budget settings. The algorithm is characterized as simple, anytime, and does not require prior knowledge of confidence or horizon. Its performance is analyzed across various settings, including asymptotic and non-asymptotic fixed-confidence, and it is supported by extensive numerical experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The algorithm is easy to implement and applicable across different settings without modification.
- The theoretical analysis is thorough, particularly for fixed β, and the empirical results are extensive.
- The paper provides a clear comparison to existing works and discusses the results well.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation is dense and can be difficult to follow, with theoretical discussions mixed with related works.
- The algorithm's performance may not be optimal for identifying the best arm, and the analysis for the IDS variant is limited.
- Some key definitions and quantities are introduced too late, hindering clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization of the paper by clearly separating theoretical discussions from related works to enhance readability. It would be beneficial to define all key quantities, such as $\bar{\beta}_{n+1}$, before introducing the algorithm. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the motivation behind proposing a single algorithm for multiple settings, as well as address the potential barriers between the ε-BAI and BAI problems. Lastly, we encourage the authors to enhance the presentation of figures for better readability and to elaborate on the discussion regarding the K(K-1) different tracking rules mentioned in the text.
