Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a dynamic pricing model enhanced by advertisement campaigns within a Bayesian persuasion framework. The authors focus on an online learning approach where the seller is uncertain about the buyer's demand function. The study derives regret bounds of $O(T^{2/3} m^{1/3})$ for discrete quality spaces and $O(T^{3/4})$ for arbitrary quality spaces, while introducing a novel quality-and-price-dependent discretization scheme. The authors analyze a UCB algorithm that effectively reduces the decision variables related to the advertising strategy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The model integrates dynamic pricing with Bayesian persuasion, presenting a novel approach in the literature.
- The learning process requires only observations of buyers' purchase decisions, which simplifies the model.
- The algorithm design and analysis are well-crafted, achieving nearly tight regret bounds.

Weaknesses:
- The description of the discretization process is somewhat unclear and could benefit from more intuitive discussion.
- The assumption that the value function is linear in $\omega$ may be too strong, as it relies on prior knowledge of the buyers' value function.
- There is a lack of numerical results, which could provide immediate intuitions about the model's performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the discretization description, particularly around line 308, to enhance reader understanding. Additionally, consider discussing the implications of the linearity assumption in the value function and explore ways to relax this requirement. Including numerical results would also strengthen the paper by providing practical insights into the model's effectiveness. Lastly, we suggest a more structured presentation, including clearer definitions and a separate conclusion section to enhance readability.
