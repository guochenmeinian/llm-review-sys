### Key Points
This paper presents a new dataset called the Linguistic Concept Learning benchmark (Licon) aimed at investigating concept learning capabilities. The Licon dataset consists of three components: Licon-A, which includes basic and novel concepts; Licon-I, similar to Licon-A but incorporating images; and Licon-T, derived from real-world questions for concept learning and reasoning. The dataset is designed to facilitate the learning of abstract concepts that cannot be solely represented visually. Additionally, the authors propose an entailment-based concept learning method (EnC) that utilizes box embeddings and graph neural networks to model relationships between concepts, demonstrating effectiveness on the Licon dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The Licon dataset is novel, diverse, controllable, and challenging.  
- The motivation for integrating visual and linguistic elements in concept learning is well-founded.  
- The proposed method effectively captures relationships through entailment and contradiction.  
- The evaluation primarily consists of zero-shot tasks, enhancing the dataset's applicability for fine-tuning or evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs).  

Weaknesses:  
- The Licon dataset is narrowly focused on specific types of concept learning, lacking scalable expansion options.  
- Sections like Licon-A do not clearly exhibit hierarchical characteristics.  
- The description of the Licon-T dataset is limited, leading to confusion about its usage and differentiation between basic and novel concepts.  
- The Licon-I dataset may appear redundant given the paper's focus on linguistic cues.  
- The claimed difficulty level of the dataset is not convincingly demonstrated in the experiments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the Licon-T dataset's structure to explicitly differentiate between basic and novel concepts. Additionally, consider expanding the dataset to include scalable options for broader applicability. The authors should clarify the hierarchical nature of Licon-A and ensure that the description of Licon-T is comprehensive. We also suggest that the authors provide more experimental evidence to substantiate the claimed difficulty level of the dataset. Lastly, please correct the identified typos, such as "plant" to "planet" in Figure-1 and ensure that all figures are adequately illustrated and referenced in the text.
