Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical analysis of linear scalarization in multi-task learning (MTL), investigating its ability to fully explore the Pareto front. The authors reveal that linear scalarization has fundamental limitations, particularly in under-parameterized regimes, where the feasible region exhibits a multi-surface structure. They derive necessary and sufficient conditions for full exploration and provide empirical validation through experiments on a three-task learning problem. Additionally, the authors propose insights into the strengths of scalarization methods and multi-objective optimization (SMTO), addressing feasible regions and gradient disagreement, and clarifying that their results differ from those of Xin et al. (2022) due to the non-convex setting and the necessity for a new theory to explain empirical successes in linear scalarization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a significant question regarding the efficacy of linear scalarization in MTL, contributing valuable theoretical insights.
2. The analysis is clear, with well-structured presentations and proofs, making the findings accessible.
3. Empirical results support the theoretical claims, demonstrating the limitations of linear scalarization.
4. The paper provides a novel theoretical analysis of scalarization failures, advancing the understanding of multi-objective optimization.
5. The authors clarify complex concepts such as feasible regions and gradient disagreement, contributing to the literature on MTL.

Weaknesses:
1. The argument that linear scalarization cannot reach intersection points of surfaces lacks clarity and requires elaboration.
2. The study is limited to a simple two-layer linear model, raising concerns about its applicability to more complex, real-world scenarios.
3. There is insufficient discussion of related works that identify similar limitations of linear scalarization, which diminishes the paper's unique contribution.
4. The experiments comparing SMTOs and linear scalarization lack consistency in methodology, potentially affecting the validity of the conclusions.
5. The applicability of the theoretical results to real-world scenarios and modern, over-parameterized MTL networks is limited.
6. The comparison with Xin et al. (2022) lacks clarity, and the differences in settings may lead to misinterpretations of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 3.2 by elaborating on why linear scalarization cannot reach intersection points of surfaces. Additionally, please discuss the main results in relation to existing literature, particularly regarding the known limitations of linear scalarization. It would be beneficial to revise Section 3 for better organization, possibly by summarizing key findings at the beginning. We also suggest including experiments with the proposed randomization approach to empirically verify its effectiveness in exploring the entire Pareto front. Furthermore, we recommend enhancing the clarity of the comparison with Xin et al. (2022) by explicitly stating the reasoning gaps between their theoretical claims and empirical findings. The authors should also enhance discussions on the limitations of their work, particularly regarding the under-parameterized regime and the general $q$. Finally, ensure that all relevant references are properly cited and discussed in the revised manuscript.
