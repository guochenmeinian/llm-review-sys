Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to addressing unobservable confounders in feature attribution methods, which can lead to misinterpretations of attribution scores. The authors propose "data-faithful feature attribution," utilizing instrumental variables (IVs) to train models free of confounders, ensuring that feature attributions reflect the true data generation process. The methods IV-SHAP and IV-IG demonstrate improved accuracy in recovering causal effects compared to traditional methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a confounder-free model training approach using instrumental variables is a significant advancement, addressing a critical gap in feature attribution.
- The paper provides a comprehensive theoretical analysis, clearly explaining the impact of unobservable confounders and how the proposed method mitigates this issue.
- The authors validate their approach with empirical results, showing up to a 67% improvement in attribution accuracy over baseline methods.

Weaknesses:
- The two-stage training process and the use of IVs may be complex to implement and require significant computational resources, potentially limiting practical usability.
- The theoretical derivations assume linear influence from unobserved confounders, which may not hold in all scenarios, limiting applicability.
- The paper lacks clarity on how expectations in certain equations are computed and does not discuss the impact of violating instrumental variable assumptions or correlations among input features.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper's readability by restructuring math-heavy paragraphs, possibly by shortening the introduction. Clarifying how practitioners can identify unobservable confounders and suitable instrumental variables would enhance the practical applicability of the method. Additionally, addressing the robustness of the method under non-linear effects and conducting sensitivity analyses would strengthen the findings. We also suggest including ablation studies to assess the impact of instrumental variable assumptions and feature correlations on the effectiveness of IV-SHAP and IV-IG. Lastly, please ensure that the scope and problem are clearly articulated to avoid confusion with traditional explanation methods.
