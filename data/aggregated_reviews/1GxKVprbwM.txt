Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of privately computing quadratic forms under local differential privacy (LDP), offering a non-interactive local DP algorithm with mean squared error (MSE) upper and lower bounds that exhibit a gap dependent on the dimension \( k \). The authors also develop results for an interactive algorithm, establishing analogous bounds. The study includes reductions between quadratic forms and linear queries, which facilitate the derivation of tight bounds.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The bound results for both non-interactive and interactive local DP algorithms are generic.
- The paper provides a complete analysis of the non-interactive algorithm and its bound results.
- It identifies a natural problem with a general theory analogous to linear queries, presenting tight results for every quadratic form.
- The techniques for multi-round LDP protocols are interesting and clearly articulated.

Weaknesses:
- The MSE bounds for the non-interactive local DP mechanism reveal a significant gap depending on \( k \), the dimension of matrix \( W \).
- The presentation requires improvement due to grammatical errors and a lack of clarity in defining local DP and randomized response mechanisms.
- The significance of the reductions in Section 1.2 is unclear, as they may appear trivial or inadequately explained.
- The paper lacks experimental validation and does not discuss the practical implications of the proposed protocols.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and coherence of the presentation, particularly by addressing grammatical mistakes and providing formal definitions for local DP and randomized response mechanisms. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the significance of the reductions in Section 1.2 and provide more intuition regarding the upper bound's dependence on \( k \). It would also be beneficial to discuss the practical applicability of the results, including the data size required for achieving good utility and the implications of the shuffle model on their findings.
