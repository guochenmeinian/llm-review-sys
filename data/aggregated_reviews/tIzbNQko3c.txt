Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel pre-training method for proteins called DiffPreT, which utilizes joint modeling of protein sequences and structures through a diffusion model. The authors propose generating pairs of conformers by perturbing side-chain rotations and maximizing mutual information between their diffusion trajectories, leading to the SiamDiff model. The effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated through experiments on enzyme classification and Atom3D tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The concept of maximizing mutual information between diffusion trajectories of different conformers is innovative and can be transformed into a loss function for mutual denoising.
2. The evaluation is thorough, including comparisons with various pre-training strategies and extensive ablation studies.

Weaknesses:
1. Random perturbations on side-chain torsional angles may yield high-energy conformations, which do not accurately reflect the physics of conformational changes, potentially undermining the mutual denoising scheme's effectiveness.
2. The paper's organization could be improved; key insights about maximizing mutual information are relegated to the appendix, while the introduction focuses heavily on diffusion preliminaries.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of essential parts of the method and provide more intuitive explanations of the noise levels used for downstream tasks. Additionally, the authors should consider discussing the implications of using different diffusion schemes and include more diverse result presentations, such as graphical visualizations of protein structures or representations. Finally, we suggest that the authors address the limitations of their approach in the main text, particularly regarding the need for structures at inference time and the evaluation against a broader range of tasks.
