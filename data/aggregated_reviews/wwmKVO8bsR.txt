Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a solution to the challenge of partially class-disjoint data (PCDD) in Federated Learning (FL), where clients contribute only a subset of classes. The authors propose FedGELA, which utilizes a globally fixed simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF) classifier while adapting locally to personal distributions. The approach aims to achieve holistic improvements in both global and local views of federated learning by addressing angle collapse and space waste issues. Contributions include a theoretical analysis of convergence, experimental validation on benchmark datasets, and a demonstration of FedGELA's advantages over existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper effectively covers related work, highlighting the limitations of existing FL methods in addressing PCDD.
2. Performance evaluations on multiple datasets (SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100) show that FedGELA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.

Weaknesses:
1. Evaluation is limited to one real PCDD application (Fed-ISIC2019), with no alternative benchmarks recommended.
2. Performance improvements over the best baseline are generally less than 3%, raising questions about the algorithm's robustness under varying conditions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including additional real-world applications or benchmarks to strengthen the findings. It would be beneficial to provide more detailed insights into the performance improvements, particularly under specific conditions, to clarify the algorithm's limitations. Additionally, addressing the concerns regarding the novelty of the approach and its differentiation from existing methods would enhance the paper's contribution.
