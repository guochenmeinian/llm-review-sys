Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into Generalized Linear Bandits (GLB) under the self-concordance assumption, demonstrating that single-parameter natural exponential families (NEFs) with subexponential tails are self-concordant and deriving novel second-order regret bounds that are free of exponential dependence on problem parameters. The authors provide a mathematically solid foundation for their OFU-type algorithm, extending its applicability to various reward distributions, including Poisson, exponential, and gamma.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The theoretical contributions are significant, particularly in establishing self-concordance for NEFs and deriving the first $d\sqrt{T/\kappa_\star}$ type regret for a broad range of GLBs.  
- The results are presented clearly, with well-defined concepts and helpful examples.  
- The paper's sound theoretical foundation and the relaxation of existing assumptions enhance its relevance.  

Weaknesses:  
- The presentation lacks clarity, particularly in the introduction of "self-concordance," which is abrupt and insufficiently explained.  
- The literature review is incomplete, failing to adequately discuss differences with existing work, such as [Rus+21], leading to unclear contributions.  
- The algorithm relies heavily on known parameters of the NEF, and parameter-free results are increasingly important.  
- The confidence set for the OFU-GLB is nonconvex, making the algorithm computationally intractable, and the paper lacks experimental results to support theoretical claims.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation by providing a comprehensive overview in the first section, ensuring that the concept of "self-concordance" is clearly defined. Additionally, a more detailed comparative analysis with existing methods should be included to highlight advantages and trade-offs. We suggest addressing the nonconvexity of the confidence set by exploring convex formulations and incorporating numerical experiments, particularly for exponential bandits. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to track the norm parameters $S_0, S_1, S_2$ throughout the paper and to include discussions on the implications of parameter-free results. Lastly, we advise correcting minor details, such as the use of "et al." in references, and ensuring that all theorem statements are directly referenced to their proofs in the Appendix.
