### Key Points
This paper presents a data-driven approach to Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in high-dimensional regression, enhancing traditional methods like the debiased LASSO. The authors derive non-asymptotic confidence intervals by estimating bias terms' means and variances from training data, addressing the limitations of conventional UQ techniques that yield overly narrow confidence intervals. The framework is applicable to both classical optimization methods and neural networks, with numerical examples demonstrating its effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The non-asymptotic treatment is a promising extension to the debiased LASSO, likely benefiting various high-dimensional regression applications.
- The method serves as a convenient plug-in for existing debiased LASSO estimators.
- Experiments convincingly demonstrate coverage levels, despite some remaining questions.

Weaknesses:
- The paper employs non-standard notation, complicating readability, particularly in Theorem 1 where $b$ is used instead of the conventional $y$.
- The type of uncertainty quantified is not clearly stated, necessitating clarification.
- Some acronyms remain undefined (e.g., MR, ITSA, LASSO).
- Figures are poorly presented, being too small and lacking necessary labels, making interpretation difficult.
- There is no comparison with conformal prediction, which is essential for contextualizing the contribution.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of notation, particularly in Theorem 1, and explicitly state the type of uncertainty being quantified. Additionally, please define all acronyms used in the paper. The figures should be enlarged, with added axis labels and legends, and individual subfigures should be labeled for clarity. We also suggest including a discussion comparing the proposed method with conformal prediction to enhance the paper's contribution. Finally, addressing the questions regarding confidence interval coverage and elaborating on terms like "image support" would strengthen the manuscript.
