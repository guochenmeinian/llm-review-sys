Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a distributionally robust version of the output feedback linear quadratic control problem, addressing systems with known partially observed linear dynamics and stochastic disturbances drawn from an unknown distribution. The disturbances are assumed to belong to an ambiguity set centered at a known Gaussian distribution, with the worst-case distribution found to be Gaussian. The authors propose a computationally efficient method using the Frank-Wolfe algorithm to determine the optimal covariance parameters for the worst-case distribution. The main contributions include theoretical results on the optimal controller and an algorithm for estimating the adversarial Gaussian distribution from data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The formulation of the distributionally robust output feedback LQ control problem is novel and clearly presented.
- The proof that the worst-case disturbance distribution is Gaussian is significant and well-supported.
- The paper is well-written, providing a thorough overview of the problem and demonstrating the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical contribution is limited to a Gaussian-centered ambiguity set, necessitating further exploration of other nominal distributions or mixtures.
- The simulation study lacks thoroughness, particularly in illustrating cases with non-normal noise distributions within the Wasserstein ball.
- The role of ball radii in performance is not discussed, and some arguments regarding convexity and the controller's ability to reconstruct the initial state are unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the simulation study by including cases where the noise distribution is non-normal but still within the Wasserstein ball, to illustrate the performance of the learned policy. Additionally, a discussion on the effect of varying ball radii on performance should be included. We suggest clarifying the claims regarding convexity of probability measures and the controller's ability to compute fictitious states without knowing the initial state. Furthermore, we advise reformulating the first sentence of Proposition 4.1 for clarity and avoiding the term "smooth" in Proposition 4.2, opting instead for "infinitely differentiable with $\beta$-Lipschitz gradient." Lastly, a more detailed discussion on the implications of the Gaussian assumption for practical applications would enhance the paper's relevance.
