Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new algorithm, FAST-LOCAL-SEARCH, for approximately maximizing a non-monotone submodular function under a cardinality constraint, achieving a 0.385-approximation with a query complexity of \(O(n + k^2)\). The authors combine several established techniques, including initial solution search, accelerated local search, and stochastic greedy improvement steps, to outperform existing algorithms in practical machine-learning applications. The algorithm's performance is supported by theoretical proofs and empirical evaluations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The algorithm achieves the best query complexity for practical algorithms attaining at least a 0.385-approximate solution, demonstrating substantial progress in the field.  
2. The paper includes a thorough theoretical analysis and detailed experimental evaluations, making it complete and well-organized.  
3. Empirical results indicate clear improvements over previous state-of-the-art algorithms, with less variance in output.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The novelty of the paper is limited, as it heavily relies on existing work, particularly the framework from [2].  
2. The presentation contains several typos and cumbersome formulas that affect clarity, particularly in the results section.  
3. The practical query complexity of \(O(n + k^2)\) may be impractical for large values of \(k\), raising concerns about the algorithm's applicability in real-world scenarios.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by proofreading for typos and simplifying complex formulas, such as those found in Line 14 of Algorithm 1. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion on how the proposed framework can outperform the \(1/e\) ratio to enhance readability for those unfamiliar with [2]. It would also be beneficial to provide a comparison of the number of query calls used in the experiments alongside the output values to substantiate claims of low query complexity.
