Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to enhancing the transferability of adversarial examples through a single-stage optimization method called Intermediate-Level Perturbation Decay (ILPD). The authors identify that traditional intermediate-level attacks often deviate from directional guides, leading to suboptimal performance. By ensuring that intermediate perturbations maintain larger magnitudes and align closely with directional guides, the proposed method significantly improves model prediction loss. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 validate that ILPD outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques across various victim models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper effectively addresses the limitations of existing intermediate-level attacks and proposes a well-grounded method (ILPD) that enhances adversarial transferability.
2. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ILPD outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins.
3. The method is pluggable, allowing integration with other attack strategies, and the analysis provides valuable insights for future research.

Weaknesses:
1. The method's performance is sensitive to the choice of parameters, particularly $\gamma$ and the intermediate layer for splitting functions h and g, which may complicate practical application.
2. The presentation of the method lacks clarity, particularly in explaining the derivation of the "dual" equation and its implications.
3. The paper's structure is somewhat disordered, with insufficient emphasis on the unique contributions of the proposed method compared to existing techniques.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 3.2 to better explain the motivation and mechanics of the proposed approach. Additionally, the authors should provide a more thorough discussion of the derivation of the "dual" equation and its relevance. It would be beneficial to include a quantitative comparison with the baseline ILA to illustrate the improvements in gradient alignment. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors address the sensitivity of the method to parameter choices by providing guidance on optimal settings for $\gamma$ and the selection of intermediate layers. Lastly, a thorough proofreading is necessary to correct grammatical errors and enhance the overall presentation of the paper.
