Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on robust rating aggregation under participation bias, where ratings may not reflect all customers' views. The authors propose two novel aggregation methods: the Balanced Extremes Aggregator (BEA) for known sample sizes and the Polarizing-Averaging Aggregator (PAA) for unknown sample sizes. They demonstrate the optimality of these methods theoretically and numerically, showing that BEA closely approaches the theoretical lower bound and that PAA achieves near-optimality under asymptotic conditions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant issue in rating systems and provides practical solutions for different scenarios.
- The problem formulation is clear, and the methods are supported by rigorous theoretical derivations.
- The evaluation of BEA and PAA under varying participation probabilities demonstrates their robustness.

Weaknesses:
- The model of participation bias is simplistic, and the motivations, advantages, and limitations of this model require further development.
- There is a lack of empirical validation on real-world datasets, limiting the practical applicability of the proposed methods.
- The comparison of the novel aggregators is restricted to naive averaging, without assessing their performance against other non-naive methods addressing participation bias.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the motivations and limitations of their model of participation bias to provide a more comprehensive understanding. Additionally, we suggest that the authors validate their methods using real-world datasets to enhance the practical relevance of their findings. It would also be beneficial to compare BEA and PAA against a broader range of aggregation methods to clarify their trade-offs. Finally, providing more details on the solution algorithm for the problem in Corollary 3.3, including convergence rates and online solvability, would strengthen the paper.
