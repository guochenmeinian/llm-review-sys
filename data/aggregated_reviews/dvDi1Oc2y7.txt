### Key Points
This paper presents a Generative Boosting Training (GBT) method aimed at enhancing paraphrase identification (PI) by generating synthetic data for challenging cases where the model misclassifies. The authors augment paraphrase sentences that differ in text but share semantic meaning (IBH1) and those that are textually similar but semantically different (IBH0). The results demonstrate improvements on two PI datasets, PPQ and LCQMC, indicating the potential for broader application of GBT across various tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The GBT technique shows significant improvements and could be generally applicable to other tasks.
- The paper is well-written, easy to follow, and includes detailed examples and diagrams.
- Solid experiments on both BERT and GPT yield state-of-the-art performance compared to baseline models.
- GBT is efficient, completing in about one hour on GPU, and all source codes will be publicly available for reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks comparisons with numerous relevant baselines, particularly counterfactual data-augmentation techniques, which are essential for validating GBT's effectiveness.
- Important technical details, such as the training process for the paraphraser and the selection of the 50K examples, are unclear.
- The ablation study does not adequately isolate the contributions of IBH1 and IBH0, and the soundness of mimicking human learning processes requires further discussion.
- Some performance improvements may be attributed to the seq2seq model's language capabilities rather than GBT itself.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of technical details, particularly regarding the datasets and the training of the paraphraser for IBH0 and IBH1. Additionally, we suggest conducting a more comprehensive ablation study that isolates the effects of positive and negative paraphrases. It would also be beneficial to include comparisons with more recent state-of-the-art data augmentation methods and to analyze error ratios with corresponding examples to strengthen the motivation for GBT. Lastly, addressing the potential contributions of the seq2seq model's language abilities to performance improvements would enhance the paper's rigor.
