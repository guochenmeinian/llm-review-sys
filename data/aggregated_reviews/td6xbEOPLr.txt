Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework called FATE for conducting fairness attacks on graph learning models, formulated as a bi-level optimization problem. The authors demonstrate the framework's versatility in addressing various fairness definitions and graph learning models, supporting both continuous and discrete perturbations. Additionally, the paper provides a proof for the perturbation budget in continuous attacks, showing that for a single-step attack, the perturbation is bounded by a constant \( B \), which extends to multi-step attacks where the cumulative perturbation remains within the budget \( B \). The performance of DICE-S is evaluated, noting its implementation modifications from the original DICE to target statistical parity specifically in GCN models. The authors discuss the suboptimal performance of DICE-S, attributing it to the distribution of perturbed edges and comparing it to the more targeted FATE method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The framework effectively covers multiple fairness notions and graph learning models, demonstrating extensive experimental validation.
2. The proof for the perturbation budget is clearly articulated and mathematically sound.
3. The implementation details of DICE-S are well-explained, providing clarity on its modifications.
4. The paper is well-structured, making it easy to follow, and provides a novel approach to understanding adversarial attacks on fairness.

Weaknesses:
1. The clarity of the methodology requires improvement, particularly regarding the budget constraint's realization and its validation in the optimization procedure.
2. The IID assumption for kernel density estimation is questionable in the context of graph data.
3. Important baselines, such as a modified version of DICE based on sensitive groups, are not adequately compared.
4. The multi-step update proof may be overly reliant on the triangle inequality, potentially leading to suboptimal solutions.
5. The performance of DICE-S is noted to be suboptimal, raising concerns about its effectiveness in fairness attacks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and rationale of the methodology by providing justification for the budget constraint realization and considering projected gradient descent as a more robust alternative. Additionally, the authors should address the IID assumption in kernel density estimation and provide further justification for its applicability to graph data. It is crucial to include comparisons with a modified DICE baseline that accounts for sensitive groups and to discuss recent debiasing works that do not rely on specific fairness definitions. We also suggest improving the rigor of the multi-step update proof by addressing the potential looseness introduced by the triangle inequality. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explicitly mention the alternative solution referenced in [4] as a potential approach to the constrained optimization problem and to elaborate on the potential use of their framework for evaluating fairness defenses, as noted in [5], to inspire further research in this area. Lastly, enhancing the organization of content by including baseline method descriptions in the main text and expanding discussions on the limitations of the work would be beneficial.
