Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for continual learning that utilizes Mahalanobis distance instead of Euclidean distance to better handle the heterogeneity of new class distributions. The authors evaluate their approach across various continual learning settings, including many-shot and few-shot class-incremental learning, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method incorporates techniques such as covariance normalization, covariance shrinkage, and Tukeyâ€™s transformation to enhance covariance matrix estimation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear motivation and validation of the methodology.
2. The proposed method outperforms existing approaches without requiring the storage of previous samples.
3. The evaluation includes thorough ablation studies and a rich set of experiments supporting the claims.

Weaknesses:
1. The reliance on a pre-trained model raises concerns about its effectiveness in different class-incremental learning settings, particularly when training from scratch.
2. The novelty of the proposed method is somewhat diminished due to the combination of established techniques.
3. The absence of error bars in the results limits confidence in the findings, which is a common practice in incremental learning research.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical evaluations by including results from training from scratch to assess the method's robustness across different settings. Additionally, we suggest providing a theoretical discussion on the observed Gaussian-like distribution of seen classes versus the non-Gaussian distribution of unseen classes. Clarifying the derivation of Equation (6) and addressing the use of the norm of Y would enhance understanding. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include implementation guidelines with pseudo code for better reproducibility.
