### Key Points
This paper presents a study of learning-augmented online algorithms with limited access to predictions, focusing on three problems: the ski-rental problem, the secretary problem, and non-clairvoyant scheduling. For the ski-rental problem, the authors propose algorithms that utilize noisy queries about the best time to rent, achieving competitive ratios that improve as the correctness probability approaches 1. In the secretary problem, they develop an algorithm that selects the best item with a probability of 1/e, contingent on a limited number of queries. The non-clairvoyant scheduling problem is framed as $B$-clairvoyant scheduling, where the scheduler can query exact job sizes, with a competitive ratio that interpolates between non-clairvoyant and fully clairvoyant settings. The paper includes experimental results on synthetic data to support the theoretical findings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents a well-motivated framework that is likely to inspire further research.
- The results are non-trivial and technically sound, particularly the interesting findings on the secretary problem and non-clairvoyant scheduling.
- Experimental figures enhance understanding of the results.

Weaknesses:
- The claim regarding the ski-rental algorithm's ability to choose the best query time lacks a general argument, relying on specific examples.
- The techniques for ski-rental and non-clairvoyant scheduling are extensions of prior work, raising questions about novelty.
- There is a disconnect between the probabilistic nature of the first two problems and the exact predictions used in scheduling, suggesting a need for a more unified framework.
- The absence of lower bounds for the ski-rental and secretary problems limits the robustness of the results.
- Experiments primarily confirm theoretical predictions without exploring real data, which would strengthen the assumptions made.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity on how the ski-rental algorithm determines the optimal query time, providing a general argument rather than relying on specific cases. Additionally, addressing the novelty of the proposed techniques in relation to existing literature would enhance the paper's contribution. We suggest unifying the framework across the three problems to eliminate the disconnect between probabilistic predictions and exact values. Providing evidence for the tightness of results, particularly for the ski-rental and secretary problems, would strengthen the theoretical claims. Finally, conducting experiments on real data would provide further validation of the assumptions regarding prediction accuracy.
