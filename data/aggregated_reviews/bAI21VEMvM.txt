Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a model-oblivious query-efficient black-box model extraction attack, achieved by solving a distributionally equivalent and max-information model extraction problem. The authors develop an active sampling-based query selection algorithm, MARICH, which selects the most informative queries to maximize entropy and minimize the mismatch between the target and stolen models. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and query efficiency of the proposed method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a novel notion of distributional equivalence extraction, extending existing notions of task accuracy and functionally equivalent model extractions, with theoretical demonstrations linking optimization problems to entropy maximization and model mismatch reduction.
2. The experimental setup addresses general doubts, enhancing the credibility of the proposed method.
3. The paper's layout is elegant, with a clear structure and logical progression, making it enjoyable and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
1. The datasets used for training the target model are considered simple, limiting the robustness of the findings.
2. Despite emphasizing the extraction of publicly available APIs, there are no experiments demonstrating the extraction of models deployed in real-world APIs.
3. The writing and organization could be improved, particularly in presenting related work as a separate section and clarifying results in Table 1.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental scope by including more complex datasets, such as ImageNet or its subsets, to enhance the robustness of their findings. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments that specifically target real-world APIs to provide practical evidence of the method's applicability. The authors should also consider reorganizing the writing for clarity, particularly by presenting related work distinctly and improving the presentation of results in Table 1. Finally, a discussion on the limitations and potential societal impacts of the work should be included to provide a comprehensive view of the research.
