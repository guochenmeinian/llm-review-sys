### Key Points
This paper presents MM-NIAH (Needle In A Multimodal Haystack), a benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal large language models' (MLLMs) comprehension of long multimodal documents. It addresses a significant gap in MLLM evaluation methods and offers insights into the capabilities and limitations of current models. The benchmark includes tasks that assess retrieval, counting, and reasoning, utilizing both text and image "needles" across a relatively large-scale dataset of 12k samples.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The MM-NIAH benchmark is the first specifically tailored for long multimodal document comprehension, filling a critical gap in evaluation.
- It employs an innovative approach to assess both text and image understanding within a unified framework.
- The evaluation includes both open-source and proprietary models, providing a comprehensive analysis of model performance.

Weaknesses:
- Some NIAH tasks may be too challenging, leading to limited differentiation between model performances.
- There is a lack of detailed information regarding the generation of question-answer pairs, which raises questions about their diversity and relevance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the depth of error analysis to elucidate how and why current MLLMs fail. Additionally, clarifying the rationale for using synthetic images instead of natural document images could strengthen the paper. The authors should also enhance document statistics, particularly regarding needle placement and document lengths. It would be beneficial to include a plot or figure illustrating text-only needle evaluations for models before and after multimodal fine-tuning. Finally, providing more details on the implementation of the RAG model and addressing the clarity of figures and claims regarding context length would enhance the overall quality of the paper.
