Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative framework called Image Textualization (IT) that aims to automatically generate high-quality, detailed image descriptions by leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and multiple visual expert models. The authors propose a pipeline that generates a base description, verifies object presence, and integrates fine-grained attributes to produce more reliable captions. Their experimental setup demonstrates that MLLMs trained using the IT framework significantly improve the richness of image descriptions, reducing hallucinations and enhancing downstream performance on related tasks. Additionally, the authors express gratitude for reviewer feedback and acknowledge the need to address typographical errors in their work.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The IT framework effectively integrates MLLM semantic understanding with visual expert detail recognition, producing comprehensive and detailed descriptions.
- The proposed evaluation benchmarks, such as DID-Bench and D2I-Bench, provide reliable tools for assessing description quality.
- The paper is well-written and clear, making it accessible to readers.
- The authors demonstrate a willingness to address reviewer concerns and improve the quality of their paper.

Weaknesses:
- The computational intensity of the IT framework may limit accessibility for researchers with fewer resources, and no specific analysis of its cost-effectiveness is provided.
- The framework's generalizability to diverse image datasets remains unverified, necessitating further validation.
- The assessment metrics proposed may not comprehensively cover all aspects of description quality, and some may introduce subjectivity.
- Potential ethical concerns, such as misuse for misinformation and biases in generated descriptions, are not adequately discussed.
- The current version contains typographical errors that need correction.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by providing a datasheet or data card, as this is crucial for transparency and reproducibility. Additionally, a flowchart illustrating the dataset generation process would enhance clarity. The authors should also address the computational costs associated with the IT framework and explore its generalizability across different image datasets. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors discuss the potential biases introduced by the models used and consider additional metrics to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of description quality. Lastly, including a qualitative assessment of generated images would provide deeper insights into the framework's performance. We also recommend that the authors thoroughly update the identified typographical errors to enhance clarity and professionalism, and consider the reviewer's feedback comprehensively to potentially raise their score.
