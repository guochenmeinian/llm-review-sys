Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents theoretical guarantees for diffusion flow matching (DFM), a generative model similar to score-based generative models (SGM). It provides an upper bound on the KL divergence between the target distribution and the one learned by DFM, promoting a deeper theoretical understanding of discretized flow matching models. The authors replace the Lipschitz condition on the score function with a relative Fisher information condition, requiring weaker assumptions than prior works.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper is clearly written, with sound proofs and a well-motivated presentation of guarantees for DFMs, which are novel compared to existing analyses of DDPM or probability flow ODE.  
2. The authors effectively exploit properties of the heat kernel in their estimation procedure, and their results extend to early-stopping settings.

Weaknesses:  
1. Assumption H1 is quite strong, requiring both source and target distributions to have finite 8-th moments.  
2. The procedure appears standard compared to theoretical work on SGM, and the dimension-dependence in the results is poor, although acknowledged as a future work avenue.  
3. Some aspects of the presentation, particularly the comparison with SGMs, may be unclear, and there are several typographical errors throughout the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the relationship between SGMs and DFMs, perhaps by adding a few words early in the paper to clarify that SGMs are a sub-case of DFMs. Additionally, addressing the strong nature of assumption H1 and exploring ways to relax it would enhance the paper's impact. We also suggest correcting the identified typographical errors to improve overall presentation quality.
