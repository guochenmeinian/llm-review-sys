### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into auction mechanisms for budget-constrained bidders with unknown prior distributions. The authors explore various auction formats, including bid-discount and pacing first and second-price auctions, alongside the Bayesian revenue-optimal auction. The central findings indicate that the Bayesian revenue-optimal auction is strategically equivalent to the budget-extracting bid-discount first-price auction, and that first and second-price auctions exhibit strategic equivalence under symmetric conditions. Additionally, the bid-discount first-price auction demonstrates superior revenue outcomes when bidders are not strategic.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The model addresses a relevant issue in auction design, particularly for platforms that lack knowledge of prior value distributions.
- The strategic equivalence results provide a compelling rationale for the shift towards first-price auctions by major platforms.
- The paper offers a comprehensive analysis of auction formats, yielding significant theoretical insights.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical nature of the paper raises questions about the practical applicability of the findings to real-world scenarios.
- The model's assumptions regarding unassured priors may not fully capture practical auction dynamics.
- A clearer roadmap of results and intuitive explanations for the technical proofs would enhance reader comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing a higher-level overview of the results and more intuitive explanations of the proofs, which are quite technical. Additionally, addressing the practical implications of the theoretical insights would strengthen the paper's relevance. Finally, clarifying the definitions of terms such as "utility-revenue profile" and ensuring consistency in terminology would benefit the reader's understanding.
