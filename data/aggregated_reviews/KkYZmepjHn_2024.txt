Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a discrete non-Markov diffusion model (DNDM) aimed at accelerating the sampling process in discrete diffusion models, particularly for absorbing diffusion processes. The authors propose a non-Markovian forward process that allows for a single transition per token, thereby skipping redundant steps and significantly speeding up sampling. DNDM employs a selective sampling strategy that enhances computational efficiency and demonstrates improved results in machine translation and unconditional text generation tasks compared to prior methods. The authors argue that while the forward processes of DNDM and D3PM are equivalent under certain conditions, the reverse sampling algorithms differ significantly, and they assert that DNDM is not merely a special case of DDIM, highlighting fundamental differences in their approaches to multinomial diffusion.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method clearly enhances sampling speed and results over standard multinomial and absorbing-state diffusion models.
- The paper provides a detailed comparison between DNDM and existing algorithms, clarifying the unique aspects of DNDM's sampling process.
- Promising experimental results demonstrate DNDM's effectiveness, particularly in the context of absorbing diffusion.
- The framework is straightforward and user-friendly, facilitating implementation in existing models.

Weaknesses:
- The method bears similarities to prior works, suggesting a need for deeper analysis of potential speed improvements and theoretical connections.
- Concerns remain regarding the use of the term "Non-Markov," which some reviewers find misleading, particularly in the context of the absorbing process.
- The claim that DNDM can accelerate sampling due to its non-Markov nature is contested, with reviewers suggesting that this assertion may mislead the community.
- Results from fewer steps in experiments would provide a clearer picture of practical benefits, as current data primarily showcases advantages at larger step counts.
- The complexity of the process may hinder understanding and implementation; additional details or visualizations on transition time distribution would be beneficial.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the method's relationship with existing approaches, particularly addressing the similarities with methods from Campbell et al. and Hoogeboom et al. We suggest including results from fewer sampling steps to better illustrate the method's practical advantages. Additionally, we recommend improving the clarity of their terminology, particularly regarding the "Non-Markov" label, to avoid confusion and potential misinterpretation. We encourage the authors to provide a more thorough explanation of the effectiveness of DNDM, addressing the concerns raised about its relationship to DDIM and the implications of its sampling strategy. Including comparisons with other fast sampling methods beyond the RDM baseline would also strengthen the paper. Finally, we suggest toning down claims of being the "first training-free acceleration method" to better align with the existing literature.
