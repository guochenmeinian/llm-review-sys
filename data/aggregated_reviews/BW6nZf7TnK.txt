Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents mip-Grid, a method that integrates anti-aliasing techniques into grid-based representations for radiance fields. The authors propose generating multiple grids through convolution operations applied to a shared single-scale grid representation, utilizing scale-aware coordinates for feature retrieval. This approach aims to mitigate aliasing artifacts while maintaining fast training times, showing improvements over existing methods like mip-NeRF, TensoRF, and K-Planes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The study addresses a significant problem in rendering, providing promising results that could benefit the community.
2. The method is straightforward, leveraging a single-scale grid and scale-aware positional encoding, making it broadly applicable.
3. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear evaluations demonstrating improvements in anti-aliasing.

Weaknesses:
1. The comparison with multi-resolution/multi-scale baselines is limited; including methods like Instant-NGP and original K-Planes would strengthen the analysis.
2. The analysis in Section 3.2 regarding multi-scale and multi-resolution lacks clarity and requires further elaboration.
3. The use of consistent kernel sizes across scales raises questions about optimization and effectiveness; larger kernels for lower resolutions may be more appropriate.
4. The lack of experiments on unbounded scenes, such as Mip-NeRF 360, limits the paper's contribution.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison by including more baselines, particularly those utilizing multi-scale/resolution methods. Additionally, elaborating on the analysis in Section 3.2 would clarify the relationship between multi-scale and multi-resolution approaches. It would also be beneficial to visualize the kernel weights to understand the filtering patterns learned. Finally, addressing the limitations regarding unbounded scenes and providing more detailed evaluations would enhance the paper's impact.
