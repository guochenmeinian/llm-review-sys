### Key Points
This paper presents a novel anomaly detection method called ContraMTD, which employs contrastive learning to identify malicious network traffic. The approach integrates local and global features through modules that analyze traffic interactions and utilizes K-means clustering for sample pair formation. The method is evaluated against seven state-of-the-art techniques across three datasets, demonstrating competitive performance, particularly on the CICIDS2018 dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
+ The application of contrastive learning for malware traffic detection is innovative and less explored.
+ The method effectively combines local and global interaction features for anomaly detection.
+ Comprehensive evaluation across three datasets and comparison with seven existing techniques.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed technique exhibits high false alarm rates on two datasets, raising concerns about practical deployment.
- The reliance on K-means clustering for sample pair formation may introduce sensitivity to its performance.
- The paper lacks comparisons with simple baseline methods, which could enhance the expressiveness of results.
- Missing details regarding dataset preprocessing and experimental settings hinder the assessment of soundness.
- The absence of experiments with adaptive attackers leaves uncertainty about the robustness of the proposed system.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the operational mode of the proposed scheme, specifying whether it is intended for online or offline intrusion detection. Additionally, the authors should include comparisons with simple baseline methods to demonstrate the necessity of their complex approach. It would be beneficial to provide more detailed information on dataset preprocessing to avoid biases and to clarify the adversary model, including capabilities and location. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors address the high false alarm rates by refining the model or exploring alternative clustering methods. Lastly, the authors should ensure that all datasets are clearly described, particularly the self-collected dataset, to enhance reproducibility.
