Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of the offline contextual bandit problem, focusing on a class of reward estimators that regularize Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS). The authors provide a general concentration result for these estimators, leading to a new Logarithmic Smoothing (LS) estimator that is designed to be pessimistic, making it applicable for policy evaluation and learning in a Bayesian context. The experimental results indicate the estimator's effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed estimator is novel and exhibits beneficial properties.
2. The smoothness of the estimator suggests ease of optimization.
3. The application to contextual bandits is noteworthy.
4. Positive experimental results support the findings.
5. The writing is clear and well-structured.

Weaknesses:
1. There is a lack of explicit comparison with existing concentration/contextual bandit bounds, making claims of superiority vague for non-experts.
2. The reference to deriving results from [1, Lemma 1.3] raises questions about whether the LS estimator is novel or merely an alternative proof technique.
3. Performance metrics appear closely aligned with those of IX.
4. The main body lacks explanations of the techniques used, such as a proof sketch for the concentration bound or comparisons with existing methods.
5. The notation U(pi) is introduced without definition, necessitating clarification within the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explicit comparison with existing concentration/contextual bandit bounds to clarify the advantages of their approach. Additionally, please clarify whether the LS estimator is a novel contribution or an alternative proof technique. We suggest including a discussion of the techniques used, such as a proof sketch for the concentration bound, to enhance understanding. Furthermore, please define the notation U(pi) within the paper for completeness. Lastly, consider addressing the potential confusion surrounding the abbreviation LS, which is commonly associated with Least Squares, by providing an alternative name.
