Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for mobile robots to efficiently search for objects in partially known environments using a POMDP framework. The authors propose a novel planning algorithm, the Growing Partially Observable Monte-Carlo Planner (GPOMCP), which reuses the belief tree and incorporates a "fake object" to guide the search. The system is evaluated through simulations in Gazebo, demonstrating improved performance over a POMCP baseline across various scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed system outperforms the baseline in several experiments.
- The authors provide a comprehensive explanation of their approach, including action execution using ROS interfaces and object detection techniques.
- The simulation results indicate that the GPOMCP Planner effectively locates target objects with fewer steps.

Weaknesses:
- The Prior Work section lacks references to significant precedents in the robotics literature, particularly regarding the challenge of fully occluded objects, which is commonly referred to as "Mechanical Search."
- The paper does not include a dedicated Limitations section, which is essential for acceptance.
- The terminology "fake object" is confusing and may be better described as "hidden object." Additionally, the paper requires clearer English and more detailed descriptions of experimental conditions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the Prior Work section by incorporating relevant literature on Mechanical Search and related POMDP approaches. Additionally, we suggest including a dedicated Limitations section to address potential shortcomings of the proposed method. The authors should clarify the use of the term "fake object" and consider replacing it with "hidden object." Furthermore, we advise enhancing the clarity of the paper through careful proofreading and providing more detailed descriptions of the experiments, particularly regarding the object positions and the evolution of the distribution under the "Covered" condition.
