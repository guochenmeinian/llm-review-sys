### Key Points
This paper presents MeLoDy, a diffusion-based text-to-music generation system that integrates Language Models (LMs) and Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs). The proposed method aims to achieve faster-than-real-time music generation while addressing the high computational costs associated with existing models like MusicLM and Noise2Music. The system comprises four components: the MuLan contrastive model, semantic language modeling via Wav2Vec2-Conformer, a dual-path diffusion model for latent generation, and a 1D VAE-GAN for latent representation learning. The authors claim that MeLoDy improves inference speed and quality but shows limitations in musicality and text correlation. Additionally, the paper includes a comparison of time costs for generating music using different language models, providing empirical evidence that DPD significantly reduces generation time, achieving speeds approximately 22x to 63x faster than coarse and fine acoustic LMs on a V100 GPU.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The dual-path diffusion model is innovative and could serve as an effective alternative to existing diffusion models.  
2. The paper addresses the critical issue of efficiency in music generation, which is often overlooked.  
3. The authors provide substantial subjective evaluations, demonstrating the quality of generated samples.  
4. The inclusion of empirical data strengthens the argument for DPD's efficiency.  
5. The detailed comparison of time costs for various LMs provides clear insights into performance differences.

Weaknesses:  
1. The paper's structure could be optimized, as important experimental results are relegated to the appendix, making them less accessible.  
2. The evaluation lacks comprehensive comparisons with baseline methods, particularly regarding musicality and text fidelity.  
3. The rationale behind certain design choices, such as the dual-path architecture and the use of an angle parameterization for the diffusion schedule, is insufficiently justified.  
4. The complexity of the system, with numerous components and hyperparameters, raises concerns about reproducibility and clarity.  
5. The authors acknowledge that additional experiments, such as the "teaching forcing" strategy and further analysis on VAE-GAN, may not be completed due to time constraints.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper's structure by integrating key experimental results into the main body rather than the appendix. Additionally, a more thorough evaluation comparing the proposed method with baseline approaches is necessary to address concerns about musicality and text correlation. We suggest providing clearer justifications for design choices, particularly regarding the dual-path diffusion model and the angle parameterization. Enhancing the clarity of the system description, especially in Section 4, would facilitate better understanding and reproducibility. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors ensure that the additional empirical evidence on time costs is clearly presented in the final version and prioritize completing the experiments related to the "teaching forcing" strategy and the analysis on VAE-GAN, if feasible, to enhance the depth of their findings.
