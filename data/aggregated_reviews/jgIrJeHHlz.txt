Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents two methods to address the Janus problem in zero-shot text-to-3D generation, focusing on debiasing score-distillation frameworks. The first method, score debiasing, involves truncating scores from 2D diffusion models, while the second, prompt debiasing, uses a language model to identify and adjust conflicting words in prompts. The authors provide both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, including an ablation study.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for addressing the Janus problem is compelling and relevant.
- The paper is well-written and presents technically sound methods.
- The proposed strategies are novel and demonstrate potential effectiveness in alleviating the Janus problem.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the methods is somewhat limited, as they appear more as optimization tricks than systematic solutions.
- The integration of debiasing methods lacks elegant co-formulation, and the qualitative results do not show significant improvements.
- The experiments are limited in scope, using only 70 prompts, which raises questions about the robustness of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental evaluation by reporting the success rate of generation, specifically how many of the 70 prompts successfully avoid the Janus problem. Additionally, we suggest conducting a dedicated experiment on Score Debiasing to clarify its effectiveness compared to Prompt Debiasing. It would also be beneficial to explore the applicability of the proposed methods to more complex 3D structures and other recent methods like ProlificDreamer and Magic3D. Finally, consider including quantitative comparisons with these methods to strengthen the paper's contributions.
