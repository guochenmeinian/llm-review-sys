### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for constructing and exploring spatial-temporal Knowledge Graphs (KGs) by integrating spatial and temporal data. The authors propose a 3-step embedding method aimed at enhancing prediction accuracy and recommendation relevance. The framework is evaluated using two datasets, demonstrating its efficacy in prediction tasks and interpretability. However, the evaluation lacks comprehensive comparisons with the latest state-of-the-art models and validation across diverse datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces a novel framework for Spatial-Temporal Knowledge Graphs, enhancing prediction accuracy and recommendation relevance.  
- It is well organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow.  
- The application of spatial-temporal KGs is meaningful in real-world scenarios.  
- The authors demonstrate a clear understanding of existing limitations in current approaches.  

Weaknesses:  
- The evaluation is limited by outdated benchmarks, with the most advanced model referenced being ST-GCN from 2017.  
- The framework's generalizability across different datasets and domains is unclear, with validation limited to only two datasets.  
- The paper lacks a detailed discussion of related literature and does not adequately explain the novelty and contributions of the proposed method.  
- There is insufficient experimentation on memory cost and a lack of comparisons with more recent spatiotemporal models.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by benchmarking against more recent state-of-the-art models, such as GraphWaveNet, ST-SSL, and AGCRN, to validate the proposed framework's effectiveness. Additionally, conducting experiments on a broader range of datasets, including UUKG, would strengthen the claims of efficiency and accuracy. The authors should provide a clearer outline of their contributions in the introduction and include a more comprehensive review of related literature. Clarifying the specific challenges of embedding spatiotemporal elements into knowledge graphs and discussing the limitations of their approach would enhance the paper's clarity. Finally, we suggest releasing the processed KG datasets to promote reproducibility in the research community.
