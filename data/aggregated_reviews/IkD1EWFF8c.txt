Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical and experimental investigation into enhancing the transferability of targeted adversarial attacks by adding perturbations towards High-Sample-Density-Regions (HSDR) of the target class. The authors propose a novel method for identifying samples within HSDR, circumventing the impracticality of density estimation in high-dimensional data. The proposed Easy Sample Matching Attack (ESMA) demonstrates significant improvements over existing generative attacks, both in effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the authors propose a method that optimizes training epochs for source models, specifically Res50 and Res152, by adopting an early-stopping approach, suggesting a training epoch limit of 300 due to minimal performance improvement beyond 350 epochs. They plan to report results for 350 epochs across all cases in response to reviewer feedback and clarify the calculation of training duration for their proposed method and TTP to ensure fairness in comparisons.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The experiments effectively demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ESMA, which significantly outperforms baseline methods.
- The concept of directing perturbations towards HSDR is both innovative and well-supported by theoretical analysis.
- The paper provides solid theoretical insights into the behavior of deep learning models within HSDR.
- The authors effectively address reviewer concerns regarding training epochs and performance.
- Clear methodology for calculating training duration enhances the transparency of the results.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks discussion or comparison with recent transfer-based attacks, which diminishes its contextual relevance.
- The experimental scope is limited, with only two tables presented; more extensive ablation studies are necessary to validate the claims.
- There is insufficient validation of whether the generated adversarial examples truly reside within HSDR, raising questions about the attribution of transferability improvements.
- Some reviewers still seek clarification on specific concepts, such as the relationship between HSDR and "low loss and low loss gradients."
- The writing contains grammatical errors and unclear notation, particularly in Section 3, which affects readability.
- The paper may benefit from further polishing to improve clarity for readers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including additional ablation studies to verify the effectiveness of their method, such as investigating the impact of using difficult samples for target anchor sets. Additionally, the authors should compare their method with recent works on transfer-based attacks to provide a more comprehensive context. Clarifying the relationship between HSDR and the concepts of "low loss and low loss gradients" would enhance reader comprehension. Finally, addressing the grammatical issues and improving the clarity of notation in the paper will significantly benefit its presentation, and further polishing based on the feedback received will enhance overall readability.
