Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an improved algorithm for estimating the mean of a multivariate Gaussian random variable under the Huber contamination model, achieving an optimal sample complexity of \(d/\varepsilon^2\) and near-linear runtime. The authors combine techniques from Diakonikolas et al. and Pensia et al. to enhance the sample complexity and error rates. Additionally, the paper introduces a linear-sample algorithm for robust Gaussian linear regression by reducing it to a robust mean estimation problem. The results address fundamental questions in robust statistics, particularly regarding Gaussian estimation and linear regression.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a significant problem in robust statistics, providing an optimal algorithm that is of high interest to the community.  
- The writing is clear and friendly, making complex concepts more accessible.  
- The proof techniques and novel reduction for Gaussian linear regression are strong contributions.  

Weaknesses:  
- The theoretical nature of the paper lacks practical application examples, which could enhance understanding of the algorithm's performance.  
- The mathematical proofs are dense, making it challenging to verify claims thoroughly.  
- Some notations are inconsistent, and the paper does not address the limitations of the analysis clearly.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the practical applicability of their work by including case studies or simulations that demonstrate the algorithm's performance across various distributions. Additionally, clarifying the conditions and assumptions in the introduction would enhance the reader's understanding. Addressing the challenges of extending the work to stronger contamination models would also be beneficial. Finally, ensuring consistent notation throughout the paper will improve clarity.
