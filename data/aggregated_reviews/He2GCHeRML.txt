Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a principled active learning (AL) paradigm designed to address the annotation challenges of 3D molecular graphs. The authors propose a novel diversity component for 3D molecular graphs, which is shown to be at least as expressive as the Geometric Weisfeiler-Lehman (GWL) test. Additionally, they develop a Bayesian geometric graph neural network (BGGNN) to compute uncertainties for 3D molecular graphs, integrating these components into a quadratic programming (QP) formulation for sample selection. The authors clarify that their graph formalism considers elements, which is crucial for distinguishing between different molecules. They emphasize that their method outperforms traditional descriptors like SOAP by providing a global 3D geometric descriptor that incorporates chemical contexts. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed AL approach and demonstrate the superiority of their method over existing baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of innovative 3D graph isometries significantly enhances the expressiveness of the method.
- The integration of diversity and uncertainty in the selection process is a significant contribution to the field of molecular learning.
- The methodology is well-supported by theoretical proofs, and the motivation is clearly articulated.
- Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate improvements over existing baselines, with statistical analyses reinforcing the validity of the results.
- The authors have effectively addressed reviewer concerns, leading to improved clarity and understanding of their methodology.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity on certain terms such as "USR" and "GSL," hindering comprehension.
- Some reviewers remain unclear about the treatment of molecular graphs with different elements, questioning the definition of diversity versus uncertainty.
- Claims made in the paper are sometimes overly strong and require more nuanced justification.
- The experimental scope is limited to QM9 and MD17 datasets, leaving the performance on larger datasets untested.
- The proposed 48-dimensional vector is purely geometry-based, neglecting the chemical context of molecular interactions.
- Despite clarifications, there is still a need for further explanation regarding the formalism used in the graph representation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of terminology by providing detailed explanations for "USR" and "GSL." Additionally, we suggest that the authors justify their strong claims with more evidence and nuanced discussions. Improving the clarity of their graph formalism to explicitly differentiate between diversity and uncertainty in molecular selection would be beneficial. Expanding the experimental evaluation to include larger datasets and relevant baselines, such as BatchBALD, would help clarify the source of performance improvements. Furthermore, addressing the limitations related to the purely geometric nature of the 48-dimensional vector and its implications for chemical properties would enhance the paper's depth. Finally, we encourage the authors to include all experimental results from Section 4.4 in the appendix for completeness, and providing more detailed examples or visualizations could help address lingering concerns about the treatment of molecular graphs with varying elements.
