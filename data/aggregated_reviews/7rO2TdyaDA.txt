### Key Points
This paper presents a Bayesian mixture model for temporal point processes that incorporates a repulsive determinantal point process (DPP) prior to enhance cluster diversity. The authors develop a specialized conditional Gibbs posterior sampling algorithm for Bayesian inference on model parameters. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method yields fewer yet more diverse mixture components and performs competitively on evaluation metrics. The paper is well-structured, with a clear motivation and a solid technical foundation, and includes an anonymous code repository for transparency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for exploring alternative priors for temporal point processes is well-articulated.
- The authors demonstrate significant thought in developing efficient inference methods, potentially laying the groundwork for further advancements.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental results are limited, with comparisons made against only one baseline model, the Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM), which do not convincingly support claims of "outstanding" performance.
- The clarity and structure of the paper require significant improvement, particularly in presenting experimental results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by comparing TP$^2$DP$^2$ against more than one alternative baseline model. If specific claims about experimental performance are made, these should be substantiated with significant results included in the body of the paper or through a comprehensive quantitative summary. To facilitate this, we suggest summarizing Algorithm 1 by removing display-math and providing the full mathematical form in the appendix. 

The body of the paper, especially Section **3 Proposed TP$^2$DP$^2$ Model & Corresponding Posterior Inference Algorithm**, requires significant restructuring for clarity. We suggest adding paragraph breaks at key points to enhance readability. Additionally, in Section **D.1 Experiments on Mixtures of Hawkes Processes**, we advise revising claims about performance consistency, as the current plots do not support the assertion that TP$^2$DP$^2$ consistently outperforms DMHP.

In the "Broader Impacts" section, we urge the authors to reconsider their claim regarding societal impacts, especially in light of the potential implications of their algorithm in healthcare decision-making contexts. 

For minor improvements, we suggest enhancing the informativeness of t-SNE plots in Appendix Section *A*, adding error estimates to the ELL metric in Table 3, and providing clearer qualitative comparisons in Appendix Section **D.3 Experiments on Real-World Datasets**. Lastly, we recommend a thorough review of wording for clarity and grammatical accuracy throughout the paper.
