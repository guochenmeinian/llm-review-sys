Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework utilizing directed hypergraphs to represent the structural properties of probability distributions, extending concepts from Bayesian networks. The authors propose a notion of QIM (qualitatively independent mechanism) compatibility, which encompasses functional dependencies beyond traditional conditional independencies. The paper demonstrates the utility of QIM compatibility in causal models and information theory, establishing equivalences with randomized probabilistic structural equation models (PSEMs) and introducing a qualitative scoring function for probabilistic dependency graphs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and insightful, clearly articulating the problem and proposed solutions. It effectively conveys the value of probabilistic hypergraphs in understanding causal models and their connection to information theory.  
- The inclusion of examples throughout the paper aids comprehension and motivation.

Weaknesses:  
- The contributions relative to existing literature are unclear, particularly regarding the redefinition of probabilistic dependency graphs (PDGs) and the necessity of Proposition 3.  
- There is a lack of practical use cases and real-world examples to illustrate the applicability of the proposed framework.  
- The paper could benefit from a discussion on the computational complexity of the scoring functions and a clearer delineation between prior work and the authors' contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions by explicitly distinguishing between background literature and their novel contributions, particularly around Definition 2. Additionally, we suggest removing Proposition 3 if its value is not clearly articulated. The authors should include practical examples that illustrate the types of settings where QIM compatibility is relevant, as well as a discussion on the computational complexity of the scoring functions. Finally, enhancing the literature review to highlight the limitations of prior work and the distinctions of this paper would strengthen the overall presentation.
