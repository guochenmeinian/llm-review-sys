Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an online baseline for temporal action segmentation (TAS) built upon a causal TCN, integrating a GRU, attention-based feature aggregation, and a memory bank. It also proposes a heuristic online post-processing method. The authors claim their framework is the first fully-supervised online approach for TAS, featuring a context-aware feature augmentation (CFA) module and an adaptive memory bank. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three TAS benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The contribution as a baseline for action segmentation is modest yet accurate, providing a reasonable online solution for this meaningful task.
2. The proposed post-processing method is intuitive and effectively addresses over-segmentation issues.
3. The experiments and ablation studies yield good results, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.

Weaknesses:
1. A major concern is the lack of reported inference speed, which is crucial for real-time applications. The authors mention this in the limitations but do not provide specific metrics such as frames per second (FPS).
2. The novelty of the adaptive memory bank is questionable, as similar mechanisms have been explored in video object segmentation tasks.
3. The paper lacks a thorough discussion of computational complexity and resource requirements, which are critical for assessing real-time applicability.
4. The qualitative error analysis is insufficient; a detailed examination of failure cases could provide valuable insights.
5. The performance gap between online and offline methods remains significant, and the authors should clarify why offline models are used as baselines.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on real-time inference speed by providing specific metrics such as FPS and end-to-end latency. Additionally, a comparative analysis of computational requirements with offline methods and other online tasks would enhance the paper's robustness. We suggest including a qualitative error analysis to identify failure cases and guide future improvements. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the novelty of the adaptive memory bank and consider exploring overlapping clips in semi-online inference for potentially better results. Lastly, addressing the performance gap with offline methods and justifying the use of offline models as baselines would strengthen the paper's contributions.
