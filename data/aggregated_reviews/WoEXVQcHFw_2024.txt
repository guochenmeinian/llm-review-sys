Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel multi-objective optimization algorithm (UMOD) that aims to generate a uniform set of solutions on the Pareto front (PF) by introducing the concept of fill distance as a metric for uniformity. The authors propose a multi-objective algorithm that utilizes a surrogate problem to optimize fill distance and employs a neural network to model the PF. The theoretical analysis addresses the challenge of ensuring diversity in solutions, which has been underexplored compared to convergence in multi-objective optimization (MOO). Additionally, the authors provide a comparative analysis of UMOD against LSSA, demonstrating that UMOD outperforms LSSA on various performance metrics, particularly Inverted Generational Distance (IGD), across multiple test problems. They also report that reducing function evaluations (FEs) from 40,000 to 15,000 does not significantly impact performance and propose methods for further reducing FEs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of the fill distance metric and a surrogate objective function contributes to the theoretical understanding of uniformity in MOO.
- UMOD shows superior performance compared to LSSA and other existing methods on multiple benchmark problems, particularly in uniformity indicators and IGD.
- Comprehensive empirical evaluations support the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, and the authors provide clear explanations of their methodology and results.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of UMOD is questioned, particularly regarding the fill distance, which resembles the established IGD metric.
- Concerns about the efficiency of UMOD arise due to reliance on neural networks and the high fitness evaluation budget, which may limit its practicality.
- The empirical study primarily utilizes small population sizes and simplistic test problems, limiting the generalizability and robustness of the results.
- Discrepancies in reported results, particularly for DTLZ5 and DTLZ6, due to a bug in the IGD calculation, raise concerns about the reliability of findings.
- The paper lacks a thorough comparison of fill distance with existing uniformity metrics and does not adequately address the limitations of the proposed method, particularly in handling disconnected Pareto fronts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty aspect of the fill distance by clarifying its distinct advantages over IGD and addressing its limitations in capturing overall solution distribution. Additionally, the authors should enhance the experimental robustness by including more complex test problems, such as DTLZ1, and consider using larger population sizes to better approximate irregular Pareto fronts. Clarifying the calculation methodology for IGD and ensuring consistency in reported results will also enhance the paper's credibility. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to include a more comprehensive literature review discussing related work in weight adaptation mechanisms and subset selection methods. We suggest summarizing the limitations of UMOD more thoroughly, particularly regarding its performance with larger populations and challenges associated with disconnected Pareto fronts. Lastly, we recommend conducting sensitivity analyses regarding the neural network's architecture and initialization methods, and providing a complete codebase for UMOD, including all necessary libraries, to facilitate reproducibility and further research.
