### Key Points
This paper presents a novel multi-step discretization method for stochastic differential equations (SDEs), specifically targeting Langevin diffusions and the denoising diffusion model SDE. The authors establish that the rates achieved surpass existing guarantees in KL divergence. Additionally, they introduce the Poisson Midpoint Method (PMM), which is inspired by the randomized midpoint method and offers theoretical and practical benefits for sampling.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed discretization method is completely novel, and the analytic framework utilizing Central Limit Theorem (CLT) type arguments is unprecedented in this context.  
- The rates achieved are state-of-the-art in KL divergence, significantly exceeding previous methods without caveats.  
- The experimental evidence supports the claim that this discretization outperforms naive methods in diffusion model applications.  
- The originality of the PMM is noteworthy, as it introduces a randomized midpoint discretization that operates under weaker conditions than existing sampling methods.  

Weaknesses:  
- The algorithm's description is cumbersome, making it challenging to read; simpler exposition or visual aids may enhance clarity.  
- The rates obtained are inferior to those of randomized midpoint discretizations, which are only valid in Wasserstein distance.  
- The writing quality is inconsistent, with several definitions and procedures lacking clarity, and some theoretical results using inconsistent terminology.  
- The dependence of final rates on key parameters is peculiar, and the authors should clarify whether these rates are close to optimal or if improvements are feasible with minor algorithmic adjustments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the algorithm description and consider incorporating visual aids to facilitate understanding. Additionally, we suggest simplifying the notation in Section 2 to enhance readability. The authors should also clarify the theoretical results, particularly regarding the inconsistent terminology and the use of "lower order terms," which could be replaced with big O notation. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the necessity of Assumption 2, as it appears to impose a strong restriction on the starting point. Lastly, addressing the minor typographical errors and ensuring consistent terminology throughout the manuscript would significantly enhance the overall presentation.
