### Key Points
This paper presents a novel planning algorithm for “planning by active sensing” in mazes, utilizing efficient visual samples to model the environment prior to navigation. Inspired by human visual maze navigation in VR, the algorithm integrates planning, navigation, and sensing through eye movements. The authors contextualize their work within existing literature, addressing specific knowledge gaps. The algorithm demonstrates computational efficiency compared to traditional methods and is grounded in empirical insights from a behavioral study.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper effectively contextualizes the problem and addresses prior works and knowledge gaps.  
- The algorithm is computationally efficient and performs well in comparison to traditional approaches.  
- It draws on biological inspiration from human vision, showcasing a rare empirical approach in neuro-inspired algorithm literature.  

Weaknesses:  
- The term “backup” is introduced without prior explanation, which may confuse readers.  
- The requirement for a high vantage point to collect pre-navigation visual samples is not explicitly clarified, potentially limiting the applicability of the approach.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the term “backup” upon its first use in section 4.3. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the implications of needing a high vantage point for collecting visual samples and how this affects the planning approach's applicability to other problems. Furthermore, addressing the following questions could enhance the paper: In how many instances did the greedy algorithm make significantly suboptimal choices requiring traceback in large mazes? How does experience influence optimal plan selection and policy updates during planning? Did higher vantage points in trials lead to better planning outcomes? Lastly, does the size of the space states impact planning efficiency?
