### Key Points
This paper presents SfPUEL, a method for estimating surface normals and material types (metallic or dielectric) from a single polarization image under unknown environmental light. The authors propose a novel network architecture that integrates polarization information with photometric stereo priors, utilizing a photometric stereo feature extractor and a polarization feature extractor with DoLP cross-attention. By jointly estimating material segmentation and surface normals from global context features, the method enhances predictions of surface normals and materials.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
* The paper includes synthetic and real polarization datasets for various materials and environmental maps.  
* It introduces a novel architecture featuring polarization and photometric stereo feature extraction, a DoLP cross-attention block, and a global context extractor.  
* The ablation study (Table 3) provides reasonable results compared to various state-of-the-art normal estimation methods (Figures 5, 6, 7, 8 and Tables 1, 2).  

Weaknesses:  
* There are no comparison results with other material segmentation methods.  
* The method does not demonstrate high-frequency, spatially-varying material examples, such as dielectric surfaces with dense strip patterns. Each object is limited to a single material.  
* The reliance on the photometric stereo network SDM-UniPS raises concerns about generalizability, as it may not handle specular dominant surfaces under polarized illumination.  
* The separation of materials into only dielectric and metallic types lacks sufficient explanation, weakening the material segmentation task.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with other material segmentation methods to provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Additionally, the authors should include examples of high-frequency, spatially-varying materials to address the current limitations. Clarifying the rationale behind the choice of only two material types and discussing the implications for more complex materials would strengthen the paper. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors explore the generalizability of their method by testing it on a wider range of real-world data and clarify how their method handles specular dominant surfaces under polarized illumination. Lastly, making the training dataset and full test dataset publicly available would greatly benefit future research.
