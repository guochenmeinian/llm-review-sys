Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for post-hoc epistemic uncertainty estimation in logit-based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by aggregating energy scores at different levels, including node, local, and group levels. The authors propose a novel method called GEBM, which enhances predictive robustness and improves performance in distinguishing between in-distribution and out-of-distribution data across various anomaly types and datasets. The paper rigorously evaluates the proposed method under diverse experimental conditions, demonstrating its effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a novel method based on energy considerations, providing sufficient background and related work, making the main idea accessible to readers.
2. Theoretical proofs and theorems adequately support the proposed methodology, and comprehensive experimental settings achieve state-of-the-art performance across various tasks.
3. The manuscript is well-structured, with a clear presentation of concepts and logical flow.

Weaknesses:
1. The experiments predominantly focus on node-level tasks, lacking exploration of graph-level tasks.
2. The paper does not include an ablation study on different types of energy used in the GEBM model, leaving the critical components unclear.
3. There is insufficient discussion on hyperparameter selection for the diffusion module, and the implicit assumption of homophily in the graph evaluation is not clearly stated.
4. The method's performance in terms of ECE and Brier score is not optimal, and the lack of intuitive explanations for certain design choices diminishes clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the exploration of graph-level tasks to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method. Additionally, including an ablation study on the different types of energy in the GEBM model would clarify which components are critical. We suggest enhancing the discussion on hyperparameter selection for the diffusion module and explicitly stating any assumptions regarding homophily in the graph evaluation. Furthermore, providing intuitive explanations for the aggregation of energy scores and addressing the performance issues in ECE and Brier score would strengthen the paper.
