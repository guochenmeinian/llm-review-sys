Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method to optimize neural network layer widths by analyzing the variance of weight norms across channels during training. The authors propose that understanding these patterns can help determine if a layer is sufficiently wide, potentially leading to reduced parameters and improved performance across various models and datasets. The study identifies distinct training dynamics, including "increase to saturate" (IS) and "decrease to saturate" (DS) patterns, and demonstrates that a narrow-wide-narrow streamline network can enhance performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper introduces a novel approach to assess layer width sufficiency using weight norm variance.  
2. It provides robust experimental evidence across multiple datasets and model architectures.  
3. The identification of distinct training dynamics offers valuable insights into neural network training.

Weaknesses:  
1. The empirical justification of the proposed method lacks convincing evidence, particularly regarding the merging of channels with IS patterns.  
2. The method's reliance on retraining models to determine layer widths may increase total training costs.  
3. There is insufficient discussion on related methods such as channel pruning and NAS-based channel number search.  
4. The complexity and additional computational costs of measuring weight norms are not adequately addressed.  
5. The experimental setup raises concerns about the choice of architectures and datasets used for validation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical justification of their method by providing clearer evidence regarding the merging of channels with IS patterns. Additionally, the authors should discuss and compare their approach with existing methods like channel pruning and NAS-based searches. It would be beneficial to analyze the computational complexity of measuring weight norms and report any additional time introduced by this method. We also suggest including a more detailed theoretical analysis of the chosen metric, considering alternatives such as gradient norm and Hessian matrix. Finally, we encourage the authors to refine their experimental setup by using a wider range of architectures and datasets to enhance the comprehensiveness of their findings.
