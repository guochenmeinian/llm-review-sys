Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an energy-based model for unsupervised binding affinity prediction, utilizing SE(3) denoising score matching (DSM) and Neural Eulerâ€™s Rotation Equations (NERE) for rotation prediction. The authors conduct experiments on protein-ligand and antibody-antigen binding, demonstrating that their method outperforms existing unsupervised and some supervised baselines. The model's effectiveness is evaluated through systematic ablation studies and the provision of code and data. Additionally, the authors propose training on a dataset of docked structures, specifically utilizing 45,000 complexes from the CrossDock 2020 dataset, filtered for quality and diversity. Results indicate a slight improvement in model performance when trained on these docked structures compared to the original model trained on PDBBind co-crystal complexes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and clear, making complex ideas accessible.
2. The proposed method shows superior performance over unsupervised and some supervised baselines in antibody binding scenarios.
3. The innovative use of Euler's rotation equations for supervision on predicted atomic forces is commendable.
4. The systematic ablation studies effectively demonstrate the importance of various model components.
5. The authors effectively addressed reviewer concerns through additional analysis and experiments, resulting in more convincing results that demonstrate the model's applicability beyond co-crystal structures.

Weaknesses:
1. The concept of using unsupervised generative models for binding affinity prediction is not novel, and the authors do not adequately compare their work with related literature.
2. The evaluation metrics are limited to Pearson correlation coefficient; additional metrics like RMSE, MAE, and AUROC should be included.
3. The model overlooks the flexibility of proteins and ligands, ignoring sidechain dynamics, which are crucial for accurate binding predictions.
4. The reliance on co-crystal structures for training may limit the model's applicability in real-world scenarios where such data is scarce.
5. The improvement in model performance when trained on docked structures, while present, is not significant.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related works to better contextualize their contributions. Additionally, incorporating a broader range of evaluation metrics, including RMSE, MAE, and AUROC, would provide a more comprehensive assessment of model performance. The authors should also consider addressing the flexibility of proteins and ligands in their model, potentially by including sidechain dynamics. Lastly, we suggest that the authors improve the clarity of the results by providing a more detailed discussion on the implications of the slight performance improvement observed with the docked structures, and further exploration of the dataset's diversity and quality could enhance the robustness of the findings.
