### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into stance detection by incorporating background knowledge to enhance understanding of targets. The authors propose the Knowledge-Augmented Stance Detection (KASD) framework, which utilizes episodic knowledge retrieved from Wikipedia and discourse knowledge through ChatGPT. The experimental results demonstrate that KASD outperforms existing methods across various datasets, showing significant improvements in both in-target and zero-shot scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses stance detection from a novel perspective by integrating background knowledge, which is well-motivated and clearly articulated.  
- The experimental design is robust, with appropriate datasets and baseline methods, yielding reproducible results that show significant improvements over existing approaches.  
- The analysis of various components within the framework enhances the reliability of the findings.  

Weaknesses:  
- The reliance solely on ChatGPT for episodic knowledge retrieval raises questions about the potential for comparison with other models like LLaMA.  
- Some results in Tables 4 and 5 may not be fairly comparable due to differing experimental setups in other papers.  
- The introduction of zero-shot learning is delayed until section 5, which could hinder readability.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their comparisons by elaborating on the experimental setups of other papers referenced in Tables 4 and 5. Additionally, consider introducing the definition of zero-shot learning earlier in the paper for better flow. It would also be beneficial to address the potential error propagation when using ChatGPT for filtering knowledge and to provide more details on the performance of KASD when directly utilizing ChatGPT for episodic knowledge extraction. Lastly, please correct the typo in line 353 and adjust the caption of Table 7 to reflect “zero-shot stance.”
