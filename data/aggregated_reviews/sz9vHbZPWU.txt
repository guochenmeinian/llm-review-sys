### Key Points
This paper presents the first method to detect and remove backdoors from diffusion models. The process involves trigger inversion, which assumes a linear dependence in the Markov chain, followed by backdoor detection to identify if a model is compromised. The final stage involves cleaning the model through fine-tuning on a loss that mitigates the effect of the detected trigger. The authors conduct extensive experimentation with 300 backdoored models and various sampling and backdooring methods, which is commendable.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces a novel approach to backdoor detection and removal in diffusion models.  
- Extensive experimentation with a large number of backdoored models enhances the credibility of the findings.  

Weaknesses:  
- The explanation of the backdoor detection process is insufficient, with much content relegated to the appendix.  
- Table 1 lacks data on metrics before the cleaning procedure, making it challenging to validate the claims of model cleaning.  
- The definition of ∆ASR is unclear, particularly regarding negative values, and the text does not clarify if it represents the difference between clean and backdoored models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the backdoor detection process by providing more detailed explanations in the main text rather than relying heavily on the appendix. Additionally, we suggest including metrics from before the cleaning procedure in Table 1 to support the claims of model effectiveness. It would also be beneficial to clarify the definition of ∆ASR, particularly addressing the confusion surrounding negative values and ensuring that the relationship between clean and backdoored models is explicitly stated. Lastly, please move the legend in Figure 4 outside the figure to avoid obscuring important data points.
