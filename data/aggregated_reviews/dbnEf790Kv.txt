Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents FUSE, a novel framework that simultaneously addresses forward (simulation of PDEs) and inverse (parameter estimation) problems for parametric PDEs. The authors propose a probabilistic approach where the output solution is sampled according to an underlying parameter distribution, utilizing a two-loss objective for training. FUSE is tested on complex PDE systems, specifically atmospheric cold bubble and pulse wave propagation, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods. Additionally, the authors formulate different loss functions for forward and inverse problems by considering various metrics over measures. They argue that FUSE is not merely a trivial composition of two methods, as it allows for entangled choices between forward and inverse models, affecting each other despite not sharing parameters. The novelty of their approach lies in relating infinite-dimensional function spaces to finite-dimensional spaces through a lifting operator and a projection mechanism. The authors assert that FUSE is applicable to real datasets, particularly in bioengineering, emphasizing its relevance in studying parametric PDEs for understanding complex systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The authors have identified a significant challenge in joint prediction and parameter estimation, proposing a relevant solution.  
- FUSE achieves state-of-the-art results on complex PDEs and exhibits impressive uncertainty propagation capabilities.  
- The integration of flow matching for PDE problems and the use of Fourier layers in the architecture are noteworthy contributions.  
- The authors provide a rigorous mathematical framework that effectively addresses the relationship between forward and inverse problems.  
- The novelty of the approach in connecting infinite-dimensional and finite-dimensional spaces is a significant contribution.  
- The applicability of FUSE to real-world datasets in bioengineering is well articulated, enhancing its relevance.

Weaknesses:  
- The methodology lacks clarity, particularly in the integration of forward and inverse strategies, raising questions about its broad applicability.  
- The literature review is limited, focusing narrowly on neural network approaches while neglecting other relevant methods such as Gaussian processes.  
- The paper does not provide sufficient detail on flow matching, particularly regarding the parametrization and its inverse.  
- There is a critical lack of existing research on neural operators relating infinite- and finite-dimensional spaces, which may challenge the novelty claim.  
- The assertion regarding the applicability of the dataset form (parameter, functional input, functional output) to real-world scenarios may require further substantiation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology, particularly in explaining the integration of the forward and inverse models, to enhance its perceived applicability. Additionally, a more comprehensive literature review is necessary, including references to classical numerical methods and other probabilistic approaches. We also suggest providing more details on flow matching, including the parametrization specifics, and addressing the potential limitations of the proposed approach in various contexts. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors provide references to existing research that supports their claims about the novelty of their approach in relating infinite- and finite-dimensional spaces. Lastly, the authors should consider elaborating on the implications of their findings for real-world applications, particularly in bioengineering and sensitivity analysis.
