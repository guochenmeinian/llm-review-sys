### Key Points
This paper presents a quantum version of equilibrium propagation (QEP), extending classical optimization algorithms to quantum systems. The authors develop the theory for quantum equilibrium propagation and provide examples of its application in quantum Hamiltonian optimization setups. The work is timely and relevant, appealing to a broad research community interested in quantum phenomena.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper effectively develops the theory for quantum equilibrium propagation, clearly explaining its details.  
2. The authors support their theoretical framework with relevant examples of QEP applications.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The absence of numerical results limits the practical understanding of the proposed algorithms.  
2. The use of the transverse field Ising model as an example is relatively simplistic; performance on more complex models, such as the anti-ferromagnetic Heisenberg model, would be beneficial.  
3. A discussion on how QEP might address the 'sign problem' in quantum simulations is lacking.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including numerical results to demonstrate the performance of QEP. Additionally, we suggest exploring more complex quantum models beyond the transverse field Ising model. It would also be advantageous to discuss how QEP could potentially circumvent the 'sign problem.' Furthermore, we encourage the authors to enhance readability by providing examples and counter-examples regarding the smooth deformation of eigenstates as mentioned in lines 121-123, and to conduct simple numerical experiments for a 2 to 3-qubit system to illustrate QEP performance as suggested in lines 198-202.
