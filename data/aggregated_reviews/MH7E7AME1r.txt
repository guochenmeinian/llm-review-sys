Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a stochastic extrapolation technique with variance reduction aimed at improving sample complexity bounds for conditional stochastic optimization (CSO) problems. The authors propose new algorithms that incorporate extrapolation and variance reduction, demonstrating better sample complexities for both CSO and finite-sum coupled compositional optimization (FCCO) problems. The paper also highlights the challenges posed by biased sample-averaged gradients and provides convergence guarantees for the proposed methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The stochastic extrapolation technique is innovative and potentially useful for various stochastic optimization formulations.
- The overall presentation is clear, with detailed theoretical results and strong numerical studies supporting the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
- The modular approach of reducing gradient bias separately before integrating with existing algorithms enhances clarity.

Weaknesses:
- The additional regularity assumption on higher-order gradients diminishes the significance of the results, raising questions about the validity of the claimed improvements.
- Inconsistencies in notation and terminology throughout the paper may confuse readers, particularly regarding the use of $\Omega(\cdot)$ and $\mathcal{O}$ notations.
- The paper references appendices without sufficient context, making it difficult to follow the arguments and verify statements.
- The authors' assertion of improved rates based on additional regularity assumptions may not be valid, as existing methods may not require such conditions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their writing by addressing the noted inconsistencies in notation and ensuring that all references to appendices are clearly marked. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more thorough discussion on the implications of the additional regularity assumptions and clarify the significance of their results in relation to existing methods. It would also be beneficial to include comparisons of iteration complexity alongside sample complexity in the related work section. Lastly, we encourage the authors to enhance the readability of the paper by revising specific sentences and ensuring that all technical terms are well-defined.
