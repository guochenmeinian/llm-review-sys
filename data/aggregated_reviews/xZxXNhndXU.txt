Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a hybrid neural scene representation for novel view synthesis (NVS) in dynamic urban environments, utilizing 3D Gaussians as a geometric scaffold and neural fields for appearance modeling. The authors introduce an opacity attenuation field to account for transient scene variations and employ an object-centric representation for dynamic actors, including non-rigid deformations for animating objects like pedestrians. The proposed method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance and improved rendering speed compared to previous approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The combination of Gaussian Splatting and neural fields effectively models geometry and appearance, enhancing scalability for large scenes.
2. Extensive experiments validate the method, including comparisons with recent baselines and comprehensive ablation studies, showcasing significant improvements in rendering quality and speed.
3. The paper is well-written, with clear organization and sufficient implementation details for reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
1. The rendering process requires querying appearance from neural fields, raising concerns about potential impacts on rendering speed compared to traditional methods.
2. There is a lack of comparison with recent neural field baselines such as UniSim and NeuRAD, as well as with 3D Gaussian baselines regarding speed.
3. Certain technical details, such as the handling of non-rigid objects and the implications of using neural fields on rendering speed, are inadequately addressed.
4. The pipeline figure lacks clarity, making it difficult to discern the connections between modules and operations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the pipeline figure to better illustrate the relationships and operations between modules. Additionally, the authors should evaluate the impact of neural fields on rendering speed and provide a comparison with recent neural field baselines. It would be beneficial to include typical resource usage metrics and runtime comparisons with competitive methods to clarify the advantages of the proposed approach. Lastly, addressing the handling of non-rigid objects, particularly dynamic cars, in more detail would enhance the paper's comprehensiveness.
