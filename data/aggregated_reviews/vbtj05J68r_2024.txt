Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a critical examination of the framework used to evaluate brain models based on their ability to predict neural activity through linear regression. The authors utilize grid cells to illustrate the inadequacies of this regression framework, arguing that models excelling in predicting grid cell responses often lack essential grid cell characteristics. They contend that the performance of linear regression is more closely tied to the implicit biases of the method rather than the models' ability to capture relevant neural properties, emphasizing the significance of the participation ratio (PR) in determining regression performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper raises important questions regarding the use of linear regression in evaluating brain models, contributing valuable insights to the field.

Weaknesses:  
Some arguments lack clarity and justification, particularly regarding the relationship between neural alignment methods and regression targets. Additionally, the paper does not adequately address how intrinsic dimensionality affects neural similarity, which may lead to confusion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by explicitly stating that the neural regressions methodology supports ANN models based on predictivity rather than similarity. The sub-heading of section 3 should be rephrased to better reflect the methodology's implications. Additionally, the authors should clearly demonstrate the relationship between intrinsic dimensionality and neural similarity, as this connection is not intuitive. The title of the paper could also be revised to indicate that maximizing neural regression scores does not necessarily inform model goodness. Finally, we suggest highlighting the context in which the neural regression methodology may be flawed, specifying when it is appropriate to use it for neural response prediction versus estimating similarity.
