Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical framework for scaling laws in time series forecasting, focusing on the interplay between dataset size, model complexity, and look-back horizon. The authors propose a novel theory that explains scaling behaviors from an intrinsic space perspective, emphasizing the critical role of the look-back horizon. They empirically validate their theoretical framework through experiments across various models and datasets, demonstrating the existence of scaling laws and the influence of the look-back horizon. The authors clarify that their results do not depend on strict autoregressive properties, as non-causal relationships can be interpreted as intrinsic noise. They acknowledge the importance of the Zip-f assumption and provide additional experimental results comparing their proposed model with various candidates, demonstrating its superior fit.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel theoretical framework that addresses the impact of the look-back horizon, a previously unexplored aspect in scaling law theories.
- It combines thorough theoretical analysis with extensive empirical validation across multiple models and datasets, including Linear, MLP, iTransformer, and ModernTCN.
- The authors maintain clarity through well-defined assumptions and presentation of experimental results with statistical analyses.
- The authors provide a comprehensive understanding of the look-back horizon's impact, which is not fully understood in the community.
- Empirical validation shows that their proposed model outperforms or is comparable to other candidates, enhancing the credibility of their theory.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation is often unclear, with several theoretical results lacking proper justification and assumptions not clearly stated.
- The empirical validation does not convincingly support the theory, as the data points per line in figures are insufficient for robust fitting.
- The theoretical framework relies on several simplifying assumptions about intrinsic space properties, which may not hold in practice, and the implications of these assumptions are not thoroughly discussed.
- Some reviewers noted a lack of clarity in the presentation of assumptions and theoretical deductions.
- The choice of default functions for modeling was questioned, suggesting that simpler polynomial forms might be more appropriate.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their presentation by explicitly stating all key assumptions, particularly regarding the use of Zipf's law and the autoregressive assumption. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more detailed discussion on the implications of their assumptions and how they relate to practical applications. To enhance the empirical validation, we advise the authors to ensure that the fitting of models is statistically significant and to compare their results against simpler models with the same number of parameters. We encourage the authors to explore simpler polynomial models, such as \(A + Bx + Cx^2\), as potential alternatives to the log function. Lastly, we urge the authors to clarify the derivations presented in section 3.2.2 and ensure that the theoretical results are plotted alongside empirical data for better verification, while also addressing mixed datasets more thoroughly in both theoretical and experimental contexts.
