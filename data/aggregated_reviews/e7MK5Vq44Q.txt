Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of GFlowNets for posterior sampling of cyclic graph structures, specifically applied to gene regulatory networks (GRN). The authors frame the problem as a dynamical systems identification challenge, factoring it into priors and model likelihoods. They utilize Hyper Networks for learning priors and GFlowNets for estimating model likelihoods, demonstrating robustness against parameters like edge sparsity. The approach is benchmarked against several methods and applied to RNA velocity data, effectively recovering known and potential gene-gene interactions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses the significant challenge of posterior sampling over directed graphs, particularly with cycles, showcasing the authors' expertise in the field.
- The method's formulation is well-motivated by biological considerations, potentially impacting the GRN inference community.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks accessibility for non-experts, making it difficult to grasp the overall significance of the innovation.
- The clarity of Algorithm 1's termination criteria and convergence to the posterior is insufficiently explained.
- The advantages of the proposed method over original GFlowNets in practical applications remain unclear.
- Assumptions regarding causal sufficiency may not hold in real-world biological contexts, raising questions about model identifiability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Algorithm 1 by explicitly stating the conditions under which the transition probability becomes null and how convergence to the posterior is achieved. Additionally, we suggest providing a comparison of MAP parameter estimates between this method and the original GFlowNet under the AUC metric to clarify its advantages. The authors should also address the assumption of causal sufficiency, considering the sparsity of single-cell data, and provide more accessible explanations in Section 5 and Figure 2. Lastly, we encourage the inclusion of simple systems to illustrate the recovery of true dependencies and the implications of modeling cyclic structures.
