Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for quantifying reward uncertainty in RLHF to address reward model over-optimization. The authors introduce a lightweight uncertainty estimator based on final layer embeddings and propose a distributionally robust optimization procedure. Empirical results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in mitigating over-optimization, outperforming mean and lora ensembles on the Anthropic HH and TL;DR datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper is generally easy to follow and presents a novel approach to uncertainty estimation, which is significant in the context of LLMs.  
2. The proposed method shows promising experimental performance and reduces memory usage compared to ensemble-based methods.  
3. The theoretical analysis provides valuable insights into the method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:  
1. The method's reliance on calculating matrix inverse $M_D^{-1}$ can lead to numerical instability and is computationally intensive for large datasets.  
2. The theoretical motivation has a substantial gap with the practical implementation, particularly regarding the requirement for infinitely wide neural networks.  
3. The uncertainty measure $U^{CI}$ lacks statistical justification and does not clearly differentiate between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.  
4. The experimental comparisons to baselines are insufficient, particularly lacking comparisons to WARM and UWO, which are necessary to substantiate claims of superiority.  
5. The experimental settings may not accurately reflect real-world scenarios, as the gap between trained and gold reward models is smaller than typical in prior works.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definition of "uncertainty" as it pertains to their work. Additionally, it would be beneficial to provide a more comprehensive comparison to baselines, including WARM and UWO, to strengthen the claims of the method's effectiveness. We suggest conducting experiments with a wider range of model sizes to ensure robustness across scales. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the construction of $C^r_{\delta}$ and provide quantitative results on the uncertainty, including correlation analyses and scatter plots to enhance the presentation of results. Lastly, we encourage the authors to justify the choice of the last embedding layer and consider the implications of their method's scalability compared to ensemble approaches.
