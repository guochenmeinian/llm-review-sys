### Key Points
This paper presents a method called Collective-Critiques and Self-Voting (CCSV) aimed at enhancing diversity in LLM-generated text, particularly focusing on gender and ethnic representation across various professions. The authors evaluate their approach using automated metrics and human judges, demonstrating that CCSV can effectively improve diversity compared to existing baselines. The study also reveals interesting findings regarding the robustness of zero-shot prompting versus few-shot prompting.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an important issue in LLM generation, providing a feasible metric for evaluating diversity.
- The method is well-evaluated with meaningful baselines and metrics, showing promising results in both automated and human assessments.
- The proposed technique is simple and applicable to various LLM architectures without specific assumptions.

Weaknesses:
- The writing quality needs improvement, with some figures appearing unclear.
- The scope of diversity examined is narrow, focusing primarily on people and cities, which may overstate the method's generalizability.
- The reliance on a specific, closed model limits reproducibility, and the authors should consider including open-source models for validation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the writing quality, particularly by clarifying figures and ensuring all content is easily interpretable. Additionally, we suggest broadening the scope of diversity examined in the study to include other dimensions, such as sentence patterns. To enhance reproducibility, we advise the authors to open-source their code and datasets, including modified versions, and to evaluate the cost implications of CCSV compared to baseline methods. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the temperature settings for the baselines and consider discussing the potential limitations of CCSV in other languages.
