### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of the impact of translationese on cross-lingual summarization (CLS). The authors investigate how translationese, introduced during the translation process, affects the modeling and evaluation of CLS, particularly in source documents and target summaries. They conduct experiments and provide suggestions for addressing translationese, including controlling it in test sets and developing translationese-aware models. The study also includes a partial human evaluation, although details are lacking.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The topic is timely and relevant, addressing a critical issue in current CLS systems.
- The authors provide a comprehensive analysis of translationese's impact on various aspects of CLS, including datasets and models.
- The findings suggest valuable directions for future research, such as constructing mixed-quality CLS datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The paper suffers from poor writing and organization, making it difficult to follow.
- Details regarding the human evaluation are insufficient, raising ethical and methodological concerns.
- The replicability of the work is compromised due to missing details on translationese metrics and experimental design.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and organization of the paper by addressing long sentences, LaTeX errors, and excessive bibliographic references. Additionally, please provide a clear definition of translationese and include examples to enhance understanding. We suggest justifying the choice of m-BART-based MT models and considering a broader focus on basic MT technologies. It is crucial to elaborate on the human evaluation process, including the selection and compensation of evaluators, as well as the specific guidelines provided. Furthermore, we recommend reporting the percentage agreement alongside Fleiss' Kappa and clarifying the use of ordinal scales in the analysis. Lastly, please ensure that all experimental results include standard deviation scores to support reproducibility.
