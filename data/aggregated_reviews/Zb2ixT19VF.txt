Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ClavaDDPM, a novel approach for synthetic data generation in multi-relational setups, addressing scalability and long-range dependency challenges. The authors propose extending the DDPM framework to handle multiple linked tables, utilizing primary-foreign key relationships. The model learns latent variables represented as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to condition the generative process based on parent-child table hierarchies. Additionally, the authors introduce a mathematical deduction that strengthens the theoretical foundation of their work, detailing the probability distributions modeled in their approach. Experimental results indicate that ClavaDDPM outperforms existing non-diffusion baselines in both effectiveness and efficiency, while also addressing important aspects of relational data synthesis under differential privacy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
**S1.** The paper addresses a critical issue in synthetic data generation, particularly for large models reliant on high-quality training data, and is the first to condition generation on multiple relational tables.  
**S2.** The clever use of latent variables with classifier guidance for grouped keys, along with support for both numerical and categorical data, enhances the model's applicability.  
**S3.** The experimental validation is thorough, with compelling results compared to existing models and informative ablation studies.  
**S4.** The manuscript is well-structured and clearly written, facilitating reader comprehension.  
**S5.** The authors provide a clear mathematical framework that enhances the theoretical rigor of their approach.  
**S6.** The inclusion of a running example using the Berka dataset aids in understanding the notation and methodology.  

Weaknesses:  
**W1.** The discussion on long-range dependencies is insufficiently detailed in Section 4, particularly regarding its mapping to the example hierarchy.  
**W2.** There is a lack of discussion on limitations, including training duration and inference times, which could be several days. The conclusion also fails to address limitations as indicated in the checklist.  
**W3.** The manuscript's mathematical notation is inconsistent, leading to potential ambiguity, and key terms are not uniformly defined.  
**W4.** The assumptions made in the model require more rigorous justification to enhance the theoretical foundation.  
**W5.** The complexity analysis of the model in large-scale databases is lacking, which is crucial for understanding its practical efficiency.  
**W6.** The ablation study on the cluster number 'k' lacks granularity, necessitating a more detailed investigation.  
**W7.** The section on multi-relational synthesis should be moved from the appendix to the main body for better coherence.  
**W8.** There are formatting issues in Equations 5-9 due to missing symbols, which could hinder clarity.  
**W9.** The relationship between label clustering and table structures lacks visual representation, which would enhance comprehension.  
**W10.** The mathematical deduction's presentation could benefit from clearer explanations to improve understanding.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve Section 4 by expanding on the details of long-range modeling and its relation to the example hierarchy presented in Figure 1. Additionally, a discussion of the limitations, including training duration and inference times, should be included in the conclusion. We suggest standardizing the mathematical notation and ensuring consistent definitions of key terms throughout the manuscript. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide a more rigorous justification for the model's assumptions and include a complexity analysis to assess scalability in large databases. A more fine-grained investigation of the impact of varying 'k' in the ablation study is also recommended. We also recommend addressing the missing symbols in Equations 5-9 for accuracy, and including visualizations that illustrate the relationship between label clustering and table structures to enhance understanding. Finally, clarifying the presentation of the mathematical deduction and relocating the multi-relational synthesis section to the main body will enhance the paper's coherence and flow.
