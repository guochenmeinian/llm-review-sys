### Key Points
This paper presents a framework, KnowEE, for retrieving knowledge for open-domain dialogue generation from LLMs and injecting that knowledge into LLM prompts to generate dialogue responses. The authors argue that training knowledge retrievers is computationally expensive and brittle, leading to poor generalization. They propose to retrieve LLM knowledge by identifying the top n most similar content-knowledge pairs from five knowledge datasets, which are used as in-context learning examples. The knowledge is injected into the response generation prompt either at the utterance level or the dialogue level. Experimental results show that KnowEE outperforms existing non-knowledge-based systems and other few-shot learning models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed approach is well-motivated and clearly explained, demonstrating superior performance across various metrics.  
- The framework is agnostic to the choice of underlying LLM, enhancing its applicability.  
- Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:  
- The distinction between the two knowledge injection approaches (utterance-based fine-grained and dialogue-based coarse-grained) is unclear, as they appear very similar.  
- The evaluation lacks content-based automatic metrics like BLEU and ROUGE, which could strengthen the analysis of response content.  
- There is insufficient discussion on the generalization of the framework to real-world scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the differences between Fine-Grained Knowledge Injection and Coarse-Grained Knowledge Injection, particularly regarding the significance of knowledge positioning in the prompts. Additionally, we suggest including content-based automatic metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE in the evaluation to assess response content more effectively. To enhance the generalization analysis, we encourage the authors to discuss how the framework would perform in diverse user interactions and real-world scenarios. Finally, we advise conducting ablation experiments comparing the performance of the proposed method with existing methods like MSDP to substantiate claims of novelty and effectiveness.
