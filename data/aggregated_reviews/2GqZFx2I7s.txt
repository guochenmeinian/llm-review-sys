Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
The paper introduces modulo sensors for object detection in extreme lighting conditions, leveraging modulo imaging and the SPUD algorithm to recover HDR images efficiently. The authors demonstrate that this approach enhances detection performance compared to saturated images and traditional HDR methods, particularly using the YOLOv10 model. The experimental results are promising, indicating significant improvements in both accuracy and processing time.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
- The problem addressed is highly relevant, particularly for autonomous driving.
- The use of modulo sensing for HDR image recovery is innovative.
- The paper is well-structured and presents convincing preliminary results.
- The methodology effectively tackles saturation issues, improving object detection accuracy.

**Weaknesses:**
- Limited comparisons with prior methods and datasets restrict the generalizability of the findings.
- The reliance on simulated data rather than real-world modulo images raises concerns about practical applicability.
- The complexity of integrating modulo sensors and the SPUD algorithm may introduce processing overhead.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We suggest increasing the test set size and incorporating additional datasets to better assess the generalization of the proposed method. Evaluating the algorithm on real-world data would enhance its credibility, despite the challenges of dataset collection. Furthermore, extending experiments to include other models, such as segmentation and depth estimation, would increase the paper's value. Addressing the domain gap between recovered modulo images and original HDR images through different recovery algorithms could also be beneficial. Lastly, a more detailed discussion of the strengths and limitations of modulo cameras in industry applications would strengthen the paper's impact.
