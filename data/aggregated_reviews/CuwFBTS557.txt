### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of the cold posterior effect in Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) and its role in enhancing adversarial robustness. The authors conduct extensive experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets using various training methods, including SGMCMC, SGHMC, and VI, demonstrating that cold posterior models consistently outperform warm counterparts in resisting adversarial attacks. The study provides both empirical evidence and theoretical insights into the effectiveness of the cold posterior effect.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper effectively combines the cold posterior effect with Bayesian Neural Networks to improve adversarial defense.  
2. Comprehensive experiments validate the impact of different posterior temperatures on adversarial robustness across multiple datasets and models.  
3. The empirical results clearly show that cold models outperform warm models in resilience to adversarial attacks.

Weaknesses:  
1. Some claims are inconsistent, particularly regarding the performance of the VI method at T=0.1, which is stated to outperform other cold posterior models but is not clearly supported by figures.  
2. The theoretical explanations for the cold posterior effect lack depth and rigor, and the paper does not analyze how common adversarial defense techniques can be integrated with the cold posterior approach.  
3. The absence of significance testing or statistical analysis raises questions about the robustness of the findings, particularly regarding performance differences at various temperatures.  
4. The experimental setup could benefit from additional datasets and attack types, and the choice of parameters for different training methods lacks sufficient explanation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis of the cold posterior effect to provide a more rigorous foundation for their claims. Additionally, the authors should clarify the reasons behind the superior performance of the VI method compared to other approaches and explore the integration of common adversarial defense techniques with the cold posterior method. To enhance the robustness of their findings, we suggest including significance testing and statistical analysis. Finally, expanding the experimental setup to include more datasets and attack types, along with a detailed explanation of parameter choices for different training methods, would improve the reproducibility of the results.
