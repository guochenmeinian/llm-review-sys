### Key Points
This paper presents a framework called UIMER that utilizes model interpretation techniques and gold rationales to improve model performance. The authors demonstrate how to align important features identified by various interpretation methods (e.g., gradient-based, erasure/replace-based, extractor-based) with gold rationales during training. The overall objective combines the original task-specific learning objective with the interpretation alignment objective. The framework is evaluated on three tasks (Intent Classification, Slot Filling, and Natural Language Inference) across multiple datasets, showing superior performance compared to baseline models and existing techniques, particularly in low-resource settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively demonstrates the use of model interpretation techniques and gold rationales to enhance model performance.
- It provides comprehensive empirical evidence across three datasets, outperforming existing methods that utilize gold rationales.
- The study is well-structured, with extensive experiments and clear presentation, making it easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the work appears limited, as the utilization of interpretations for performance enhancement has been extensively explored in prior research.
- The proposed method's reliance on gold rationales may limit its applicability in real-world scenarios due to the challenges of obtaining high-quality rationales.
- The focus on low-resource settings raises questions about the scalability of the method to larger datasets and its performance on out-of-distribution samples.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their work by providing a clearer justification of the challenges addressed by their proposed model. Additionally, exploring the method's performance with larger training datasets and on out-of-distribution samples could enhance its relevance. We also suggest that the authors include stronger baseline models for comparison and clarify the experimental metrics used, particularly regarding the measurement of generated interpretations. Lastly, consider using full names for tasks in Table 1 to improve readability.
