Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Delta-CoMe, a delta compression method for aligned language models that combines low-rank compression and mixed-precision quantization to enhance performance. The authors propose assigning higher bitwidths to singular vectors with larger singular values, employing a group-wise quantization approach. Experimental results indicate that Delta-CoMe achieves compression comparable to existing methods while resolving quality issues in various tasks across multiple model scales.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper is well-written, making complex ideas accessible.  
2. The combination of delta-compression and mixed-precision quantization is novel and effectively demonstrated through thorough experiments.  
3. The method shows significant performance improvements across diverse tasks and models, suggesting its applicability in delta-compression literature.  
4. The authors provide insightful analysis of quantization error and comparisons with existing methods, enhancing the credibility of their approach.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The empirical choice of bitwidths and the greedy search algorithm may lead to suboptimal decisions, raising concerns about generalizability.  
2. The paper contains typographical errors and issues with LaTeX encoding that affect readability.  
3. The rationale behind certain design choices, such as the selection of singular vector bands for mixed precision, lacks clarity and requires further exploration.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their design choices in Section 5.1, particularly regarding the selection of singular vector bands for different precisions. Additionally, a more thorough search algorithm should be considered to optimize the bitwidth assignment, as the current approach may not generalize well. Including discussions on the interdependency of base model weight compression and delta weight compression would enhance the paper's depth. Finally, addressing the typographical errors in Tables 1 and 6 would improve the overall presentation.
