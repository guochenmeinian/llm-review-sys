### Key Points
This paper presents a method for accelerating Toeplitz Neural Networks (TNNs) by converting them to State Space Models (SSMs) during inference, thereby reducing inference complexity from log-linear to constant time. The authors formulate the conversion as an optimization problem and provide a closed-form solution using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through extensive experiments on language modeling tasks, and it is noted that the method can also be applied to other LongConv-based models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a significant problem in enhancing the efficiency and scalability of TNNs and other LongConv-based models for long sequence modeling.  
- It presents a novel solution that leverages the mathematical properties of TNNs and SSMs, supported by rigorous analysis of correctness and stability.  
- Extensive experiments validate the proposed method across various settings, showcasing superior numerical stability and efficiency compared to other gradient-based methods.  
- The paper is well-organized, providing comprehensive background context and potentially impactful findings for the LLM field.

Weaknesses:  
- The proposed method may be perceived as a straightforward combination of existing techniques, lacking sufficient novelty or insight beyond the integration of TNNs and SSMs.  
- Limitations and trade-offs of the method, such as potential accuracy loss or expressiveness due to the conversion process, are not adequately discussed.  
- Evaluation is limited to a single dataset (Wikitext-103), which may restrict the generalizability of the results.  
- The transition from TNNs to SSMs involves approximations that could introduce discrepancies compared to the original representation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the limitations and trade-offs of their proposed method, particularly regarding accuracy and expressiveness. Additionally, expanding the evaluation to include more complex tasks beyond language modeling would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the method's potential. Finally, we suggest that the authors consider integrating their method with other efficiency techniques to further enhance inference speed and clarify which specific techniques might be suitable for such integration.
