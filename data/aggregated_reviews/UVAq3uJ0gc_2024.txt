Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a zero-th order algorithm for Stochastic Compositional Optimization (SCO) problems, specifically addressing nonconvex and nonsmooth settings. The authors propose an algorithm named GFCOM, along with a variance reduction variant called GFCOM+. They provide a complexity analysis for reaching Goldstein approximate stationary points and extend their analysis to the convex setting, concluding with numerical experiments and comparisons to the Kiefer-Wolfowitz method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well-written, with clearly presented assumptions and a logical flow in the analysis. The study of SCO problems and the development of gradient-free algorithms are significant contributions.

Weaknesses:  
The numerical section lacks a specific compositional structure, weakening its relevance. The paper does not convincingly motivate its application to machine learning. The technical novelty is limited, as the proposed algorithms are largely extensions of existing work. Additionally, the authors fail to prove that $\mathbf{v}_t$ is an unbiased gradient estimator, and important related work on variance reduction is not reviewed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the numerical section by incorporating a specific compositional structure to better illustrate the method's relevance. Additionally, providing a convincing motivating example related to machine learning would strengthen the paper. The authors should clarify the value of $c$ for algorithm implementation and ensure that the independence of random variables $\xi$ and $\zeta$ is explicitly stated. We suggest revising misleading statements regarding the computational intractability of finding $\epsilon$-stationary points and refining the discussion on the Goldstein $\delta$-subdifferential. Finally, a comparison of the obtained complexity estimate with existing zero-th order stochastic optimization literature would enhance the paper's contribution.
