### Key Points
This paper presents a study on dense retrieval, focusing on improving document embedding for clustering and accelerating the retrieval process. The authors propose a Hybrid Inverted Index that merges the benefits of dense retrieval and lexical matching, along with learning techniques for term and cluster selection through a joint optimization solution. Experiments conducted on popular datasets yield promising results, demonstrating lossless retrieval quality with competitive efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research topic is significant and timely.
- The paper is well organized, with clear descriptions of method design and implementation.
- The proposed techniques are solid, effectively combining lexical and semantic features for improved retrieval speed and precision.

Weaknesses:
- Recent related works in high-dimensional similarity search are overlooked, which may outperform the methods compared.
- The experimental results lack a comparison of setup latency alongside query latency.
- There is no discussion of space overhead or memory consumption related to the proposed techniques.
- The term "lossless retrieval quality" may cause confusion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by including recent works such as [1], [2], and [3] to provide a more comprehensive comparison. Additionally, the authors should report setup latency in their experiments and clarify the use of "lossless retrieval quality." It would be beneficial to measure precision/recall loss due to index approximation and discuss the input types and similarity metrics used for each ANN. Finally, the authors should address the optimization of hyper-parameters for HNSW and IVFPQ to ensure fair comparisons.
