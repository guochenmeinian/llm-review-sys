Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DeBaRa, a diffusion-based framework for indoor scene generation that utilizes a self-score evaluation strategy for selecting conditioning input. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach across various tasks, including layout generation, scene completion, and LLM-guided text-to-scene generation. However, the novelty of using EDM over DDPM is questioned, as it does not significantly advance the field of indoor scene generation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The empirical results are promising, showing high-quality outputs both qualitatively and quantitatively.
- The proposed method is novel and effective for the intended tasks.
- An LLM-guided alternative pipeline simplifies input formats, enhancing model functionality.

Weaknesses:
- The architectural differences between DeBaRa and other diffusion-based models are not substantial, lacking sufficient experimental support.
- There is a lack of implementation details and ablation studies, making reproducibility difficult.
- Missing comparative experiments with baseline methods hinder the evaluation of claimed advantages in downstream tasks.
- The writing is unclear in parts, and Section 4.4 ("Additional Results") is missing, affecting clarity and completeness.
- Numerous typing errors detract from the professionalism of the manuscript.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing and ensure that all sections, including Section 4.4, are complete. Additionally, we suggest providing detailed implementation information, including training settings and ablation studies for design choices such as EDM vs. DDPM/DDIM and classifier-free guidance scales. It would also be beneficial to include comparative experiments with baseline methods like ATISS, LEGO-Net, and DiffuScene to validate the advantages claimed in downstream tasks. Lastly, addressing the rendering quality to meet artistic standards and clarifying the evaluation metrics used would enhance the paper's overall quality.
