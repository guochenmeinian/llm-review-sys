### Key Points
This paper presents SpaceByte, a byte-level architecture that integrates local and global transformer blocks to enhance language modeling performance. The authors demonstrate that SpaceByte outperforms previous byte-level architectures and rivals subword-level transformer models when normalized for training FLOPs. The architecture uniquely applies global blocks after "spacelike" characters, addressing the challenge of predicting subsequent characters at these points.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- **Originality**: The concept of selectively applying global blocks based on predictability is innovative and useful.  
- **Quality**: Extensive experiments validate the architecture's capabilities.  
- **Clarity**: The paper is well-written and easy to follow.  
- **Significance**: SpaceByte shows that byte-level architectures can compete effectively with subword tokenization transformers.

Weaknesses:  
- The rationale for preferring SpaceByte over standard tokenization is unclear, as the authors do not adequately address the downsides of tokenization mentioned in the introduction.  
- There is a lack of ablation studies to justify the architecture's design choices, such as the ordering of local and global layers.  
- The definition and characteristics of "spacelike" tokens are insufficiently detailed.  
- The novelty of SpaceByte may be diminished by its similarities to existing models, and the focus on specific languages limits generalizability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for using SpaceByte over standard tokenization by providing results that specifically address the downsides of tokenization. Additionally, conducting ablation studies on the architecture's design choices would enhance understanding of its effectiveness. It would also be beneficial to clarify the definition of "spacelike" tokens, including their common characteristics and prevalence. Finally, we suggest including evaluations on downstream tasks to demonstrate the practical applicability of SpaceByte beyond bits-per-byte performance.
