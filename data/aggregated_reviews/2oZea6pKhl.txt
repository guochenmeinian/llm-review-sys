Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for 3D occupancy prediction in autonomous driving using 4D imaging radar sensors, addressing the limitations of traditional methods reliant on LiDAR or camera inputs, particularly in adverse weather conditions. The authors propose several key contributions: 

- **Utilization of 4D Radar Tensors (4DRT):** The method processes raw 4DRTs, preserving essential scene details and capturing comprehensive environmental data.
- **Novel Data Processing Techniques:** Techniques such as Doppler bins descriptors, sidelobe-aware spatial sparsification, and range-wise self-attention mechanisms are introduced to manage the large and noisy 4DRT data effectively.
- **Benchmarking and Evaluation:** RadarOcc is benchmarked on the K-Radar dataset, demonstrating superior performance in radar-based 3D occupancy prediction compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly under adverse weather conditions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The writing quality is commendable, and a demo is provided for reviewers to observe the effects.
2. The work is pioneering in utilizing 4D imaging radar for 3D occupancy prediction, showcasing creativity in addressing radar data challenges.
3. Extensive experimental and ablation studies are conducted.

Weaknesses:
1. The computational demand may be high, with insufficient description of this aspect.
2. The reliance on a single dataset raises concerns about generalizability.
3. The experiments are limited due to the dataset, potentially affecting the robustness of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by incorporating additional datasets, such as nuScenes, for comparison. Additionally, please provide detailed information on the overlap ratio between different sensors and the region of interest (ROI). It would be beneficial to include the overall inference speed and the computational load reduction achieved by the Doppler bins descriptor, as well as the impact of range-wise self-attention and spherical-to-Cartesian feature aggregation on computational overhead. Lastly, consider exploring methods to enhance training data and generalization, especially in light of the challenges posed by obtaining ground truth occupancy data.
