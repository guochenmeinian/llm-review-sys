Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to image retrieval and matching through geometrical verification, introducing "topological common sense" as an alternative to traditional pixel-perfect robust estimation. The authors critique existing Spatial Verification (SP) methods and propose a Topological Verification (TP) model that enhances the RANSAC process by maximizing Homeomorphism regions. The evaluation demonstrates significant improvements in performance on various datasets, establishing new state-of-the-art results without the need for fine-tuning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of topological consistency to the RANSAC process is an interesting and innovative idea.
- The biological inspiration behind the TP model is sound and effectively emulates human visual processing.
- The proposed method shows robust performance, outperforming traditional SP methods and demonstrating high explainability.

Weaknesses:
- The claim of explainability needs clarification, as SP methods also offer some level of explainability.
- The focus on retrieval as a proxy task limits the generalizability of the method; exploring other applications like matching or loop closure could strengthen the work.
- The technical contributions are somewhat limited, as the combination of RANSAC and topological models lacks novel insights, and comparisons with a broader range of methods are insufficient.
- Missing details in the methodology, such as the initial hypothesis set and the workings of the saccade function, could hinder understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their claims regarding explainability, particularly in distinguishing their approach from SP methods. Additionally, exploring the applicability of TP in other tasks beyond retrieval would enhance the paper's impact. We suggest including a more comprehensive comparison with existing methods, particularly those that do not require fine-tuning, and conducting experiments on diverse datasets to validate the method's robustness. Addressing the missing details in the methodology and providing a time and memory analysis would also strengthen the paper.
