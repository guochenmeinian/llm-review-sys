Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a generic algorithm that converts item-level differential privacy (DP) algorithms into user-level DP algorithms, achieving a $\sqrt{m}$ improvement in user complexity. The authors recover previous user complexity bounds across various learning tasks and demonstrate the transformation's applicability in settings with limited samples per user. The work also establishes a connection between sample perfect generalization and local deletion DP, leading to tight user sample complexity bounds for several privacy-preserving machine learning applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The transformation from item-level to user-level DP is applicable in scarce settings, unlike previous works that require sufficient samples per user.
- The authors derive new bounds for PAC learning in the example-scarce setting and clarify the relationship between DP and perfect generalization.
- The writing is clear, and the paper is well-structured, making it easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed algorithm lacks computational efficiency, which is a significant drawback.
- The paper does not address the lower bound for the $\sqrt{m}$ factor, which could enhance the completeness of the analysis.
- Some technical details, such as the specifications for $\varepsilon', \delta'$ in Theorem 16, require further clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm to enhance its practical applicability. Additionally, addressing the lower bound for the $\sqrt{m}$ factor would strengthen the theoretical contributions. In Theorem 16, we suggest providing specific criteria for how small $\varepsilon', \delta'$ should be. Furthermore, clarifying the connection between local deletion DP and user-level DP would benefit readers' understanding. Lastly, we encourage the authors to refine the presentation of the technical overview to enhance clarity.
