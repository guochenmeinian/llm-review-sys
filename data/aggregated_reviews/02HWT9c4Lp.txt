Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Voxel Proposal Network (VPNet), which aims to achieve semantic scene completion through a voxel proposal mechanism and a multi-frame knowledge distillation scheme. The authors propose a dual-branch architecture that utilizes a Confident Voxel Proposal (CVP) module for generating confident voxel features and a Multi-Frame Knowledge Distillation (MFKD) module to enhance performance by fusing information from multi-sweep LiDAR data. The method demonstrates improved performance on the SemanticKITTI and SemanticPOSS datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The approach of reconstructing from reliable occupied voxels and propagating information is effective for semantic scene completion.
2. The originality of VPNet lies in its prediction of offsets for confident voxel proposals, distinguishing it from existing methods.
3. The paper includes comprehensive ablation experiments and extensive evaluations on two benchmarks.
4. The structure of the manuscript is clear, with well-benchmarked qualitative and quantitative results.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation behind the proposed components, particularly MFKD, is insufficiently explained, leaving unclear how VPNet addresses the limitations of existing methods.
2. The writing quality requires improvement, with some technical descriptions leading to confusion regarding the processing of inputs.
3. The performance comparison with state-of-the-art methods, particularly SCPNet, is lacking, and the differences in protocol need clarification.
4. The use of excessive symbols complicates the technical details, making them difficult to follow.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for using MFKD and provide a straightforward analysis of how VPNet overcomes the limitations of existing methods. Additionally, we suggest revising the writing to avoid confusion regarding the processing of inputs and to simplify technical descriptions. It is essential to include comparisons with at least three state-of-the-art knowledge distillation algorithms and clarify the differences between MFKD and SCPNet. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide a clearer overview of the network components before delving into specific designs.
