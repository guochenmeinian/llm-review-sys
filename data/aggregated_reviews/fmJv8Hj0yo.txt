Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Diffusion-ITM, a method that adapts diffusion-based models for image-text matching tasks without the need for retraining. The authors introduce the Generative-Discriminative Evaluation Benchmark (GDBench), which encompasses seven complex vision-and-language tasks and bias evaluations. The results indicate that Diffusion-ITM is competitive across multiple tasks and outperforms CLIP. The paper emphasizes the importance of integrating discriminative and generative models and provides a new benchmark for future research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel method for adapting diffusion-based models for image-text matching tasks without retraining, which has practical implications.
- The evaluation of the proposed method across various vision-and-language tasks offers valuable insights into its performance and potential biases.
- The creation of a new benchmark for image generation models enhances comparative analysis within the research community.
- The paper is well-structured and clearly articulated.

Weaknesses:
- The findings regarding the performance of Stable Diffusion are interesting but not particularly surprising, given its pre-training on numerous image-text pairs.
- The method's performance on more challenging benchmarks, such as Winoground, is subpar, indicating areas for improvement.
- The paper lacks a theoretical analysis of applying generative diffusion models to discriminative tasks, which would enhance understanding.
- There is no analysis of time cost or efficiency; the inference speed of Stable Diffusion is slow, and the method's step assignment needs clarification.
- Minor issues, including punctuation errors and formatting inconsistencies, require attention.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis of applying diffusion models to discriminative tasks to provide deeper insights. Additionally, addressing the performance on challenging benchmarks like Winoground is crucial for demonstrating the method's robustness. We suggest including a comprehensive analysis of computational costs and efficiency, particularly in relation to inference speed. Clarifying the assignment of time steps in the method and ensuring consistency in formatting and punctuation throughout the paper would enhance its overall quality. Lastly, considering the inclusion of more diverse zero-shot classification tasks in GDBench could broaden its applicability.
