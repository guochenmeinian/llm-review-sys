### Key Points
This paper investigates the challenge of distinguishing a Gaussian pancake distribution from a Gaussian distribution through score estimation. The authors demonstrate that assuming the $L^2$-error of score estimation is of the order $\log(d)$ allows for a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the Gaussian pancake problem. They also establish that in the cryptographically hard regime, a polynomial sample complexity $O(d)$ ensures a small score estimation error for Gaussian pancake problems. The main theorem presents a statistical-computational gap, indicating that if efficient $L^2$-accurate score estimation is achievable, it implies a computationally efficient solution for the Gaussian pancakes problem, which is considered hard under lattice-based cryptography assumptions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The authors introduce a novel perspective on the Gaussian pancake problem by framing it within the context of score estimation from diffusion models. Theorem 3.1 is particularly noteworthy, as it shows that accurate score estimation enables polynomial-time solutions to the Gaussian pancake problem. The paper is well-written, clear, and provides valuable insights into the statistical-computational gap, contributing significantly to the literature on diffusion models and computational hardness.

Weaknesses:  
The paper's assertion that score estimation is cryptographically hard is confusing. The main theorem suggests that the Gaussian pancake problem can be solved under specific assumptions, while the hardness of score estimation appears to contradict this. The relationship between Theorems 3.1 and 4.2 is unclear, particularly regarding the $O(\log d)$ error assumption in Theorem 3.1 versus the polynomial $O(d)$ upper bound in Theorem 4.2, which may leave the narrative incomplete. Additionally, the work lacks empirical evidence related to diffusion models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the relationship between the hardness of score estimation and the Gaussian pancake problem, particularly addressing the confusion surrounding the implications of Theorems 3.1 and 4.2. It would be beneficial to explicitly outline how the assumptions in these theorems interact. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors enhance the paper by including empirical evidence to support their theoretical claims, particularly in the context of diffusion models.
