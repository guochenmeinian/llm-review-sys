### Key Points
This paper presents Quick Back-Translation (QBT), a novel method for unsupervised machine translation that repurposes the Transformer encoder as a generative model. By utilizing encoder-generated sequences to enhance the decoder, QBT aims to address the computational load of autoregressive inference and improve data throughput. The experimental evaluation indicates that while QBT enhances training efficiency, the improvements in translation quality are limited, with only a modest increase of approximately 0.2 BLEU.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of non-autoregressive (NAR) generation in QBT effectively improves translation efficiency.
- The paper is well written, clear, and supported by extensive experimentation.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of QBT is limited, as it primarily alters the autoregressive structure to a non-autoregressive one.
- Improvements in translation quality are minimal, and the evaluation relies heavily on a single metric (BLEU), which may not fully capture the method's effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by incorporating additional metrics beyond BLEU, such as COMET, and conducting significance tests to substantiate the effectiveness of QBT. Further analysis on how encoder-generated sequences contribute to decoder performance would enhance understanding of QBT's mechanisms. Additionally, we suggest providing insights into any trade-offs or drawbacks encountered in model performance, such as encoding quality or training stability, and clarifying the specific characteristics of the Transformer architecture that facilitate its repurposing for generative tasks.
