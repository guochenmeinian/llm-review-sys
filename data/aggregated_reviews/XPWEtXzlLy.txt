### Key Points
This paper presents the Mirror Diffusion Model (MDM), a novel class of diffusion models that operates within a constrained convex set by transforming the generation process from a constrained original space to an unconstrained dual space. The MDM allows for efficient training and sampling akin to unconstrained diffusion models, with a subsequent mapping back to the original space. The authors demonstrate that MDM outperforms reflected diffusion models in quality and efficiency and showcases its application in watermark generation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces a new diffusion model that effectively confines generation to a constrained convex set, utilizing a transformation to an unconstrained dual space for efficient training and sampling.  
- It provides clear instructions for designing strongly convex functions applicable to various shapes, enhancing the model's versatility.  
- Experimental results indicate that MDM achieves superior generation quality and efficiency compared to reflected diffusion models, with competitive results in watermark generation.

Weaknesses:  
- The requirement for a strongly convex function whose gradient maps the constrained convex set to the entire \(R^d\) space raises concerns about how this condition is ensured.  
- The performance gap between MDM-proj and MDM-dual remains significant, and the dual-space distribution may not be adequately specialized for pixel-based image generation.  
- The experiments could benefit from evaluation on more realistic datasets, such as CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, to strengthen the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by providing proofs that the gradient of the strongly convex function maps the constrained convex set to the whole \(R^d\). Additionally, we suggest including more experimental results on realistic datasets like CIFAR-100 and ImageNet to validate the model's performance further. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to address the compression in Section 5.2 to enhance understanding and clarify the implications of the polytope constraint on watermarking. Lastly, addressing the related literature on learning diffusion models in constrained domains would strengthen the paper's context.
