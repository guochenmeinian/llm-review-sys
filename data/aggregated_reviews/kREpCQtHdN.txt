Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework, the Individualized Markov Decision Processes (iMDPs), to address the challenge of identifying individualized state-transition processes in reinforcement learning (RL) influenced by latent individual-specific factors. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for the identifiability of these factors and propose a generative-based method for learning them from observed state-action trajectories. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on various datasets, including synthetic and real-world scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Theoretical guarantees for identifiability under both finite and infinite conditions.
2. A practical method for learning individualized RL policies from observed data, employing variational autoencoders with vector quantization.
3. Comprehensive experimental validation across multiple datasets, showcasing the method's robustness and versatility.
4. The modular nature of the iMDP framework allows for independent study and improvement of its components.

Weaknesses:
1. The assumption that latent individual-specific factors are time-invariant may not hold in real-world scenarios where these factors can evolve.
2. The method's generalizability to all types of RL problems, particularly those with instantaneous causal influences, is uncertain.
3. Limited real-world validation in critical domains like healthcare and education, with a need for more diverse experimental environments.
4. The paper lacks detailed evaluation metrics for the policy adaptation process for new individuals.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors address the limitation of time-invariant latent factors by discussing potential extensions for time-varying factors in the limitations section.
2. We suggest incorporating real-world experiments in healthcare or education to validate the practical utility of the method.
3. We recommend providing detailed evaluation metrics and benchmarks for the policy adaptation process to assess its effectiveness and efficiency.
4. We encourage the authors to include a discussion in the appendix about the differences and connections between iMDP and related frameworks such as meta-RL and POMDPs.
