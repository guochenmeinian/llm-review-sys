Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents MotionGPT, an innovative approach that integrates language modeling with human motion modeling by treating motion tokens similarly to language tokens. The authors utilize a motion tokenizer based on VQ-VAE, followed by fine-tuning a pretrained language model on a unified vocabulary of motion and language. The model is then instruction-finetuned for tasks such as text-to-motion, motion completion, and motion captioning, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across these tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The novel concept of treating motion as discrete tokens for language models opens avenues for numerous applications, with comprehensive tasks showcasing the model's flexibility.
- The quantitative and qualitative results indicate state-of-the-art performance, generating natural human motion and demonstrating impressive multi-task capabilities.
- Extensive ablation studies provide a thorough analysis of the model's design choices.

Weaknesses:
- The absence of failure analysis raises concerns about understanding the model's learning of the motion-language relationship.
- The evaluated motions in the supplementary materials appear simplistic, questioning the model's ability to generalize to more complex, unseen tasks.
- The quantized representation may limit motion representation due to sequence-level encoding, potentially affecting performance in practical applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the failure analysis to better gauge the model's learning capabilities. Additionally, the authors should consider evaluating more complex motion scenarios to assess generalization effectively. It would be beneficial to explore the granularity of the motion representation and its impact on performance, particularly in practical applications. Lastly, we suggest increasing the sample size in user studies for more reliable evaluations, ideally to around 50 participants.
