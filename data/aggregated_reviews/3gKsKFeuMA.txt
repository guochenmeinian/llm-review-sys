Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretically sound Fourier shifting operator aimed at enhancing the learning capability of small-size image restoration models. The authors propose Deep Fourier Shifting, a novel approach that models the shift mechanism within the Fourier domain, offering two variantsâ€”amplitude-phase and real-imaginary. The proposed operator can be integrated into existing image restoration networks, demonstrating improved performance and reduced computational overhead across various tasks, including denoising and low-light enhancement.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed deep Fourier shifting operator is theoretically plausible, transforming spatial shifting into an information-preserving Fourier cycling manner, thus enhancing learning.
2. Integration of Fourier shifting into existing methods improves performance and reduces model parameters, showcasing practical effectiveness.
3. The paper is well-organized, with a clear presentation that aids in understanding the progression from problem formulation to solution.

Weaknesses:
1. The two Fourier shifting variants do not consistently outperform each other across different baselines, and the authors should clarify which variant to choose for specific scenarios.
2. The generalizability of the shifting displacement effect needs further explanation, particularly regarding the underlying mechanisms that contribute to better generalization.
3. The contribution may appear limited, as the paper lacks focus on real-world datasets and practical implementation challenges, such as memory usage and adaptability to hardware platforms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the selection of Fourier shifting variants for different baselines and application scenarios. Additionally, the authors should provide insights into the underlying mechanisms that enhance generalization. Addressing practical implementation challenges, including memory usage and adaptability to various hardware, would enhance the manuscript's relevance. Furthermore, incorporating recent studies from 2023 and beyond would ensure the manuscript reflects the latest advancements in the field. Lastly, we suggest revising the title to better align with the content and contributions of the paper, as well as correcting typographical errors throughout the manuscript.
