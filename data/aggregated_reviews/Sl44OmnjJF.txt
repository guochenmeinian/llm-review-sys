### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive study on browser fingerprinting's role in online tracking and targeted advertising, proposing the FPTrace framework to analyze the relationship between browser fingerprints and advertising behaviors. The authors investigate how changes in browser fingerprints influence bidding patterns and HTTP records, revealing significant implications for user privacy under regulations like GDPR and CCPA.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research question is novel and practical, addressing a significant gap in existing literature.
- The FPTrace framework effectively simulates user interactions and captures detailed data, enhancing the reliability of findings.
- The methodology includes rigorous quantitative analysis, demonstrating a clear relationship between fingerprinting and advertisement tracking.

Weaknesses:
- The abstract lacks specific quantitative results or key statistics, which could strengthen claims.
- The assertion of being the "first study" to measure browser fingerprinting may require further substantiation.
- The complexity of FPTrace could limit its practical application for some users.
- The study acknowledges limitations in conclusively linking fingerprinting to cookie restoration, which may detract from the overall validity of the findings.
- The paper does not sufficiently explore how fingerprinting practices might circumvent privacy regulations, limiting the impact of its findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the abstract by including specific quantitative results or key statistics to support their claims. Additionally, we suggest providing a nuanced discussion regarding the claim of being the "first study" to measure browser fingerprinting. To enhance the practical utility of FPTrace, consider simplifying its implementation or providing clearer guidance for users with varying technical expertise. We also encourage a deeper analysis of how fingerprinting may circumvent privacy regulations to strengthen the implications of the findings. Lastly, addressing the reproducibility of results by curating a dataset and including comparisons with existing tools would significantly enhance the paper's impact.
