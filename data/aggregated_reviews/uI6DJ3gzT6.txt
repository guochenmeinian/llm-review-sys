### Key Points
This paper presents a novel recommendation algorithm utilizing box representations to enhance diversity in recommendation systems. The authors propose a black-box single-point embedding of users and items, which is expanded into box embeddings, allowing for a broader range of recommendations. The intersection of user and item boxes indicates potential recommendations, and the paper introduces two new metrics for evaluating diversity. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation for using box embeddings to improve diversity is promising and well-articulated.
2. The similarity function effectively captures user-item relationships, contributing to overall accuracy.
3. The authors meticulously designed two new diversity evaluation metrics, addressing shortcomings in existing methods.
4. Extensive experiments were conducted, and results were thoroughly analyzed, showcasing the practical applicability of the methods.

Weaknesses:
1. Insufficient justification for design choices leaves many questions unanswered, such as the impact of high-dimensional box volume and the necessity of box representations for items.
2. The overall performance comparison lacks clarity, making it difficult to assess improvements from the LCD-UC model.
3. The narrow selection of base models does not convincingly demonstrate the universality of the proposed method.
4. The manuscript does not adequately compare conventional diversity methods, and the experimental settings are not clearly described.
5. The use of different MLPs raises concerns about the robustness of findings due to potential overfitting from additional parameters.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for their design choices, particularly addressing the implications of high-dimensional box volume and the necessity of box representations for items. Clarifying the performance comparison and expanding the selection of base models would strengthen the demonstration of the LCD-UC model's universality. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with conventional diversity methods and providing clearer descriptions of experimental settings. Finally, detailing the online test results and discussing the implications of the new diversity metrics in real-world scenarios would enhance the paper's contributions.
