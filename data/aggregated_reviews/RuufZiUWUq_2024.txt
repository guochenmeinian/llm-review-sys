### Key Points
This paper presents a method to exploit vulnerabilities in the unlearning process of Large Language Models (LLMs) through a technique called Activation Steering. The authors demonstrate that even when information is supposedly unlearned, it can be accurately recovered by manipulating activation patterns. The study reveals that current unlearning methods inadequately eliminate sensitive knowledge, exposing models to targeted attacks and emphasizing the necessity for more robust unlearning strategies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. **Novelty**: The introduction of activation steering for precise information retrieval from unlearned data is innovative and advances beyond existing methods.  
2. **Simplicity**: The method relies on straightforward activation manipulations and prompt anonymization, enhancing its practical applicability.  
3. **Direct Identification of Unlearning Issues**: The paper effectively highlights the shortcomings of existing unlearning techniques, demonstrating that sensitive data remains retrievable.

Weaknesses:  
1. **Subjective Evaluation Criteria**: Using keyword frequencies as a proxy for answer correctness may introduce bias and fail to capture semantic accuracy.  
2. **Lack of Tasks**: The focus on unlearning scenarios limits the evaluation; including a broader range of tasks could enhance the assessment of the method's capabilities.  
3. **Unclear Process Description**: The explanation of generating steering vectors and the anonymization strategy lacks clarity, necessitating a more detailed step-by-step description for reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method's process, particularly in generating steering vectors and the anonymization strategy. Additionally, expanding the experiments to include various tasks would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the method's effectiveness. Addressing the subjective nature of the evaluation criteria could also enhance the robustness of the findings.
