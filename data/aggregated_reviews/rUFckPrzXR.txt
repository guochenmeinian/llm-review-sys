Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel training method for Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NeuralODEs) that integrates synchronization and homotopy optimization. The authors argue that this approach smooths the loss landscape, facilitating better optimization and achieving competitive results in convergence speed and accuracy, particularly for long training data. The method demonstrates robustness across various dynamical systems, outperforming traditional techniques like vanilla SGD and multiple-shooting algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The combination of homotopy optimization with synchronization is innovative and well-suited for training NeuralODEs on dynamical system tasks.
2. The method effectively enhances training efficiency and addresses issues related to irregular loss landscapes.
3. It is model-agnostic, imposing no restrictions on model structure or parameters, which increases its general applicability.
4. The experimental results validate the method's effectiveness across various scenarios.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks rigorous theoretical support for its claims, relying primarily on empirical results without a detailed analysis of the loss landscape's properties.
2. The proposed method has only been tested on low-dimensional toy models, limiting its applicability to more complex systems.
3. There is insufficient comparison with existing stabilized models that limit expressivity to highlight the advantages of the new method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical foundation of their method by including discussions on the smoothness of the loss landscape and the implications of the Hessian trace after incorporating coupling terms for homotopy optimization. Additionally, we suggest providing experimental results on more complex real-world datasets to demonstrate the method's applicability beyond low-dimensional models. It would also be beneficial to include sensitivity analyses regarding hyperparameter selection and to explore the method's performance in high-dimensional systems or control applications.
