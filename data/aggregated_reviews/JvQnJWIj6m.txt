### Key Points
This paper presents C-JEPA, a novel contrastive self-supervised learning framework that enhances the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (I-JEPA) by integrating Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization (VICReg). The authors propose that C-JEPA addresses limitations such as model collapse and inaccurate mean patch representations, demonstrating its effectiveness through rigorous empirical and theoretical evaluations. C-JEPA achieves superior performance metrics across various tasks, including image classification and object detection, with improved convergence.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The integration of VICReg with I-JEPA effectively addresses critical issues like model collapse and enhances visual representation learning.  
- The framework is supported by extensive empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, showing superior performance compared to existing methods.  
- The writing is smooth and easy to follow, with comprehensive validation through ablation studies and qualitative visualizations.  

Weaknesses:  
- The contrastive learning approach lacks novelty, being a simple combination of I-JEPA and VICRegâ€™s regularization strategy.  
- Further comparisons with leading methods like Dinov2, Mocov3, and IWM are necessary for benchmarking against current advancements.  
- The paper does not adequately address the computational overhead introduced by the additional regularization terms.  
- There are typographical errors, such as an invalid citation in line 302, and the applicability of C-JEPA to video tasks remains unexplored.  
- Limitations regarding computational complexity and environmental concerns due to large network capacity are not sufficiently discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their approach by exploring more innovative integrations beyond the combination of I-JEPA and VICReg. Additionally, please provide comparisons with the latest leading methods like Dinov2, Mocov3, and IWM to strengthen the benchmarking of C-JEPA. We suggest clarifying the basis for claims regarding training speed and stability, as well as addressing the computational overhead introduced by the VICReg integration. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore the applicability of C-JEPA to video-related tasks and to include a discussion of the limitations and potential negative societal impacts of their work, particularly regarding computational demands and environmental concerns.
