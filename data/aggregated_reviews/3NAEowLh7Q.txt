Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents OpenGaussian, a method utilizing 3D Gaussian Splatting for open vocabulary comprehension at the 3D point level. The authors propose three techniques: intra-mask smoothing loss and inter-mask contrastive loss for feature enhancement, a two-level codebook for discretization, and an instance-level 3D-2D association technique. OpenGaussian addresses the limitations of existing 3DGS methods focused on 2D pixel-level analysis, demonstrating effectiveness in various tasks, including open-vocabulary object selection and 3D point cloud understanding.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation is well-grounded, and the proposed method is technically sound.
2. Visualizations are clear, effectively showcasing the advantages of OpenGaussian over previous literature.
3. The method demonstrates good performance across various tasks, validated by extensive experiments.

Weaknesses:
1. The ablation studies are insufficiently thorough, particularly regarding the use of xyz information and the need for results at the coarse-level with k=64 and k=320.
2. The paper's writing requires improvement, as it may be challenging for readers without abundant prior knowledge.
3. There is no discussion of limitations or efficiency comparisons with previous methods, particularly regarding inference time and real-time performance.
4. The three contributions appear separate; a more integrated narrative is encouraged.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the thoroughness of the ablation studies, particularly by including results for the coarse-level with xyz information. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis for k1 and k2 should be provided to clarify their impact on performance. We suggest enhancing the clarity of the writing to make it more accessible to a broader audience and including a discussion of limitations. Finally, we encourage the authors to integrate the three contributions into a cohesive narrative and provide efficiency comparisons, including inference time, to assess real-time applicability.
