Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an approach called “SynGen” aimed at improving attribute binding between nouns and their modifiers in text-to-image latent diffusion models, specifically Stable Diffusion. The authors propose a two-part loss on attention maps that (1) encourages similarity between attention maps of nouns and their modifiers, and (2) ensures that attention maps for nouns/modifiers differ from those of other tokens in the prompt. The paper evaluates SynGen using three datasets, including a newly proposed challenge set, and demonstrates its effectiveness through human evaluations, qualitative analyses, and ablation studies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper addresses a significant challenge in text-to-image diffusion models related to generating objects with accurate attributes.  
2. The proposed two-part loss imposes localized pairwise constraints on attention maps, effectively linking image patches to both nouns and their modifiers while preventing interference from other tokens.  
3. The evaluation includes a wide range of prompts, including those from prior work and a new challenge set, enhancing the robustness of the findings.  
4. The authors conduct thorough ablation studies to understand the effects of the proposed losses.

Weaknesses:  
1. The method is closely tied to the Attend-and-Excite framework, yet this connection is not adequately highlighted in the introduction, suggesting a need for revision in Section 2.  
2. The general “content separation” rating in human evaluations is insufficient; finer-grained scores for object counts and attribute accuracy would provide a clearer assessment of task success.  
3. The loss function ablation indicates that some objects may be omitted from generated images; exploring the combination of proposed losses with global constraints from Attend-and-Excite could be beneficial.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the connection to the Attend-and-Excite framework in Section 2. Additionally, consider collecting more detailed human evaluation metrics to assess the number of objects generated and their attribute accuracy. We suggest exploring the combination of the proposed losses with global constraints from the Attend-and-Excite paper to address the issue of omitted objects. Furthermore, it would be helpful to clarify that this is an inference-only guidance procedure and correct the identified typographical errors. Lastly, reorganizing the examples in Figures 4, 5, and 6 chronologically would enhance readability.
