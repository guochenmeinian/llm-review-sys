Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel continuously weighted contrastive loss function (CWCL) for multi-modal models, addressing the similarity of samples within the same batch and the non-binary nature of similarity between input samples. The authors propose a method that utilizes a continuous weight matrix to enhance alignment between modalities, demonstrating significant performance improvements in zero-shot classification tasks compared to standard approaches like LiT and SimCLR.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method effectively resolves key issues in standard contrastive loss, showcasing novelty in its approach.
- The authors provide strong experimental results across various modalities, including text-image and speech-image, with notable zero-shot evaluation outcomes.
- The method is computationally efficient, requiring only $\mathcal{O}(k^2)$ for pairwise weights per batch.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental results lack completeness, particularly in comparisons with baseline models such as LiT or CLIP, which diminishes the evaluation's robustness.
- The presentation of results, especially in Section 4.2.1, is unclear and difficult to follow.
- The paper does not adequately ground the main contribution (CWCL) within the context of existing literature, failing to cite relevant prior work that addresses similar shortcomings in contrastive learning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of experimental results, particularly by providing comparisons with baseline models to strengthen the evaluation. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the presentation of results in Section 4.2.1 for better readability. It would also be beneficial to include a limitations section to address potential shortcomings of the proposed method. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore and discuss alternative continuous pairwise weights to provide deeper insights into their main contribution.
