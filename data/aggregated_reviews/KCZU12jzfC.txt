### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative framework that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate textual data into urban region profiling. The authors pose critical questions regarding the effectiveness of augmenting traditional data sources, such as satellite images, with textual information. The methodology is described clearly, and extensive numerical evaluations demonstrate the model's efficiency. The findings suggest that the incorporation of textual modality can enhance the accuracy of urban region profiling.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-organized, facilitating comprehension.
2. The use of LLMs to augment imagery with textual information represents a novel approach in the field.
3. The experimental analysis is comprehensive, highlighting the significance and future potential of the UrbanCLIP framework.

Weaknesses:
1. The methodology for incorporating LLMs is somewhat confusing, particularly regarding the alignment of textual and image information.
2. The paper achieves modest improvements over the current state-of-the-art (SOTA), which could be elaborated further.
3. Key aspects of the method, such as text refinement and the filtering of low-quality texts, lack detailed explanations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology, particularly regarding the alignment of textual and image information. Additionally, we suggest providing more detailed explanations about the data and evaluation of downstream tasks, including whether urban region profiling labels are at the image or city level. It would also be beneficial to analyze cases where LLMs fail to generate effective text and clarify the techniques used to filter low-quality texts. Lastly, we encourage the authors to address the confusion surrounding the loss function in the prompt-guided downstream task section.
