Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an advancement in data selection methods by building on the reducible hold-out loss selection (RHO-LOSS) approach. The authors propose a reasonable approximation for the non-trivial objective function and eliminate the need for additional hold-out data. The work includes both theoretical results, such as a lower bound for hard-to-estimate objectives, and empirical results demonstrating the method's efficacy across various datasets in the vision setting.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors provide a well-motivated and clearly explained method.
- The paper includes both theoretical and empirical results, showcasing improvements in robust generalization and training acceleration.
- The experiments cover a range of datasets and models, with good ablation studies on tuning the zero-shot predictor.

Weaknesses:
- The paper does not convincingly demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, particularly RHO-LOSS, as indicated by the results in Table 1 and Figure 1.
- The ablation study lacks sufficient experimental results across more datasets and model structures, and comparisons with RHO-LOSS are not adequately addressed.
- There are concerns regarding the dependency on clean data through the zero-shot predictor, which may undermine claims of independence from oracle clean data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their comparisons with RHO-LOSS by providing more intuitive empirical and theoretical analyses of their method's effectiveness and efficiency. Additionally, we suggest expanding the ablation study to include more datasets and model structures to validate conclusions. It would also be beneficial to clarify how target accuracies are selected and to provide empirical measurements of the time added by the proposed method compared to standard training. Finally, addressing the potential impact of the zero-shot predictor's performance on the overall method would strengthen the paper's claims.
