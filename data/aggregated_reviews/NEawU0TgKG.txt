Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel parameterization method for dataset distillation called FreD, which utilizes the frequency domain to create a compact synthetic dataset from a larger original dataset. By employing frequency-based transforms, the method optimizes the frequency representations of data instances, concentrating spatial domain information on specific frequency components. The authors provide both theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating FreD's efficiency compared to conventional methods, addressing challenges posed by large datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The approach of using frequency domain information is innovative and has not been previously explored.
2. The paper is well-written, with clear explanations and a comprehensive suite of experiments validating the proposed method.
3. The visualization of distilled results enhances understanding of the algorithm's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. The experiments lack diversity, focusing primarily on small datasets like CIFAR, which limits the interpretation of the algorithm's usefulness for larger datasets.
2. There are no transfer experiments to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach in transfer learning contexts.
3. The choice of transform (DCT, DFT, or DWT) and its impact on performance is not thoroughly discussed.
4. The inconsistency in IPC values across tables raises questions about the methodology and its implications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental design by including larger datasets to better assess the algorithm's applicability. Additionally, conducting transfer experiments would provide insights into the method's effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Clarifying the choice of frequency transform and its implications on performance is essential. Furthermore, addressing the inconsistencies in IPC values and providing a complexity analysis would enhance the paper's rigor. Lastly, including visualizations for 3D datasets would broaden the scope of the evaluation.
