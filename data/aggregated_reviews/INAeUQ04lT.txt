Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents `TimeXer`, a Transformer-based model for time series forecasting that effectively integrates exogenous variables to enhance prediction accuracy. The authors propose a novel architecture that utilizes innovative attention mechanisms, demonstrating its effectiveness through extensive experiments across various real-world datasets, showcasing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a meaningful approach to integrating exogenous variables into Transformer-based models for time series forecasting.
- The model design is well-thought-out, and the experiments are comprehensive, validating the method across different domains and prediction horizons.
- The paper is well-structured and clearly articulates the problem, solution, and results, making it accessible to readers.

Weaknesses:
- There is no comparison with native models that can forecast using exogenous variables.
- The implementation details for extending TimeXer to multivariate time series prediction are insufficient.
- Some relevant literature is missing, which should be included in the camera-ready version.
- The methodology lacks intuitive examples demonstrating how the model learns from exogenous variables.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with native forecasting models that utilize exogenous variables. Additionally, provide more detailed implementation guidance on extending TimeXer for multivariate time series prediction. It is crucial to include the missing relevant literature in the final version. Furthermore, we suggest incorporating intuitive examples that illustrate how TimeXer effectively utilizes exogenous variables, enhancing the model's practical relevance. Lastly, clarify the rationale for using the non-overlapping patch method over the overlapping method in the methodology section.
