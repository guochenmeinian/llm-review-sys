Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the complexity of sampling from heavy-tailed distributions, distinguishing between high-accuracy and low-accuracy guarantees. The authors analyze proximal samplers based on Gaussian and stable oracles, demonstrating that Gaussian oracle-based samplers can only achieve low-accuracy guarantees, while stable oracle-based samplers can achieve high-accuracy guarantees. The paper establishes lower bounds for stable oracle samplers, indicating that the upper bounds presented are optimal. Additionally, it proposes a novel sampler based on restricted alpha-stable oracles, replacing the standard heat equation with a fractional heat flow, and provides a practical implementation for the case of alpha=1.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem is well-motivated and interesting.
- The algorithms are well-designed, with upper and lower bounds derived for different settings.
- The authors provide insightful discussions and solid theoretical proofs.
- The work presents a clear separation in performance between stable and Gaussian proximal samplers, supported by a combination of lower and upper bounds.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks experimental validation of the theoretical findings, which is essential for a comprehensive evaluation.
- The presentation is somewhat dense, which may hinder understanding, although this is largely due to the technical nature of the work.
- There are no implementable algorithms for general alpha values in (0,2), and the impact of alpha on efficiency is not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including empirical experiments to validate the theoretical results and provide a toy illustration for the implementable algorithm in the alpha=1 case. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the impact of alpha on the efficiency of the samplers and consider simplifying the presentation to enhance readability. Finally, providing real-world examples to motivate the problem would strengthen the paper's relevance.
