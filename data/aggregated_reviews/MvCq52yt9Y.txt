Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the issue of popularity bias in Graph Collaborative Filtering (GCF) and its connection to Dimensionality Collapse (DC) in the embedding space. The authors propose a novel decorrelated penalty based on LogDet divergence to mitigate these issues. They provide both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence demonstrating that GCF LogDet can extend to full-rank embedding matrices while maintaining a small condition number. The proposed method outperforms other contrastive-based GCF models on benchmark datasets, enhancing recommendation effectiveness for less popular items.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper explores significant limitations in graph collaborative filtering algorithms and introduces GCF-LogDet, effectively addressing dimensionality collapse and popularity bias.
- It provides a thorough theoretical and empirical analysis of dimensionality collapse and demonstrates high-quality self-supervised embeddings.
- The methodology and experimental setup are well-documented, with detailed proofs in supplementary materials.

Weaknesses:
- The paper does not explicitly establish the correlation between dimensionality collapse and popularity bias, which could confuse readers regarding the rationale behind the proposed method.
- There is a lack of comprehensive comparisons with existing methods that specifically address popularity bias in GCF.
- The related work section does not adequately compare with methods tackling dimensionality collapse, missing relevant literature.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction or related work section by explicitly discussing the connection between dimensionality collapse and popularity bias. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on how their method specifically addresses popularity bias, providing theoretical or empirical explanations. We suggest revising the experimental section to include comparisons with existing methods that directly address popularity bias, such as the r-regularization based graph aggregation plugin. Furthermore, the authors should enhance the related work section by discussing and comparing methods that alleviate dimensionality collapse, including those proposed in recent literature.
