### Key Points
This paper presents a novel hybrid model called MCNet (Monotonic Calibration Networks) aimed at improving uncertainty calibration in online advertising. MCNet incorporates a Monotonic Calibration Function (MCF), an order-preserving regularizer, and a field-balance regularizer to enhance model performance and reliability. The authors provide a well-structured explanation of MCNet, supported by theoretical foundations and extensive experimental validation across public and private datasets. The proposed solution effectively addresses the calibration problem, demonstrating improved prediction accuracy and fairness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of monotonic neural networks and regularization techniques is innovative.
- The paper features a comprehensive evaluation, including detailed ablation studies and comparisons with existing methods.
- Clear presentation and structured organization enhance readability.

Weaknesses:
- The model's performance varies significantly across datasets, with modest improvements noted in some cases.
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion of the root causes of miscalibration and the rationale for preferring post-hoc calibration methods.
- Regularization techniques and their hyperparameter tuning may present practical challenges.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the primary causes of miscalibration in the datasets and clarify why a post-hoc calibration method was chosen over an end-to-end strategy. Additionally, providing a more detailed explanation of field imbalance and the conditions under which the field-balance regularizer is effective would enhance understanding. We suggest elaborating on the effectiveness of the order-preserving regularizer and addressing potential scenarios where it may fail. Furthermore, clarifying the rationale for using different learning rates for MCNet-None and MCNet-Field could provide valuable insights. Lastly, exploring computationally less intensive approaches for model training and inference, as suggested, could improve efficiency.
