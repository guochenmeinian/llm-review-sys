### Key Points
This paper presents a method called ImbGNN to address both class imbalance and structural imbalance in graph classification. The authors propose a degree-oriented optional augmentation (DoOA) to generate graphs with a more imbalanced degree distribution and a size-oriented Graph of Graphs (GoG) construction to improve class imbalance by allowing smaller graphs to access more information. The paper includes experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles an important problem in graph classification by considering both class and structural imbalances.
- The proposed techniques, DoOA and GoG, are original and intuitively effective.
- The paper is well-structured, clearly written, and includes comprehensive experimental evaluations.

Weaknesses:
- The interrelationship between class imbalance and structural imbalance is not adequately explored, lacking clarity on their mutual impacts.
- The definition of structural imbalance is vague and should be more formally defined.
- The paper does not sufficiently address the negative effects of rigid augmentation strategies on imbalanced graph learning.
- There is insufficient theoretical analysis regarding the effectiveness of the GoG construction and potential noise propagation.
- Important baseline methods for graph class imbalance learning are not discussed or compared, limiting the demonstration of the proposed model's effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the relationship between class imbalance and structural imbalance, providing specific examples of their interactions. Additionally, a more formal definition of structural imbalance should be included. The authors should address the negative impacts of rigid augmentation strategies on imbalanced graph learning and provide a theoretical analysis of the GoG construction's effectiveness. Furthermore, we suggest including discussions and comparisons with relevant baseline methods such as GraphSMOTE, GraphSHA, and Tail-GNN to strengthen the paper's claims. Lastly, the formatting of equations should be unified, ensuring consistency throughout the paper.
