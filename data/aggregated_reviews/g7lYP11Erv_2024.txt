Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a regularization method for prompt learning aimed at enhancing the generalizability of point cloud analysis in 3D tasks. The authors propose a framework comprising three constraints: mutual agreement, text diversity, and model ensemble, which can be integrated into existing large multi-modal 3D models. Additionally, they introduce three new benchmarks for evaluating 3D domain generalization, confirming the effectiveness of their approach through experimental results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The framework is simple yet effective.
2. The writing is clear and easy to follow.
3. The introduction of new benchmarks may benefit the research community.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the work is questionable, as prompt tuning has been extensively studied in other domains, and the proposed constraints appear similar to existing methods.
2. The relationships within the text diversity constraint are unclear, and the method lacks detailed explanations of its components.
3. The proposed method seems overly simplistic, lacking specific designs for integrating LLMs with 3D point cloud multimodal learning.
4. There is insufficient analysis of the method's limitations and sensitivity to hyperparameters.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the relationships between the components of the text diversity constraint and how they relate to the regularization in Eq.2. Additionally, we suggest including diagrams to illustrate the existing multi-modal frameworks and the authors' improvements. The authors should also analyze the sensitivity of the model ensemble constraint to its hyperparameters and justify the necessity of ensembling across all epochs. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the advantages of prompt learning for domain generalization compared to fine-tuning methods like Low Rank Adaptation and to enhance the literature review by incorporating relevant works on domain adaptation and generalization for 3D point clouds.
