Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical analysis of data subsampling for Poisson regression using ID-link and root-link functions, focusing on the construction of sublinear coresets under specific assumptions characterized by the parameter $\rho$. The authors extend existing techniques to demonstrate that Poisson regression can admit small coresets when using polynomial link functions, despite the canonical log-link function not allowing for such coresets. The work emphasizes the significance of the $\rho$-complex parameter for data compressibility and the relationship between VC-dimension and total sensitivity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The results appear to be novel and contribute to the understanding of coresets for Poisson regression, a topic of growing interest in machine learning.  
- The paper provides a convincing theoretical framework, particularly in subdividing input functions to achieve improved bounds for VC-dimension.  
- The writing is generally clear, with high-level ideas and intuitions well articulated, making the theoretical contributions accessible.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks a well-structured format, failing to clearly introduce key concepts, discuss related work in detail, or provide a summary/conclusion.  
- There is insufficient justification for the relevance of studying non-canonical link functions, which may render the problem less interesting to a broader audience.  
- The techniques employed are largely extensions of prior work, leading to conclusions that may not be surprising.  
- The absence of experimental results weakens the practical implications of the theoretical findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the structure of the paper by clearly delineating the introduction, proposed methods, and conclusions. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed discussion of related work and the limitations of their approach. To enhance clarity, consider presenting the proposed data subsampling techniques in a pseudo-code format. We also suggest including experimental results to validate the theoretical claims and to address the relevance of the $\rho$ parameter more thoroughly. Lastly, revising the title to reflect the focus on $p$-th root links would better align with the content of the paper.
