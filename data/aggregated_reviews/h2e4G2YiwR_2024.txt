Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents “TwinAct,” a novel method for separating actions from actors in few-shot action image generation using text-guided diffusion models (TGDMs). The authors propose a common textual action feature space to avoid interference from actor-specific visual semantics, streamlining the process into three steps: constructing the action space from key phrases, imitating actions within this space, and generating context-adaptive images using an action similarity loss. The results demonstrate TwinAct's robustness and versatility for personalized content generation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The method's approach to imitating actions through a combination of action bases is innovative and facilitates few-shot customization.
2. The paper is well-structured and clearly articulated, with a sound technical explanation of the methodology.
3. Experimental results are impressive, showcasing TwinAct's robustness and potential applications for customized characters and actions.

Weaknesses:
1. The performance degradation observed in Figure 6 when two people are involved needs clarification.
2. The authors should provide a detailed explanation of how the model can be customized for both character and action.
3. Examples and analyses of TwinAct's failures or suboptimal performances are lacking, along with steps to address these issues.
4. Including figures similar to Figures 8 and 9 from the appendix in the main text would enhance the results' persuasiveness for readers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the performance degradation in Figure 6 when two actors are present. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on the customization process for both character and action. Providing examples of failure modes and discussing potential solutions would strengthen the paper. Lastly, we suggest incorporating key figures from the appendix into the main text to make the results more accessible to readers.
