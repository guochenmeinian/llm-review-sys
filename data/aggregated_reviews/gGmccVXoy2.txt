### Key Points
This paper presents a methodology for tip of the tongue (TOT) retrieval by decomposing long and complex queries, introducing the WhatsThatBook dataset, which consists of real-world TOT queries for books. The authors propose a retrieval-by-decomposition approach, where each long query is decomposed into sub-queries targeting different fields, and these are processed by individual retrievers. The results indicate that incorporating query decomposition into existing retrievers improves state-of-the-art performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of the WhatsThatBook dataset is a significant contribution to the field.
- The proposed retrieval-by-decomposition method is novel and demonstrates effectiveness against classical IR baselines.
- The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, facilitating reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- The methodology lacks rigor, as the decomposition strategy appears ad hoc and does not incorporate additional linguistic or contextual information.
- There is a lack of comprehensive experiments, including ablation studies and comparisons with more recent baselines.
- The dataset's limited size (approximately 14k documents) raises concerns about the generalizability of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the methodological rigor by implementing a more structured approach to query decomposition, potentially incorporating linguistic or contextual factors. Additionally, conducting at least two ablation studies to validate the contributions of LLM and query decomposition would strengthen the findings. The authors should also consider expanding their baseline comparisons to include more recent models and multi-modal approaches. Finally, addressing the dataset's limitations by exploring its performance with a larger knowledge base would enhance the robustness of their conclusions.
