### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for personalized video-to-text generation, addressing the task of personalized video commenting. The authors propose a PVCG framework that includes a clip selector for predicting user-commented clips and a text generator for producing comments based on user preferences. The framework employs confidence-aware scheduled sampling and iterative inference strategies to tackle the absence of ground truth clips during inference. Additionally, a new dataset is introduced to facilitate the study of personalized video comments generation, and extensive experiments are conducted to validate the model's effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of personalized video commenting fills a gap in existing models that overlook user preferences.
2. The PVCG framework effectively integrates clip selection and text generation, optimized in an end-to-end manner.
3. A novel dataset is provided for personalized video comments generation.
4. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed model's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. The authors do not compare their model with recent video-based baselines, such as video-chatgpt.
2. Authorization for data collection from the website https://www.bilibili.com is unclear.
3. The dataset division information for experiments is not specified.
4. Methodological clarity, particularly regarding the visual modeling description, is lacking.
5. The paper does not address the long-tail phenomenon in user modeling.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the methodological clarity, especially regarding the visual modeling description. Additionally, we suggest incorporating comparisons with recent video-based models as baselines to enhance the persuasiveness of the findings. It is also essential to clarify the authorization for data collection from the specified website and provide detailed division information for the proposed dataset. Furthermore, an analysis of time and space complexity should be included, along with a discussion on the long-tail phenomenon in user modeling. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide real-world examples of applications that utilize their framework for real-time streaming video commenting.
