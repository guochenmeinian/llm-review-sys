Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents HotBEV, a transformer-based model designed for 3D detection tasks from multi-view camera data, focusing on hardware efficiency and real-time inference. The authors propose a latency-aware design strategy, incorporating a convolutional modulation layer and a hardware-oriented backbone to optimize inference speed and accuracy. Additionally, the paper introduces a framework for optimizing 3D BEV detection using Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to balance performance and efficiency, along with a theoretical latency prediction model that shows favorable results in latency comparison. However, the marginal improvements in performance and efficiency raise questions about the necessity of NAS for this optimization. The authors acknowledge the need for a self-contained paper and plan to elaborate on various concepts in the final version.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively addresses the need for efficient 3D detection models, emphasizing practical latency gains.
- The design methodology allows for customization to specific hardware, enhancing adaptability.
- Comprehensive benchmarking results provide valuable insights for improving inference efficiency.
- The authors provide a comprehensive rebuttal addressing initial concerns.
- The theoretical latency prediction model demonstrates promising results.
- The intention to release code for community assessment is commendable.

Weaknesses:
- The justification for focusing on multi-frame models over 3D representations lacks sufficient discussion and experimental backing, limiting applicability to other sensor data.
- The examined GPU devices are predominantly high-power, neglecting the potential for embedded GPU considerations.
- Certain sections of the methodology are dense and challenging to follow, leading to unclear points.
- Comparisons with stronger baselines and recent works are insufficient, particularly regarding the necessity of the latency prediction model.
- The introduction of numerous concepts without succinct explanations complicates comprehension.
- Marginal performance improvements relative to state-of-the-art raise doubts about the effectiveness of NAS in this context.
- The ability of the latency prediction model to estimate on-device speeds across diverse GPU architectures remains uncertain.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for their design choices, particularly regarding the focus on multi-frame models, and provide experimental evidence to support this decision. Additionally, consider including comparisons with embedded GPU devices to broaden the applicability of the proposed methodology. The writing should be clarified in dense sections to enhance readability. We also suggest a more thorough discussion of how the proposed methods compare with 3D reconstruction-based BEV detectors and a detailed analysis of the latency prediction model's effectiveness against realistic latency measurements. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the self-containment of the paper by providing clearer explanations of introduced concepts. It would be beneficial to clarify the necessity of using NAS for optimizing the trade-off between speed and performance and to address the model's capability to accurately estimate on-device speeds across various GPU architectures. Finally, including results from the Waymo Open Dataset and comparisons with modern transformer-based backbones would strengthen the paper's contributions.
