### Key Points
This paper presents Tourbillon, a biologically plausible architecture utilizing circular autoencoders trained asynchronously with various recirculation algorithms in a self-supervised manner. The authors provide preliminary results on the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets, highlighting the potential advantages of their approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written, with clear motivation and ease of understanding.  
- Tourbillon demonstrates greater biological plausibility compared to other bio-compatible methods.  

Weaknesses:  
- The first paragraph is overly argumentative, asserting that gradient descent is the "sole" effective optimization method in high-dimensional spaces, which could be softened to "an extremely effective optimization method."  
- There are inconsistencies and errors, including a lack of citations for "Feedback Alignment (FA), Difference Target Propagation (DTP), Stacked Autoencoders, and the Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm," and an incorrect figure reference on Line 101.  
- The experiments are conducted on small networks with simple datasets, and while scaling is not the current goal, exploring performance in larger architectures would be beneficial.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the first paragraph by rephrasing the claim about gradient descent to reflect its effectiveness without asserting exclusivity. Additionally, please include citations for the mentioned algorithms and correct the figure reference on Line 101. We suggest providing more detailed explanations of how Tourbillon addresses each biological implausibility and including a direct comparison with a standard baseline model.
