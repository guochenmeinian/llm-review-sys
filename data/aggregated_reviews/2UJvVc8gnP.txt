### Key Points
This paper presents Masked Path Modeling (MPM) to enhance vision-and-language navigation (VLN) performance by using masked paths to optimize single action prediction training. The authors demonstrate that MPM improves baseline success rates by approximately 1-2% across R2R, R4R, and RxR datasets. The approach is motivated by the need to address data scarcity in VLN and is applied to a history-aware multimodal transformer model, yielding notable performance gains.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- MPM is a simple yet effective framework that appears model-agnostic and scalable.
- The authors achieve strong results across multiple VLN datasets and provide interesting analyses.

Weaknesses:
- The data collection pipeline lacks novelty, as it does not create new paths and resembles existing methods like PREVALENT.
- The novelty of the mask-then-reconstruct idea for VLN is questionable, as similar concepts have been previously proposed.
- MPM's application is limited to fine-grained instruction-following tasks, and more diverse applications should be explored.
- Some claims and terminologies, such as "path dynamics," are not well-explained, leading to confusion.
- The rationale behind certain experimental results, such as the effect of 100% masking, requires further exploration.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their writing to resolve confusions raised by reviewers, particularly regarding terms like "path dynamics." Additionally, we suggest that the authors apply MPM to a broader range of tasks beyond fine-grained instruction-following, such as REVERIE, and include more comparative experiments with other models like DUET+MPM and EnvDrop+MPM to substantiate their claims. Finally, addressing the novelty concerns related to the data collection process and providing more detailed statistics about the collected paths would strengthen the paper.
