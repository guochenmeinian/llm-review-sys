### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for out-of-distribution (OOD) sample detection in inductive graph few-shot classification (GFSC) using a sand mixing scheme to introduce observed classes as artificial OOD samples into meta-tasks. The authors propose two unsupervised OOD discriminators based on distance and probability criteria, optimizing the graph-based encoder by integrating the performance of these discriminators. Experimental results across four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in both OOD detection and node classification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The practical setting of encountering unobserved classes during testing is relevant and widely applicable.
- The introduction of observed classes as artificial OOD samples is intuitive, and the proposed unsupervised OOD discriminators are novel.
- The evaluation protocol is comprehensive, including various baselines and conducting ablation studies and hyperparameter analyses.

Weaknesses:
- The framework is complicated with many hyperparameters, and the selection process for these values is unclear.
- Missing statistical significance tests raise questions about the reliability of the performance differences between SMUG and baseline methods.
- The logic in the introduction is somewhat chaotic, and the experiments rely on outdated baseline methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction to enhance logical flow. Additionally, we suggest including a separate subsection to discuss the synchronization of OOD samples and the limitations of the SMUG framework. It would be beneficial to conduct statistical significance tests to validate the performance differences reported in the experiments. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to consider more recent baseline methods and clarify the parameter settings for the baseline models used. Lastly, providing more readable figures and detailed captions would enhance the overall presentation of the results.
