### Key Points
This paper presents the implementation of the Langevin sampling algorithm using hardware circuits for MCMC sampling, specifically targeting Gaussian-Gaussian posterior, Bayesian linear regression, and Bayesian logistic regression. The authors demonstrate effectiveness in low-dimensional problems and analyze the time complexity as sub-linear. However, practical usability concerns remain unaddressed, particularly regarding circuit design for complex distributions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The manuscript is elegantly written and addresses a significant area, reducing complexity through stochastic computing techniques.  
- The complexity analysis and results are clearly discussed, showing promise for the proposed approach.  

Weaknesses:  
- There is no principled framework for circuit design, raising questions about scalability for complex distributions like neural networks.  
- The comparison of the proposed method to matrix inversion lacks fairness; a comparison to the Langevin algorithm simulated on a computer would be more appropriate.  
- SPICE simulations lack discussions on energy consumption, current, and voltage ranges, which are crucial for understanding practical applicability.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the selection of the Langevin sampling algorithm, explaining its intrinsic advantages over other sampling methods. Additionally, we suggest providing more quantitative specifics regarding the circuit, including current source values and noise source peak-to-peak ranges, as well as an analysis of energy consumption alongside complexity. Finally, we encourage the authors to develop a principled framework for circuit design that addresses scalability for complex distributions, particularly in the context of neural networks.
