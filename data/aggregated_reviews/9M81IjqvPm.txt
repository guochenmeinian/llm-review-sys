### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of the merging mechanism for ad and organic items in online advertising, addressing the overlap between these two types. The authors articulate the mechanism design problem and introduce the concept of form stability to simplify it. They propose two mechanisms, FIX and CHANGE, and analyze their competitive ratios under specific conditions. The study emphasizes the need for incentive compatibility in ad auctions, particularly when organic and paid impressions overlap.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper tackles a novel and relevant topic at the intersection of advertising auctions and recommendation systems, with clear logic and progressive depth in its analysis.  
- The proposed mechanisms yield promising results and are grounded in realistic scenarios, demonstrating a solid understanding of the underlying principles.

Weaknesses:  
- Numerous typographical errors detract from the overall quality, including misspellings and garbled references that suggest insufficient quality control prior to submission.  
- The introductory and preliminary sections lack clarity, making it difficult to grasp the problem's motivation and context. Additionally, some proofs and characterizations are either missing or inadequately justified.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introductory and preliminaries sections to better articulate the problem and its real-life applications. Additionally, we advise a thorough revision to correct typographical errors and ensure rigorous quality checks before future submissions. It would also be beneficial to provide proofs for Lemma 5.5 and the truthfulness of the FIX and CHANGE mechanisms, as well as to explore the generalization of results to randomized mechanisms. Lastly, justifications for assumptions regarding click-through rates and the extension of approximation results to broader settings should be included.
