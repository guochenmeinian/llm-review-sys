Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a dual approach to enhancing human decision-making in project selection through an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) and a greedy optimization algorithm known as MGPS. The authors frame the project selection problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and propose a myopic algorithm for action selection. Additionally, the paper introduces a metalevel-MDP formulation that addresses project selection evaluation without assuming symmetry in the model, thereby solving a more general problem compared to previous work. The authors emphasize the necessity of evaluating specific goals derived from a broader distribution of rewards and express skepticism regarding the feasibility of the proposed solution algorithm based on value iteration for their tutoring system, highlighting the need for efficient online computation of information-gathering actions. The effectiveness of the ITS is evaluated through a user study, demonstrating improved performance among participants trained with the tutor compared to those without.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and clearly presents the algorithm.
- The user study is rigorously designed, showing the effectiveness of the tutoring system.
- The formulation addresses a general problem by not assuming symmetry, enhancing its applicability.
- The requirement to evaluate specific goals from a wider distribution of rewards adds depth to the analysis.

Weaknesses:
- The contributions are incremental, lacking novelty compared to existing literature, particularly in the context of POMDPs.
- The blending of two distinct ideas—algorithm development and tutoring system design—results in a superficial treatment of both.
- The algorithm's myopic approximation limits its generalizability, and the authors do not sufficiently analyze its properties or connect it to existing decision process literature.
- There is concern about the feasibility of the proposed solution algorithm for practical implementation in the tutoring system.
- The potential externalization of important strategy components through manually designed information rewards may limit the approach's effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the depth of analysis on the MGPS algorithm, including a theoretical exploration of its properties and comparisons to other algorithms, such as bandit strategies. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the novelty of their approach in relation to existing POMDP literature and consider using more recent algorithms for comparison, such as POMCP or its variants. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to enhance the user study by including a baseline that displays the AI agent's recommendations during test time and to investigate what users are learning from the tutoring system to provide clearer insights into its effectiveness. Lastly, we recommend that the authors explore alternative methods to improve the feasibility of the proposed solution algorithm for their tutoring system, allowing for efficient online computation of the value of information-gathering actions, and consider rephrasing the problem to incorporate past work as additional baselines, which could strengthen the overall argument.
