### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the bandit task assignment problem, where tasks are selected sequentially, each with uncertain processing times and rewards. The authors propose an algorithm with a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{MNT})$, where $T$ is the time horizon, $N$ is the number of tasks, and $M$ is the maximum number of concurrent tasks. The algorithm utilizes a UCB-based approach and demonstrates optimality through a lower bound analysis. The paper includes numerical experiments that compare the proposed algorithm with existing methods, highlighting its superiority.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a well-motivated and interesting learning scenario, effectively distinguishing it from existing related works.
- The theoretical analysis is rigorous, providing detailed proofs and a non-trivial regret bound that indicates optimality.
- The writing is clear and organized, with well-defined notation and minimal typographical errors.
- The proposed algorithm addresses practical challenges in task assignment under uncertainty, supported by empirical evidence of its effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The techniques primarily rely on prior work, which may limit the novelty of the contributions.
- The empirical evaluation is limited to synthetic datasets, lacking real-world data and broader scenarios.
- The paper does not adequately discuss the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm.
- There is insufficient sensitivity analysis regarding key parameters, which could inform the algorithm's robustness.
- Practical implementation considerations are not thoroughly addressed, limiting applicability in dynamic environments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the notation in Section 3, particularly regarding the initial confusion with $b \le a$. A brief explanation would enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest formalizing the footnote on page 4 and providing a comparison with blocking bandits, particularly in the context of task assignment without constraints. Discussing why bandit task assignment may be easier than blocking bandits would add depth. 

To strengthen the empirical evaluation, we recommend incorporating real-world data and exploring a wider range of scenarios with varying $\bar{r}$ and $\bar{c}$. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis of the algorithm's computational complexity should be included to assess scalability. Conducting sensitivity analyses across different parameter values would provide valuable insights into the algorithm's performance. Lastly, we encourage the authors to elaborate on practical implementation strategies and potential modifications to the problem framework to accommodate uncertainty in processing times.
