### Key Points
This paper presents SongCreator, a novel song-generation system capable of creating complete songs with both vocals and accompaniment from given lyrics. The authors propose a dual-sequence language model (DSLM) and an innovative attention mask strategy, which significantly enhances the musicality of generated songs and allows for the completion of various song generation tasks within a single model. Extensive testing indicates that SongCreator outperforms existing models like MusicLM, MusicGen, GPT, Suno, and Udio in generating lyrics-to-song and lyrics-to-vocals, while also enabling independent control over the acoustic characteristics of vocals and accompaniment. The authors emphasize the challenges of comparing their method with Suno due to differences in dataset quality and size, but assert that DSLM achieves musicality close to ground truth samples despite these limitations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses an important topic in song generation, a complex area of AI research.
2. The introduction of DSLM and its attention masking strategies enhances the musicality of generated songs.
3. DSLM's capability to handle multiple song generation tasks within a single model is a significant advancement over previous works.
4. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed models and methods, providing clear comparisons of performance against existing models.

Weaknesses:
1. The introduction lacks clear logic and motivation, making it hard to identify the unique contributions compared to existing models.
2. The related works in Table 1 are confusing; Jukebox is omitted yet discussed extensively, which may understate the originality of the proposed methods.
3. The dataset used for training is relatively small and of lower quality, which may affect the generated song quality.
4. The paper lacks a comparison of inference latency, which could provide insights into the trade-off between performance and speed.
5. The quality of "original song" samples on the demo page is unclear, raising questions about their source and processing.
6. The exclusion of prominent music generation products like Suno and Udio from detailed discussion is a notable oversight.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction to clearly articulate the unique contributions of SongCreator compared to existing models. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the presentation of related works in Table 1 to avoid confusion regarding the omission of Jukebox. The authors should also provide a more comprehensive discussion of how SongCreator differentiates from products like Suno and Udio, either in the limitations section or within the main text. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to enhance the clarity of figures and descriptions, particularly in explaining the attention mask strategies and the data processing methods. We also recommend improving the clarity regarding the quality of "original song" samples on the demo page by specifying whether they were taken from DISCO-10M or in-house datasets. Adding a table for inference latency in the final version would give readers a high-level understanding of the trade-off between performance and speed. Lastly, including examples to illustrate the gap between academic research and commercial products like Suno would enhance the paper's impact.
