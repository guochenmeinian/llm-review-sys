### Key Points
This paper presents a study on automatic text dating (ATD) through the introduction of a time-aware text encoder named TALM, which is designed to capture temporal information. The authors propose a diachronic document modeling framework to achieve document-level representations for long historical texts. Experiments conducted on a Chinese historical corpus demonstrate improvements over existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem addressed is intriguing and relevant, contributing to a deeper understanding of historical context in language processing.
- The empirical validation on a Chinese diachronic corpus shows practical effectiveness, with TALM outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
- The paper provides insightful interpretations of results, particularly regarding challenges in predicting specific historical periods.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the method is limited, with significant elements borrowed from existing works, such as Hamilton et al. (2016) and Grail et al. (2021).
- Evaluation is based solely on one dataset, which raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings.
- The presentation quality is subpar, with formatting issues and unclear arrangements in tables and figures.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their contributions by clearly distinguishing their work from existing methods. Expanding the evaluation to include multiple datasets and comparisons with Large Language Models, such as GPT models, would enhance the robustness of their findings. Additionally, addressing ethical and societal implications related to the use of language models in historical analysis is crucial. We suggest refining the clarity of the paper's presentation, possibly by using a LaTeX template, and providing more detailed explanations of the dataset and model parameters. Finally, exploring the incorporation of meta-temporal features, such as author and genre, could enrich the analysis.
