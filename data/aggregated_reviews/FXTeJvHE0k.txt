Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents NAVSIM, a benchmarking framework for closed-loop evaluations based on real-world data, enabling non-reactive testing and assessment of planning outcomes without relying on simulators like CARLA. The authors propose innovative metrics, including PDMS, and a standardized dataset derived from nuPlan, enhancing the framework's applicability. The paper is well-structured, with comprehensive experimental analysis, including benchmarks and results from the CVPR 2024 NAVSIM Challenge, demonstrating the framework's significance in the field of end-to-end autonomous driving.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- NAVSIM addresses a significant challenge in closed-loop simulation, providing a practical solution for current research.
- The framework's use in the CVPR 2024 Challenge highlights its relevance and contribution to the community.
- The paper is well-written, with clear presentation and thorough experimental validation, including insightful analyses.

Weaknesses:
- The short simulation horizon may limit the evaluation of long-term planning decisions and ride comfort.
- The framework may not account for unmarked objects in the bird's eye view data, and road elevation changes could be overlooked.
- The fixed 15-second simulation duration may not be robust for all scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the limitations related to the short simulation horizon and its impact on long-term decision-making. Additionally, we suggest providing more insights on the selection of the closed-loop simulation duration, considering whether it could be dynamically adjusted based on specific scenarios. Clarifying the implications of using a non-reactive simulation and discussing the appropriateness of the chosen time horizon and weight values in the scoring function would also enhance the paper's depth.
