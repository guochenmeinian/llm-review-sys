Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a causal discovery method that addresses mixed functional relations data, incorporating both linear and nonlinear relationships. The authors propose a Jacobian score-based method to identify leaf nodes and recover causal order, utilizing a new "parent score" for improved pruning. Additionally, the paper introduces a framework called CaPS, which claims to be the weakest assumption capable of handling linear, nonlinear, and mixed relations simultaneously. The authors argue that while LiNGAM can work under non-Gaussian noises, it is limited to purely linear causal relations. Empirical results indicate that the proposed method outperforms baseline approaches on synthetic data and demonstrates competitive performance on real-world datasets, with CaPS consistently outperforming LiNGAM in non-Gaussian settings. The authors address concerns regarding the Gaussian noise assumption and the theoretical interpretability of their conditions, providing experimental evidence to support their claims.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper is clearly written and well-organized.  
2. The theoretical motivations are well-explained, and proofs are adequately provided.  
3. The experimental results are extensive, covering various theoretical aspects and competitors.  
4. The authors provide empirical evidence showing that CaPS outperforms LiNGAM under non-Gaussian conditions.  
5. The framework is claimed to handle a broader range of causal relations than existing models.  
6. Additional experiments enhance the understanding of the practical testability of the proposed conditions.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The assumption of non-decreasing variance of noises is overly restrictive and impractical.  
2. The results on real-world datasets are not compelling.  
3. The primary distinction between the proposed method and existing score-matching methods appears to be the introduction of Assumption 1, raising questions about its advantages.  
4. The identifiability conditions rely on stringent assumptions, and the Gaussian noise assumption may limit generalizability.  
5. The assumptions made in the framework lack natural theoretical interpretability and practical testability.  
6. The necessity of zero-mean Gaussian noise for asymptotic identifiability remains unclear, raising concerns about the method's practicality.  
7. The claim regarding the weakness of the assumptions in A2.2 is contested, as identifiable models exist under non-Gaussian noises.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the necessity of the "parent score" and clarify its advantages over traditional methods. Additionally, we suggest that the authors consider relaxing the assumptions regarding noise variance and explore the implications of non-Gaussian noise. It would also be beneficial to include comparisons with more recent methods such as DAGMA and TOPO to strengthen the contribution of the proposed approach. Furthermore, we recommend improving the clarity regarding the necessity of zero-mean Gaussian noise for asymptotic identifiability and confirming its relevance. We encourage the authors to provide a more detailed explanation of where Gaussian distribution is specifically required in the proof of Theorem 1. Finally, enhancing the experimental results on real-world datasets would provide a clearer demonstration of the method's practical applicability and help articulate the theoretical interpretability and practical testability of the assumptions further.
