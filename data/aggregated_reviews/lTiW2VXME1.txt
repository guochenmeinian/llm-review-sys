### Key Points
This paper presents a novel permission system called "Beast in the Cage," designed to enhance web security by tightly controlling JavaScript operations on web content and data. The system allows developers to define fine-grained policies for scripts interacting with HTML elements and data locations, leveraging mandatory access control principles. The authors implemented this system within the Chromium browser's Blink engine and developed a policy generation tool. The paper evaluates the system's performance, compatibility, and usability through benchmarks and a longitudinal study.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed system allows developers to specify permissions for individual elements, enhancing security and control.
- The development of a tool for automatic policy generation improves usability for web developers.
- Practical evaluations demonstrate the system's real-world applicability and minimal performance overhead.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation lacks depth and sufficient technical details, particularly regarding usability and compatibility claims.
- No publicly available source code raises concerns about reproducibility.
- The complexity of implementing and maintaining fine-grained policies may pose challenges, especially for dynamic websites.
- The effectiveness of the system heavily relies on developers' understanding of security risks and accurate policy definitions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- We recommend that the authors provide publicly available source code for "Beast in the Cage," including the policy generator and discussed browser extensions, to enhance reproducibility.
- We suggest that the authors expand Section 6 to maintain technical rigor and address usability and compatibility in greater detail.
- We recommend demonstrating the system's effectiveness by showcasing a real-world webpage not using "Beast in the Cage" and illustrating how it can be protected against attacks.
- We encourage the authors to introduce mechanisms for automatic policy validation to identify potential conflicts or security gaps.
- We recommend that the authors conduct more comprehensive testing across a wider range of complex websites to assess the system's impact on functionality and usability.
