### Key Points
This paper presents a new model poisoning attack for Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL), termed the "Normalized attack," and proposes an ensemble FRL approach that is provably secure against this and existing Byzantine attacks. The authors assert that their method maximizes the angular deviation between aggregated policy updates, distinguishing it from prior techniques. The paper includes extensive experiments demonstrating the attack's effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed defense.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a novel attack strategy tailored to Byzantine-robust FRL.
2. The proposed ensemble method is supported by formal proofs of robustness against poisoning attacks.
3. The organization and clarity of the paper are commendable, with comprehensive experiments.

Weaknesses:
1. The contribution is not sufficiently novel, as many robust aggregation methods against Byzantine attacks already exist.
2. The depth of the analysis is lacking, as the paper attempts to address both attacking and defending within a limited page count.
3. The majority vote ensembling method is not novel, with similar approaches documented in previous literature.
4. The assumption that attackers have knowledge of server rules is questionable, as typically, attackers control malicious clients without server insights.
5. The paper does not adequately discuss the communication and computational overhead of the proposed defense method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation section by providing a more in-depth discussion on the rationale for model poisoning attacks in real-world FRL deployments. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the theoretical analysis of the normalized attack, particularly regarding its performance against existing defenses like FedPG-BR. It would also be beneficial to include a comparison with state-of-the-art robust aggregation methods to enhance the evaluation of the proposed defense. Lastly, addressing the implications of the communication and computational overhead associated with the ensemble method would strengthen the paper's practical relevance.
