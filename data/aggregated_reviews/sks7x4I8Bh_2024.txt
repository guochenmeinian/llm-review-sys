Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on converting offline estimation algorithms into online estimation algorithms using an information-theoretic approach, introducing the Oracle-Efficient Online Estimation (OEOE) framework. The authors characterize the statistical and computational complexities of online estimation within this framework, demonstrating that near-optimal online estimation error can be achieved through offline estimation oracles, although computational efficiency is often limited. The framework is applied to interactive decision-making problems, highlighting the comparative strengths of online and offline estimators.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of the OEOE framework creatively bridges offline and online estimation, enhancing the understanding of statistical estimation in contemporary online learning.
2. The paper provides robust theoretical analysis and proofs, reflecting a deep comprehension of the complexities in transitioning offline algorithms to online contexts.
3. By examining the relative power of online and offline methods, the work addresses a fundamental question in statistical learning, with implications for practical applications like contextual bandits and reinforcement learning.

Weaknesses:
1. The OEOE framework's computational inefficiency is noted, and the authors could enhance this by exploring heuristic approaches or approximations that offer practical advantages despite potential trade-offs in theoretical guarantees.
2. The absence of empirical validation weakens the paper; including experimental results or simulations demonstrating the OEOE framework's practical performance would significantly strengthen the findings.
3. Certain sections, particularly detailed proofs and technical discussions, are dense and may hinder reader comprehension. Improving clarity through intuitive explanations, step-by-step breakdowns, or illustrative examples would enhance accessibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the computational efficiency of the OEOE framework by exploring heuristic approaches or approximations. Additionally, including empirical validation through experimental results or simulations would provide valuable insights into the practical performance of the framework. Lastly, enhancing the clarity of dense sections with more intuitive explanations and illustrative examples would make the paper more accessible to readers.
