### Key Points
This paper presents an application of LLMs to identify dissent within FOMC transcripts, exploring the Hawkishness/Dovishness of FOMC policy attitudes over time. The authors utilize the GPT-4 model to analyze sentiment in FOMC statements and transcripts, questioning whether the issued statements reflect the sentiments expressed in the transcripts. The study expands on previous work by Hansen and Kazinnik (2023) by analyzing 3,728 sentences from 1994 to 2016, contributing to the understanding of dissent within the FOMC.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a relevant research topic, enhancing understanding of dissent dynamics within the FOMC.
- The annotated dataset has numerous interesting applications in economics, finance, and NLP research.
- The use of GPT-4 is clearly explained, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing sentiment.

Weaknesses:
- The overall conclusions are not compelling, particularly regarding the insights from Figure 3b and its relevance.
- There is a significant lack of quality measures for verifying the results, raising concerns about the reliability of the findings.
- The contribution is viewed as relatively incremental, primarily shifting from GPT-3 to GPT-4 without substantial new insights.
- The study could benefit from a longer format to allow for more in-depth analysis and discussion of limitations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation of their findings by providing a quantitative analysis of Figure 3a, accounting for time in their analysis. Additionally, clarifying the evaluation or analysis presented in Figure 3b would enhance understanding. We suggest including definitions for "hawk" and "dove," along with a brief explanation of differing opinions on monetary policy aggressiveness. Incorporating measures of inflation over the analyzed period would also be beneficial. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to establish quality measures for the use of GPT-4, potentially exploring open-source systems for transparency. Lastly, a detailed comparison between manual and GPT-based annotations, including clarification on ambiguous terms like "escalates any borderline cases," would enrich the study.
