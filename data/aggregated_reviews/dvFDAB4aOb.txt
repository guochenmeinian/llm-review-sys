### Key Points
This paper presents FRANCIS, a framework for generating fake resumes aimed at enhancing job applicants' visibility on online platforms and manipulating company visibility. The authors introduce three attack scenarios: company promotion, company demotion, and user promotion, demonstrating the feasibility of data poisoning attacks on job platforms. However, the practical application of these attacks remains questionable, particularly regarding the real-world adoption of "Career predictions" algorithms and the feasibility of creating the necessary volume of fake resumes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and clear.
- It effectively identifies vulnerabilities in online job platforms.
- The evaluation is detailed and utilizes real-world data.

Weaknesses:
- The real-world applicability of the proposed attacks is unclear.
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion on the generalizability of findings across different platforms.
- Key terms and symbols are not consistently defined, leading to confusion.
- The ethical implications of using the dataset are insufficiently addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for the use of "Career predictions" algorithms by providing citations that support their real-world adoption. Additionally, introduce NEMO earlier in the paper to better frame the validation of FRANCIS. Clarify the definition of "injection ratio" and provide absolute hit ratios in the evaluation to gauge the effectiveness of the attacks. Discuss the generalization limitations of the findings and consider including a user demotion attack scenario. Lastly, address the ethical considerations regarding data collection and the risks associated with using the dataset.
