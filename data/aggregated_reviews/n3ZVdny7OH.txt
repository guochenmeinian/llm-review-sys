Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Distributionally Robust AUC (DRAUC) optimization method that integrates Wasserstein distance-based distributionally robust optimization (DRO) with AUC optimization. The authors reformulate the problem to address challenges such as computational feasibility and label bias, providing both theoretical and empirical validation across multiple datasets. The proposed frameworks, DRAUC-df and DRAUC-da, aim to enhance robustness against data perturbations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors effectively combine DRO with AUC optimization, resulting in a tractable framework that shows meaningful performance improvements over baseline methods.
- The theoretical analysis is well-motivated, and the experiments on corrupted long-tailed benchmarks demonstrate the proposed method's superiority.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation is limited to small-scale datasets like CIFAR and MNIST, raising concerns about the scalability of the proposed method to larger datasets.
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion of limitations and potential societal impacts, and there are issues with presentation clarity, including notation inconsistencies and the need for clearer explanations of certain equations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the experimental settings, particularly for CIFAR10-LT, to clarify the performance discrepancies observed. Additionally, addressing the limitations of the proposed method, especially regarding scalability and the potential for overly pessimistic models, would strengthen the paper. We also suggest including comparisons with f-divergence-based methods in the experiments and refining the presentation to enhance clarity and consistency in notation.
