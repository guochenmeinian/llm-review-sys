Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an improved PAC-Bayes bound for uniformly stable randomized algorithms, introducing new assumptions and proof techniques. The authors apply their general theorem to specific algorithms, namely stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and randomized coordinate descent (RCD), yielding sharper or novel PAC-Bayes bounds. The work aims to provide stronger generalization guarantees for stochastic algorithms by analyzing stability and PAC-Bayes, extending results beyond strong convexity to non-smooth convex problems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The improvement in the PAC-Bayes bound is significant, being sharper in most cases and potentially up to $\sqrt{n}$.
2. The introduction of new assumptions, particularly sub-exponential stability, offers a fresh perspective and innovative proof techniques that could be applied to other problems.
3. Concrete applications demonstrate the power of the general theorem, with sharper bounds for SGD that do not require strong convexity and a completely novel bound for RCD.
4. The paper is well-written, providing sufficient background and clear definitions, making it accessible even to those less familiar with PAC-Bayes.

Weaknesses:
1. The definition of prior and posterior over hyperparameters rather than the hypothesis class is confusing and requires clarification.
2. The terminology of "parameter" and "hyperparameter" is inconsistent with standard usage, leading to potential confusion; renaming may enhance clarity.
3. Some statements in theorems and results lack clarity, particularly regarding the significance of assumptions and the relationship between distributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by providing more background on the prior and posterior definitions, particularly in relation to the hypothesis class. Additionally, consider renaming "parameter" and "hyperparameter" to align with conventional meanings, as this could reduce confusion. We suggest addressing the specific questions raised regarding the significance of the PAC-Bayes analysis and the assumptions made, particularly in relation to the stability conditions. Furthermore, ensure that all references are cited with specific locations for reader ease, and verify the accuracy of constants in the proofs, particularly in Theorem 1 and Lemma A.1.
