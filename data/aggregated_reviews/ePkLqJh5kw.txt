Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the robustness of graph neural networks (GNNs) against edge noise during link prediction. The authors empirically investigate the effects of bilateral edge noise on input topology and target labels, leading to performance degradation and representation collapse. To mitigate these issues, they propose the Robust Graph Information Bottleneck (RGIB), which employs information theory to extract reliable supervision signals. The paper details two implementations of RGIB: RGIB-SSL, utilizing self-supervised learning, and RGIB-REP, employing data reparametrization for data denoising.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and organized, with a clear motivation for the research.
- The introduction of bilateral edge noise is a significant contribution to the field of GNNs.
- The RGIB principle is well-supported by empirical observations and theoretical analysis.
- Extensive experiments across various datasets and models validate the effectiveness of RGIB-SSL and RGIB-REP.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for hybrid graph augmentation in RGIB-SSL lacks clarity, and its superiority over other contrastive learning methods needs further explanation.
- The authors do not discuss the robustness of the proposed algorithm under adversarial attacks.
- There is insufficient exploration of RGIB's applicability to other graph representation learning tasks, such as node classification.
- The assumptions regarding clean node features and their impact on model sensitivity require further elaboration.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind hybrid graph augmentation and provide insights into its advantages over existing contrastive methods. Additionally, we suggest including evaluations of the proposed algorithm under adversarial attacks to demonstrate its robustness. It would also be beneficial to discuss how RGIB could enhance performance in other graph representation tasks, such as node classification, and to clarify the assumptions regarding clean node features and their implications for model sensitivity. Finally, consider moving the adversarial attack experiments from the appendix to the main body of the paper for better visibility.
