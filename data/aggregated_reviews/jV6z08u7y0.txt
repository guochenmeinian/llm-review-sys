Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the collaboration between consecutive layers in under-parameterized and over-parameterized neural networks, focusing on how this collaboration, termed co-correlation, relates to adversarial robustness. The authors introduce Dirichlet energy as a metric to evaluate adversarial risk and demonstrate that under-parameterized networks enhance performance through co-correlation, while over-parameterized networks achieve robustness independently of this correlation. The authors also propose to clarify the research goal in both the abstract and introduction, emphasizing the relationship between Dirichlet energy, adversarial robustness, and co-correlation. They plan to enhance the preliminary section with a detailed explanation of the neural network setting and its generalizability, include additional empirical evidence with complex models to support their proposed Theorem 4.1, and clarify assumptions in the dynamics of co-correlation by comparing them with existing works. The conclusion will be rephrased to reiterate the research goal and summarize the modeling approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a significant question in deep learning regarding the relationship between generalization, adversarial robustness, and network architecture from an original perspective.  
- It provides a comprehensive literature review and employs rigorous mathematical formulations for definitions and proofs.  
- The introduction of co-correlation offers a novel way to quantify layer collaboration and is supported by theoretical analysis and experiments.  
- The authors demonstrate a commitment to improving clarity and coherence in the manuscript, and the proposed modifications aim to enhance the understanding of key concepts and their interrelations.  
- The inclusion of additional empirical evidence with complex models strengthens the validity of the findings.  

Weaknesses:  
- The motivation for studying co-correlation and its connection to robustness and generalization is unclear, particularly in the abstract and introduction.  
- The relationship between Dirichlet energy and co-correlation lacks direct analysis, making it difficult to draw conclusions about adversarial robustness.  
- The paper's reliance on simplified models for experiments limits its applicability to practical neural networks.  
- The initial lack of clarity in stating the research goal may hinder reader comprehension.  
- Several grammatical and formatting issues detract from the clarity of the presentation.  
- The manuscript may benefit from a more thorough explanation of the neural network setting and its implications.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for studying co-correlation and its relevance to adversarial robustness in the abstract and introduction. Additionally, we suggest providing a more direct analysis connecting co-correlation dynamics to adversarial robustness. It would be beneficial to conduct experiments on more complex models beyond the simplified frameworks currently used. Furthermore, addressing the grammatical and formatting issues throughout the paper will enhance readability and professionalism. We also recommend that the authors provide a comprehensive explanation of the neural network setting, including its generalizability, and ensure that the reasoning behind their assumptions in the dynamics of co-correlation is well articulated and compared with existing literature. Finally, we encourage the authors to rephrase the conclusion to emphasize the research goal and summarize their modeling approach effectively.
