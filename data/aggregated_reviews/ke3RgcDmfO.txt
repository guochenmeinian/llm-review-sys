Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents TextDiffuser, a model designed to enhance text rendering in diffusion models by generating character-level text layouts. The authors propose a two-stage approach: the first stage estimates keyword layouts to create segmentation masks, while the second stage generates images conditioned on these masks. The work also introduces the MARIO-10M dataset, a large-scale collection of image-text pairs with OCR annotations, and establishes the MARIO-Eval benchmark for evaluating text rendering quality. The model is evaluated across multiple tasks, demonstrating its flexibility and controllability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-motivated and organized, addressing the challenge of generating text images with diffusion models.
2. The TextDiffuser model exhibits flexibility, adapting to various conditions as shown in experiments.
3. The introduction of the MARIO-10M dataset is a significant contribution, providing valuable resources for future research.

Weaknesses:
1. There is a mismatch between the character-level layout generated from standard fonts and the diverse styles of real text, limiting font generation diversity.
2. The model does not explicitly control attributes such as color, layout, and style, which affects generation diversity.
3. Performance comparisons are limited to general text-to-image diffusion models without specific optimization for text painting, necessitating comparisons with state-of-the-art text generation methods.
4. The methodology lacks clarity on handling complex characters and generating rich-text images, particularly in terms of perspective changes and ordering of text boxes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the adaptability of TextDiffuser for complex characters, such as Chinese, by extending the embeddings of segmentation masks and using a multilingual dataset for training. Additionally, we suggest incorporating fine-grained control signals for glyphs and adopting advanced frameworks like Stable Diffusion 2.1 for high-resolution rendering. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide a more comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art text generation methods and to clarify how the model manages the generation of rich-text images, particularly regarding the efficiency and accuracy of text generation when handling multiple queries.
