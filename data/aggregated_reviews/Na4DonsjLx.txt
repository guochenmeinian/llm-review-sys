Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper conducts an analysis of dialogue inference tasks, focusing on the semantic information gap between dialogue context and required outputs. The authors manually annotate task difficulty levels in the CICERO dataset, demonstrating that existing models like T5-base perform worse as the information gap increases. They propose a contrastive learning approach to bridge this gap, which shows improvements in model performance through various evaluation metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper presents a well-motivated topic that is of significant interest to the dialogue understanding community.
- It provides a human-annotated dataset for commonsense inference with task difficulty classifications, which is valuable for future research.
- The proposed contrastive learning method is intuitive, model-agnostic, and demonstrates consistent improvements in both automatic and human evaluations.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for the contrastive learning approach is unclear, and the selection of negative samples may not effectively address the information gap.
- The evaluation metrics yield inconsistent results, particularly regarding NLI metrics, which do not show improvement across all models.
- The baseline models used are considered outdated, and the paper lacks analysis on why certain metrics do not improve.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the motivation behind applying the contrastive learning approach and provide a more detailed analysis of the negative sample selection process. Additionally, we suggest that the authors evaluate more recent models and incorporate effective few-shot learning strategies. It would also be beneficial to analyze the discrepancies in evaluation metrics, particularly regarding NLI metrics, and to ensure that conclusions drawn from the results are consistent and well-supported.
