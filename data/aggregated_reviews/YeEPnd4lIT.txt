### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to the Dual Cold-Start Cross Domain Recommendation (Dual-CSCDR) problem through the User Distribution Mapping with Collaborative Filtering (UDMCF) framework. The authors propose a method that integrates a rating prediction module and a feature space alignment module, effectively utilizing non-overlapping user data to enhance recommendation performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the method's effectiveness across multiple datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed Dual-CSCDR problem is relevant and significant within the web conference context.
- UDMCF outperforms state-of-the-art models on various datasets, showcasing its strong performance.
- The methodology is technically sound, with clear presentation and detailed experimental results.

Weaknesses:
- Some descriptions of involved parameters are missing, such as the calculation of the KL-divergence term in Eq.(6).
- The architecture of the proposed neural network lacks detail, impacting reproducibility.
- The paper does not sufficiently explain the practical applications of the Dual-CSCDR task or how baseline models relate to it.
- The model framework diagram is overly simplistic and does not adequately represent internal structures.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the advantages of their approach compared to other methods, particularly regarding graph neural networks. Additionally, the authors should provide a detailed architecture of the proposed neural network to enhance reproducibility. It would be beneficial to include a pseudo algorithm for the UDOT and clarify the motivations behind certain methodological choices. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors discuss the potential applicability of their model to other recommendation problems beyond Dual-CSCDR and consider adding a structure for General Item Subgroup Distribution Adaptation to align item distributions. Lastly, a notation table could aid reader comprehension, and emphasizing "Dual Cold-Start" in the title would align it better with the content.
