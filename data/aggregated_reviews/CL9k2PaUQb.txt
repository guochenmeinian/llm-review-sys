Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a generalization of the surprisingly popular (SP) voting algorithm to the partial ranking setting, addressing the challenge of eliciting full rankings from agents. The authors propose Aggregated-SP and Partial-SP, which allow voters to report predictions on a subset of alternatives, thereby improving practicality in real-world applications. The paper demonstrates that these methods outperform conventional preference aggregation algorithms and provides theoretical bounds on sample complexity under a Mallows model distribution.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively addresses a significant limitation of previous methods by allowing for the elicitation of partial preferences, which is crucial for real-world applications.
- The proposed model for capturing agents' behaviors is theoretically sound and could facilitate future research on crowdsourcing ranking data.
- The experiments are robust, utilizing multiple datasets and various methods for comparison, yielding valuable insights.

Weaknesses:
- The paper's readability is hindered by unclear explanations of key concepts, such as the transformation of sparse elicitations into pairwise voting inputs and the principles behind the new algorithms.
- There is insufficient differentiation from prior work, particularly regarding the contributions of the previous paper [25], which should be more thoroughly compared.
- The theoretical guarantees provided appear to lack tightness, and certain assumptions, particularly in Section 6, are overly constrained.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the main text by providing more detailed explanations of how sparse elicitations are converted into pairwise voting inputs and elaborating on the principles of the new algorithms. Additionally, a more comprehensive comparison with the prior work [25] should be included to clarify the contributions of this paper. We suggest revisiting the theoretical guarantees to ensure they are more robust and addressing the limitations related to hyperparameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Finally, we encourage the authors to discuss the implications of applying SP to contexts like political polling, where the concept of ground truth may be problematic.
