Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for identifying causal mechanism shifts across different structural causal models (SCMs) and analyzing conditional differences in causal mechanisms across multiple environments. The authors propose a two-step algorithm, MSG, which first identifies nodes with mechanism shifts and then discovers causal parents and edge differences. The approach builds on recent advancements in score-matching based causal discovery, particularly under nonlinear additive noise models, and is evaluated against existing methods, demonstrating improved performance. The authors also enhance their experimental section by incorporating additional baselines, specifically Park et al. and Budhathoki et al., showing that their method consistently outperforms these baselines in terms of F1 score, precision, and recall across various settings. They address concerns regarding Assumption B and provide clarifications on the elbow strategy and statistical rigor in their methodology.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem addressed is significant, focusing on identifying changes without complete graph learning.
- The paper is well-structured, with clear motivation and theoretical results, making it accessible to readers.
- The proposed algorithm shows scalability, identifying mechanism shifts efficiently without extensive causal DAG estimation.
- The authors effectively incorporate additional baselines, enhancing the robustness of their experimental results.
- The method shows significant performance improvements over existing approaches, as evidenced by the provided metrics.
- The authors demonstrate responsiveness to reviewer feedback, indicating a willingness to refine their work.

Weaknesses:
- The invariant noise assumption (Assumption B) is considered unrealistic and restricts the generalizability of the method.
- Some reviewers express concerns about the need for rigorous statistical results to support the method's claims.
- The main contribution, Theorem 1, is viewed as a straightforward extension of existing results, lacking novelty.
- The experiments are limited, missing comparisons with important related works and failing to evaluate certain algorithm components.
- The paper may require substantial revisions to address key comments and assumptions, particularly regarding the elbow strategy and the definition of shifted nodes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding Assumption B, particularly regarding its implications for root nodes and the handling of shifted noise distributions. Clarifying how root nodes are treated in the context of interventions would enhance the paper's rigor. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with the DCI algorithm and the work by Varici et al. (2021) to strengthen the experimental validation. Expanding the experiments to include more baseline methods and addressing the performance of Algorithm 2 in terms of efficiency would provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Furthermore, we recommend improving the statistical rigor of the method by providing more detailed results that avoid undefined scenarios, such as zero divided by zero. Specifically, consider proposing a new statistic that incorporates a small epsilon value in the denominator to ensure well-defined behavior in cases where leaf nodes are not shifted. Finally, please provide references to support the elbow strategy as a classic heuristic and clarify the theoretical foundations of the method to enhance its credibility. Including a conclusion section to summarize findings and implications would also be beneficial.
