### Key Points
This paper presents a replay-based continual learning approach that addresses catastrophic forgetting while enhancing generalizability for future tasks. The authors propose a method that includes salient subset selection and salient parameter selection, utilizing an instance-wise relation distillation loss (IRD) adapted for specific embeddings. The method is built on contrastive learning principles, aiming to preserve generalizable knowledge while allowing for plasticity in learning new tasks. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the baseline Co2L in certain scenarios, although not universally.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The approach demonstrates improvements over the baseline Co2L method, with a clear focus on saliency scores at task boundaries.  
- The experimental design is thorough, and the results are well-presented, showcasing some state-of-the-art outcomes.  
- The paper is clearly written and discusses related work comprehensively.  

Weaknesses:  
- The weight saliency approach does not yield further improvements, raising questions about its effectiveness.  
- The authors do not explore future research directions, which is a missed opportunity for a workshop paper.  
- There is a lack of comparison with established methods like FIM/EWC/AFEC in the context of salient parameter selection.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the weight saliency approach, providing a detailed analysis of its lack of improvement. Additionally, we suggest incorporating comparisons with FIM/EWC/AFEC to clarify the advantages of their method. To enhance clarity, we advise condensing Section 2 and including a figure that illustrates the pipeline for easier comprehension. Lastly, addressing the implications of saliency score generation changes and the applicability of the method in dynamic task scenarios would strengthen the paper.
