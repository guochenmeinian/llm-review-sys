### Key Points
This paper presents a method for stance detection that decouples topic-agnostic and topic-aware representations through two separate embedding layers trained via contrastive learning. The authors propose a new dataset for pre-training the topic-aware embeddings and report state-of-the-art performance on several stance detection datasets. However, the contributions are perceived as incremental, and the overall presentation of the paper is problematic.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an important problem in stance detection and proposes an effective solution.
- The combination of topic-agnostic and topic-aware features demonstrates innovation in generalizing stance detection to unseen topics.
- The organization of the paper is clear, making it easy to follow the narrative.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the topic-agnostic and topic-aware features is unclear, as similar ideas have been proposed in prior work.
- The analysis of experiments lacks depth, and the rationale behind the choice of contrastive learning is insufficiently explained.
- The paper contains numerous grammatical errors, typos, and poorly presented figures, which detract from its quality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the novelty of the TAG and TAW encoding layers by providing a more in-depth explanation of the rationale for using contrastive learning and triplet loss. Additionally, a more comprehensive analysis of the experimental results is necessary. The authors should address the peculiar performance of the few-shot setting compared to zero-shot and include a discussion on the potential biases introduced by the topic-aware embeddings. Finally, we urge the authors to correct grammatical errors, typos, and improve the overall presentation of figures for the next version of the paper.
