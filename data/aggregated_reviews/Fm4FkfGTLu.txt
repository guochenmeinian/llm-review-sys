Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents gRNAde, a geometric deep learning pipeline for RNA sequence design that addresses the RNA reverse folding problem. The authors propose a multi-graph representation and extend message passing to operate independently on each conformer while sharing an adjacency graph. The evaluation techniques compare gRNAde's performance against Rosetta and RDesign, showing improved results, particularly when utilizing multiple conformers. The authors also introduce a new dataset for RNA inverse design and conduct a zero-shot ranking analysis on mutation data. They emphasize the importance of autoregressive decoding for structural self-consistency, contrasting it with RDesign's non-autoregressive approach, while acknowledging challenges in reproducing RDesign's results due to issues with data splits and model sampling capabilities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is exceptionally well written, providing a thorough overview of the challenges in RNA design and the significance of the problem.
- The authors provide a rigorous comparison of gRNAde with existing models, including detailed ablation studies, demonstrating promising results despite limited performance improvements.
- The experimental validation assesses the utility of design choices and includes a variant effect evaluation, showing convincing improvements over random baselines.
- The authors provide a novel approach to multi-state design and representation learning for biomolecules, positioning gRNAde as a more accessible tool compared to Rosetta, with faster inference times.

Weaknesses:
- The correlation between gRNAde's perplexity and recovery lacks support, with unclear representation in figures and no reported correlation value.
- The evaluation relies solely on random baselines for variant effect analysis; including comparisons with other reverse folding models could strengthen the findings.
- There is a lack of comprehensive comparisons with competitive baselines, particularly regarding RDesign, as the authors did not retrain RDesign's model architecture on their dataset.
- The claim of being the first to address the RNA inverse folding problem is contested due to the publication of RDesign prior to NeurIPS 2024.
- Some reviewers noted that equivariant neural networks outperform invariant networks in certain scenarios, which requires further clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the correlation analysis by clearly labeling figures and reporting correlation values. Additionally, including comparisons with other reverse folding models or metrics from Rosetta would enhance the evaluation. We suggest conducting a study on the impact of training data quantity on gRNAde's performance and exploring potential bottlenecks in multi-conformational models. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to retrain RDesign's model architecture on their dataset to provide a more robust comparison. We also recommend improving the clarity regarding the performance discrepancies between equivariant and invariant neural networks, particularly in the single-state scenario. Finally, addressing the implications of their work in the context of existing literature would strengthen their claims of novelty.
