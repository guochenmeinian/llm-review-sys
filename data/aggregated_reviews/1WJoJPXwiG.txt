Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the FinEntity dataset, which focuses on financial entity labeling and sentiment annotation, facilitating entity-level sentiment classification in the financial domain. The authors demonstrate that pre-trained language models fine-tuned with this dataset outperform zero-/few-shot ChatGPT models. The practical utility of the dataset is illustrated through a case study on cryptocurrency price prediction, where an LSTM model incorporating entity-level sentiment features shows improved accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The annotated dataset is a valuable resource for the community, particularly in the scarce area of entity-level sentiment analysis.
- The authors provide clear and detailed documentation of the data collection and annotation process, enhancing reproducibility.
- The application of the dataset in predicting cryptocurrency prices demonstrates its practical utility.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset's detailed distribution and size are unclear, with ambiguity regarding the entity categories and the distinction between sequence-level and entity-level models.
- The dataset construction method lacks innovation, and the paper resembles an experimental report rather than a research paper.
- Ethical concerns arise from the use of undergraduate students for labeling without a dedicated ethics statement.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the dataset's distribution by presenting detailed distributions in tabular form. Additionally, the authors should address the ethical concerns by providing a dedicated "Ethics Statement" and clarifying the implications of using their model for financial predictions. It would also be beneficial to elaborate on the methodology of the entity-level approach and ensure that claims regarding the uniqueness of the dataset are substantiated. Lastly, we suggest including references for the use of conditional random fields with BERT and clarifying the metrics used in Table 1.
