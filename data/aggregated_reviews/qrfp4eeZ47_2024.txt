Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents FactorizePhys, which employs Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to decompose voxel embeddings and integrates the Factorized Self-Attention Module (FSAM) into both 3D-CNN and 2D-CNN architectures for estimating blood volume pulse signals from video frames. The effectiveness of FSAM and FactorizePhys is demonstrated through evaluations against state-of-the-art remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) methods across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Introduction of FSAM for computing multi-dimensional attention from voxel embeddings.
2. Comprehensive evaluation of FSAM and FactorizePhys against state-of-the-art rPPG methods.
3. Versatile integration of FSAM into existing 2D-CNN and 3D-CNN architectures.
4. Clear presentation and structure of the paper, with a good degree of novelty in the proposed architecture.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation for using NMF is unclear; further insights into its relevance to attention mechanisms and visualization of attention maps are needed.
2. The choice of NMF over other matrix factorization methods like SVD and QR is not justified.
3. The factorization optimization process is inadequately described; reliance on a one-step gradient descent may not suffice for satisfactory results.
4. Experimental results lack uncertainty estimates, which are essential for drawing meaningful conclusions.
5. The methodology section is not clearly illustrated, with confusing equations and insufficient explanation of symbols.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for using NMF in relation to the rPPG task and provide visualizations of attention maps to demonstrate effectiveness. Justifying the choice of NMF over other methods like SVD and QR is necessary. The authors should also clarify the optimization process for factorization, possibly incorporating more gradient descent steps. Including uncertainty estimates in the experimental results is crucial for robust conclusions. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the methodology section by clearly explaining the symbols used in equations and ensuring that all equations are well-defined.
