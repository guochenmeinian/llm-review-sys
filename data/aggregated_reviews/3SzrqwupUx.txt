Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical framework for understanding the expressivity of state-space models (SSMs) through input-controlled differential equations (CDEs) and Rough Path Theory. The authors derive distinct inductive biases for various SSMs, particularly highlighting the advantages of data-dependent models like Mamba over traditional data-independent models such as S4. The work establishes that SSMs with dense transition matrices can approximate any continuous function, while those with diagonal matrices lack this capability unless multiple layers are stacked.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work provides fundamental theoretical justifications for the expressivity of different SSMs.
- It rigorously distinguishes between data-dependent and data-independent modeling, showcasing the superiority of the former.
- The insights gained from the theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments, enhancing their credibility.
- The paper is well-written, making complex theories more accessible.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical analysis lacks characterization of convergence rates, which is crucial for understanding practical implications, especially in high-dimensional settings.
- The experimental section is limited, primarily focusing on low-dimensional synthetic datasets, raising questions about the applicability to real-world data.
- Practical implications of the theoretical results remain unclear, particularly regarding the utility of chaining diagonal CDEs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical section by discussing the approximation rates of SSMs, particularly focusing on the parameter efficiency of data-dependent modeling. Additionally, we suggest expanding the experimental section to include more diverse tasks and a comprehensive comparison of dense versus diagonal CDEs with mixing, including error bars for performance metrics. Clarifying the practical implications of chaining diagonal matrices and providing preliminaries on rough path theory would also enhance the paper's accessibility and relevance. Finally, addressing the questions raised about the gating mechanism and the definition of NCDE would strengthen the overall clarity of the work.
