Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an active learning framework for estimating the geographical range of species using limited observation data. The authors propose leveraging a set of pretrained range estimation models from various species to create a weak classifier for new species, guiding data collection efforts to minimize the number of required presence/absence queries. The method utilizes a joint feature representation and a linear combination of existing classifiers, demonstrating improved performance on benchmark datasets through extensive evaluation, including ablation studies. Additionally, the authors introduce a method that utilizes an untrained neural network to generate "nn rand feats" based on location input, clarifying the computational cost and benefits of their approach, particularly the compact representation derived from equation 3. They explain that the feature extractor remains frozen in experiments, except for the AN_FULL_E2E baseline, due to the limited labeled data available during early active learning stages and the need for efficient model updates. The authors provide evidence of their method's performance relative to strong baselines, particularly in the IUCN dataset, and acknowledge the importance of addressing additional questions raised by reviewers.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant problem in species distribution modeling, particularly relevant in the context of environmental changes.
- It introduces technical novelty by utilizing existing species models to estimate ranges for new species, enhancing the accuracy of predictions.
- The evaluation is thorough, showcasing the impact of design choices on performance, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- The authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the computational implications of their approach.
- The performance of their method is validated against strong baselines, showing promising results.
- The engagement with reviewer feedback indicates a willingness to improve the paper.

Weaknesses:
- The approach is a straightforward application of active learning, with limited novelty beyond the introduction of candidate models.
- The method's effectiveness is highly dependent on the diversity of the hypothesis set, raising concerns about its applicability to species that are not well-represented by existing models.
- Comparisons are primarily made against simple baselines, with limited exploration of alternative methods or more robust baselines.
- The explanation of the feature extractor's role and the rationale for its freezing could be more detailed.
- Some aspects of the methodology may require further clarification to enhance reader comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the unique machine learning challenges specific to species range estimation and clarify how their approach addresses these challenges.
- The authors should consider including a stronger baseline that trains a general classifier on joint presence data from all available species to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
- We suggest visualizing the contributions of individual species in the weighted average to better understand the model's predictions and the relationships among species.
- The annotations in Fig. 4 should be made clearer to enhance readability without requiring zooming in.
- We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the freezing of the feature extractor and its implications for model performance.
- Additionally, we suggest that the authors expand the discussion on computational costs and the merits of their approach in the final paper. Addressing these points will enhance the overall understanding and impact of the work.
