Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents FUGAL, an algorithm for graph alignment that utilizes additional node features to optimize a relaxed problem. The authors propose a combination of a Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) and a Linear Assignment Problem (LAP), directly operating on adjacency matrices while incorporating structural features to enhance node similarity. The method aims to find a permutation matrix that aligns two graphs, distinguishing itself from prior approaches that rely on intermediary representations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and presents a clear methodology, particularly in Section 3.  
- The combination of QAP and LAP offers an elegant solution and demonstrates promising performance in experiments.  

Weaknesses:  
- There is a significant lack of references to related work, particularly in the context of existing algorithms addressing graph matching.  
- The experimental section is weak, lacking comparisons with relevant literature and not demonstrating the impact of each addition to the baseline formulation.  
- The paper does not provide theoretical guarantees or a clear discussion of the method's limitations, nor does it include a sensitivity analysis or ablation studies.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review to include relevant references, particularly those that have similar formulations or approaches to graph matching. Additionally, the authors should conduct experiments comparing their method against established algorithms, such as those referenced in the reviews, to strengthen the experimental section. It would also be beneficial to include an analysis of the contributions of each term in the optimization, as well as a discussion on the theoretical guarantees of the method. Finally, we suggest that the authors clarify the limitations of their approach and consider conducting a sensitivity analysis on the structural features used in their method.
