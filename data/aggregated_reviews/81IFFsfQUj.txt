Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DMPlug, a novel plug-and-play method for solving inverse problems using diffusion models, optimizing latent seeds from a pre-trained diffusion model to address maximum a posteriori (MAP) problems. DMPlug demonstrates superior performance against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across various inverse problems while exhibiting robustness to unknown perturbations. The authors argue that their approach, which utilizes only three backward steps in the diffusion process, is effective despite the common understanding that more steps are typically necessary for meaningful image generation. Additionally, the paper discusses a method for box inpainting and its performance relative to various deep learning backbones, acknowledging limitations in posterior sampling and uncertainty quantification. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the blurriness observed in reconstructions, attributing it to the spectral bias of their learning process and the PSNR metric used for evaluation. They include additional results and comparisons with strong baseline methods, demonstrating competitive performance metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper provides a comprehensive review of existing technologies, aiding readers unfamiliar with the field.
2. The proposed method is described clearly and in detail, enhancing understanding.
3. Experimental results on CelebA and FFHQ datasets show promising qualitative outcomes, outperforming baseline methods.
4. The exploration of the method's robustness under various noise conditions is thorough and informative.
5. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the blurriness issue, linking it to the spectral bias and PSNR metric.
6. The inclusion of additional baseline methods strengthens the comparative analysis of their approach.
7. The method shows competitive performance metrics, achieving high PSNR and maintaining pixel-level fidelity.

Weaknesses:
1. The method closely resembles existing works in optimizing noisy latent variables, lacking a theoretical basis or intuitive insight into why three backward steps yield good results.
2. The experimental metrics are based on a limited dataset of 100 images, which is insufficient compared to the 1000-image tests commonly used in existing literature. Additionally, the choice of CelebA and FFHQ datasets, which have similar patterns, raises concerns about the diversity of the experimental evaluation.
3. The paper lacks comparisons with several relevant baseline methods, which diminishes the convincing nature of the experimental results.
4. The method's limitations in posterior sampling and uncertainty quantification are acknowledged but not addressed within the current manuscript scope.
5. The performance difference between using different DM backbones is noted, but the authors argue it should not be considered a limitation, which may not satisfy all reviewers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical justification for the effectiveness of using three backward steps in the diffusion process and provide intuitive insights into this choice. Additionally, the authors should expand their experimental evaluation by including a larger dataset and more diverse datasets to strengthen their claims. A comparison with more baseline methods, such as DDNM, DiffPIR, and RED-Diff, is essential for validating the performance of DMPlug. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to address the computational cost associated with DMPlug, particularly in terms of time and memory consumption, and to explore the potential for optimizing in intermediate latent spaces to enhance performance. We also recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the limitations of posterior sampling and uncertainty quantification, potentially outlining future work to address these issues. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explore alternative visual metrics for evaluation beyond PSNR to better align with human perception. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the implications of the performance differences observed with various DM backbones in their results.
