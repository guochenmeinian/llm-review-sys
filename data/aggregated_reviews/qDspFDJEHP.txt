### Key Points
This paper presents a research agenda on the utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) in mathematical education, focusing on their capabilities in solving math problems and providing feedback on student answers. The authors propose two sub-problems: the ability of LLMs to solve mathematical problems and their effectiveness in checking the correctness of answers. The study employs GPT-3.5 and the MathQA dataset to evaluate LLM performance, categorize errors, and analyze the potential for LLMs to assist in educational contexts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a thoughtful analysis of LLMs, breaking down the investigation into three distinct research questions, which aids in understanding their capabilities and limitations.
- It provides a literature review that supports the utility of LLMs as assessment tools and explores their error-correction abilities, which could inform the development of cognitive tutors.

Weaknesses:
- The findings regarding LLM performance are not novel, as it is already known that LLMs struggle with solving math problems. The categorization of errors lacks clarity on how categories were developed and their implications.
- The reliance on a single annotator for error categorization raises concerns about subjectivity and accuracy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the "how" aspect of utilizing LLMs for math problem-solving, providing clearer methodologies and implications for practice. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the robustness of error categorization by involving multiple annotators to mitigate subjectivity. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore deeper cognitive models related to reasoning tasks to strengthen the analysis of LLMs as tools for correcting student errors.
