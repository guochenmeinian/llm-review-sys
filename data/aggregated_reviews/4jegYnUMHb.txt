Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for universal anomaly segmentation (AS) by framing it as change segmentation. The authors propose the MetaUAS framework, which utilizes a synthetic training set generated through change detection techniques, allowing for effective training without requiring anomaly data. The method demonstrates generalizability across multiple industrial datasets, including MVTec, VisA, and Goods, using a single normal image as a prompt.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The formulation of anomaly segmentation as change segmentation is innovative and has practical implications.
- Extensive experiments across various datasets validate the effectiveness of the MetaUAS framework, particularly benefiting from the soft feature alignment module.
- The method's ability to synthesize large-scale image pairs for training is commendable, and it shows strong performance without needing anomalous data.

Weaknesses:
- The paper suffers from clarity issues, particularly regarding the explanation of method variants (MetaUAS/MetaUAS*/MetaUAS*+) and the prompt pooling process.
- There is a lack of comparison with existing change segmentation methods, which could strengthen the argument for the proposed approach.
- The reliance on a single normal image per class raises concerns about the robustness and efficiency of the method, especially as the number of classes increases.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology section by thoroughly explaining the different method variants (MetaUAS/MetaUAS*/MetaUAS*+) and the prompt pooling process. Additionally, including comparisons with one or two recent change segmentation methods applied to AS would provide valuable context. The authors should also address the implications of using a single normal image as a prompt and explore the potential for utilizing multiple prompts to enhance robustness and efficiency. Finally, a discussion comparing their approach with CLIPSeg would be beneficial.
