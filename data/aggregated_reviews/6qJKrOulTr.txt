Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a mathematically rigorous methodology based on Riemannian geometry for attributing network importance of tokens in transformer models' input space. The authors propose an intuitive algorithm involving a relatively inexpensive eigendecomposition. Experiments across three datasets in both image and NLP domains explore the correlation of features with ground-truth inputs and initial steps toward understanding how these features influence the network's output logits. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper employs a mathematically solid approach to identify regions of the input space that explain transformer model decisions, which is crucial for interpretability.
- The authors effectively present complex technical content in an accessible manner without sacrificing depth or rigor.

Weaknesses:
- A significant weakness is the lack of comparison with related work regarding how the identified important features alter the output logits, with no use of established perturbation test protocols to provide experimental evidence.
- The limited number of experiments raises concerns about the methodology's practical gains, as the results primarily focus on toy datasets like MNIST, which are hard to interpret. The method shows only a minor increase in cosine similarity over the baseline, insufficient to justify its adoption.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental validation by including comparisons with existing methods, such as the perturbation test, to demonstrate how the identified features affect output logits. Additionally, conducting experiments on more complex datasets, such as TinyImageNET or CIFAR, would provide stronger evidence of the methodology's effectiveness. Furthermore, we suggest clarifying the novelty of the proposed tools in relation to existing literature, particularly the work on the Fisher information matrix, and providing quantitative results to substantiate claims made in the paper.
