Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a text-guided keypoint localization method aimed at detecting keypoints that are out-of-input image, specifically focusing on human interactions with objects like hockey sticks. The authors propose the TokenCLIPose method, which utilizes cropped images of the person and language priors to predict keypoints outside the input image. The method is evaluated on newly introduced datasets, including Ice-Hockey and CrowdPose, demonstrating its effectiveness in occluded scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The integration of text to represent spatial relationships of keypoints is a reasonable and innovative approach.
2. The paper is well-written and easy to understand, providing a clear motivation for the proposed method.
3. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms previous 2D human keypoint estimation methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The proposed method is not well-suited for tasks like Ice-Hockey, as abandoning visible objects leads to unacceptable predictions for visible keypoints.
2. The experiments lack depth, particularly in analyzing the performance on small datasets, which may not convincingly support the claims made.
3. The paper does not adequately discuss the adaptation of baseline methods to the new task or the rationale behind using keypoint-specific text embeddings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the visualization of results, particularly in Figure 1(b), to clarify ambiguities. Additionally, the authors should conduct further experiments on more robust datasets, such as OCHuman, to validate the effectiveness of their method under challenging conditions. A more in-depth analysis of the performance improvements, specifically distinguishing between unseen and seen keypoints, is essential. Furthermore, the authors should provide clearer explanations regarding the use of normalizing flow and the exact text prompts utilized in their method. Lastly, a comparison with more recent works like ViTPose++ and BUCTD would strengthen the paper's contributions.
