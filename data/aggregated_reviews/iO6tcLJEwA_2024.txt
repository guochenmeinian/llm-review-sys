Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents eFreeSplat, a method for generalizable novel view synthesis (GNVS) that operates independently of epipolar geometry cues, claiming that reliance on such cues degrades performance. The authors utilize a pre-training and supervised reconstruction/NVS training pipeline, similar to Dust3r, and validate their approach on RealEstate and ACID datasets. The introduction of a cross-view completion model and iterative refinement for Gaussian attributes aims to enhance cross-view consistency. The authors also plan to include a more comprehensive discussion of related works, specifically addressing methods like SRT and GS-LRM that do not rely on epipolar line sampling.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method shows performance comparable to the state-of-the-art method MVSplat.
- The innovative approach of not using epipolar geometry priors is commendable.
- The authors acknowledge and plan to address the validity of suggestions regarding the novelty and contribution of their method.
- The proposed model offers a fresh perspective on GNVS by focusing on data-driven 3D priors without the constraints of epipolar priors.
- The ablation study on input view overlap ratios effectively supports the claims made in the introduction.

Weaknesses:
- The authors overclaim by stating their method is the first epipolar-free work, ignoring prior works such as SRT, LEAP, and PF-LRM, which also do not utilize epipolar geometry. These should be properly discussed.
- The related work section lacks discussion on generalizable NVS using Gaussian splatting, particularly GS-LRM.
- The evaluation does not convincingly verify the authors' claims, particularly regarding the performance gains over the epipolar-aware baseline pixelSplat when overlap is smaller.
- The original manuscript lacked a thorough discussion of related works, particularly those that do not require epipolar line sampling.
- Due to time constraints, the authors were unable to prepare a more overlap-balanced dataset for experiments, which limits the analysis of their method's performance.
- The ablation analysis does not clearly indicate which module contributes most to performance improvement.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of prior works, ensuring that all relevant methods are accurately represented to avoid overclaiming. Additionally, we suggest including more related work on generalizable NVS using Gaussian splatting, particularly GS-LRM, to provide a more comprehensive context. The evaluation should be strengthened to clearly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method, particularly in sparse-view settings. We encourage the authors to clarify the contributions of each module in the ablation study to enhance the understanding of their impact on performance. Lastly, we recommend that the authors prioritize the establishment of a balanced dataset for future experiments to better analyze the advantages of their method in scenarios with significant viewpoint changes.
