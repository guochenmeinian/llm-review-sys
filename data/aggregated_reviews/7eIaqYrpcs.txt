Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Vidu4D, a reconstruction model that accurately reconstructs 4D (sequential 3D) representations from single generated videos, addressing challenges related to non-rigidity and frame distortion. Central to Vidu4D is the Dynamic Gaussian Surfels (DGS) technique, which optimizes time-varying warping functions to transform Gaussian surfels from a static to a dynamically warped state, allowing for precise depiction of motion and deformation. The method also incorporates a geometric regularization technique to preserve the integrity of the surface-aligned Gaussian surfels.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and presents interesting visual results, demonstrating impressive rendering quality and achieving state-of-the-art performance in the field.
2. The proposed DGS approach effectively addresses motion and deformation, enhancing the capture of fine-grained appearance details.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks clarity regarding the specific video foundation model used, raising questions about the source of qualitative improvements.
2. The quantitative evaluation is limited, relying on a small set of generated videos, and does not report performance on a more diverse dataset, which may affect generalizability.
3. The organization of the paper is cluttered, making it difficult to follow, and the main method lacks extensive evaluation details and comparisons with realistic scenes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the video foundation model used and provide results using open-source models like SVD or Open-SORA. Additionally, the authors should expand the quantitative evaluation to include a larger and more diverse dataset of generated videos. We suggest reorganizing the paper to enhance readability by moving some cluttered annotations to the appendix and providing a clearer introduction to the overall framework of Vidu4D. Finally, addressing the computational complexity and runtime performance of Vidu4D would be beneficial for practical applications.
