Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of Flow Matching to discrete variables, focusing on the Fisher-Rao metric over the probability simplex. The authors propose a method for generative modeling of discrete data by sampling from the empirical distribution on a statistical manifold defined by categorical distributions. They define essential geometric tools such as the metric tensor, tangent space, and geodesics, and they map the statistical manifold to a sphere for computational stability. The authors introduce a novel ELBO formulation inspired by concurrent work (MDLM) that applies to both continuous flow models and those relying on discrete jumps. The method is empirically validated across various applications, demonstrating competitive results, particularly in discrete data generation tasks, and achieving performance comparable to existing models like MultiFlow, BFN, and SEDD-uniform.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is well-founded, with inspiring geometric insights and a mathematically rigorous formulation of the ELBO, enhancing the theoretical foundation of the approach.
- The paper is clearly written and easy to follow, with effective figures that enhance understanding.
- The empirical results indicate good performance, particularly in discrete data generation tasks, and the inclusion of comparative BPC results demonstrates the effectiveness of SFM against various existing models.
- The authors engage in constructive discussions, addressing reviewer concerns and clarifying complex concepts.

Weaknesses:
- The grounding for the differences in performance between the Riemannian and flat simplex metrics is unclear.
- The practical motivation for sampling categorical distributions is insufficiently addressed, leading to confusion about the transition from theory to practice.
- Some sections lack clarity, particularly regarding the definitions and implications of the Fisher information metric and the change of measure.
- The presentation of the proposed method lacks convincing motivation, particularly regarding its superiority over other approaches.
- Some reviewers noted confusion in the visualization and mathematical details, particularly in relation to the exponential map and geodesics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the transition between sampling categorical distributions and generating discrete data, possibly by including an empirical study to motivate this choice. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the definitions and implications of the Fisher information metric, particularly in Section 3.3, and provide more context for the Optimal Transport setup in Section 3.4. It would also be beneficial to shorten the derivation of the NLL formula in Section 3.5 and explain its relevance to flow matching objectives. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by providing more background on the significance of the Fisher-Rao metric and its implications for generative modeling earlier in the text. We also suggest revising the caption of Figure 1 to clarify the use of the parametrization map $\pi$ instead of the exponential map for plotting geodesics. Lastly, addressing the motivation for their approach more convincingly and including discussions on alternative perspectives regarding the treatment of text tokens could enhance the paper's impact and broaden its accessibility to a wider audience.
