Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents *Epistemic Neural Networks (ENN)* as a novel framework for uncertainty estimation in deep learning, introducing the *epinet* architecture that enhances conventional neural networks. The authors argue that joint predictions are crucial for effective sequential decision-making and demonstrate that *epinets* achieve comparable marginal performance while significantly improving joint predictive performance over traditional Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) and deep ensembles.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant issue in uncertainty quantification, introducing a new class of models (ENN) that effectively tackles it.
- Solid experimental results, particularly in joint predictions, showcasing the advantages of *epinets* over conventional methods.
- Clear distinction between ENNs and BNNs, enhancing reader understanding of the proposed framework.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation and writing quality are lacking, which limits the excitement for publication.
- The focus of experiments is narrow, primarily on image classification, without exploring other domains or decision-making scenarios.
- The theoretical analysis connecting joint log-loss to decision performance is insufficiently rigorous.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the technical presentation and clarity of the paper, addressing specific concerns such as:
1. Qualifying claims regarding the performance of *epinets* in relation to joint predictions.
2. Providing more intuition and explanations for key concepts, particularly in sections discussing BNNs and ENNs.
3. Expanding the experimental evaluation to include direct uncertainty quantification and decision-making benchmarks, such as active learning or contextual bandits.
4. Discussing the limitations of the proposed framework in the conclusion to provide insights for future research directions.
5. Enhancing the writing quality throughout the paper to ensure clarity and coherence for the reader.
