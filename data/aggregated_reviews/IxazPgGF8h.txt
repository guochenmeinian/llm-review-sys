Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ChatCam, a system that enables camera operation through natural language interactions. It comprises two main components: CineGPT for text-conditioned trajectory generation and an Anchor Determinator for precise camera trajectory placement. The authors propose a comparison between a rule-based algorithm and CineGPT for generating camera trajectories based on user instructions. While the rule-based method can execute simple commands effectively, it lacks the ability to accurately determine anchor points and handle complex prompts autonomously. Experimental results demonstrate ChatCam's effectiveness in simplifying camera movements and lowering technical barriers for creators, while also highlighting the efficiency of the CineGPT pipeline in managing complex user inputs without human intervention.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. ChatCam is a novel system for generating camera trajectories via natural language.
2. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
3. The proposed CineGPT and Anchor Determinator are technically sound.
4. The paper effectively highlights the efficiency of the CineGPT pipeline and its ability to handle complex user inputs without human intervention.
5. The authors acknowledge the need for accurate anchor points and the limitations of the rule-based approach in determining these points.

Weaknesses:
1. The system's validation is limited to a few static 3D scenes, and the generated trajectories are relatively short.
2. Some components lack thorough verification, such as the impact of the text prompt “smooth panning speed” on trajectory generation.
3. The experimental details, including the training dataset and the time cost of Anchor Determination during inference, are unclear.
4. The paper does not adequately address the limitations of the approach or provide sufficient comparisons to baselines.
5. The rule-based method's reliance on a finite set of predefined rules limits its adaptability to complex scenarios.
6. There are concerns about the stochastic components in the proposed method, which may affect the reliability of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the training dataset description in Section 4, including details on dataset construction and the types of camera movements included. Additionally, the authors should clarify the time cost of Anchor Determination during inference. To enhance the evaluation, we suggest including diverse trajectory outputs for the same text prompt and demonstrating the method's performance on dynamic scenes. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the issues related to defining the scale of trajectories and collision handling in the revised paper. Including experimental results comparing the performance of CineGPT with the rule-based method using the same anchor points would also be beneficial. It would be advantageous to address the concerns regarding the reliability of the results by providing specific examples of stochastic elements in their method. Lastly, consider creating a dictionary of camera movements with parameters for control to enhance the rule-based approach's functionality.
