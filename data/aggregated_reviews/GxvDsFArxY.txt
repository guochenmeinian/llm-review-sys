Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents PhyloGen, a novel method for phylogenetic tree inference that utilizes a pre-trained genomic language model to generate phylogenetic trees without relying on evolutionary models or aligned sequences. PhyloGen approaches phylogenetic inference as a conditionally constrained tree structure generation problem, optimizing both tree topology and branch lengths through three modules: Feature Extraction, PhyloTree Construction, and PhyloTree Structure Modeling. The method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets. While the idea proposed is interesting, the authors acknowledge that the paper's presentation requires improvement, and parts of the methodology and evaluation metrics need clarification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The framework is innovative, leveraging a pre-trained genomic language model instead of aligned sequences.
- The method achieves superior performance on real-world datasets, indicating its effectiveness.
- The idea proposed in the paper is considered interesting by the reviewers.

Weaknesses:
- The clarity of ablation experiments is insufficient, particularly regarding the performance differences between the proposed method and baseline methods when certain components are removed.
- The claim that unaligned sequences better reflect actual sequence variation than aligned sequences lacks sufficient experimental support.
- Numerous writing issues detract from the overall presentation, including unclear notation and typographical errors.
- The overall presentation of the paper is lacking, and there are unclear aspects in both the methodology and the evaluation metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the ablation experiments by ensuring consistency in evaluation settings across Table 1, Table 2, Table 5, and Figure 6, and by including average metrics across all datasets. Additionally, provide more detailed explanations of the ablation results to clarify the performance advantages of the proposed method. 

We also suggest that the authors substantiate their claim regarding unaligned sequences with direct experimental evidence. 

To enhance the manuscript's readability, we advise addressing the identified writing issues, such as correcting typographical errors and ensuring that all variables and functions are clearly defined before use. Furthermore, we recommend improving the overall presentation of the paper and providing clearer explanations of the methodology and evaluation metrics.
