Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an adversarial attack model, Auto-attack on Text-to-image Models (ATM), designed to generate attack prompts that cause text-to-image models, specifically Stable Diffusion, to produce undesired outputs. The methodology employs a Gumbel Softmax distribution for differentiability and applies a binary mask to maintain object nouns while ensuring fluency and similarity. The authors identify four distinct attack patterns and demonstrate the method's effectiveness in both white-box and transferable black-box attacks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written, organized, and presents a novel method for generating effective attack prompts, aiding in vulnerability investigations.
2. The authors successfully uncover four distinct attack patterns, highlighting the method's significance in studying generative model vulnerabilities.
3. The proposed method shows a high success rate in white-box attacks and excellent transferability to other generative models like DALL-E 2 and Midjourney.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation behind ATM is not clearly correlated with the identified vulnerabilities of the stable diffusion model.
2. The distinction between replacing and extending words in prompt modifications is unclear, leading to potential confusion.
3. The authors mention designing defensive strategies but do not provide examples or details on their implementation.
4. Some sections lack clarity, such as the definition of generation speed and the specific impacts addressed by embedding prompts separately.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the purpose and motivation of ATM, ensuring a clearer connection to the identified vulnerabilities. Additionally, clarifying the criteria for choosing between word replacement and extension in prompt modifications would enhance understanding. The authors should provide examples of how their method can be utilized to design defensive strategies. Furthermore, addressing the definition of generation speed and the impacts of embedding prompts separately would strengthen the paper's clarity. Lastly, including details on the classification accuracy of CLIP for clean text prompts and the specifics of the quantitative experiment settings would be beneficial.
