### Key Points
This paper presents a backtracking approach for smooth convex optimization that operates on a per-coordinate basis, providing a theoretical analysis that demonstrates its advantages over classical backtracking line-search methods. The authors propose a cutting plane method to determine optimal per-coordinate step sizes, referred to as preconditioners, and validate their approach through experiments on ill-conditioned logistic regression problems, showing improvements over vanilla gradient descent.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and organized, with significant contributions that serve as a foundation for various machine learning problems.
- The proposed method fills a gap in the optimization literature by extending backtracking to multi-dimensional settings, demonstrating technical soundness and practical effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The manuscript contains some typos and lacks clarity in certain sections, making it somewhat difficult to follow.
- The focus on smooth and strongly convex problems may limit the applicability of the method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the manuscript to enhance reader comprehension, particularly in sections that may be challenging to follow. Additionally, addressing the identified typos and ensuring that the representation of variables is consistent throughout the paper would strengthen the overall presentation. We also suggest that the authors consider discussing the implications of the 'CUT' subroutine's overhead in large-scale problems to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the algorithm's efficiency.
