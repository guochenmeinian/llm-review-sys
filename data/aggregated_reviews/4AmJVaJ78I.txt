Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Extrapolated Cyclic Primal-Dual Algorithm (ECyclicPDA), a novel method for solving extensive-form games (EFG) using a block-coordinate approach. The authors derive a convergence rate of O(1/T) and demonstrate that their method can outperform existing first-order methods, particularly in specific scenarios. The algorithm utilizes dilated regularizers for efficient proximal updates and introduces a restarting heuristic that enhances performance. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper provides a new understanding of local update rules and combines local updates with extrapolated methods, which is original and interesting.  
- The theoretical analysis appears sound, and the empirical results convincingly show progress toward closing the gap with CFR-based approaches.  
- The writing is clear and accessible, making the problem approachable for non-experts.  

Weaknesses:  
- The computational cost per iteration may be high due to the need for proximal steps over the entire function, which could affect practical applicability.  
- The experimental comparisons with non-coordinate algorithms may be unfair, as they do not account for all computational costs.  
- The restarting heuristic lacks a clear explanation and theoretical support, making its benefits unclear for various algorithms.  
- The paper does not adequately compare with related optimistic OMD algorithms or provide a thorough analysis of execution times and computational demands.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the restarting heuristic by providing a detailed explanation of its implementation and tuning parameters. Additionally, we suggest including a comparison of computational costs in terms of wall clock time rather than just gradient computations. It would also be beneficial to explicitly compare ECyclicPDA with optimistic OMD algorithms to better contextualize its performance. Finally, the authors should consider providing a more direct and compact presentation of their contributions to facilitate critical assessment.
