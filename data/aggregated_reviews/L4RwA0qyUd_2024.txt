Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel causal inference method that addresses unobserved confounding by utilizing pre-treatment text data to infer proxies. The authors adapt proximal causal inference techniques to text data settings, employing multiple instances of pre-treatment text and two zero-shot models to estimate proxies, which are then used in the proximal g-formula for average causal effect estimation. The method is evaluated through simulations on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets, and a falsification heuristic for untestable assumptions is introduced.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper proposes an innovative method for proximal causal inference using text data.
- It is well-written, clearly articulating the method's requirements and assumptions.
- The empirical evaluation is conducted in a principled manner, with propositions guiding the design and a falsification heuristic aligned with performance.

Weaknesses:
- The literature review is incomplete, lacking acknowledgment of foundational work by Zvi Griliches (1977) and relevant texts like "Applied Causal Inference Powered by ML and AI" (Chernozhukov et al., 2024).
- The empirical evaluation's significance is limited due to reliance on synthetic data, making real-world applicability difficult to assess.
- The organization of material is convoluted, particularly regarding the various constraints and assumptions, which could hinder readability and comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review to include all relevant sources, particularly foundational works on proximal inference. Additionally, providing more convincing examples of how to construct proxies from electronic health records (EHR) would enhance the credibility of the assumptions made. To clarify the organization, we suggest summarizing the key conditions and assumptions in a table or paragraph in the appendix, and including examples of text proxies in the main paper to bridge the gap between theoretical requirements and empirical applications. Finally, addressing the potential impact of using larger language models for proxy inference would strengthen the discussion on model sensitivity.
