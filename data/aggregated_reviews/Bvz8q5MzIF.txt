### Key Points
This paper presents a framework called Fact Embedding through Diffusion Model (FDM), which transforms the entity prediction task into a conditional fact generation task by learning the distribution of plausible facts directly from knowledge graphs. The method employs a Conditional Fact Denoiser to generate target fact embeddings from noised data. Experimental results indicate that FDM achieves state-of-the-art performance on the FB15k-237 dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to existing models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a novel perspective by learning plausible fact distributions instead of relying on score functions, indicating a creative application of diffusion models in knowledge graph embedding (KGE).
- Extensive comparisons with a broad range of baselines, particularly the significant improvement on the FB15k-237 dataset, support the proposed framework's superiority.
- The manuscript is well-organized and easy to follow, with informative ablation studies that clarify design choices.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion on the computational complexity and scalability of FDM, especially for large-scale knowledge graphs, and the datasets used in experiments are relatively small.
- The hidden size of the Conditional Fact Denoiser is excessively large, raising concerns about efficiency, and the dimension of embedding vectors is not addressed.
- The reasons for the significant performance gain on FB15k-237 remain unclear, and the advantages of the diffusion perspective require deeper analysis. The effect of explicit conditional constraints is not fully explored in the experiments.
- The motivation for the approach could be elaborated, particularly regarding the inadequacy of explicit scoring functions for modeling knowledge graph patterns.
- The ablation study appears simplistic, and additional tailored experiments would strengthen the paper's contribution.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the computational complexity and scalability of FDM, particularly in relation to larger knowledge graphs such as YAGO3-10. Additionally, the authors should clarify the dimension of embedding vectors and address the efficiency issues related to the hidden size of the Conditional Fact Denoiser. A more comprehensive analysis of the performance gains on FB15k-237 and a deeper exploration of the diffusion perspective's advantages are necessary. We also suggest including training and inference times, as well as model parameter sizes, in comparison with baseline methods. Finally, conducting more extensive ablation studies and experiments specifically tailored to the diffusion model design would enhance the paper's contributions.
