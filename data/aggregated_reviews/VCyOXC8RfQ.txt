### Key Points
This paper presents P-AT, an extension of the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) tailored for Instruction-Following Language Models (IFLMs) like Alpaca and Flan-T5. It aims to detect biases related to gender, race, and age, while introducing an "Entropy" metric to evaluate language modeling quality. The authors apply their bias assessment across various state-of-the-art models, revealing biases and discussing the relationship between model size and prompt templates.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a valuable tool for assessing bias in models that understand prompts, with clear presentation and well-defined experiments.
- The introduction of the Entropy metric is a commendable addition, aiding in distinguishing between low bias scores due to contextual limitations and those arising from genuine bias.

Weaknesses:
- A key weakness is the lack of direct measurement of statistical significance in observed bias, which is addressed in prior works like SEAT/WEAT.
- The choice of WEAT as the basis for P-AT is questioned, as more recent and comprehensive bias detection datasets may be more suitable.
- The paper lacks concrete definitions for "bias" and "harm," and does not adequately link the bias scores to relevant social issues.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of bias definitions and the implications of bias scores, particularly how a p-AT score of 1.0 relates to social issues. Additionally, we suggest providing a rationale for the choice of WEAT over more contemporary datasets and addressing the lack of significance testing by exploring methods to incorporate statistical significance into the analysis. Finally, we encourage the authors to investigate strategies for developing less brittle prompts to enhance the robustness of their findings.
