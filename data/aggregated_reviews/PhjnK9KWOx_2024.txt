Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper examines the limitations of softmax loss in recommender systems, particularly its weak correlation with ranking metrics like DCG and sensitivity to false negatives. The authors propose pairwise softmax loss (PSL), which replaces the exponential function in softmax loss with activation functions such as ReLU, Tanh, and Atan to enhance alignment with ranking metrics and improve robustness. PSL optimizes the score gap between positive and negative item pairs, aiming for a tighter correlation with ranking metrics and better noise resistance. Empirical evaluations across various datasets indicate that PSL generally outperforms softmax loss and other baseline loss functions in recommendation accuracy and robustness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
* The paper is well-organized, with clear explanations and thorough theoretical and empirical results.
* Strong theoretical analysis and comprehensive evaluations across multiple datasets and testing conditions are provided.
* The proposed PSL method addresses key limitations of softmax loss, potentially leading to more accurate and robust recommender systems.

Weaknesses:
* The proposed activation functions may interact differently with various recommendation models, limiting the generalizability of the method.
* Specific activation functions may introduce biases, favoring certain data distributions or interaction patterns.
* The reliance on temperature scaling for robustness could lead to parameter sensitivity, necessitating careful tuning that may not be practical in real-world scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by testing the activation functions on a broader range of recommendation models. Additionally, conducting ablation studies to understand the interaction between the activation functions and various model components could provide deeper insights. 

We also suggest providing a rationale for the selection of activation functions based on empirical evidence to strengthen the validity of their choices. Furthermore, the authors should analyze the sensitivity of PSL to the temperature parameter and offer guidelines or automated methods for effective tuning.

Lastly, we encourage the authors to extend their experiments to include results on more cutoffs beyond NDCG@20 and to address how PSL affects other important metrics, such as AUC, in pointwise click scenarios.
