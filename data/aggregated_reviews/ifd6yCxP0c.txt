### Key Points
This paper presents a benchmarking study on Multi-Sensor Fusion (MSF) aimed at enhancing the robustness of perceptual models against physical sensor attacks. The authors create a dataset encompassing 11 different types of attacks and evaluate it using 7 MSF-based models and 5 single-modality models. The study introduces advanced IoU-based metrics for performance evaluation and analyzes the impact of fusion methods on model robustness, revealing that not all fusion methods enhance robustness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work will release a large dataset consisting of 11 different physical sensor attacks.
- It comprehensively evaluates 7 latest MSF models and 5 single-modality models.
- Advanced IoU-based metrics are introduced for objective evaluation of model robustness.
- Detailed experimental results provide insights into the advantages and disadvantages of various fusion methods.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset link is not provided, leaving uncertainty about its release conditions.
- The novelty of the work is limited, as it does not introduce significant changes to existing models.
- The attack methods are relatively simple, and more complex scenarios should be considered.
- The paper primarily analyzes LiDAR and camera sensors, neglecting other modalities like radar and ultrasonic sensors.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the conditions under which the dataset will be released, as this is a key contribution. Additionally, the authors should justify the exclusion of certain attack types in Section 2.2 by linking them to their threat model in Section 2.1. To enhance the robustness evaluation, we suggest considering more complex attack scenarios and including a broader range of sensor modalities. Furthermore, the authors should address practical deployment challenges, such as the potential increase in computational complexity and storage requirements associated with their proposed fusion methods. Lastly, we recommend improving the clarity of the research questions and providing a systematic approach to the relevance of the KITTY-Spoof dataset in real-world scenarios.
