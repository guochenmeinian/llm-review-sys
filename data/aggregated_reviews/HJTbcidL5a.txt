### Key Points
This paper presents two techniques to enhance the efficiency of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) without compromising accuracy. The first technique, TokenDrop, involves randomly dropping a subset of stop words from sequences to reduce the number of tokens processed and mitigate overfitting. The second technique, BucketSampler, organizes batches based on sequence lengths and includes improvements such as modulating the learning rate based on batch size, capping maximum batch sizes, and merging residual buckets. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that these methods can achieve significant speedups in fine-tuning and inference, with results indicating an average speedup of up to 10x on datasets like GLUE and SQuAD.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively addresses an important challenge in LLM fine-tuning, proposing techniques that can significantly enhance efficiency.
- The framework is well-documented, with clear motivation and detailed descriptions of its components.
- The authors provide a thorough ablation study, demonstrating the contributions of each technique.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental scope is limited, focusing primarily on base models and not exploring larger architectures or seq2seq models.
- There is insufficient analysis of results, particularly regarding the relationship between sequence length distribution and speedup gains.
- The baseline comparisons, particularly with random samplers, are considered weak, and the paper lacks references to earlier works on bucketing techniques.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental setup by including tests with larger models, such as RoBERTa large, and seq2seq architectures to assess the generalizability of their methods. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed analysis of the results, particularly exploring the correlation between sequence length distribution and speedup gains. Clarifying the scope of the framework regarding its applicability to various tasks and languages would also enhance usability. Finally, we encourage the authors to strengthen baseline comparisons by including a simple sequence length bucketing baseline and to address the lack of references to earlier works on bucketing techniques.
