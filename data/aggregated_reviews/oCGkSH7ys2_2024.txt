Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of an adversarial language game named Adversarial Taboo, where an attacker and a defender engage in strategic communication around a target word known only to the attacker. The authors propose that applying reinforcement learning to the game outcomes enhances the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The study utilizes LLaMA-2-7B and Baichuan-2-13B models, demonstrating improved performance across various reasoning benchmarks through self-play training.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents an intriguing adversarial language game.
- The authors demonstrate that training on game data enhances general reasoning abilities.
- Extensive experiments are conducted on two large language models across multiple datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The procedure relies on standard training within the game data, lacking analysis on why this training enhances general reasoning ability.
- No ablation study was performed on training techniques, such as filtering negative advantages.
- The enhancements compared to the IM+AlpacaSFT baseline are not pronounced, and there is a decline under mutual conditions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion and analysis of why training within the game increases general reasoning ability. Additionally, conducting an ablation study on training techniques, including negative advantages filtering, would strengthen the findings. To bolster the argument for the proposed method, we suggest comparing results with those of Alpaca SFT on general tasks. Furthermore, clarifying the self-play methodology in non-adversarial contexts and enhancing the readability of Figure 1 with more explanatory information in the caption would benefit the presentation.
