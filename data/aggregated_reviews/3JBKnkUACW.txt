### Key Points
This paper presents a continual learning method aimed at addressing catastrophic forgetting and enhancing knowledge transfer through a task incremental learning approach (TSS). The authors propose a subnetwork discovery with soft-masking to facilitate learning across a mixed sequence of tasks. Extensive experiments are conducted across various NLP tasks to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and easy to understand.
- The introduction of a parameter importance-based gradient soft-mask enhances knowledge transfer capabilities.
- Extensive empirical studies demonstrate the method's effectiveness, outperforming CL baselines.

Weaknesses:
- The significance of continual learning for mixed sequences is unclear, lacking formal definitions and practical applicability.
- The core ideas of subnetwork discovery and importance score computation are not innovative and could apply to conventional task-incremental learning.
- The experimental setup raises concerns due to the use of small training datasets, which may not reflect real-world scenarios.
- Missing comparisons with replay-based methods and insufficient exploration of resource disparities among tasks.
- The methodology is difficult to follow, and key metrics related to knowledge transfer are not adequately reported.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definitions surrounding "continual learning of a mixed sequence" and the distinctions between "similar" and "dissimilar tasks." Additionally, consider revising the experimental setup to utilize larger training datasets that better reflect practical applications and include a replay-based method as a baseline for comprehensive evaluation. We also suggest enhancing the explanation of the methodology to improve its accessibility and ensuring that key metrics related to knowledge transfer, such as forward/backward transfer, are included in the experiments. Lastly, addressing the concerns regarding resource disparities among tasks would strengthen the study's applicability.
