### Key Points
This paper presents an automatic method for evaluating LLM's attributions, linking generated text to evidence texts through a three-way classification task with labels: attributable, extrapolatory, and contradictory. The authors evaluate various models, including fine-tuning LLMs on QA, fact-checking, NLI, and summarization datasets, as well as zero-shot or few-shot approaches. The evaluation is conducted on two test sets: one simulated from QA datasets and another from New Bing-generated documents. The experiments reveal varying performances across models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper demonstrates alignment between automatic attribution evaluation and human evaluation.
- Models trained on repurposed datasets show improvements in the AttrEval-GenSearch dataset.
- The exploration of both prompting and fine-tuning strategies is appreciated.

Weaknesses:
- Evaluation on 'AttrEval-Simulation' may be biased and lacks diversity, potentially misrepresenting real-world challenges.
- The reliance on GPT-4 for both generation and evaluation raises concerns about bias and limited test data.
- The novelty of the problem formulation is somewhat limited, as it closely resembles existing NLI categories.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper's aim, specifying whether it focuses on dataset collection or evaluation methods. Additionally, we suggest expanding the size of the evaluation set to strengthen the findings. The authors should also address the potential biases in simulated data and clarify the technical similarities between training and evaluation datasets. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to consider including a label for partially supported claims and to provide more details on the data repurposing process in the Approach section.
