### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to the unbiased learning to rank problem by introducing Whole Page Unbiased Learning to Rank (WP-ULTR), which addresses biases from various SERP features beyond position-related biases. The authors propose a new method, Bias Agnostic whole page Unbiased Learning to Rank (BAL), which utilizes causal discovery to automatically model user behavior and mitigate biases. The effectiveness of BAL is validated through experiments on the Baidu-ULTR dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing models that focus solely on position-related biases.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles an important research problem and proposes a unified debiasing strategy for various SERP features, representing an incremental advancement in the field.
- The proposed method is well-explained and easy to understand.
- Experimental results are convincing, utilizing a large real-world dataset rather than synthetic data.

Weaknesses:
- The definition of the WP-ULTR problem lacks clarity and formality, requiring a more concise explanation to emphasize its significance.
- Recent ULTR methods are not included in the baseline comparisons, limiting the evaluation of the proposed method's effectiveness.
- The backbone ranking model relies on a bare BERT LLM without fine-tuning, raising concerns about the realism of the experimental setting.
- The paper's writing is unclear in several areas, with misleading statements and a lack of detail regarding the causal modeling and user behavior analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and formality of the WP-ULTR problem definition to highlight its significance. Additionally, please include more recent ULTR methods in the baseline comparisons to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method. We suggest enhancing the experimental realism by utilizing a fine-tuned relevance ranking model instead of a bare BERT LLM. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the causal modeling and user behavior analysis, particularly regarding the use of "r_hat" instead of true relevance "r" and the implications of this choice. Lastly, we advise improving the overall writing quality to ensure coherence and clarity throughout the paper.
