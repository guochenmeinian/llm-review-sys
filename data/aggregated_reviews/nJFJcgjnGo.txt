Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a benchmark for evaluating model robustness against structural distributional shifts in graph datasets. The authors propose three metrics for dataset splitting and conduct experiments to assess various models under these shifts, revealing that existing graph models face significant challenges. The study emphasizes the trade-offs between representation quality and the ability to distinguish nodes from different distributions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses an understudied problem of evaluating model robustness and uncertainty estimation under structural distribution shifts.
2. It introduces novel evaluation metrics for creating data splits based on structural distribution shifts.
3. The empirical findings from evaluating different methods provide valuable insights.

Weaknesses:
1. The assumption that less important nodes are out-of-distribution (OOD) is counterintuitive given the power-law distribution of real-world graphs.
2. The experimental setup's equal splitting of in-distribution (ID) and OOD data raises concerns about generalizability; real-world scenarios typically involve smaller OOD proportions.
3. The focus on structural distribution shifts without considering feature distribution shifts limits the evaluation's comprehensiveness.
4. The authors should provide more detailed justification and analysis for their proposed metrics, including sensitivity to different configurations.
5. The title is misleading as the benchmark primarily targets node prediction tasks, which should be reflected.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for their choice of metrics and explore the sensitivity of evaluation results to different configurations. Additionally, consider investigating varying ratios of ID to OOD data to enhance practical relevance. Clarifying the misleading aspects of the title and ensuring it accurately reflects the focus on node-level tasks is essential. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors discuss potential solutions or design principles for addressing structural distribution shifts, as well as provide guidance on selecting appropriate node properties for dataset splitting.
