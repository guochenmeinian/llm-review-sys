Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel strategy for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects called the Fused and Accurate Shrinkage Tree (FAST). The authors propose a shrinkage-based approach that combines trial and observational data to reduce mean squared error (MSE) in treatment effect estimation. They introduce a new split criterion that down-weights observational data with high confounding bias and provide theoretical analysis to support their methodology. Simulations and real data analyses demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is technically sound and well-organized, making it easy to follow.
- The proposed method shows better performance than existing methods, particularly in the context of data fusion.
- The theoretical analysis provides valuable insights into the advantages of the modified splitting criterion.

Weaknesses:
- The rationale for choosing a tree-based algorithm over other machine learning methods is not convincingly articulated.
- The interpretation of the theoretical results is unclear, particularly regarding how they demonstrate the advantages of data fusion.
- The omission of $\sigma^2_b$ in the shrinkage estimator raises concerns about its practical justification.
- The limitation discussion is inadequate, and the paper lacks a comprehensive literature review, particularly regarding transfer learning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for using tree-based algorithms in data fusion by providing a clearer comparison with other methods. Additionally, the authors should enhance the interpretation of their theoretical results to clarify how they illustrate the benefits of their approach. It is crucial to address the omission of $\sigma^2_b$ in the shrinkage estimator and provide scenarios where this omission is justified. We also encourage the authors to expand the limitation discussion and include a more comprehensive literature review, particularly in relation to transfer learning. Finally, conducting experiments on multiple data-generating mechanisms would strengthen the evaluation of the proposed method's performance.
