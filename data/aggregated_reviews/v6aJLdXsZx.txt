### Key Points
This paper presents a novel task called automatic table verification (AutoTV) and introduces the arXiVeri benchmark. The authors propose several metrics, including table matching accuracy, cell matching recall, cell matching precision, and F1, to evaluate the performance of table verification. However, there are numerous assumptions in the method, and the limitations are only mentioned at the end, which may lead to over-claiming of results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The proposed work defines a new and important task in the domain of table verification and introduces relevant evaluation metrics.

Weaknesses:  
The method is based on many assumptions, and the abstract and conclusions do not adequately highlight where the method may fail. The limitations are not sufficiently integrated into the main text, leading to potential over-claiming of results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the abstract and conclusions by clearly stating where their method may fail. Additionally, we suggest evaluating the proposed method on other papers from Bioarxiv or Medarxiv to strengthen the findings.
