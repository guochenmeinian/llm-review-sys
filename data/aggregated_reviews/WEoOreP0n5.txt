### Key Points
This paper presents a heuristic approach to learn masks that activate only specific parts of neural networks to save energy in reinforcement learning (RL) problems. The authors propose an algorithm that applies this masking method to Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and provide experimental results demonstrating its effectiveness. They also explore energy-efficient architectures in single and multi-task RL scenarios, achieving significant parameter reduction while maintaining performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses the critical issue of energy consumption in RL tasks, which is highly relevant given the trend towards large models.  
- It is well-written, clear, and presents the algorithm and experimental results effectively.  
- The experiments are thoroughly analyzed, justifying design choices and demonstrating the method's generality and potential impact on the machine learning community.  

Weaknesses:  
- The algorithm is specifically designed for SAC, raising questions about its generalizability to other RL policies like DDPG and PPO, which is not discussed in the paper.  
- There is a lack of visualization regarding the activation of different neural pathways, which could enhance understanding of task similarity and pathway similarity.  
- The title may mislead readers regarding the focus on energy consumption, as the connection feels underdeveloped.  
- Some experimental details are omitted from the main text, although they are available in the appendix.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the generalizability of the proposed method to other RL policies beyond SAC. Additionally, visualizing the activation of neural pathways would strengthen the argument for the concept of neural pathways. We suggest clarifying the connection between the approach and energy consumption in the title and throughout the paper. Furthermore, including more experimental details in the main text would enhance comprehension. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore the application of their method in diverse domains beyond MuJoCo to assess its general applicability.
