Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper addresses the issue of spurious correlations in data collection environments by proposing a method that applies a mask to input data to distinguish between spurious and semantic features. The masked data is processed through local models tailored for each environment, with each model trained to achieve neural collapse for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. The authors leverage neural collapse to enhance OOD classification performance across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The use of neural collapse for OOD generalization is innovative and relevant.  
- The paper tackles a significant problem in real-world applications, supported by extensive experiments demonstrating improved performance.  
- The writing is clear, facilitating understanding of the spurious correlations issue.

Weaknesses:  
- A comparison with both OOD generalization methods and spurious correlation methods is necessary, as existing methods can automatically detect and separate features.  
- The types of spurious features the method can handle need clarification, particularly regarding superposition of features.  
- The rationale for adding noise to the mask during learning requires further explanation.  
- Deeper analyses in experiments, such as confirming neural collapse and visualizing learned masks, would enhance the paper.  
- There are inconsistencies in terminology and writing that need to be addressed for clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with existing OOD and spurious correlation methods to provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Clarifying the types of spurious features the proposed method can handle, especially in superposition, is essential. The authors should also elucidate the rationale behind adding noise to the mask during learning. Conducting deeper analyses in experiments, including confirming neural collapse and visualizing learned masks, would add valuable insights. Lastly, we suggest addressing the inconsistencies in terminology and writing to enhance clarity and coherence throughout the paper.
