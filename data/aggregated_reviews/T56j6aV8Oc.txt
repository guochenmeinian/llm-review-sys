Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into why Adam outperforms SGD in language tasks, attributing the performance gap to heavy-tailed class imbalances in training datasets. The authors conduct a series of experiments demonstrating that Adam consistently outperforms SGD due to its ability to progress independently of class frequencies, while SGD struggles with low-frequency classes. The findings are validated across various data types and architectures. Theoretical analysis further reveals that convergence in gradient descent is heavily influenced by class frequencies, whereas sign descent remains unaffected. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The identification of heavy-tailed class imbalance as a key factor in the Adam-SGD performance gap is a novel and significant contribution.
- The experiments are robust and well-designed, including thorough ablation studies that substantiate the hypothesis.
- The rigorous theoretical exploration of class frequencies' impact on convergence rates provides valuable insights into the mechanisms favoring Adam.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on a linear model may oversimplify the findings, raising questions about the applicability of insights to more complex, practical scenarios.
- Some figures contain misleading captions, and the organization of sections could be improved for clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of figure captions to accurately reflect the experiments conducted, particularly distinguishing between SGD and full GD results. Additionally, consider relocating section 2.2 into section 3 for better flow. It would also be beneficial to elaborate on the theoretical results and their implications in the context of more complex models. Finally, please ensure that all relevant works, such as those by Zhang et al. and Xie and Li, are cited and discussed in relation to the findings on heavy-tailed class imbalance.
