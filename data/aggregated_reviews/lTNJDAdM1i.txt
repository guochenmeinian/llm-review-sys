### Key Points
This paper presents Ablated Learned Temperature Energy (AbeT), a method for detecting Out-of-Distribution (OOD) inputs in deep neural networks. AbeT reduces the False Positive Rate at a 95% True Positive Rate by 43.43% compared to existing methods, without requiring multiple training stages or hyperparameters. The model effectively learns to differentiate between In-Distribution (ID) and OOD samples through exposure to misclassified ID examples, and it enhances OOD detection in object detection and semantic segmentation tasks, achieving significant performance gains.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The evaluation scenarios are comprehensive, with experiments verifying the effectiveness of the proposed detection scheme across classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, making the approach more convincing.
2. The writing is clear and effectively communicates the ideas.

Weaknesses:
1. There is a lack of discussion on recent works, with the latest referenced study from 2020, which is outdated. The authors should include more recent studies, such as Fang et al. (2022).
2. The method is primarily empirical, modifying an existing post-processing energy score, which limits the novelty of the contribution.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by including more recent studies relevant to OOD detection. Additionally, the authors should consider providing a mathematical proof of the proposed method to enhance its theoretical foundation. Furthermore, we suggest relocating the key results from the appendix to the main paper to ensure that the primary findings are readily accessible and to comply with page limit rules.
