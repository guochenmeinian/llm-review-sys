### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the tensor PCA problem, focusing on low-rank tensor recovery with Gaussian noise. The authors propose various matricization techniques and analyze their performance, establishing sharp thresholds for signal recovery. The work builds on established results in random matrix theory and introduces an iterative algorithm based on successive contractions of the tensor, achieving exact recovery under specific conditions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The presentation is clear and concise, effectively introducing three different approaches to tensor PCA with formal guarantees.
2. The results are based on well-established matrix PCA techniques, making them accessible and instilling confidence in their applicability.
3. The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of tensor PCA algorithms in a high-dimensional asymptotic framework, identifying sharp thresholds for performance.

Weaknesses:
1. The theoretical contributions are minimal, as the paper primarily adapts existing matrix PCA techniques to the tensor setting without offering significant new insights or innovative methods.
2. There is a lack of comparison among the proposed approaches, which may leave readers uncertain about the best technique to apply.
3. The analysis is largely asymptotic, with a need for non-asymptotic results to enhance the practical relevance of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical depth by exploring non-asymptotic results for the successive contraction method and comparing its performance with the tensor power iteration algorithm. Additionally, the authors should consider discussing the potential information-computation gap in tensor PCA to better position their results within the broader literature. Lastly, we suggest providing a clearer comparison of the three proposed approaches to guide readers in selecting the most suitable technique.
