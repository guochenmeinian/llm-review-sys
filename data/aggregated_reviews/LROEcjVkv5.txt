Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the pure exploration problem in infinite-armed bandits, focusing on identifying an arm with a high expected reward. The authors propose algorithms for both fixed-confidence and fixed-budget settings, achieving significant improvements in sample complexity and failure rates. Specifically, they derive an expected sample complexity of $O(\log(1/\delta) \log(1/\eta) / \eta \epsilon^2)$ in the fixed-confidence setting and an asymptotic failure rate of approximately $\exp(-N/\log^2 N)$ in the fixed-budget case. The paper also addresses the challenge of unknown parameters, providing theoretical guarantees for their algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The originality of the problem addressed is notable, as it closes gaps in existing literature regarding upper and lower bounds.
- The algorithms are well-motivated and theoretically sound, with significant contributions to both fixed-confidence and fixed-budget settings.
- The clarity of writing and thorough literature review enhance the paper's accessibility.

Weaknesses:
- Some results lack clarity and rigor, particularly concerning the use of undefined constants (e.g., $C$, $\rho$, $\rho_1$, $\rho_2$) and the notation in proofs, which complicates readability.
- The proof of Lemma 4 is unconvincing and requires further development.
- Certain sections contain typos and unclear definitions (e.g., $\eta_1$, the meaning of "batches"), which detract from the overall quality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their results by explicitly defining constants used in the algorithms and avoiding symbols like $\Omega$ in proofs. Please consider postponing the proof of Lemma 4 to the Appendix and elaborating on the arguments presented. Additionally, we suggest including a more detailed explanation of the sample complexity bounds in the fixed-budget setting and clarifying the notation used throughout the paper. Addressing the remaining typos and providing an outline and conclusion would enhance the overall presentation.
