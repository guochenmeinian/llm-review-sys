Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into online multi-group learning, focusing on scenarios where the group size can be large or infinite. The authors propose a group-wise oracle-efficient algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while avoiding enumeration of all groups. The theoretical analysis covers three settings: i.i.d., adversarial with smoothed context distributions, and adversarial transductive. The paper also provides a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{dT/\sigma})$ for the $\sigma$-smoothed online learning setting.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a significant problem in online learning, particularly relevant in real-world applications with large group sizes.
2. It employs intuitive optimization and game theory techniques, yielding satisfactory theoretical results.
3. The presentation is clear and well-structured, enhancing readability and rigor.

Weaknesses:
1. The theoretical analysis is limited to the binary case, $\mathcal{Y} = \{ -1, 1 \}$, which restricts its applicability; exploring the multi-class case is a potential future direction.
2. The use of measure theory in Definition 4.1 may not be accessible to all readers; thorough definitions of key concepts would enhance self-containment.
3. The discussion on related work is insufficient; including regret bounds and online learning settings would improve context, possibly through a comparative table.
4. The motivation for using the AMF framework and FTPL is unclear and requires further elaboration, as does the novelty of the analysis.
5. The computational efficiency of the $(G, H)$-optimization oracle is not adequately addressed, raising questions about its practical implementation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis by extending it to the multi-class case. Additionally, we suggest thoroughly defining all concepts related to measure theory to enhance accessibility. To strengthen the related work section, please include regret bounds and online learning settings, potentially in a comparative table format. Clarifying the motivation for the AMF framework and FTPL, as well as the novelty in the analysis, would also be beneficial. Finally, a discussion on the computational efficiency of the $(G, H)$-optimization oracle should be included to address practical concerns.
