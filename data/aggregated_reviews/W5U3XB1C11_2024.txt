Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents RABBit, a framework for relational verification of deep neural networks (DNNs) that specifically addresses the verification of universal adversarial perturbations (UAP). The authors propose strong bounding and strong branching techniques, leveraging a product DNN structure to enhance verification precision. They provide updated tables with corrected standard accuracies and clarify the methodology for calculating UAP accuracy. The experimental results indicate that RABBit outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) verifiers for relational properties across various architectures and training methods. The authors also emphasize the importance of tracking relational dependencies in their approach and provide comparisons with SOTA verifiers, including MNBaB and GCP-CROWN.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper tackles a significant problem in verifying the absence of universal adversarial perturbations.  
- It introduces a novel algorithm that effectively combines strong bounding and strong branching methods, demonstrating practical utility.  
- The authors have made significant improvements in addressing reviewer concerns, including providing updated and corrected tables, enhancing the clarity of the paper, and ensuring the reproducibility of the code.  
- Comparisons with both MNBaB and GCP-CROWN demonstrate RABBit's superior performance, reinforcing its claims against SOTA verifiers.  
- The paper includes detailed experimental results and statistical analyses that substantiate the effectiveness of RABBit.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks sufficient proof for claims regarding the superiority of strong bounding over existing methods, particularly concerning the time limits and parameters used.  
- The code remains insufficiently documented and contains bugs, which hinders reproducibility.  
- The paper is not sufficiently self-contained, lacking detailed explanations of foundational concepts and algorithms, such as RACoon.  
- The structure of the paper is confusing, with some sections requiring prior knowledge of others for clarity, including disorganized sections and abrupt introductions of concepts like the MILP instance and k-UAP accuracy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by reorganizing sections to present foundational algorithms before introducing complex concepts. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more comprehensive comparison against recent SOTA baselines like GCP-CROWN and MN-BaB to substantiate performance claims. To enhance reproducibility, we recommend that the authors improve the documentation of the code to address reported bugs and include installation instructions and descriptions of the models used in experiments. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to expand the discussion on relational properties beyond UAP to clarify the broader applicability of their approach and provide a more comprehensive background on RACoon and other relevant concepts to make the paper more self-contained. Finally, we advise restructuring the paper to present Algorithm 1 before discussing Strong Bounding and Strong Branching, and including a description of the BaBSR score estimates and certified adversarial training approaches to provide a more complete understanding of their methodology.
