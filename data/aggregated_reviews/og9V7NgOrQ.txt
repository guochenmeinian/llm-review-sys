Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for learning Maximum Manifold Capacity Representations (MMCRs) through direct optimization of manifold capacity, demonstrating competitive performance on self-supervised learning (SSL) benchmarks. The authors propose a novel SSL objective function based on Manifold Capacity Theory (MCT) that enhances linear separability and shows that MMCRs are sample efficient, outperforming existing frameworks in certain aspects. The empirical results reveal distinct characteristics of MMCRs compared to other SSL methods, while also predicting neural data effectively. However, the distinction between MMCR and other methods, such as TiCo, remains unclear, particularly regarding the claim that MMCR incentivizes global high dimensionality without large pairwise comparisons.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed SSL algorithm is efficient and does not require large batch sizes or embedding dimensions.
- The empirical results align well with the theoretical framework, showcasing competitive performance across multiple datasets.
- The paper effectively showcases the conversion of geometric manifold capacity analysis into a practical SSL method and provides a theoretical foundation, empirical studies, and comparisons with biological data.
- The authors' response to reviewer comments indicates a willingness to clarify and improve the manuscript.

Weaknesses:
- Limited evaluations raise questions about the generalizability of the proposed method, particularly in more complex datasets like COCO.
- The architecture is restricted to ResNet-50, lacking competitiveness with more recent SSL methods.
- The discussion on the biological plausibility of MMCRs is insufficient, and the relevance to neuroscience needs clearer articulation.
- The claim that sETF solutions are optimal is questioned, as non-sETF configurations can achieve the same nuclear norm.
- The relationship between dimensionality and the number of centroids is not fully addressed, leading to potential misunderstandings.
- The analyses of neural data do not convincingly strengthen the argument for MMCR, suggesting that the specific objective function may not significantly impact predictive performance.
- The paper lacks error bars in evaluations, which could help clarify the robustness of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the relationship between their proposed objective and existing methods, particularly in relation to the work by Wang et al. (2020). Additionally, conducting an ablation study to investigate the necessity of minimizing object manifold compression is essential. The authors should also provide theoretical or empirical comparisons between MMCR and nuclear norm-based methods. To enhance the discussion, we suggest clarifying how the current work accounts for existing data and articulating the implications for understanding neural processes. Furthermore, the authors should explicitly discuss the non-uniqueness of optimal sETF solutions and elaborate on the relationship between dimensionality and the number of centroids, especially when the number of centroids exceeds the ambient dimensionality. To strengthen the discussion of neural data analyses, we recommend clarifying what is meant by "explaining variance" and expanding on the implications of their findings for understanding neural computations. Finally, including error bars in evaluations and addressing the biological feasibility of MMCRs would further strengthen the paper.
