### Key Points
This paper presents Retro-fallback, a novel framework that utilizes stochastic processes to address the retrosynthesis problem, notably incorporating the uncertainty of reaction allowability, a critical aspect often overlooked. The evaluation, while deemed simple, is acknowledged as appropriate for the scope of a workshop paper.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Clear description and solid structure.
- Sufficient experiments and discussions enhance the paper's credibility.
- The novel evaluation metric, successful synthesis probability (SSP), is practical, and the use of an and/or tree structure for its estimation is commendable.
- The model outperforms Retro* and BFS on the SSP metric and shows superiority in conventional metrics like fraction solved, shortest route, and most successful route.

Weaknesses:
- The discussion of related work could be expanded, and the second part of retrosynthesis requires a more detailed description.
- The distinction between `buyability` and `feasibility` should be clarified, as `buyability` can be directly assessed, while `feasibility` involves real-world considerations.
- Figure F.9 could benefit from including the `fraction solved` metric for better comparison.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related work and provide a more comprehensive description of the second part of retrosynthesis. Additionally, consider elaborating on the definitions and calculations of `buyability` and `feasibility`. Including the `fraction solved` in Figure F.9 would enhance the comparative analysis. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors consider incorporating more metrics, such as matching accuracy for retrosynthetic planning, to strengthen the paper.
