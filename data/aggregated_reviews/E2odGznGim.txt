Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the persistence of backdoors in deep learning models even after defense algorithms have been applied. The authors propose a novel metric, the Backdoor Existence Coefficient (BEC), which quantifies the presence of backdoors, ranging from 0 (nonexistent) to 1 (still present). The methodology involves identifying backdoor-related neurons and computing similarities in feature maps across different model states. Additionally, the authors introduce three types of attacks—white-box, black-box, and transfer-based—that aim to reactivate backdoors by applying universal adversarial perturbations. The experimental evaluation encompasses six defenses, seven attacks, and three datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed attacks in reactivating backdoors. The authors assert that the original backdoor and the re-activated backdoor are highly similar in effect, despite differences in parameters and triggers, and argue that backdoor re-activation is independent of the choice of surrogate models due to their shared training on the same poisoned dataset. They emphasize the significance of their findings in prompting a reconsideration of post-training backdoor defenses.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of the BEC is timely and provides a reliable measure for assessing the effectiveness of backdoor defenses.
- The three proposed attacks exhibit reasonable effectiveness in generating new poisoned instances with high success rates.
- The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, addressing various perspectives and settings.
- The authors provide a clear distinction between original and re-activated backdoors, supported by empirical evidence.
- The discussion on the adversary's perspective and the two-step process of backdoor injection and activation is insightful and enhances understanding of backdoor dynamics.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation of the transfer-based attack lacks clarity regarding the assumptions and differences between black-box and transfer scenarios.
- The detectability of perturbed instances is not discussed, which is crucial for evaluating the practicality of the proposed attacks.
- The paper only presents mean results without standard deviations, limiting the assessment of variability in attack success rates.
- The description of running times in the Appendix is confusing and lacks context.
- The terminology used, such as "backdoor re-activation," may be misleading as it implies a change in model parameters, which remains static post-training.
- Some reviewers expressed confusion regarding the parameters in the BEC computation and the implications of using intermediate versus final activations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the transfer-based attack by explicitly stating the assumptions regarding surrogate models and the differences in attacker knowledge between black-box and transfer scenarios. Additionally, the authors should evaluate the detectability of the perturbed instances against various defenses and include examples to strengthen their claims. It would also be beneficial to present standard deviations alongside mean results to provide a clearer understanding of the variability in attack success rates. Lastly, we suggest that the authors clarify the context of the running times reported in the Appendix to enhance the comprehensibility of their analysis. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity of terminology, particularly regarding "backdoor re-activation," to avoid misconceptions about model parameter changes, and explicitly clarify the computation of $\rho_{\text{BEC}}$ in their equations to mitigate confusion. Exploring the comparison of BEC metrics over intermediate activations versus final activations in greater depth could provide valuable insights into the backdoor effects.
