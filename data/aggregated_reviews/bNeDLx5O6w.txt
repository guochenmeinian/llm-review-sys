### Key Points
This paper presents a Multi-Aspect Feedback (MAF) framework aimed at enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by decoupling feedback generation for various error categories and utilizing error-specific tools. The authors demonstrate MAF's effectiveness across multiple reasoning tasks, showing improvements in performance compared to existing iterative refinement baselines. The study highlights the potential of MAF to contribute significantly to NLP engineering.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The experimental results indicate that MAF outperforms base language models and Self-Refine on complex reasoning tasks.
- The modular design of the framework allows for flexibility in integrating new models and tools.
- The identification of over-refinement as a potential issue in iterative frameworks is a valuable insight for the community.

Weaknesses:
- The framework's reliance on predefined error types may overlook other significant error categories.
- Some modules appear unnecessary or detrimental based on ablation study results, necessitating more comprehensive experiments to validate their effectiveness.
- The paper lacks human evaluation and case studies, which would strengthen its findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Table 1, ensuring it is referenced earlier in the text. Additionally, a detailed comparison of the Eager and Lazy Refinement strategies should be included in the experiments. The authors should also provide more comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the necessity of each module for various tasks. Furthermore, including human evaluations and case studies in the final version would enhance the paper's robustness. Lastly, addressing the blurriness of appendix images and ensuring proper figure captions will improve readability.
