Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a formal definition of U-nets, a fundamental component of modern deep learning frameworks like diffusion models. The authors propose a theoretical framework that elucidates U-net behavior and extends its application beyond 2D images. They conduct experiments across various modalities to validate their theoretical findings. Additionally, the paper introduces Multi-ResNets, a new class of U-nets with a simplified, wavelet-based encoder lacking learnable parameters, demonstrating competitive performance in tasks such as image segmentation and PDE surrogate modeling. The authors also identify how high-frequency information is dominated by noise in diffusion models and argue that average pooling provides a beneficial inductive bias by yielding lower-resolution coefficients with a high signal-to-noise ratio, facilitating the separation of signal from noise. Theorem 2 is acknowledged as valid, but its interpretation requires clarification, which the authors plan to address in the camera-ready version.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses the under-explored area of U-nets, particularly in the context of diffusion models, and provides a much-needed formalism.
- The theoretical contributions, including the mathematical definition of U-nets, facilitate the identification of self-similarity structures and high-resolution scaling limits.
- The diversity of modalities studied highlights the potential impact of a deeper understanding of U-nets.
- The authors engage positively with reviewers and show a willingness to clarify and improve their work.
- The planned improvements to Theorem 2's discussion are well-received, and the paper has been recognized for its potential contributions to the field.

Weaknesses:
- The inductive bias described in Theorem 2 is problematic, as it applies to any multiscale model with average pooling, not exclusively U-nets. Furthermore, it does not adequately address the common "epsilon-type" prediction framework in diffusion models, where the U-net's role is to predict noise rather than the denoised image.
- Clarity issues arise from the presentation, with essential components, such as Algorithm 1 for staged training and practical construction guidelines for U-nets, relegated to the appendix, making it difficult to grasp the core concepts.
- The paper lacks sufficient references to prior work, particularly regarding the relationship between U-nets and wavelets, and the application of diffusion models on complex geometries.
- Theorem 2 shares similarities with existing results by Donoho, which may limit its novelty.
- The current benchmarks for performance comparison, particularly with FNO and U-Net, are not definitive, necessitating further validation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by including essential algorithms and construction guidelines in the main text rather than the appendix. Additionally, we suggest that the authors refine their discussion of Theorem 2 to accurately reflect the role of U-nets in both "epsilon-type" and "sample-type" predictions, ensuring that the inductive bias is comprehensively understood. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to enhance the literature review by incorporating relevant prior work on U-nets and wavelets, as well as addressing the performance of Multi-ResNets in diffusion models compared to established baselines. We also recommend improving the clarity of Theorem 2's interpretation in the camera-ready version and consider adding a comment in the appendix discussing how max pooling can extract low-resolution information. It would be beneficial to include a reference to “DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL FRAMELETS: A GENERAL DEEP LEARNING FRAMEWORK FOR INVERSE PROBLEMS” by Ye et al. 2018. Finally, we suggest conducting independent performance comparisons of FNO and U-Nets, including other baseline models to strengthen the paper's findings.
