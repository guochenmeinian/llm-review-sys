Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new method for measuring neural network similarity by evaluating filter subspace distance, which is particularly relevant for federated and continual learning. The authors demonstrate both the theoretical and empirical effectiveness of their approach, showing that it can outperform traditional metrics like CCA and CKA in specific scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The problem addressed is fundamental to various applications in machine learning.
2. The proposed algorithm is simple, efficient, and easy to implement.
3. The methodology is clearly articulated, enhancing understanding.
4. The experimental results indicate that the method is effective in practice.

Weaknesses:
1. The solution is limited to CNNs, raising questions about its applicability to other models, such as transformers.
2. The experimental section lacks depth and could benefit from additional datasets like CIFAR-10, SVHN, and ImageNet.
3. Assumption 2.6 is strong and may not hold in complex real-world datasets.
4. The method's theoretical foundations are restricted to single-layer convolutions without nonlinearity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including results from CIFAR-10, SVHN, and ImageNet to enhance the robustness of their findings. Additionally, the authors should explore the extension of their algorithm to other architectures, such as transformers, and clarify the implications of Assumption 2.6 in practical scenarios. It would also be beneficial to consider a weighted average for layer-wise similarities, as not all layers may contribute equally to overall network performance. Lastly, addressing the limitations of their theoretical contributions and providing more comprehensive comparisons with CCA and CKA in diverse architectures would strengthen the paper.
