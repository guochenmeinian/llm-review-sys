### Key Points
This paper presents a cloth simulation model based on Kirchhoff-Love thin shell theory, utilizing a neural network to parameterize a deformation field (NDF) from a base parameterization. The model accommodates periodic and Dirichlet boundary conditions, allowing for discretization at any resolution and material conditioning. It is validated against the Belytschko obstacle course and compared with two mesh-based differentiable simulators, demonstrating comparable performance with superior memory efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The NDF enables simulation without prior knowledge of necessary resolution, reducing memory usage.
2. The method employs sophisticated thin shell theory, effectively reproducing complex anisotropic and buckling effects.
3. The work may inspire further research in neural cloth simulation by showcasing the advantages of a continuous NDF representation.
4. The supplementary material provides extensive details and validations.

Weaknesses:
1. The absence of collision detection and friction limits applicability, as acknowledged by the authors.
2. The training time is significantly high, potentially slower than state-of-the-art FEM systems.
3. The proposed method runs slower than classical simulators, raising concerns about efficiency.
4. The framework's generality is questioned, particularly regarding its extension to arbitrary garment shapes and real-time editing capabilities.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the framework's limitations, particularly regarding collision detection and friction, to enhance its applicability in realistic scenarios. Additionally, addressing the efficiency concerns by optimizing training time would strengthen the paper. We suggest including examples of the initial fitting to input meshes in the main text to demonstrate applicability beyond simple test scenarios. Furthermore, clarifying the concept of discretization in Fig. 6 and exploring the potential for extending the framework to support non-boundary point constraints would be beneficial. Lastly, we encourage the authors to consider differentiating their contributions more clearly from existing literature, particularly regarding the novelty of the solver framework.
