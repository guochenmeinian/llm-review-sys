### Key Points
This paper presents a faster \(O(m \log m)\) algorithm for the ellipse-polytope intersection, significantly improving upon existing \(O(m^2)\) algorithms. However, the theoretical justification for this improvement lacks depth, and the empirical results primarily focus on synthetic datasets, limiting practical relevance. The authors propose a method that enhances the complexity of high-dimensional slice sampling, yet comparisons are restricted to BoTorch's elliptical slice sampling, missing alternative methods like rejection sampling or Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). The paper also emphasizes speed improvements but provides minimal discussion on accuracy and convergence properties.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The manuscript is clearly written and easy to understand.
- The proposed method is straightforward to implement.
- The proofs are well-structured and of high quality.
- The algorithm effectively improves the complexity of high-dimensional slice sampling.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical justification for the speed improvement is insufficient.
- Experiments are limited to synthetic datasets, lacking diversity and real-world applications.
- Comparisons are only made with BoTorch's implementation, neglecting other relevant methods.
- There is little discussion on the accuracy and convergence properties of the algorithm.
- The explanation of the pseudocode lacks detail in certain areas.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis to better explain why their method outperforms existing algorithms beyond empirical results. Testing the algorithm on real-world datasets, particularly in domains like Bayesian optimization or Gaussian processes, would enhance practical validation. We suggest including comparisons with alternative methods, such as rejection sampling or Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), to provide a broader context for efficiency. Additionally, the authors should address the accuracy and convergence properties of the algorithm, ensuring that samples drawn are representative of the truncated multivariate normal distribution. Clarifying the conditions under which the \(O(m \log m)\) method performs optimally would also be beneficial. Finally, we recommend expanding the discussion on GPU scalability and numerical stability, particularly in high-dimensional cases, and providing a more detailed explanation of the pseudocode, especially the transition between sorting angles and computing the cumulative max.
