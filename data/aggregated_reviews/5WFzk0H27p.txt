Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Tournesol public dataset, collected from the Tournesol platform, which includes over 204,000 pairwise comparisons on the recommendability of more than 40,000 YouTube videos made by over 20,000 users. The dataset evaluates secondary criteria such as content reliability, topic importance, and layman-friendliness, aiming to enhance the ethical alignment of recommendation algorithms through large-scale, community-driven judgments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The dataset is collected in a fully deployed environment with real users, providing practical insights and enhancing its significance.
2. It offers a detailed analysis of contributor judgments, highlighting biases and variations, demonstrating high-quality research practices.
3. The dataset is publicly available, encouraging transparency and further research on ethical recommender systems.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks experimental results, such as naive baseline comparisons, making it difficult to assess the dataset's utility and effectiveness.
2. There is no comparative analysis with existing datasets, which is necessary to highlight the unique features of the Tournesol dataset.
3. The writing is obscure in parts, and there are numerous typographical errors that detract from the paper's professionalism and clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing and address typographical errors to enhance professionalism. Additionally, the authors should include experimental results demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in improving recommendation systems and provide a clearer explanation of the motivation behind the chosen secondary criteria. A comparative analysis with existing datasets would also help elucidate the unique advantages of the Tournesol dataset. Finally, systematically formulating specific recommendation tasks and providing naive baseline comparisons, similar to those in the Tenrec dataset, would clarify the dataset's utility and guide future research.
