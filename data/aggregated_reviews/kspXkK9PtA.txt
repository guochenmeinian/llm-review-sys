### Key Points
This paper presents a generative post-processing network (GenPPN) designed to enhance the output of natural language generation (NLG) components in task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems. The model utilizes the LLaMA language model and reinforcement learning (RL) with a predefined reward function to optimize performance. The authors propose that GenPPNs improve task completion by refining system outputs based on dialogue context and actions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of GenPPNs on the MultiWOZ dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of reinforcement learning to enhance post-processing is insightful, effectively linking dialogue-level and utterance-level rewards.
- The versatility of GenPPNs allows compatibility with various NLG models, increasing their applicability.
- The paper is well-structured, clearly presenting results and informative ablation studies.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for adding GenPPN to the already complex TOD pipeline is weak, and the incremental nature of the work may limit its impact.
- The evaluation primarily compares against older methods like SC-LSTM, lacking comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches.
- The absolute performance of models with GenPPN does not exceed that of the strong Template baseline, raising questions about the value of the improvements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for their approach by considering additional criteria for the reward function, such as fluency and naturalness. Additionally, we suggest conducting evaluations against state-of-the-art methods to strengthen the comparative analysis. It would also be beneficial to include ablation studies that clarify the contributions of reinforcement learning versus instruction tuning. Finally, demonstrating specific cases where GenPPN outperforms the Template model would enhance the paper's impact and relevance.
