Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on online classifier learning under online label shift, focusing on Unsupervised Online Label Shift (UOLS) and Supervised Online Label Shift (SOLS). The authors propose a novel framework that reformulates the online label shift problem as online regression of the marginal distribution function, addressing previous convexity issues. The paper extends theoretical bounds from UOLS to SOLS and includes an extensive empirical study, although most datasets used for experiments simulate label shift dynamics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and detailed, clearly outlining contributions and limitations.
- The key novelty lies in reformulating the problem, allowing efficient solutions with existing tools.
- The theoretical bounds provided are tight, and the proofs are accessible.
- Extensive empirical studies support the theoretical findings.

Weaknesses:
- The approach requires memory that scales linearly with time, raising practical concerns.
- Most datasets used for experiments involve simulated label shifts, with only one using real-world data.
- The scope of the paper is considered restrictive, as it assumes class conditionals remain unchanged over time.
- Some technical aspects, such as the role of $\delta$ in the big $\tilde{O}$ function, are unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the quantification of memory usage in experiments to address practical concerns. Additionally, incorporating recent consumer-related datasets that reflect real-world label shifts, particularly pre- and post-Covid data, would enhance the relevance of the findings. Clarifying the role of $\delta$ in the big $\tilde{O}$ function and simplifying the theoretical exposition could improve accessibility. Lastly, we suggest revising the title to better reflect the core contributions and addressing the confusion surrounding the term "sample efficient" in the context of the paper.
