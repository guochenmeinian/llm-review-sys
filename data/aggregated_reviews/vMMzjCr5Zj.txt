Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method called Large Pre-trained Time-series Models (LPTM) aimed at enhancing the efficiency and performance of time-series analysis across various domains. The authors propose an adaptive segmentation module that dynamically identifies optimal segmentation strategies during pre-training, addressing the limitations of fixed-length segmentation. LPTM demonstrates superior forecasting and classification performance, requiring up to 40% less data and 50% less training time compared to existing models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The relevance of the problem and motivation for adaptive segmentation is compelling.
- The proposed adaptive segmentation method is an innovative solution to the segmentation challenge in time series.
- LPTM is compared against a wide range of appropriate and challenging baselines, yielding promising empirical results.
- The paper is well-written and clear, with a reasonable choice of baselines.

Weaknesses:
- The paper does not sufficiently investigate *why* the proposed method works, particularly the interplay between the scoring function and encoder training.
- Many experimental claims lack adequate substantiation, such as the absence of error bars and statistical significance tests.
- The overall presentation, including language and formatting, requires improvement.
- The implementation is inaccessible due to an expired repository, hindering reproducibility as key hyperparameters are not provided.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the investigation into the underlying mechanisms of the method, particularly the relationship between the scoring function and encoder training. Additionally, please ensure that all experimental claims are substantiated with appropriate statistical analyses, including error bars and significance tests. We suggest enhancing the overall presentation quality, including language refinement and consistent formatting. Furthermore, please address the accessibility of the implementation by providing a working repository and including all necessary hyperparameters for reproducibility. Finally, consider incorporating classical long-term forecasting datasets to strengthen the evaluation and avoid potential cherry-picking of results.
