Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel explanation method called RegExplainer for interpreting graph regression models, addressing challenges such as distribution shifting and decision boundary issues. The authors propose leveraging the graph information bottleneck theory and self-supervised learning, and they evaluate their method on multiple datasets, both synthetic and real-world. The authors express gratitude for the reviewers' detailed feedback, emphasizing its importance in refining their work and aligning revisions with expectations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The writing flow is clear and easy to follow.
- The theoretical justification for the objective function in Eq. (4) is thorough.
- The proposed method effectively addresses the distribution shift problem specific to regression tasks.
- The code is released, enhancing reproducibility.
- The authors demonstrate a strong commitment to addressing reviewer feedback, showing openness to further discussions and clarifications.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution regarding datasets is unclear, as detailed descriptions are lacking.
- The method does not consider subgraph connectivities, potentially leading to isolated nodes.
- Property 2 is overclaimed, as it dismisses the ground truth joint distribution $p(Y^*,Y)$.
- Section 4.3 is hard to follow, particularly regarding the processes for obtaining $(G^+)^{\Delta}$ and $G^*$.
- The nature of $G^*$, $(G^+)^{\Delta}$, and $G^{mix}$ (binary or continuous) is not clearly defined.
- The method for measuring distances between graphs is inadequately justified.
- The problem definition in Lines 113-115 lacks clarity regarding the criteria for valid explanations.
- The reviews do not specify particular areas of weakness in the paper, which may limit the authors' ability to focus their revisions effectively.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the contribution by providing detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Additionally, the authors should consider incorporating subgraph connectivities into RegExplainer to avoid isolated nodes. It is crucial to address the overclaiming of Property 2 by including a discussion on the ground truth joint distribution. We suggest that the authors enhance Section 4.3 by providing more detail on the processes for obtaining $(G^+)^{\Delta}$ and $G^*$. Clarifying whether $G^*$, $(G^+)^{\Delta}$, and $G^{mix}$ are binary or continuous will strengthen the paper. Furthermore, the authors should justify the metrics used for measuring distances between graphs and clarify the problem definition to specify the criteria for valid explanations. Lastly, we recommend that the authors improve the specificity of their revisions by directly addressing any highlighted concerns from the reviewers and enhancing clarity in certain sections to further strengthen the paper's impact. Exploring the applicability of the method to node-level regression tasks could also broaden its impact.
