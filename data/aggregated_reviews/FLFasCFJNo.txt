Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel meta-learning approach using Bayesian filtering to discover synaptic plasticity rules that enable an excitatory-inhibitory recurrent spiking neural network to meet predefined criteria. The authors demonstrate that their method can recover various heterogeneous rules that align with target dynamical regimes, sometimes deviating from mean-field model predictions. The study emphasizes the flexibility of the filter Simulation-Based Inference (fSBI) method, which automates the identification of plausible rule families while addressing limitations of traditional approaches in synaptic plasticity research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The manuscript is well-written and clear, with informative illustrations.
- The fSBI framework shows flexibility across architectures and rule parameterization, applicable in unsupervised learning contexts.
- The analysis of the reduction in effective dimensionality of rule parameters is insightful.
- The findings challenge traditional theoretical protocols and highlight the limitations of standard neuroscience protocols.

Weaknesses:
- The computational demands of the method may increase significantly with a larger number of rule parameters, as noted by the authors.
- The choice of specific metric bounds lacks detailed explanation, raising concerns about sensitivity and impact on results.
- The paper does not adequately address the scalability of the algorithm or the generalization of learned rules to different network architectures and neuron properties.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the long-term utility of the discovered plasticity rules, particularly regarding their applicability to memory formation and task performance. It would be beneficial to explore the inclusion of weight regularization or homeostatic mechanisms and their potential impact on the pool of plausible rules. Additionally, we suggest providing more clarity on the selection of metric bounds and their implications, as well as conducting simulations across different initializations to assess robustness. Finally, we encourage the authors to speculate on the biases in sampling using fSBI and to clarify the rationale behind the choices made in their simulations.
