Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel connection between Information Pursuit (IP) and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), primarily used in Compressed Sensing, to enhance explainability in visual classification. The authors propose an approach termed IP-OMP, which integrates a normalization step in OMP, allowing it to be framed as an instance of IP. The paper also explores the application of OMP in explainable AI by embedding semantic attributes and images into a joint space using CLIP embeddings, demonstrating the effectiveness of IP-OMP through numerical experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Explainability is a highly relevant topic.
- The connection between IP and OMP is intriguing and insightful.
- The proposed explainability approach is elegant and theoretically grounded.
- Numerical experiments are well-designed and executed.

Weaknesses:
- The treatment of noise is insufficient; comparisons between IP and OMP assume clean signals.
- The settings of IP and OMP differ significantly, which undermines the feasibility of their relationship.
- The manuscript does not adequately address noise and approximate sparsity in OMP.
- The novelty of the proposed connection is questionable, given OMP's long-standing presence in the literature and the common practice of column normalization.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the noise treatment in their comparisons, ensuring that the original signal is not assumed to be clean. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the insights gained from the proposed connection, particularly regarding the implications for IP. It would be beneficial to explore the performance of IP-OMP in same-modality query problems to better demonstrate its capabilities. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to consider filtering inappropriate queries in CLIP-IP-OMP to enhance its explainability. Lastly, we recommend addressing the ambiguity surrounding the term "explainable AI" to align with human-like interpretations of query selection.
