Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for rasterizing and optimizing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for omnidirectional cameras. It approximates the rendering of each 3D Gaussian as a perspective camera directed towards each Gaussian, effectively adapting the 3DGS method to omnidirectional camera models. The authors demonstrate that their approach achieves higher rendering quality and speed compared to previous NeRF counterparts. The method is general and applicable to various camera models, enhancing its utility in real-world applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for extending 3DGS to omnidirectional cameras is clear, addressing practical data collection needs.
- The proposed method is simple yet effective, avoiding complex camera models while maintaining high rendering speed.
- Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show significant improvements over existing methods, with a well-preserved rendering speed.

Weaknesses:
- The approximation error is influenced by the size of the Gaussian, and details regarding the maximum size limit are insufficiently explained.
- The paper lacks a comparative performance analysis with 360-GS, which is relevant given their similarities.
- Writing quality and clarity are inconsistent, with grammar issues and typos present throughout the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing, particularly in the abstract and key sections, to enhance readability. Additionally, more details should be provided regarding the maximum size limit of the Gaussians to clarify the approximation error. Including a performance comparison with 360-GS would strengthen the paper's contributions. Finally, addressing the implementation of alpha blending of Gaussians and ensuring consistency between the title and content regarding the Gaussian Splatting framework is essential for a clearer presentation.
