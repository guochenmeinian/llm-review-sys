### Key Points
This paper presents Trieste, a modular open-source library for Bayesian optimization within the TensorFlow ecosystem. The library allows users to mix-and-match modules of four types, offering flexibility and good defaults. It supports various standard features, including batched trials, multi-fidelity, multi-objective optimization, and outcome constraints, and compares favorably to other libraries like Ax+BoTorch and Emukit. The authors claim there are no other Bayesian optimization libraries for TensorFlow 2, but OSS Vizier, published in early 2023, offers comparable features. The paper is well-written and aligns with the BDU workshop theme, providing valuable contributions to the community.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- Trieste's modular design and comprehensive feature set enhance its usability for complex optimization tasks.  
- The library's open-source nature and alignment with TensorFlow provide strong community support.  
- The paper is clearly written and relevant to the workshop theme.

Weaknesses:  
- The claim regarding the absence of other TensorFlow 2 libraries is inaccurate, as OSS Vizier exists with similar features.  
- The TensorFlow-centric approach may limit applicability for users of other frameworks like PyTorch.  
- The paper lacks empirical experiments and discussions on scalability and support for modern deep learning architectures.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors update the paper to include references and comparisons with OSS Vizier. Additionally, we suggest incorporating empirical experiments to evaluate the framework's scalability and its support for modern deep learning architectures beyond simple implementations from KERAS. To enhance clarity, consider combining Figures 1 and 2 into a single "Figure 1" with parts A and B. Adding a reference for L-BFGS-B and revising the sentence on lines 104-109 by deleting "has" or adding "which" or "and" after "research" would also improve the paper.
