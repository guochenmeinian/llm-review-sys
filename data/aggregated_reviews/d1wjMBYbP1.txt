Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an approach to zero-shot anomaly detection through Adaptive Centered Representations (ACR), which integrates batch normalization with meta-training. The methodology relies on three key assumptions: the existence of a relevant training set, batch-level analysis during inference, and a predominance of normal class data in the batch. ACR effectively utilizes batch statistics to assign anomaly scores, demonstrating its applicability across various data types, including images and tabular data. The authors argue that their method achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art techniques on the MVTec-AD dataset, particularly emphasizing that pixel-level results outperform image-level results due to the nature of feature extraction. They clarify that while their method is a batch-level detector, it offers advantages over pre-trained foundation models, such as being lightweight and not requiring human intervention for task specification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors address the significant task of zero-shot anomaly detection, which is crucial in many domains.
- The proposed method shows competitive performance with state-of-the-art techniques in industrial anomaly detection.
- It is applicable to a wider range of data types, including tabular data, enhancing its utility.
- The notation and assumptions are clearly articulated, aiding comprehension of the approach.
- The method is lightweight, requiring less memory than large foundation models.
- Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on critical assumptions, such as the availability of a meta-training set and batch-level anomaly detection, may limit practical applicability.
- The assumption of a meta-training set presupposes strong prior knowledge of anomalies, which may not be realistic.
- Performance concerns arise from the requirement of over 100 training classes, with diminished results when reduced to 20 classes, indicating potential scalability issues.
- The novelty of using meta-training to adapt batch normalization for batch-level anomaly detection may be perceived as incremental.
- The experimental section lacks clarity and organization, complicating the understanding and reproducibility of results.
- Confusion exists between anomaly detection and one-class classification, leading to misleading comparisons and statements in the related works section.
- Concerns remain regarding whether the contribution meets the standards for publication at NIPS.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and organization of the experimental section to enhance reproducibility and understanding. Further exploration of the method's performance with fewer training classes is essential to assess its scalability. Additionally, we suggest addressing the confusion between anomaly detection and one-class classification by clearly differentiating these tasks in the paper. A schematic diagram outlining the overall method would also aid comprehension. Lastly, the authors should provide qualitative results to illustrate the method's effectiveness and clarify the implications of batch-level predictions, including threshold selection for anomaly recognition. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the novelty of their contributions, particularly in relation to the use of meta-training with batch normalization, and elaborate on how their method's advantages over pre-trained foundation models extend beyond performance metrics. Addressing the incremental nature of their approach could strengthen the overall impact of the paper.
