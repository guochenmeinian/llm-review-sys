### Key Points
This paper presents Privacy-Friendly Cross-Domain Recommendation (PFCDR), addressing the cold-start problem without transferring sensitive user data by distilling transferable knowledge from insensitive item embeddings, termed prototypes, using a conditional model inversion mechanism. This innovative approach establishes a new data format and learning paradigm to extract prototypes from traditional recommendation models, effectively bridging domain gaps while preserving privacy. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate its effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation for privacy protection in Cross-Domain Recommendation is clearly articulated.
2. The experimental results are promising, demonstrating significant performance improvements.
3. The paper is well-structured and easy to understand, enhancing its accessibility.

Weaknesses:
1. The proposed method lacks a formal privacy protection guarantee, such as Differential Privacy (DP).
2. The experiments are limited to a single, small dataset and outdated recommendation methods, necessitating the inclusion of more contemporary and state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.
3. The distilled user prototypes are not entirely user-irrelevant, potentially compromising privacy, and the framework's complexity may hinder practical implementation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their work by citing and comparing their method with important references in the field of privacy-preserving cross-domain recommendation. Additionally, the authors should explore the performance of PFCDR on top-k recommendation tasks to enhance practical relevance. We suggest including larger, real-world datasets in experiments to strengthen the findings and provide insights into the computational performance of PFCDR, especially regarding its scalability and efficiency in real-world applications. Furthermore, clarifying the role of Knowledge Distillation and the accuracy of the bridge function in matching user prototypes would enhance understanding. Lastly, addressing the limitations related to domain-shared knowledge would improve the robustness of the proposed method across diverse recommendation scenarios.
