Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents algorithms for the marginal MAP (MMAP) problem in credal networks, extending existing Bayesian network algorithms. The authors propose both exact and heuristic approaches, with a focus on the latter due to scalability issues with larger problems. The paper provides a thorough overview of the problem, existing literature, and empirical evaluations, contributing to the field of probabilistic reasoning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well-written and offers a comprehensive overview of the MMAP problem and related work. It addresses an important and general problem in probabilistic graphical models (PGMs), with empirical validation of proposed algorithms. The inclusion of supplementary code enhances reproducibility and serves the probabilistic reasoning community.

Weaknesses:  
The relationship between the proposed algorithms and those for Bayesian networks is not sufficiently detailed. It remains unclear whether the algorithms for credal networks are straightforward generalizations of Bayesian network algorithms, particularly regarding runtime guarantees. Additionally, the focus on maxi-max and maxi-min criteria limits the exploration of decision-making in credal networks, which could benefit from considering other criteria like maximality or interval dominance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the relationship between credal networks and Bayesian networks, specifically addressing whether tight intervals in credal networks correspond to Bayesian algorithms and the challenges in this generalization. Furthermore, we suggest exploring additional decision criteria beyond maxi-max and maxi-min to enrich the analysis of credal networks. Clarifying the significance of marginal MAP in credal networks and conducting experiments on counterfactual inference would also strengthen the paper's contribution. Lastly, we encourage the authors to elaborate on strategies for controlling the trade-off between accuracy and complexity in their algorithms.
