Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents novel adaptive variance reduction methods for stochastic optimization, specifically introducing the Ada-STORM method, which achieves an optimal convergence rate of $O(T^{-1/3})$ for non-convex functions without requiring bounded gradient and function value assumptions. The authors extend this method to stochastic compositional optimization, maintaining the same convergence rate, and develop an adaptive algorithm for non-convex finite-sum problems that achieves an optimal rate of $O(n^{1/4}T^{-1/2})$. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated through numerical experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The Ada-STORM method effectively overcomes limitations of existing adaptive STORM methods, achieving optimal convergence rates without the $O(\log T)$ term.
2. The theoretical analysis is novel and clearly articulated, demonstrating flexibility across various optimization tasks.
3. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results, showcasing superior performance compared to other algorithms.

Weaknesses:
1. Theorem 4 lacks a comparison of important constants such as $\Delta_F$ and $L$ with existing methods, which could enhance the discussion.
2. Content in Lines 240 to 242, particularly Algorithm 4, should be included in the main body rather than relegated to the Appendix.
3. Several typos are present, including incorrect notation in Lines 145 and 516.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion in Theorem 4 by including a comparison of constants like $\Delta_F$ and $L$ with existing methods. Additionally, we suggest incorporating the content from Lines 240 to 242 into the main body of the paper for better accessibility. Lastly, we advise the authors to correct the identified typos to enhance clarity and precision.
