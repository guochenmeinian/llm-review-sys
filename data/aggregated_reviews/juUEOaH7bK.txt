Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for enhancing weakly supervised learning through Unsupervised Labeling Function (ULF) correction using k-fold cross-validation. The authors propose a method that optimizes the assignment of labeling functions (LFs) to classes by recalculating allocations based on reliable cross-validated samples. The paper includes extensive experiments with feature-based and pre-trained models, demonstrating that the proposed method performs comparably or better than existing solutions. The authors provide a well-documented appendix to support reproducibility.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and clearly organized, enhancing understanding.
- The proposed method shows competitive performance, outperforming existing methods in most cases.
- The research is well-motivated, with a clear rationale for re-estimating the joint distribution between labeling functions and class labels.
- Extensive experimentation adds significant value, supported by detailed appendices.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks ablation experiments to assess the impact of different labeling functions.
- There is insufficient discussion of results, limiting the depth of analysis.
- The experimental section does not detail computational requirements or hyperparameters.
- The comparison with other label aggregation methods (e.g., ASTRA, SPEAR, ImplyLoss) is inadequate.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion section to provide a deeper analysis of the results and their implications. Additionally, including a section on future research directions would enhance the paper's significance. The authors should also consider adding ablation studies to evaluate the impact of various labeling functions and provide details on computational requirements and hyperparameters in the experimental section. Finally, we suggest incorporating comparisons with other relevant label aggregation methods to strengthen the contributions of the paper.
