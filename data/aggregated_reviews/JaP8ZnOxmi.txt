### Key Points
This paper presents a method for depolarising news summarisation through a proposed polarity minimization loss, aimed at improving access to neutral news information. The authors demonstrate that their methodology outperforms general-purpose summarisation models in terms of neutralising valence and retaining salient information. They provide evidence of effectiveness through various metrics, including human evaluations and ablation studies that highlight the importance of learning bidirectional polarity shifts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-motivated with a clear introduction that effectively outlines the problem and key concepts.
- The proposed method shows significant improvements in bias mitigation and information preservation, outperforming existing baselines.
- The structure of the paper is clear, making it easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The intuition behind the polarity minimization loss is not well articulated, and comparisons to other models are selective and lack justification.
- Some experimental details are unclear, such as the construction of pairs for the loss function and the specifics of the models used in experiments.
- Certain sections contain confusing language and require more explanation, particularly regarding the results and figures.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the articulation of the intuition behind the polarity minimization loss and justify the selective comparisons to other models, particularly those by Lee et al. (2022). Additionally, we suggest including more recent multi-document summarization techniques in the benchmarks and clarifying the construction of pairs for the loss function. It would also be beneficial to provide clearer explanations in the experimental section and ensure consistent precision in reporting results across tables. Lastly, we advise moving Appendix A to the main content and including the missing references mentioned in the reviews.
