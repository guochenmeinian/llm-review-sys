### Key Points
This paper presents a faithfulness metric for response generation that utilizes Conditional Point-wise Mutual Information (C-PMI) between the generated response and the source document, considering dialogue history. The authors propose a decoding strategy, PMIâ€“FAITH, which significantly enhances performance on the BEGIN benchmark. The problem statement clearly distinguishes between faithfulness and hallucination, and the proposed methods demonstrate improved performance and detailed analyses compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel state-of-the-art metric for estimating faithfulness in dialogue generation.
- The decoding strategy effectively enhances the generation of faithful responses.
- The methodology is well-articulated, and the results show significant improvements.

Weaknesses:
- There is a lack of validation for the evaluation setting, particularly regarding the use of classification metrics.
- Human evaluation details are insufficient to substantiate the performance claims of PMI-D.
- The paper does not provide a comparative analysis of PMI-FAITH against other metrics in human evaluations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the evaluation setting and provide benchmark settings for the generation metrics. Additionally, please include more details on the human evaluators involved in the study. It would be beneficial to add grammar-related metrics to demonstrate improvements from the p-masking technique. Furthermore, we suggest addressing the concerns regarding the potential for CPMI explosion and clarifying the estimation methods used for P(r|d, h) and P(r|h) in Equation 2. Lastly, please ensure that the missing references are included in the final version.
