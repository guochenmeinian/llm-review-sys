### Key Points
This paper presents a method for generating energy-efficient random numbers, specifically targeting applications in machine learning. The authors propose a s-MTJ based floating point number generation scheme, addressing the growing concerns regarding the sustainability and power consumption of machine learning algorithms. The paper is well-written and effectively communicates its central message.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The development of a s-MTJ based floating point number generation scheme is a notable contribution.
2. The authors provide extensive quantitative analysis of energy and power consumption related to their approach.

Weaknesses:
1. The approach generates uniform random numbers, but many machine learning applications require Gaussian random numbers for weight initialization and other uses. The paper lacks a discussion on the feasibility of extending the current method to generate Gaussian random numbers.
2. The absence of real-life application examples limits the understanding of how the proposed approach's limitations impact algorithm performance.
3. There is a missing Table reference on line 127, and a poorly referenced table on page 3.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by explicitly stating the novelty of their work, particularly in relation to existing literature on current-driven MTJs as RNGs. A comparison between their circuit and more standard solutions, such as CPUs or dedicated ASICs, would enhance the discussion on energy efficiency. Additionally, including a paragraph on the extension of their method to Gaussian random numbers would strengthen the paper. Finally, presenting a fabricated circuit or experimental implementation, rather than solely simulations, would significantly improve the paper's merit.
