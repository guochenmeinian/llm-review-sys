### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to address two challenges in Chinese Named Entity Recognition (CNER): catastrophic forgetting and non-entity type semantic transfer issues. The authors propose pooled feature distillation loss and confidence-based pseudo-labeling to mitigate these problems. Extensive experiments across ten CNER settings and three datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation is clear, focusing on the semantic shift problem in CNER, which has been overlooked by prior methods.
- The paper provides a comprehensive comparison of the proposed method with various baselines, showcasing significant improvements.
- The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the approach and have the potential to inspire further research in CNER and related tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments are limited to BERT, leaving the performance on larger models unexamined.
- The paper lacks a detailed analysis of the proposed approach's limitations and does not compare it with state-of-the-art methods outside the CNER domain, which may affect its generalizability.
- Certain details, such as performance under different hyper-parameter settings (e.g., \lambda) and computational complexity, are unclear or missing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental design by including evaluations on larger models to clarify performance. Additionally, a detailed analysis of the limitations of the proposed approach should be provided, including scenarios where it may not perform well. The authors should also discuss the computational complexity of their method to address concerns for large-scale datasets or real-time applications. Finally, clarifying the performance under different hyper-parameter settings would enhance the paper's rigor.
