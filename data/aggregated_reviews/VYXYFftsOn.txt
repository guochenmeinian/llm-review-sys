### Key Points
This paper presents the FIT problem to investigate the minimum number of training images required to effectively imitate a concept. The authors conduct experiments on face and art style datasets, suggesting that 200-600 images may represent a threshold for imitation. The findings are significant for detecting copyright violations in image generation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The experiments are concrete and well-structured, providing clear explanations of the steps involved in estimating the imitation threshold (FIT).  
2. The introduction effectively defines the problem of imitation, and the background section contextualizes the research landscape, enhancing reader comprehension.  
3. The work addresses important ethical and legal implications of text-to-image models, potentially informing future discussions on model transparency and responsibility.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The conclusion that models cannot replicate concepts appearing less than 200 times lacks empirical validation; the authors should conduct pretraining models to support this claim.  
2. The proposed methodology, MIMETIC2, does not introduce radically new concepts, as it builds on existing methods for evaluating image similarity.  
3. The broader implications of the findings for legal or technical communities are not fully articulated, particularly regarding how the proposed thresholds could influence legal standards related to copyright infringement.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the validation of their conclusion by conducting empirical analysis through pretraining models. Additionally, we suggest that the authors enhance the discussion of MIMETIC2 by clarifying its novel contributions to the field. Finally, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the implications of their findings for legal standards and technical communities, particularly in relation to copyright infringement.
