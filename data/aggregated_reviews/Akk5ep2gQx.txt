### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for multi-attribute controllable dialogue generation, introducing the Dialog Attribute Space Controller (DASC) to manage multiple attributes in generated responses. The authors propose a weighted decoding method that utilizes an Attribute Token Embedding and an Attribute Context Embedding, allowing for enhanced control in the decoding process. Evaluation results indicate that DASC achieves strong controllability in combinatorial control tasks and provides clear visualizations of attribute lexical embeddings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The study addresses an important task in multi-attribute controllable dialogue generation and proposes an intuitive weighted decoding method.  
- The analysis is comprehensive and instructive, providing sufficient support for its claims.  
- The proposed method enhances controllability of different attributes, as evidenced by experimental results.

Weaknesses:  
- The exploration of previous works is limited, and the experiments lack comprehensiveness, particularly in comparing with models that do not utilize the same attribute handling methods.  
- The experimental section could benefit from significance testing on human evaluation results and comparisons with recent large language models (LLMs).  
- Some results require further explanation, particularly regarding the observed differences in sensibleness and interestingness compared to other models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including significance tests on human evaluation results and comparing their method with recent LLMs. Additionally, the authors should consider addressing the performance of the attribute classifier as derived from Eq.2 and Eq.7, and provide more detailed explanations for the observed differences in performance metrics, such as the relationship between sensibleness and interestingness in their results. Finally, incorporating comparisons with important baselines like FUDGE, PPLM, and Cocon would strengthen the paper's contributions.
