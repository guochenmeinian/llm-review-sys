Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents **LeapAD**, a dual-process closed-loop autonomous driving system inspired by human cognition. It utilizes a **VLM** to analyze scenes and identify critical objects, followed by a dual-process learning approach comprising an **Analytic Process** for detailed reasoning and a **Heuristic Process** for efficient decision-making. The system demonstrates superior performance in the CARLA simulator compared to camera-only methods. The Heuristic Process benefits from continuous learning through a memory bank that accumulates knowledge from the Analytic Process.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dual-process framework effectively emulates human cognitive functions, enhancing adaptability and performance in autonomous driving.
- The system achieves state-of-the-art results in closed-loop simulations, demonstrating its potential impact on the field.
- The paper is well-written, providing clear explanations and sufficient details for reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- The distinction between the Analytic and Heuristic Processes is unclear, particularly regarding the use of language models.
- The evaluation relies solely on the CARLA simulator, lacking real-world data and comprehensive performance metrics.
- The reliance on textual descriptions for scene understanding may introduce inefficiencies, especially in complex scenarios with multiple dynamic actors.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definitions and distinctions between the Analytic Process and Heuristic Process, particularly justifying the terminology used for each. Additionally, we suggest incorporating evaluations using real-world datasets, such as nuScenes, to provide a more comprehensive assessment of LeapAD's performance. More ablation studies should be included to explore the influence of various VLMs, including LLaVa, on the system's effectiveness. Finally, we encourage the authors to consider using vectorized representations for scene understanding, as this may enhance efficiency and robustness in complex driving scenarios.
