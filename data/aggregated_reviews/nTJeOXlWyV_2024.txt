Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework, RTify, that aligns the temporal dynamics of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with human reaction times for visual recognition tasks. The authors propose a method that transforms RNN activity into a real-valued evidence measure, which is integrated over time by an evidence accumulator. Two training approaches, supervised and self-supervised, are introduced to optimize the stopping threshold and the transformation function. The framework demonstrates its effectiveness across various psychophysics tasks, showing improvements over existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem addressed—adaptive computation time and its relationship to human reaction times—is intriguing and relevant.
- The solution is innovative, utilizing WW models and a unique training loss that is uncommon in the neural network field.
- RTify effectively trains models to match human reaction times, demonstrating applicability to both synthetic and real-world tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The writing is overly complex, making the approach difficult to understand; the application of RNNs on top of CNNs is not clearly articulated.
- The benchmarks for visual experiments are weak; stronger datasets like CIFAR10/100 or ImageNet should be considered.
- Key details regarding WW models are lacking, and including PyTorch pseudo code for the forward pass would enhance clarity.
- The novelty of adaptive computation for RNNs is questionable; comparisons with existing methods like ACT are necessary.
- The rationale for incorporating human reaction times is not sufficiently explained, leaving the reader unclear about its significance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing to make the approach more accessible, particularly for practitioners unfamiliar with the field. A more thorough discussion of the WW model and its relevance to the proposed method should be included. Additionally, we suggest that the authors consider using stronger datasets for evaluation and provide detailed explanations of the formulation of the $\Phi$ function and the loss propagation. Including a table to present results systematically and clarifying the impact of reaction times on performance would also enhance the paper's presentation. Finally, addressing the similarities and differences between RTify and existing methods like ACT would strengthen the contribution of the work.
