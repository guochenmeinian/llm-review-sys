### Key Points
This paper presents SANS, a novel system for efficiently discovering the densest subgraph in relational graphs without the need for materialization. SANS employs a summary-based peeling method for estimating subgraph densities, demonstrating significant efficiency improvements over traditional methods. Theoretical analysis indicates that SANS provides a (2+$\epsilon$)-approximation for edge-density metrics, and extensive experiments validate its effectiveness across multiple real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- SANS significantly reduces computational costs by eliminating graph materialization.
- The inclusion of user-defined APIs enhances adaptability for various applications.
- The paper is well-structured and accessible, with helpful examples illustrating key concepts.

Weaknesses:
- Important content affecting reader understanding is relegated to the appendix, and some sections require more clarity and restructuring.
- The paper lacks a general approximation proof for density metrics beyond edge density and has limited evaluation against a single baseline.
- The analysis of the algorithm's performance under varying graph structures is insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the main body by relocating critical content from the appendix and enhancing explanations for theoretical analyses. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more comprehensive discussion on potential future research directions, including optimization strategies for SANS and its application to diverse graph analysis problems. Further, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the scalability of SANS with large graphs and provide detailed guidelines for selecting hyperparameters like $k$ and $\theta$ across different datasets. Lastly, addressing the impact of neighborhood summary quality on density estimation and exploring the trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency would strengthen the paper.
