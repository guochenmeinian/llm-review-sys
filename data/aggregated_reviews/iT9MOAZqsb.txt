Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new theoretical framework based on mean field theory to analyze adversarial training, focusing on aspects such as upper bounds of adversarial loss, time evolution of weight variance, and conditions for adversarial trainability. The authors conducted experiments to validate their theoretical findings, demonstrating the framework's versatility and potential applicability to other training methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-organized and easy to follow.  
- The proposed theoretical framework offers an inspiring perspective on adversarial training, potentially guiding future research.  
- The inclusion of empirical results on MNIST supports the theoretical claims.  
- The analysis highlights important insights regarding the performance of vanilla ReLU networks in adversarial training.

Weaknesses:  
1. Verification experiments were limited to the MNIST dataset; additional experiments on more challenging datasets would strengthen the findings.  
2. A more systematic evaluation of results, such as comparing adversarial loss in residual networks versus training steps, would be beneficial.  
3. Some conclusions overlap with previous works; citing relevant references in the main content would enhance credibility.  
4. The framework does not address the transfer attack phenomenon mentioned in relation to residual networks; further explanation is needed.  
5. The presentation is dense and convoluted, making it difficult to follow proofs and claims; restructuring the appendix and main paper for clarity is recommended.  
6. The discussion of empirical results is repetitive and could be consolidated for better clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the verification of their findings by conducting experiments on more challenging datasets beyond MNIST. Additionally, including a systematic evaluation of results would enhance the paper's rigor. We suggest that the authors provide citations for conclusions that align with previous works to bolster their arguments. Clarifying the transfer attack phenomenon in relation to residual networks would also be beneficial. Furthermore, we advise restructuring the paper to simplify the presentation of theoretical results and proofs, possibly by creating a separate section for key theorems to improve accessibility for readers. Lastly, consolidating discussions of empirical results would streamline the narrative and enhance comprehension.
