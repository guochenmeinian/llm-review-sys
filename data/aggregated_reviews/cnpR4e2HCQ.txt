Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents theoretical results regarding the quality of embeddings learned by random walk-based methods such as DeepWalk and its generalization, node2vec. The main finding indicates that embeddings from node2vec, with DeepWalk as a specific case, effectively preserve the community structure in graphs generated by a stochastic block model (SBM). The paper is primarily theoretical, supplemented by experimental results based on synthetic graphs from SBM. It also discusses the consistency of node2vec embeddings for community detection in degree-corrected stochastic block models (DCSBMs) using k-means clustering.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides valuable theoretical insights into a widely used embedding algorithm.
- The theoretical results are non-trivial, employing advanced proof techniques.
- The writing is clear and the paper is well-structured.

Weaknesses:
- The focus on community detection is too narrow, as node embeddings have broader applications. The discussion on node classification and link prediction is not convincing, as it still relies on community structures.
- The analysis of the p and q parameters in node2vec is insufficient. A deeper exploration of how these parameters interact with those in SBM would enhance the findings.
- Informal Theorem 1 lacks clarity regarding the graph structure and community count, making it potentially trivial under certain conditions.
- The paper does not adequately clarify how its results extend previous works, particularly regarding the asymptotic distribution of node2vec embeddings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the p and q parameters in node2vec, particularly how they relate to the parameters in SBM. A detailed examination of the interplay between these parameters would significantly enrich the paper. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide more clarity on how their results differ from those in previous works, especially [10] and [11], to better highlight the novelty of their contributions. Furthermore, addressing the misleading aspects of the experiments, particularly in Figure 3, and including error bars in Figures 1 and 2 would enhance the robustness of the findings. Lastly, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the potential for extending their results to scenarios with a growing number of communities.
