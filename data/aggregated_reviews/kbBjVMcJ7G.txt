Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of policy mirror descent (PMD) to the reinforcement learning (RL) setting, addressing the challenge of requiring an exact value function by formulating an approximate value function based on operators over transition and reward functions, leading to a closed-form solution. The authors provide theoretical analysis on convergence guarantees and error bounds while clearly stating assumptions. Experiments conducted on toy RL problems demonstrate that their algorithm outperforms typical RL baselines in these low-dimensional settings. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1) The paper is well-presented, with clear discussions on how this work relates to prior research and well-motivated key concepts.  
2) The theoretical analysis is robust, yielding promising results.  
3) The comparison to RL baselines, even in toy problems, is commendable, with encouraging results.  
4) Detailed discussions of limitations and assumptions are provided.  
5) The key results, particularly the value functions with closed-form solutions via operators, are novel and significant.  

Weaknesses:  
1) Experiments on more complex MDPs with larger state-action spaces would be beneficial to test scaling properties. While the contributions are substantial, this remains a valuable future direction.  
2) Extensions to continuous action spaces should be explored, as it seems feasible given the formulation with additional approximations.  
3) The empirical validation is limited to simple environments in OpenAI Gym, and the experimental results lack deeper interpretation and connection to theoretical results.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental validation by including more complex MDPs and continuous action spaces to assess the scalability and applicability of the proposed method. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the connection between experimental results and theoretical analysis to strengthen the overall argument. Furthermore, please ensure that all references are correctly hyperlinked and that minor typographical errors, such as the one on line 335, are corrected.
