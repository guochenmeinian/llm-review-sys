### Key Points
This paper presents a method to address the issue of spurious programs in weakly supervised semantic parsing through a filtering approach based on "denotation similarity," which is determined by how often two programs yield the same results on a set of inputs. The authors propose a clustering technique for candidate semantic parses and evaluate their method, Execution-Based Filtering, on the NLVR and WTQ datasets, demonstrating improvements in accuracy and consistency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach is interesting and well-written, effectively demonstrating improvements on NLVR and WTQ.
- The use of a voting mechanism based on program execution across various worlds is a valuable contribution.

Weaknesses:
- The gains reported in tables appear incremental, and the complexity of implementation may outweigh empirical benefits.
- The novelty of the work is questioned, particularly in relation to existing methods, and there is uncertainty about the empirical validity of the underlying intuition regarding spurious programs.
- Additional comparisons with recent advancements in the field are lacking, and some notations and presentations could be clearer.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of notations and presentations, particularly in section 4, to facilitate understanding. Additionally, we suggest including more comprehensive comparisons with methods utilizing pre-trained language models and self-consistent chain-of-thought prompting to better contextualize the effectiveness of Execution-Based Filtering. Furthermore, providing correlation statistics between a program's similarity to the majority vote and its spuriousness would strengthen the empirical foundation of the claims. Lastly, an analysis of the types of spurious programs that are more problematic and a clearer explanation of the observed phenomena at different thresholds would enhance the paper's rigor.
