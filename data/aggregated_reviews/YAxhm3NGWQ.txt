### Key Points
This paper presents a graph contrastive learning framework (GCL-IVG) that addresses varying degrees of homophily and heterophily in network structures. The authors propose a counterfactual approach to disentangle homophilic and heterophilic patterns from the original graph, generating distinct views through manipulation of a treatment factor. These views are encoded using separate graph filters before being integrated into the contrastive learning pipeline. The motivation for this approach is supported by preliminary analyses demonstrating improved clustering performance when segregating edges based on their characteristics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation is clear and the existence of heterophilic edges in real-world graph data is well acknowledged.
2. The novel use of counterfactual intervention to generate distinct views enhances the contrastive learning framework's ability to capture signals from both homophilic and heterophilic perspectives.
3. The integration with existing contrastive learning pipelines is seamless, facilitating easier adoption.

Weaknesses:
1. The counterfactual outcome relies on prior knowledge, making it subjective and potentially inapplicable in all real-world scenarios.
2. The paper lacks a complexity analysis of the proposed model, which is essential for understanding its computational demands.
3. There is insufficient comparison with additional downstream tasks, such as clustering and graph classification, to validate the model's effectiveness.
4. The experimental datasets are relatively small, and the paper does not adequately address the performance of the method on larger datasets or in supervised learning contexts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the complexity analysis of the proposed model to clarify its computational demands. Additionally, we suggest including more downstream tasks, such as clustering and graph classification, to demonstrate the model's effectiveness comprehensively. It would also be beneficial to incorporate more visualizations and case studies to analyze the two different representations obtained from the generated views. Lastly, addressing the lack of motivation in the method's design and providing clearer explanations of the treatment matrices and their use would enhance the paper's clarity and impact.
