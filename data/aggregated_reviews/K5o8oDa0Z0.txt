### Key Points
This paper presents TaCo, a two-stage model utilizing small-scale tabular language models (TaLMs) for chain-of-thought (CoT) generation and answer inference, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the TABMWP dataset. The authors propose a new paradigm for tabular mathematical reasoning and provide extensive evaluations, including ablation studies, to highlight the model's components. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces an interesting model that is parameter-efficient and performs well empirically.
- It conducts thorough experiments and ablation studies, providing valuable insights into the model's effectiveness.
- The organization of the paper effectively contextualizes the research within the broader field of tabular reasoning.

Weaknesses:
- The work appears incremental, resembling previous CoT methods applied to tabular tasks without significant novelty.
- The role of the answer inference model is questioned, with suggestions that simpler methods could achieve similar results.
- Reproducibility concerns arise due to the reliance on specific datasets and the underspecified settings of parameters.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation to enhance reader understanding. Additionally, the authors should address the significance of the answer inference model by providing case studies or algorithms that demonstrate its necessity. Expanding the discussion on computational cost in relation to accuracy would also strengthen the paper. Finally, including more benchmark datasets for cross-validation and clarifying the model's performance in scenarios lacking detailed solutions would be beneficial.
