Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Neuc-MDS, a novel extension of classical Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) designed to handle non-Euclidean and non-metric dissimilarities. The authors propose a generalization of the inner product to symmetric bilinear forms, allowing for both positive and negative eigenvalues from the dissimilarity Gram matrix. Neuc-MDS aims to minimize STRESS (sum of squared pairwise errors) through efficient eigenvalue optimization. The theoretical analysis supports the method's effectiveness, and empirical evaluations demonstrate promising results across diverse datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with clear problem definition and motivation.
- Neuc-MDS effectively extends MDS to accommodate non-Euclidean data, backed by solid theoretical analysis.
- The availability of code enhances reproducibility and practical application.

Weaknesses:
- Some foundational concepts may be overly detailed, potentially limiting space for more specific material.
- The experimental section lacks a subsection for interpreting embeddings, and embeddings are not visualized.
- The overall writing can be difficult to follow, particularly regarding the construction of the bilinear form matrix A.
- The theoretical guarantees depend on specific assumptions that may not hold in practice, and the method's computational complexity could hinder scalability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing, particularly in explaining the construction of the bilinear form matrix A. Additionally, we suggest including a subsection in the experimental section to interpret the embeddings and visualizing them for better understanding. It would also be beneficial to provide a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity and scalability of Neuc-MDS, especially for large datasets. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore strategies for handling negative distances and to compare Neuc-MDS with popular non-linear methods like t-SNE and UMAP to contextualize its performance.
