Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Active-Passive-Constraint (APC) score as a novel evaluation method for assessing and optimizing the faithfulness of AI-driven persona interactions in role-playing applications. The authors propose a fine-grained, constraint-based scoring system that significantly enhances the granularity of persona-driven role-playing (PRP) evaluations. The methodology utilizes a Natural Language Inference (NLI) model distilled from GPT-4 for consistent evaluations, validated through experiments that show a high correlation with human judgment. Additionally, the APC score serves as a preference target for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), providing new insights into improving PRP systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The method is user-friendly and quantifiable, significantly contributing to rapid iteration in the Role Playing LLM field.
2. The APC score not only assesses role-playing but also serves as an optimization target, enhancing the global faithfulness of AI characters.
3. The paper introduces Contextual Preference Optimization, refining the evaluation and optimization process.

Weaknesses:
1. The main experiment involves too few characters (only 9), raising concerns about the reliability of the conclusions.
2. The APC score relies on an NLI Discriminator with claimed 90% accuracy, but lacks details on its training and data volume, questioning its generalizability.
3. The paper does not cite similar research that focuses on enhancing role-playing effectiveness by limiting character knowledge boundaries.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental design by including a larger and more diverse set of characters to enhance the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, providing detailed information on the training and data volume for the NLI Discriminator would strengthen the claims regarding its accuracy and generalizability. We also suggest including a comparison with simpler baseline methods for evaluating PRP faithfulness to highlight the advantages of the APC scoring system. Lastly, clarifying the rationale for model selection and simplifying complex methodology explanations could enhance accessibility and reproducibility.
