### Key Points
This paper presents a new resource for French-language automated essay scoring (AES) research, consisting of a corpus of 6,569 essays across various CEFR levels from the Test de Connaissance de Fran√ßais certification exam. The authors describe the corpus's distributional statistics, criteria for essay inclusion, available metadata, and linguistic features. Baseline AES results using deep learning and feature-based machine learning methods are also provided, along with a comprehensive literature review on AES corpora.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The corpus is sizeable and of high quality, with rigorous scoring protocols and useful metadata, making it a significant resource for AES researchers focused on French.
- Baseline scoring results offer a helpful starting point for applying novel methods.
- The literature review is comprehensive and relevant.
- The paper is well-crafted, clear, and organized.

Weaknesses:
- Variability in performance between methods, particularly the high accuracy for CamemBERT with lower QWK, suggests potential majority-class bias; additional statistics on predicted distribution would be beneficial.
- The criteria for excluding essays that do not clearly exemplify a score/level represent a significant gap to consider.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by addressing the following points:
- Provide statistics on the predicted distribution to clarify the performance variability noted in Table 2.
- Consider revising the criteria for essay exclusion to address the significant gap identified in section 7 (Limitations).
- Clarify the meaning of "LE" in TCFLE-8 and whether "8" refers to eight L1 languages.
- Address the use of the term "atypical candidates" to avoid potential stigma and consider a clearer alternative.
- Expand on the statement regarding TCFLE-8's applicability to SLA studies by specifying which issues can be explored.
- Ensure that all acronyms are defined upon first use and check for consistency in terminology throughout the manuscript.
- Proofread for grammatical errors and typos, particularly in Appendix B and throughout the text, to enhance overall presentation.
