### Key Points
This paper presents a method for automating radiology reporting by integrating prior and current chest X-ray images through longitudinal representation learning. It introduces a novel training strategy called sentence-anatomy dropout, which enhances the controllability of report generation by focusing on specific anatomical regions. The authors claim improved performance on MIMIC-CXR-based datasets, demonstrating the potential for increased accuracy and clinical relevance in automated reports.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a straightforward method for utilizing prior images in radiology report generation, achieving compelling results that outperform recent baselines.
- Comprehensive ablation experiments clarify the contributions of prior data and sentence-anatomy dropout.

Weaknesses:
- The originality of the approach is questioned, as it appears to combine existing ideas rather than introducing a novel structure, raising concerns about the clarity of its contributions.
- The reported performance improvements are not substantial compared to previous work, and the fairness of comparisons against existing methods is unclear due to the use of additional inputs not available to those methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions by explicitly detailing the differences between this work and previous studies, particularly regarding performance metrics. Additionally, we suggest that the authors consider combining this paper with their prior work to provide a more comprehensive analysis and comparison against enhanced baselines. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to design experiments more effectively, particularly regarding the hallucination of missing anatomical regions, to ensure a fair evaluation of their method's performance.
