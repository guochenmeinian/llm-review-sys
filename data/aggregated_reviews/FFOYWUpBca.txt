Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Confounded-Disentanglement (C-Disentanglement) framework, which utilizes the inductive bias of confounders to recover causal generative factors from observed data. The authors propose the cdVAE method, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating meaningful latent representations, particularly under distribution shifts. The paper includes theoretical and empirical analyses, showing improved performance on various datasets compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Originality: The authors introduce a novel approach to leverage observed confounders for learning disentangled representations.
- Quality: The manuscript provides both theoretical and empirical support for its claims.
- Clarity: The inclusion of schematics and examples aids in understanding the method.
- Significance: The work addresses the timely issue of improving latent representations for domain generalization.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks engagement with recent relevant literature, particularly concerning disentanglement and auxiliary information.
- Ambiguities in notation and definitions may hinder comprehension.
- The reliance on domain expertise for defining confounders raises concerns about scalability and potential errors.
- The evaluation metrics used may not fully capture the quality of disentangled representations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by positioning their work relative to recent advancements in disentanglement that leverage auxiliary information. Clarifying the differences between confounders and auxiliary variables is essential. Additionally, addressing the strict assumptions regarding Gaussian distributions and linear mixing in their model would enhance the generalizability of their findings. Incorporating qualitative evaluations alongside quantitative metrics would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's performance. Lastly, ensuring clarity in notation and definitions throughout the paper will aid reader comprehension.
