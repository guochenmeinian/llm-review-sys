Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Blurred-Dilated method (BD), which employs BlurPools and dilated convolutions on the source model to enhance the transferability of adversarial attacks. The authors demonstrate that BD can outperform several state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and improve attack success rates when combined with existing black-box attacks. The experiments are primarily conducted on ImageNet, with a focus on preserving important features to increase transferability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is clearly written, with a detailed introduction and comprehensive reporting of model modifications in tables.
2. A wide range of experiments is conducted, addressing various concerns through comparisons with SOTA, success rates against robust models, and ablation studies.
3. The proposed method is simple and effective, as it does not introduce additional computation time compared to methods like GhostNet.

Weaknesses:
1. The experiments are limited to ImageNet, raising questions about BD's effectiveness on lower-resolution datasets like CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.
2. The method is specific to certain model components, lacking general guidelines for the "early stop" strategy and making it challenging to extend to new models. Claims about BD being a universal technique may be overstated, as it requires specific CNN layers.
3. Minor formatting issues exist, such as inconsistent citation formatting and notation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of the BD method by testing it on lower-resolution datasets like CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Additionally, we suggest providing clearer guidelines on the "early stop" strategy and addressing the limitations regarding the applicability of BD to non-CNN models. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the implications of their architectural choices, particularly regarding the application of dilated convolutions and blurred downsampling. Finally, addressing the minor formatting issues will enhance the overall presentation of the paper.
