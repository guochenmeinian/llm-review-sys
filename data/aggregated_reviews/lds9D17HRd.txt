Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method that fuses features from Stable Diffusion (SD) and DINOv2 to enhance semantic and dense correspondence tasks. The authors evaluate SD features, noting their high-quality spatial information but occasional inaccuracies in semantic matching. In contrast, DINOv2 features provide sparse yet accurate matches. By employing a simple weighted concatenation strategy, the authors achieve significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets such as SPair-71k, PF-Pascal, and TSS. The paper also demonstrates the potential for high-quality object swapping without task-specific fine-tuning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- **Extensive evaluation and analysis.** The paper includes numerous experiments and visualizations that effectively analyze the behavior of SD and DINOv2 features, presented in a well-organized manner.
- **Strong zero-shot performance.** The combination of SD and DINOv2 features leads to impressive zero-shot performance in semantic correspondence, surpassing previous task-specific methods.
- **Interesting community message.** The study highlights the rich information contained in publicly available models, which could inspire future research in semantic correspondence.

Weaknesses:
- The method's handling of outliers in correspondences is unclear, particularly given the reliance on nearest neighbor search, which may be less robust to occlusions or out-of-frame points.
- The paper lacks strong quantitative assessments to substantiate claims about the complementarity of SD and DINOv2 features.
- Missing baselines for comparison with other supervised and unsupervised methods, which could strengthen the evaluation.
- The explanation of PCA aggregation for SD features is insufficiently clear, and the evaluation resolution relative to input resolution is not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how the proposed method addresses outliers in correspondences. Additionally, a more in-depth discussion on the differing behaviors of SD and DINOv2 features would enhance the paper's strength. The authors should also consider including comparisons with missing baselines such as CATs++ and PWarpC to provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Furthermore, clarifying the PCA aggregation process and the evaluation resolution in relation to input resolution would strengthen the methodology section. Lastly, exploring the potential of other diffusion models that operate in the original pixel space could provide valuable insights into performance improvements for fine-grained details.
