Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to improving video-language understanding models, focusing on aligning described actions with video segments and modeling temporal dynamics. The authors introduce ActionBench, a modified benchmark for evaluating action antonyms and video reversal problems, and propose the Paxion framework, which includes a knowledge patcher for enhanced action encoding and a knowledge fuser for integrating this knowledge into frozen video-language models. The Discriminative Video Dynamics Modeling (DVDM) objective is also introduced to improve action recognition capabilities. Empirical results indicate that these innovations enhance performance in video-text retrieval and temporal visual question answering tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of ActionBench provides a valuable framework for probing action understanding in video-language models.
- The proposed modifications to the contrastive objective effectively enhance the model's ability to recognize action antonyms and address video reversal issues.
- Extensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity regarding the "patching data," which is only detailed in the appendix, making it difficult for readers to grasp its significance in the main text.
- The motivation for the DVDM objective is overly complex, hindering readability.
- The evaluation of downstream tasks is limited, primarily focusing on video-text retrieval and VQA, which restricts comparisons with existing methods.
- The performance on SSV2 appears low, raising questions about the effectiveness of the proposed approach in this context.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the "patching data" by including explicit definitions and relevant details in the main text and tables. Additionally, simplifying the motivation for the DVDM objective would enhance readability. To strengthen the evaluation, we suggest including comparisons with other existing methods and datasets to better contextualize the performance of the proposed approach. Finally, providing explanations for the low performance on SSV2 would help address potential concerns regarding the model's effectiveness.
