Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for pretraining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) using fragment-level strategies based on graph fragmentation. The authors utilize a frequency-based method for extracting molecular fragments and perform fragment-based contrastive and predictive tasks to jointly pretrain two GNNs on molecular and fragment graphs. The proposed models demonstrate improved performance on various molecular property prediction tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-organized and easy to follow.
2. The fragment-level contrastive pretraining framework is innovative, capturing both granular patterns and higher-order connectivity.
3. The results on the Long-range Graph Benchmark are particularly strong.
4. Comprehensive comparisons with baselines highlight the advantages of the proposed methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The technical contribution is limited, as some components, like the principle subgraph extraction module, are borrowed from existing literature.
2. Empirical performance is not robust enough, particularly in distinguishing gains over baselines.
3. The authors do not clearly state how to choose hyperparameter alpha, and the effects of vocabulary size are only explored on three datasets.
4. Missing ablation studies on the contributions of various components and loss functions in the system.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the hyperparameter selection process, particularly for alpha. Additionally, we suggest conducting ablation studies to assess the impact of the fragmentation strategy and pretraining tasks on performance. It would be beneficial to explore a wider range of vocabulary sizes and report the pertaining time for the experiments. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to compare their fragment extraction method with other motif extractors, such as those used in JT-VAE, to strengthen their claims. Lastly, addressing the writing issues and providing more detailed discussions on the limitations and design choices would enhance the overall presentation of the paper.
