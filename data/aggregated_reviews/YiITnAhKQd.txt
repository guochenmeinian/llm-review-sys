### Key Points
This paper presents a manually annotated corpus for the Somali language, contributing to the development of data resources for low-resource languages. The authors propose an information retrieval (IR) system based on this corpus, which is significant given the scarcity of Somali language resources. The corpus consists of 2,300 documents labeled by native speakers and linguists, along with a new list of stop words for Somali.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The creation of a new IR dataset for Somali addresses a critical gap in NLP resources for low-resource languages.
- The dataset was developed by native speakers and linguists, ensuring its relevance and accuracy.
- The authors provide a new list of stop words, enhancing the utility of the corpus.

Weaknesses:
- The writing style is sloppy, with numerous grammatical errors and typos that hinder comprehension.
- Important details about the corpus, such as the total number of queries, document statistics, and the set of labels used, are lacking.
- The evaluation measures for the IR system are insufficient, as standard metrics like precision and recall are not utilized.
- The corpus's copyright status is unclear, raising potential legal issues regarding the use of crawled content.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the writing style by thoroughly revising the text for grammatical accuracy and clarity, potentially with the help of a native English speaker or a tool like Grammarly. Additionally, the authors should provide complete statistics regarding the corpus, including the total number of queries and document lengths. We suggest incorporating standard evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F-measure to assess the quality of the IR system. Furthermore, the authors must clarify the copyright status of the crawled content to ensure compliance with legal requirements.
