### Key Points
We find that the paper presents Intrinsic LoRA (I-LoRA), which effectively extracts scene intrinsics such as normals, depth, albedo, and shading from various generative models. The approach utilizes Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune pre-trained models with minimal target datasets, demonstrating competitive performance across multiple generative frameworks, including GANs and diffusion models. The experiments are comprehensive, covering diverse generative models and augmentation techniques, which enrich the analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths include the practical application of I-LoRA in scenarios with limited data, thorough experimentation showcasing its capabilities, and a well-structured narrative. We also note the intriguing finding that generative networks, even autoregressive models, possess implicit knowledge about scene intrinsics, a phenomenon not previously highlighted in prior works. However, weaknesses arise from the reliance on a ground truth predictor network, which may hinder real-world applicability. Additionally, the assumption of having a few labels from pre-trained models is somewhat unrealistic, and the paper lacks clarity on the specific layer choices for applying LoRA, raising questions about the robustness of the method across different models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We suggest improving the method by clarifying the layer selection process for applying LoRA and providing insights into the robustness of I-LoRA when different layers are chosen. Additionally, we recommend addressing the reliance on a ground truth predictor network and reporting the specific label requirements to substantiate claims of data efficiency. Lastly, we question the necessity of introducing Augmented I-LoRA if it does not yield improvements and seek clarification on how I-LoRA generates scene intrinsics.
