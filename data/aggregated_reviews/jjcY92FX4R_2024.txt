Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a canonization perspective for designing frames in neural networks, mapping inputs to their canonical forms for efficient frame design. The authors establish a connection between frames and canonical forms, leading to the development of new frames for eigenvectors under Orthogonal Axis Projection (OAP) that outperform existing methods. The reduction to canonization reveals equivalences between previous methods and unifies invariant and equivariant frame averaging approaches. The work also highlights a one-to-one connection between frames over finite groups and canonization, proving the non-universality of SignNets and proposing a novel algorithm, OAP.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Theoretically describing frames through canonization is beneficial, with clear definitions and straightforward theorems.
- The primary method, OAP, effectively uses Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization to canonicalize eigenvectors and resolve basis ambiguity.
- The paper provides strong theoretical results and empirical analysis that supports the proposed architecture's higher performance.

Weaknesses:
- The overall writing lacks clarity, with limited application examples beyond the orthogonal group and eigenvector canonization.
- The empirical evaluation is weak, needing more detailed analysis and comparisons with other datasets and methods.
- Several terms and problem settings are not clearly defined, making the manuscript difficult to read.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the overall writing quality to enhance clarity and readability, particularly in defining terms and problem settings. The authors should provide more examples to justify the theorem, such as exploring canonization in the translation group or product group \(E(d) \times S_n\). Additionally, we suggest including a detailed empirical evaluation with comparisons to other methods, such as MAP + LSPE versus OAP + LSPE, and addressing the computational complexity of OAP relative to non-frame-averaging methods like GIN. Finally, please add references in the main text to the appendix for proofs and n-body experiments, and consider discussing related works to strengthen the contribution.
