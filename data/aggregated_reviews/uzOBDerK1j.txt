Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an online estimation framework addressing robust sequential estimation in non-stationary environments, where the learner observes a sequence of samples from unknown probability distributions that may be corrupted. The authors propose a clipped stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm that achieves sublinear regret bounds, even in the presence of distribution drift, heavy tails, and outliers. The loss function is strongly convex, and the paper provides theoretical results alongside empirical validation, demonstrating the algorithm's effectiveness under various conditions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors tackle an important and previously unexplored problem in online, robust, and non-stationary convex optimization.
- The proposed algorithm is simple and empirically validated, achieving tight regret bounds in several scenarios.
- The paper is generally well-written, with thorough explanations of the problem setup and prior work.

Weaknesses:
- The regret measurement could be more naturally framed in terms of excess risk, and it is unclear if results transfer to this metric.
- The necessity of diameter-dependence in stationary settings with corruptions is questionable, and a lower bound without this requirement would be beneficial.
- Claims of dimension independence may be misleading due to implicit dependence on the trace of covariance.
- The novelty of the results is uncertain, as clipped SGD is a standard approach, and the analysis could benefit from clearer exposition and additional detail in the appendix.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the regret measurement by addressing the potential transfer to excess risk. Additionally, we suggest providing a lower bound without diameter-dependence to clarify its necessity. The authors should also consider revising the claims of dimension independence to avoid misleading implications and enhance the exposition of their analysis, particularly in the appendix, to ensure correctness and comprehensibility. Furthermore, a more detailed discussion on the distinction between drift and corruption would enrich the paper's contribution.
