Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for detecting AI-generated texts by estimating the intrinsic dimensions of sequences produced by humans and language models (LLMs) using persistence homology dimension (PHD). The authors demonstrate that intrinsic dimensions differ significantly between human and machine-generated texts, with human texts exhibiting higher dimensions. They employ a logistic regression classifier based on these dimensions, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods like DetectGPT and GPTZero, and show robustness against paraphrase attacks and samples from non-native speakers.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors propose a novel method that outperforms existing AI-generated content detection techniques.
- The method is straightforward and likely to engage researchers in related fields.
- The robustness of the method against paraphrase attacks enhances its relevance.

Weaknesses:
- The analysis lacks depth; particularly, the performance of the single-feature classifier in relation to dataset size and noisy datasets needs further exploration.
- Table 1 could be expanded to include additional approaches to intrinsic dimension estimation, providing a clearer comparison across methods.
- The paper does not adequately discuss the implications of the PHD-based detector's performance relative to other classifiers, particularly in the context of paraphrasers.
- Some vague statements in the discussion require clarification, especially regarding the robustness of the PHD classifier across domains and models.
- The absence of a detailed description of the new dataset limits the understanding of its contribution.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis by exploring how the classifier's performance varies with dataset size and noise levels. Additionally, we suggest extending Table 1 to include results from other intrinsic dimension estimation methods for better comparative insights. The authors should clarify their inferences regarding the effectiveness of the PHD-based detector compared to other classifiers, particularly in the presence of paraphrasers, and provide statistical tests to support their claims. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to refine vague statements about the robustness of the PHD classifier and to include a detailed description of the new dataset, including its statistics and curation process, in the paper.
