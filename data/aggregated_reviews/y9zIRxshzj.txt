Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new causal model where individual events of the cause variable trigger events of the effect variable with dynamic delays. The authors propose a cause-effect matching approach to learn a fully directed acyclic graph, named the CASCADE algorithm, which performs a topological search on observational data. The article also employs the Algorithmic Markov Condition alongside Kolmogorov complexity for causal discovery from event sequences, focusing on distinguishing instantaneous and delayed effects. The CASCADE algorithm is evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces a comprehensive theory and algorithm, validated through extensive experiments with real data.  
- It employs Pearl's causality model innovatively, diverging from traditional Granger causality, and presents a well-defined logic and substantiated proofs.  
- The theoretical foundation based on the AMC and MDL principle is solid, and the algorithm is well-organized with clear explanations.

Weaknesses:  
- The direct matching between cause and effect events limits the model's applicability, as it does not accommodate scenarios where a single event causes multiple effects or multiple events jointly cause a single effect.  
- The experimentation section lacks depth, particularly regarding the robustness of the model under real-world conditions and the implications of restrictive assumptions.  
- The paper does not adequately address scalability and computational complexity, particularly for large datasets, and lacks discussion on parameter sensitivity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the implications of their assumptions, particularly regarding the direct matching between cause and effect events, and explore potential ways to address these limitations. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the experimentation section to evaluate the robustness of the CASCADE algorithm under challenging real-world conditions, including scenarios with multiple colliders. It would also be beneficial to provide a more detailed analysis of the algorithm's scalability and computational complexity, especially concerning large datasets. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the sensitivity of the CASCADE algorithm to the choice of parameters for the delay distribution and cause probability.
