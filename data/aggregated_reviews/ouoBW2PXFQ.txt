Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CALANet, an all-layer aggregation network aimed at enhancing the accuracy of human activity recognition (HAR) while ensuring low computational costs for real-time applications on edge devices. The authors argue that traditional CNN models for HAR often underperform due to reliance on features from only the last layer. CALANet aggregates features from all layers, theoretically proving that its computational cost aligns with conventional CNNs. Empirical results across seven datasets demonstrate that CALANet outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The topic of sensor-based HAR is significant and relevant to the ML community.
2. The authors provide theoretical proofs regarding complexity, enhancing the paper's credibility.
3. Evaluation on seven datasets offers comprehensive results, showcasing both efficiency and effectiveness.
4. The discussion of future studies adds depth to the manuscript.

Weaknesses:
1. The choice of baseline models is questionable; more advanced models from leading conferences should be considered to justify CALANet's advantages.
2. The rationale for selecting CNNs over other architectures is insufficiently supported.
3. Dataset partitioning lacks consistency, with varying splits across datasets.
4. The manuscript would benefit from additional references to support claims made in the text.
5. The related work section lacks discussion on accelerating CNNs, a well-studied topic.
6. Writing clarity can be improved, particularly in Table 1 and Figure 2, which require better organization for reader comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the selection of baseline models by reviewing advanced works from AAAI, IMWUT, Sensys, and Mobicom to enhance the justification of CALANet's performance. Additionally, the authors should clarify their choice of CNNs and consider discussing the applicability of CALANet to other architectures. Consistent dataset partitioning should be established, and more references should be added to strengthen arguments throughout the manuscript. We suggest revising the related work section to include discussions on CNN acceleration and improving writing clarity, particularly in Table 1 and Figure 2, for better reader understanding.
