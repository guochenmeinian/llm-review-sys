Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on offline subtask discovery from a causal perspective, defining subtasks as selections to address long-horizon tasks and facilitate transferable skills. The authors propose a matrix factorization-based algorithm, seq-NMF, to learn subgoals and extract subtasks, demonstrating strong performance in transferring to new tasks. The paper emphasizes the interpretability of subtasks and validates the proposed theory through experiments on unseen long-horizon manipulation tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The causal-graph-based algorithm design is well-motivated and theoretically solid.
- The paper is well-written, with an elegant presentation that is easy to follow.
- The formal definition of subtasks addresses interpretability challenges not previously discussed in the literature.
- The proposed method shows superior performance in both quantitative and qualitative studies.

Weaknesses:
- The Kitchen benchmark, while challenging, consists of tasks with clear subtask structures, making subtask discovery relatively straightforward. Demonstrating the algorithm's capability in less structured tasks would be beneficial.
- The focus on multi-task learning is limited to different compositions of the same set of subtasks, suggesting a need for exploration of more generalized multi-task learning scenarios.
- The reliance on state sequences for subgoal extraction raises concerns about applicability in real-world settings where states may not be available, necessitating exploration of various modalities like visual perception.
- Some parts of the paper lack clarity, particularly the mathematical objective in Equation (1), which could benefit from clearer notation definitions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the mathematical objective in Equation (1) by defining notations earlier in the paper. Additionally, we suggest demonstrating the subtask discovery capability of the proposed algorithm in tasks lacking clearly defined subtask structures. Exploring the applicability of the proposed theory to real-world scenarios with various modalities, such as visual perception, would also enhance the paper's impact. Finally, expanding the discussion on generalized multi-task learning could provide valuable insights for future research directions.
