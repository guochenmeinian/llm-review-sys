Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of the relationship between data noise and model simplicity, particularly focusing on decision trees and linear models. The authors demonstrate that noise acts as an implicit regularizer, leading to simpler models being favored in noisy datasets compared to clean ones. They reveal that noise expands the set of "good" features and increases the number of models utilizing at least one good feature. The research provides both theoretical assurances and practical insights regarding the likelihood of simple yet accurate machine learning models, contingent on the noise levels in data generation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a deep theoretical analysis of how noise influences model complexity, particularly its regularization effects and implications for simpler model selection, enhancing the understanding of the Rashomon effect.
- The theoretical results are robust, well-presented, and supported by empirical evidence, making the insights applicable to real-world machine learning scenarios.

Weaknesses:
- The paper tends to overemphasize the novelty of the connection between regularization and noise, which is well-established in prior work. The authors should clarify their unique contributions, particularly regarding the Rashomon set.
- The experimental section is limited, focusing on simple model types and datasets. A broader experimental panel, especially with more complex models, would strengthen the evaluation.
- The reliance on assumptions like uniform random label noise may not reflect real-world conditions. A more explicit discussion of these limitations would enhance understanding of the results' applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions by distinguishing their findings from established literature, particularly in the context of the Rashomon effect. Expanding the experimental section to include more complex models and datasets would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of their claims. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explicitly discuss the limitations of their assumptions, such as uniform random label noise, to better contextualize their results.
