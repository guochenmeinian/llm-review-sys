Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an empirical study on deep neural networks, focusing on the "tunnel effect," where early layers create linearly separable representations while later layers compress these representations for output. The authors investigate how this effect influences transfer learning and catastrophic forgetting, demonstrating that the linearly separable representation emerges at a depth that is a fraction of the total depth, typically between 1/3 and 2/3. The study includes a variety of benchmark datasets and architectures, providing clear visual results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper offers a thorough empirical study with extensive experiments across different models and datasets, effectively illustrating the tunnel effect.  
- The connection between the tunnel effect and practical implications for transfer learning is a notable contribution.  
- The experiments are well-organized, and the results are presented clearly.

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty of the findings is questionable, as the emergence of linearly separable representations before the final layer has been previously documented.  
- The motivation behind the paradox discussed in the introduction is unclear, and the authors do not adequately clarify how their work addresses this paradox.  
- The procedure for computing numerical rank lacks detail, and some figures do not provide sufficient context for interpretation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation paragraph in the introduction and explicitly state how the paradox has been addressed in the conclusion. Additionally, the authors should provide a comprehensive explanation of the numerical rank computation, including the threshold value $\sigma$, and ensure that figures, particularly Figure 6, include necessary shading for clarity. A comparison of the timing of the tunneling effect relative to training and test losses would enhance the assessment of the claims made in Section 3.1. Lastly, discussing the role of skip connections in relation to the tunnel effect could enrich the analysis presented in the paper.
