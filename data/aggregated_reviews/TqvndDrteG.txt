### Key Points
This paper presents a new model that addresses the limitations of Gaussian Processes (GPs) in handling non-Gaussian errors, heteroscedastic noise, and outliers, while maintaining flexibility and accurate uncertainty quantification. The authors propose future directions for research, including numerical experiments tailored to specific settings and Bayesian Optimization (BO) experiments, particularly in transfer BO contexts. The theoretical analysis is compelling, and the approach is deemed sensible despite being in an early stage with no results yet.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles a compelling problem and offers a strong and original contribution.
- Clear writing and compelling proofs enhance the paper's readability and impact.
- The proposed method effectively overcomes GPs' cubic scaling issues.

Weaknesses:
- The project is early-stage, lacking results, which is acceptable for a workshop setting.
- Uncertainty exists regarding the applicability of the proofs in realistic scenarios.
- The exposition of the IterRCGP algorithm is somewhat rushed, and the importance of hyperparameters like noise variance and lengthscale is unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the exposition of the IterRCGP algorithm by clearly outlining its motivation and implementation details. It would be beneficial to address how noise variance and lengthscale hyperparameters will be estimated and integrated into the algorithm to avoid potential numerical issues. Additionally, we suggest that the authors implement the procedure on a small toy problem to demonstrate its effectiveness visually. Clarifying the sensitivity of IterGP's posterior mean to outliers and confirming the efficiency of the implementation would also strengthen the paper. Finally, we encourage the authors to explain their choice of a hybrid model combining IterGP and RCGP over other methods for handling heavy-tailed noise.
