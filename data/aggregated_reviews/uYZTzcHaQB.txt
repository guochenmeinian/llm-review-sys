Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a motif-oriented influence maximization (MOIM) problem under the linear threshold model, focusing on motifs—strongly connected subgraphs—rather than individual nodes for viral marketing. The authors propose an algorithm that optimizes the influence function by establishing submodular upper and lower bounds, aiming to maximize activated motifs. The NP-hardness of the problem is demonstrated, and extensive experiments validate the algorithm's effectiveness across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. Novel Problem Definition: The paper introduces a new perspective by targeting motifs, which adds significant value to influence maximization in real-world scenarios.  
2. Algorithmic Contribution: The proposed algorithm leverages submodular properties, providing an approximation solution with a guaranteed ratio, which is a notable advancement in the field.  
3. Well-structured Presentation: The paper is well-written, with a clear problem definition and rigorous theoretical derivations, enhancing understanding of the contributions.  

Weaknesses:  
1. Unclear Motif Definition Rationale: The rationale for defining motifs as strongly connected groups is insufficiently justified, leading to potential confusion.  
2. Lack of Approximation Hardness Result: The absence of an approximation hardness result limits understanding of the algorithm's performance limits.  
3. Limited Real-World Applicability: The assumptions regarding motif activation may not align with real-world dynamics, and the problem is constrained to a few fixed propagation models.  
4. Minor Writing Issues: There are minor writing issues, such as text sequence problems and the need for intuitive explanations for proofs.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the rationale behind defining motifs as strongly connected groups, possibly by including theoretical advantages or references to similar definitions in existing literature. Additionally, the authors should consider providing an approximation hardness result to clarify the performance limits of their algorithm. Including experiments that demonstrate performance changes with varying motif sizes would enhance insights into scalability. We also suggest addressing the assumptions made for motif activation and exploring the adaptability of the method to dynamic networks. Lastly, providing clearer explanations for the proofs and ensuring that the abstract and relevant sections are self-contained would strengthen the paper.
