Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the concept of private everlasting prediction, which allows for responding to an unlimited sequence of queries while preserving privacy for both training data and queries. The authors explore the PAC learnability problem within this framework and demonstrate that the sample complexity scales quadratically with the VC dimension through a generic construction called GenericBBL. The work also provides a formal framework for everlasting prediction and a comprehensive privacy analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors formulate a novel theoretical concept of private everlasting prediction, extending the single query model with practical relevance.
2. The paper proves significant theoretical properties, including the necessity for hypotheses to evolve over time and the quadratic scaling of sample complexity with VC dimension, marking an improvement over existing private learning methods.
3. The writing is clear and accessible, enhancing comprehension of complex ideas.

Weaknesses:
1. The algorithm GenericBBL has a constant $\tau>1.1\times 10^{10}$, which seems excessively large; a smaller constant may be preferable.
2. The algorithm lacks computational efficiency, limiting its practical applicability.
3. The paper does not provide empirical evaluations or comparisons with existing methods, making it difficult to assess the proposed approach's real-world utility.
4. The supplementary materials contain redundant information, detracting from the main paper's clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the computational efficiency of the GenericBBL algorithm to enhance its practical applicability. Additionally, providing a brief overview of the proof ideas for Theorem 5.1 would clarify complex arguments. The authors should also consider including empirical evaluations and comparisons with existing methods to substantiate the effectiveness and robustness of their proposed private everlasting predictor. Furthermore, we suggest revising the supplementary materials to eliminate redundancy and improve overall coherence.
