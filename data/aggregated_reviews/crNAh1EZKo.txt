Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an online allocation problem aimed at achieving \(\alpha\)-fair solutions through an algorithm that provides a constant approximate regret. The authors propose an efficient online resource allocation policy called OFA (Online Fair Allocation) that minimizes regret for the aggregate utilities of agents over multiple rounds. The study includes a non-tight lower bound that improves upon previous results and compares the proposed algorithm with existing approaches using synthetic and real data in fair caching and scheduling contexts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and addresses an important problem with real-life applications.
- It employs technically sound methods, including a clever reduction to online linear optimization and a bootstrapping technique for proving regret bounds.
- The treatment of the problem is fairly complete, and the comparison with previous work is clear, highlighting improvements and technical innovations.

Weaknesses:
- The upper and lower bounds provided are not tight, and the lower bound only slightly improves upon prior results.
- Some experimental results lack clarity and do not convincingly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm, particularly in real-world datasets.
- There are inconsistencies in the algorithm description, specifically regarding the division of \(x_i(t-1)\) by \(R_i(t-1)\) versus \(R_i(t-2)\).
- The motivation for using the concave \(\alpha\)-fair utility function is not strongly articulated, and the relevance of examining \(\alpha > 1\) is unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their experimental results by providing intuitive explanations for the observed performance, particularly regarding the algorithm's behavior with smaller values of \(\alpha\). Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the inconsistencies in the algorithm description and provide a more robust discussion on the implications of using the \(\alpha\)-fair utility function. It would also be beneficial to highlight the technical novelty of their contributions more explicitly and address how their techniques might generalize beyond the specific choice of the \(\alpha\)-fair utility function.
