Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Neural k-Opt (NeuOpt), a learning-to-search (L2S) solver designed for routing problems, which factorizes k-opt exchanges into simpler operations. The authors propose a Guided Infeasible Region Exploration (GIRE) scheme to enhance exploration of both feasible and infeasible regions. NeuOpt can be integrated into divide-and-conquer frameworks for large-scale Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) and is evaluated on TSP and CVRP problems with up to 100 nodes. The results show slight improvements over other learning-based methods but underperform against traditional solvers like HGS and LKH3. The authors highlight advantages such as end-to-end training capabilities, improved batch training/inference through GPU utilization, and reduced dependency on pre-existing solvers. However, the results lack significance, particularly regarding solving speed.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with clear delivery of key ideas and an impressive literature review.
- The action factorization method is novel, allowing flexibility in choosing k for k-opt exchanges.
- NeuOpt's integration into divide-and-conquer frameworks offers significant benefits, including parallelization and reduced run time.
- GIRE is a promising contribution that aids in escaping local optima and enhances exploration, with its ability to explore infeasible regions being a notable advancement in search methodologies.
- Comprehensive empirical comparisons with baseline methods are provided.

Weaknesses:
- NeuOpt's performance is only slightly better than other learning-based methods and does not outperform traditional solvers.
- The solving speed is notably slow, raising concerns about practical applicability.
- The complexity of the method may hinder reproducibility, especially since the code is not provided.
- There is a lack of analysis regarding the source of performance improvements and comparisons with original k-opt methods.
- The paper could provide more detailed evaluations of GIRE's application to various constraints, and some aspects of GIRE's feasibility analysis may require further elaboration.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Figure 1 to better convey the proposed method's ideas. Additionally, we suggest including a detailed analysis of performance sources and conducting comparisons between original k-opt and NeuOpt. To enhance reproducibility, providing the code would be beneficial. We also encourage the authors to evaluate NeuOpt on larger problem sizes and consider generalization capabilities. Furthermore, we recommend improving the discussion on GIRE's application to other constraints and providing additional evaluations to solidify its feasibility. Specifically, consider implementing the suggested adaptations for feature supplementation and reward shaping more comprehensively. Finally, enhancing the analysis of GIRE's performance metrics and the impact of entropy measures would provide deeper insights into its effectiveness.
