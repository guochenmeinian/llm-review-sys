### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to word-pair metaphor detection, leveraging Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT) to model attribute similarities between source and target concepts. The authors propose a Siamese neural network to generate attribute vectors and utilize contrastive learning to address domain inconsistencies. The method demonstrates state-of-the-art results across three datasets, supported by comprehensive experiments and an effective ablation study.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method introduces a new loss function that incorporates attribute similarity, enhancing metaphor detection performance.
- The paper is well-written and organized, with clear experimental results and thorough analysis.
- The use of ChatGPT for comparison and the comprehensive nature of the experiments are commendable.

Weaknesses:
- The computational complexity of the proposed method is not demonstrated, which is critical given the time-consuming nature of graph construction and learning.
- The experimental settings lack clarity, particularly regarding the prompts used for ChatGPT and the dataset construction process.
- There are gaps in analyzing the impact of attribute graph quality and the appropriateness of token-level methods for word-pair detection.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental settings by detailing the prompts used for ChatGPT and providing an example of the sampling process in Section 4.2.1. Additionally, the authors should address the computational complexity of their method and analyze the impact of the quality of the attribute graphs. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the rationale behind using token-level methods for word-pair metaphor detection, especially in light of the results presented in Table 2.
