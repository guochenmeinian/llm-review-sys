Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a structure-free graph condensation paradigm, SFGC, which distills large-scale graphs into a small-scale node set without explicit graph structures. The method encodes topology into node attributes, allowing the condensed graph-free data to substitute the original graph for training GNNs while achieving comparable performance. The approach employs a parameter matching schema under imitation learning and a dynamic evaluation schema using a GNTK score. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The originality of the structure-free condensation paradigm, which encodes graph structure into node attributes, is a significant contribution that may inspire future research.  
- The clarity of the paper is commendable, with well-defined concepts and sound descriptions of contributions and techniques.  
- The experimental results demonstrate good generalization across different GNN architectures, supporting the claims made.

Weaknesses:  
- Technical details regarding the selection of condensation ratios and the handling of condensed graph labels are insufficiently explained.  
- The paper lacks a clear motivation for the necessity of reducing graph sizes without explicit structures.  
- There is a need for a more thorough discussion of limitations and potential future directions, as well as a clearer presentation of hyper-parameter details.  
- The reproducibility of results is hindered by the absence of source code.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of how condensation ratios are determined for datasets like Cora and Citeseer, and clarify the generation of condensed graph labels based on the original graph's classes. Additionally, the authors should provide more details on whether student and teacher steps are empirical hyperparameters or learnable parameters. A more comprehensive discussion of experimental findings, particularly regarding the generalization ability of the synthesized graph-free data, would enhance the paper. Furthermore, including a discussion on the practical applications of SFGC, such as in neural architecture search or adversarial robustness, would strengthen the paper's significance. Lastly, a complexity analysis comparing GCN and GNTK concerning the number of nodes should be included to provide deeper insights into the proposed method's efficiency.
