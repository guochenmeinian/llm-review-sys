Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents UniGuide, a unified framework for geometry-conditioned molecular generation using unconditional diffusion models. The authors propose that UniGuide maps conditions to the configuration space, addressing adaptability issues in existing molecular diffusion models by offering a training-free approach through a condition map that aligns complex geometric conditions with the diffusion model's configuration space, facilitating self-guidance during generation. UniGuide is characterized as a self-guiding and gradient-based method that does not require additional networks for guidance. The framework is evaluated across various drug discovery tasks, including structure-based, fragment-based, and ligand-based drug design, demonstrating effectiveness comparable to or superior to specialized models, particularly in maintaining equivariance and integrating geometric conditions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a novel, training-free method for guiding diffusion models based on expected geometry conditions, enhancing adaptability without additional training overhead.
2. UniGuide effectively maps conditions to the configuration space, simplifying gradient signal computation and enhancing flexibility.
3. Extensive evaluation across multiple drug discovery tasks showcases the framework's effectiveness, with empirical results demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The contribution and generalizability of UniGuide are somewhat overstated; the focus on geometry-aware conditions requires clarification in the introduction and figures to enhance accuracy.
2. The distinction between UniGuide and validity guidance could be more clearly articulated, particularly regarding implementation differences.
3. The presentation of results in tables may mislead by highlighting "diffusion-based approaches" without adequately contrasting them with non-diffusion baselines.
4. Important baselines, such as DecompDiff and IPDiff for SBDD tasks, are missing, raising concerns about the competitiveness of UniGuide in downstream tasks.
5. Some reviewers noted potential instabilities in gradient calculations related to surface definitions in existing methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the contribution by explicitly distinguishing UniGuide's novel aspects from existing gradient-based guidance methods. Additionally, the authors should clarify the differences between UniGuide and validity guidance, particularly in terms of implementation specifics. We also suggest reconsidering the presentation style in tables to accurately reflect performance comparisons and including missing baselines in the evaluation to strengthen the paper's claims. Furthermore, addressing the concerns regarding potential instabilities in gradient calculations and providing additional details on the training process, particularly regarding the conditioning for different tasks, would enhance understanding of the framework's generalizability.
