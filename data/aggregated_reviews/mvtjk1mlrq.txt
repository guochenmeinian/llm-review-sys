### Key Points
This paper presents a novel technique called Knowledge Rumination, aimed at enhancing the performance of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks without relying on external knowledge sources. The authors propose to elicit latent knowledge from PLMs using task-guided prompting and inject it back into the feed-forward network for knowledge consolidation. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach effectively improves performance on various commonsense reasoning tasks and benchmark datasets, indicating a better utilization of the knowledge embedded within PLMs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The introduction of Knowledge Rumination offers a fresh perspective on leveraging latent knowledge within PLMs.  
- The method is model agnostic, applicable to various PLMs, including RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-3.  
- Comprehensive experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed approach across multiple tasks.  
- The technique shows promise in improving performance without the need for external knowledge bases.

Weaknesses:  
- The performance improvements may not be statistically significant, necessitating a significance test to validate the results.  
- The approach heavily relies on task-guided prompting, which may require manual tuning for different applications.  
- The application of the technique to GPT-3.5 lacks a solid theoretical justification, as it does not output soft hidden states suitable for back-propagation.  
- The paper does not adequately address the impact of knowledge reflection on different types of pre-training models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical justification for applying Knowledge Rumination to the GLUE benchmark, particularly since it does not explicitly focus on entity knowledge. Additionally, we suggest conducting significance tests to validate the observed performance improvements across tasks. The authors should also explore the generalizability of the Knowledge Rumination approach by testing its applicability on a broader range of NLP tasks. Furthermore, we advise citing and comparing the work with related studies, such as the least-to-most prompting approach by Zhou et al. (2022), and consider conducting experiments on open-sourced causal LMs like OPT or LLaMA to address limitations with closed-source models.
