Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the convergence of probability distributions learned by diffusion models, particularly when the data distribution exhibits low-dimensional structures. The authors propose improvements over previous work by achieving a convergence rate that logarithmically depends on the ambient dimension and polynomially on the intrinsic dimension. They demonstrate that the DDPM sampler can adapt to low-dimensional structures, leading to a convergence rate of \(O(k^2/\sqrt{T})\), where \(k\) is the intrinsic dimension and \(T\) is the number of steps.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors consider a general low-dimensional structure defined by the covering number of the support, not limited to k-dimensional manifolds.
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it accessible to readers.

Weaknesses:
- The assumption of bounded support for the data distribution is overly restrictive compared to previous works, which consider bounded second moments.
- The argument regarding the uniqueness of coefficients leading to dimension-independent discretization error lacks convincing evidence, as it only establishes a lower bound on the error for one denoising step.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generality of their results by relaxing the assumption of bounded support or justifying its necessity. Additionally, we suggest providing empirical demonstrations to support the theoretical claims, particularly regarding the performance of the proposed coefficient design. It would also be beneficial to include a discussion on why earlier approaches yield dimension-dependent errors and to clarify the intuition behind the chosen step sizes in the analysis.
