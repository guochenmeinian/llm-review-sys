Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on integrating learning-augmented frameworks into priority queue design, focusing on enhancing worst-case performance through potentially inaccurate predictions. The authors explore three prediction models—dirty comparisons, pointer predictions, and rank predictions—applied to priority queues based on skip lists for sorting and Dijkstra algorithms. The research demonstrates the effectiveness of these models in optimizing priority queue operations and establishes the optimality of the proposed solutions while discussing potential real-world applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The mathematical proof process is rigorous, enhancing the paper's credibility.
- The proposed methods significantly reduce data item comparisons during basic operations in priority queues, attracting interest from related fields.
- The problem is well-motivated, addressing limitations of traditional priority queues.
- The authors provide sound justifications for their prediction models and demonstrate improvements over classical algorithms.

Weaknesses:
- Writing quality suffers from poor logical flow, lengthy sentences, and dense concepts lacking adequate explanation.
- The paper lacks a detailed motivation overview and does not sufficiently summarize innovations or experimental results.
- It depends heavily on prior work, requiring readers to have background knowledge, and lacks innovative aspects compared to previous studies.
- The experimental section is inadequately explained, with significant issues in the setup and metrics used for evaluation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the logical flow and transitions in the writing, particularly by elaborating on the limitations of traditional priority queues before introducing the learning-enhanced framework. Additionally, the authors should simplify lengthy sentences and provide clearer explanations for dense concepts, possibly relocating detailed application examples to the "Background" section. 

We suggest including a comparative table in the results section to clarify the improvements of the learning-augmented algorithms over traditional bounds. The authors should also provide more context for the experimental settings and ensure that key variables are formally defined. It is essential to include error metrics for the prediction models and compare various methods regarding execution time and memory usage. Lastly, we recommend addressing the claims about advantages under adversarial insertion orders with appropriate experimental validation.
