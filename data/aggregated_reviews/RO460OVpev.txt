### Key Points
This paper presents a method for identifying metaphors by reformulating the task as a relation extraction problem. The authors propose a new dataset for Chinese metaphorical relation extraction, which includes a fine-grained annotation scheme for identifying source and target spans of metaphors. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on their constructed benchmark compared to baseline models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a new dataset for Chinese metaphor relation extraction is a significant contribution.
- The fine-grained characterization of metaphors in the annotation scheme is reasonable and useful.
- The proposed approach outperforms pipeline-based methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of joint modeling for span prediction and metaphor relation identification.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental settings are not solid, with some aspects being unreasonable, leading to unconvincing results.
- The baseline model lacks strength, and the dataset appears small and imbalanced in terms of metaphor types.
- The annotation scheme is unclear, and the span enumeration may be expensive, complicating the model's scalability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the annotation scheme by providing examples and a detailed explanation of the consistency and inter-annotator agreement procedures. Additionally, the authors should address the potential limitations of the identified metaphorical relations and discuss the dataset's size and balance. We also suggest clarifying the model description, particularly regarding the assumptions in equation 8 and the handling of trigger words. Finally, enhancing the experimental design and baseline model strength would strengthen the paper's overall impact.
