### Key Points
This paper presents the Rubik’s cube convolution operator, designed to model high-order channel-wise interactions efficiently. The operator employs a spatial-shifting mechanism across channel-wise groups, resulting in zero FLOPs and zero parameters while utilizing only point-wise convolution and dot-product operations. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in various tasks, including image denoising, low-light image enhancement, guided image super-resolution, and image de-blurring.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The concept of Rubik’s cube convolution is reasonable and represents a promising advancement in modeling high-order channel dimension information.
2. The design is simple, efficient, and easy to implement, relying solely on shift, dot-product, and point-wise convolution.
3. The paper is well-written, with extensive analyses and convincing illustrations of the proposed methods.
4. Comprehensive results and ablation studies showcase the superiority of the proposed method.
5. Supplementary materials provide additional experiments, reinforcing the effectiveness of the Rubik’s cube convolution.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper does not provide FLOPs for the Rubik’s cube convolution, which may be significant due to the numerous dot-products involved.
2. Despite the spatial-shifting mechanism being zero-FLOP and zero-parameter, it may introduce high latency, potentially limiting practical applications.
3. Performance gains are marginal, particularly in low-light enhancement and deblurring tasks, suggesting a need for more robust components.
4. The experiments utilize outdated methods, and comparisons with state-of-the-art techniques are lacking.
5. The experimental results on GaoFen2 are inconsistent with other findings, raising concerns about reliability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity on the differences between Rubik’s cube convolution and g^nConv. Additionally, the authors should provide FLOPs and inference time data to substantiate claims of efficiency. To enhance performance, consider integrating more robust components tailored for specific tasks and conducting additional experiments to significantly reduce parameters while maintaining or improving performance. Finally, we suggest validating the effectiveness of Rubik’s cube convolution against the best current methods to strengthen the reliability of the results.
