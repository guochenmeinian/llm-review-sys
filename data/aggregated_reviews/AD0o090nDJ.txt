### Key Points
This paper presents a generalization of the left-corner transformation, termed the Generalized Left-Corner Transformation (GLCT), which effectively removes left recursion while producing bijectively equivalent grammars. The authors provide proofs confirming the properties of GLCT and explore its relationship with the Selective Left-Corner Transformation (SLCT), demonstrating that SLCT is a special case of GLCT. Empirical results indicate that GLCT yields smaller grammars than SLCT across multiple languages.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers an elegant generalization of left-corner parsing, contributing significantly to the parsing, formal grammar, and machine learning communities.
- It is well-written and accessible, demonstrating a strong grasp of the relevant literature.
- The empirical evaluation shows that GLCT produces smaller grammars than SLCT, with better properties across diverse datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The scope may not align perfectly with typical EMNLP papers, leaning more towards a mathematical formal language conference.
- The empirical results are limited, primarily focusing on a single grammar, which raises questions about the generalizability of the findings.
- The mathematical contributions, while interesting, may be viewed as incremental from a pure mathematics perspective.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the formal definition of the condition on \(\vec{\Gamma}\) for clarity. Additionally, it would be beneficial to provide insights into how the efficiency gains relate to specific grammar properties, potentially by analyzing grammars extracted from treebanks with varying annotation schemes. To enhance the empirical evaluation, we suggest including performance measurements on the ATIS grammar and standard parsing algorithms to demonstrate the significance of the speedup achieved. Lastly, consider expanding the empirical analysis to include comparisons with other existing PCFGs to strengthen the paper's contributions.
