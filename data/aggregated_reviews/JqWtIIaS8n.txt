Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents LithoBench, a new dataset and benchmark for training and evaluating deep learning-based lithography simulation and mask optimization. The dataset consists of over 120,000 tiles derived from real circuit designs and synthesized layouts, potentially establishing a standard for future DNN-based ILT evaluations. The authors clarify that their benchmark groups—MetalSet, ViaSet, StdMetal, and StdContact—are designed with similar critical dimensions and pitches, ensuring that technology node differences do not compromise the dataset's quality. They assert that existing DNN-based ILT benchmarks are lacking in quality, making LithoBench a significant contribution to the field. The authors also provide metrics for assessing model performance and insights from testing various recent methods against the benchmark, while addressing concerns regarding the dataset's applicability to full-chip designs by emphasizing that tile-based data is sufficient for effective benchmarking in semiconductor foundries.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Addresses the need for rigorous benchmarks in deep learning-based lithography with diverse, realistic data.
- LithoBench is the first large-scale lithography dataset built from real-world designs, enhancing its relevance for DNN-based applications.
- Includes both lithography simulation and mask optimization tasks, providing a comprehensive suite for lithography applications.
- The dataset is openly available, promoting further research in the semiconductor industry.
- The authors effectively address reviewer concerns, improving clarity and depth in their responses.

Weaknesses:
- Different sets (metal, via, stdmetal, stdvia) appear to use inconsistent tech nodes, which may hinder node-specific conclusions.
- The paper lacks a clear comparison with existing datasets, raising questions about its novelty and significance.
- There are potential ambiguities regarding the definition of "full-chip" data, which may limit perceived applicability.
- Concerns about information leakage between training and testing datasets could be further clarified.
- The absence of full-chip scale data limits the dataset's applicability for real-world DNN-based ILT methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by explicitly summarizing all prior benchmarks and datasets related to ILT in the paper. Additionally, the authors should clarify the tech nodes used across different sets to ensure consistency. It would be beneficial to elaborate on why the dataset is representative and comprehensive enough for fair benchmarking. We also suggest including a dedicated related work section to compare LithoBench with existing datasets like ICCAD-13 and GAN-OPC. Lastly, to address concerns about information leakage, we recommend including more detailed explanations in Section 3.1.1 regarding the random generation of tiles and the implications of shared design rules. Discussing the limitations of the dataset, particularly regarding the absence of full-chip data, would enhance the paper's depth and context.
