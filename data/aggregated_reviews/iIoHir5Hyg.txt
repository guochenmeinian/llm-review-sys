### Key Points
This paper presents a generator-agnostic knowledge pre-selection method called GATE for knowledge-grounded dialogue systems. The authors propose a unified approach to knowledge selection that improves response generation by selecting context-related knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate GATE's superiority in knowledge selection accuracy and response quality across two datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed knowledge pre-selection method addresses a critical area in knowledge-grounded dialogue, particularly relevant for large language models (LLMs).
- The experimental design is detailed and well-structured, showcasing GATE's effectiveness in enhancing response generation.
- The ability to handle both structured and unstructured knowledge bases is a notable contribution.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks sufficient implementation details, hindering reproducibility.
- Claims regarding the novelty of pre-selection methods are inaccurate, as prior work exists in this domain.
- Clarifications are needed on several aspects, including keyword extraction, reward signal differences, and the evaluation process.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the implementation details, including hyperparameters and training processes, to facilitate reproducibility. Additionally, a more thorough discussion of the limitations and future directions of GATE is necessary. The authors should clarify the extraction of keywords from conversation history and the differences between reward signals R_node and R_gold. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to explain how the method accommodates variable numbers of knowledge sentences and to discuss why pre-selection is superior to post-selection. Lastly, addressing the inconsistency in Table 4 regarding the keyword "2008" and correcting any typographical errors would enhance the paper's clarity.
