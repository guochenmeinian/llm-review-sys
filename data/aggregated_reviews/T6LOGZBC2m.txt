### Key Points
This paper presents OPERA, a novel algorithm for offline policy evaluation (OPE) that adaptively combines multiple estimators to minimize mean squared error (MSE). The authors leverage bootstrapping to estimate MSE, enhancing the accuracy of policy evaluations without requiring explicit selection of estimators. OPERA is shown to outperform existing methods in healthcare and robotics, contributing to a versatile framework for offline reinforcement learning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces an innovative approach by combining multiple OPE estimators, addressing a significant limitation of existing methods.  
- The theoretical foundation is robust, with rigorous proofs demonstrating OPERA's effectiveness in minimizing MSE.  
- Empirical results across various domains convincingly show OPERA's superior performance in selecting better policies.  
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written, facilitating reader comprehension.

Weaknesses:  
- There is insufficient discussion on how to construct an appropriate set of estimators for the proposed algorithm.  
- The assumption that at least one base estimator is consistent may not hold in practice, particularly in complex environments.  
- The potential for OPERA to favor biased estimators needs further exploration.  
- A more detailed implementation guide for practitioners would enhance the paper's practical applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on how to construct the set of estimators before applying the ensemble algorithm. Providing general guidelines would be beneficial. Additionally, the authors should address how OPERA performs when the assumption of consistent estimators does not hold and consider mechanisms to detect and handle inconsistent base estimators. Including a section on practical considerations for implementing OPERA in real-world scenarios would also be valuable. Finally, we suggest adding a brief paragraph summarizing the limitations and potential social impacts of the work in the conclusion section.
