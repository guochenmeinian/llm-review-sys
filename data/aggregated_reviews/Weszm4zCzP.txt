### Key Points
This paper presents a mutual information-based framework for topic segmentation that integrates region-based and edge-based techniques, effectively capturing both local and global semantic information. The authors provide experimental evidence demonstrating the framework's superiority over state-of-the-art methods on two public meeting transcript datasets. Additionally, ablation studies are conducted to analyze the contributions of the region-based and edge-based techniques, as well as the impact of different sentence representation models. The paper is well-articulated and presents its ideas clearly.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The framework's approaches are well-motivated, with necessary references provided for clarity.  
- The focus on local and global semantics is well-explained, particularly through ablation studies.  
- The framework's compatibility with various sentence representation models is a notable advantage.  

Weaknesses:  
- The segment encoder's requirement to encode all possible segments during training and inference is not adequately explained, raising concerns about the quadratic complexity and its impact on training time.  
- The application of the framework is limited to meeting transcripts, raising questions about its generalizability to other document types.  
- Missing confidence intervals and the paper's complexity may hinder understanding for non-experts.  
- Ambiguities in the proposed methods and insufficient details on the segment encoder's implementation and boundary detection are noted.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the segment encoder's training process to clarify the implications of encoding all possible segments. Additionally, the authors should address the generalizability of their approach beyond meeting transcripts, possibly by defining the structural properties of the datasets used. To enhance clarity, we suggest simplifying the language for broader accessibility and including confidence intervals in the results. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide more detailed descriptions of the segment encoder's implementation and the boundary detection process. Lastly, we advise careful proofreading to correct grammatical errors and ensure consistent formatting throughout the paper.
