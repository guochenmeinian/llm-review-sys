Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new large-scale dataset for Under Display Camera (UDC) image restoration, named UDC-SIT, consisting of 2,340 images of shape $1792\times1280$. The authors propose an image-capturing system and a novel image alignment technique utilizing Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to align captured images. UDC-SIT includes comprehensive annotations, such as light source and flare components, which are not present in other datasets. The experimental results indicate that this dataset poses significant challenges for existing image restoration methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The data collection method is reasonable and effective.
2. The image alignment technique is novel and useful.
3. The dataset is challenging for current image restoration methods and includes detailed annotations.

Weaknesses:
1. The website for accessing the dataset is currently unavailable.
2. The handling of empty boundary areas post-alignment is unclear.
3. The dataset's applicability may be limited to specific display types and cameras.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the accessibility of the dataset by ensuring the website is operational. Additionally, the authors should clarify how to manage the empty boundary areas after image alignment. It would be beneficial to conduct generalization experiments to demonstrate the dataset's applicability across different devices. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors provide simple applications utilizing the additional annotations to highlight their importance compared to other datasets.
