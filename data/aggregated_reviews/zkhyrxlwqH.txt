Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an unsupervised homography estimation method for multimodal image pairs using an alternating optimization framework called AltO. The authors introduce the Geometry Barlow Twins (GBT) loss function as a key innovation for this approach. The method aims to extend existing uni-modal techniques to multimodal datasets by incorporating Modality-Agnostic Representation Learning (MARL) and alternating training. The authors evaluate their method on three multimodal datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in aligning images across different modalities. However, concerns are raised regarding the convergence of training under large homography deformations and the necessity of few corresponding regions for homography estimation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The alternating optimization framework combined with the Geometry Barlow Twins loss offers a novel perspective on unsupervised multimodal homography estimation.  
- The introduction of MARL and alternating training is a noteworthy approach to address the challenges of cross-modal data.  
- The paper is well-organized and presents the methodology clearly, making the core ideas accessible to readers.  
- Experimental results indicate that AltO outperforms several existing unsupervised methods on multimodal registration datasets.

Weaknesses:  
- The feasibility and rationale of the proposed method are questionable, particularly regarding the lack of direct supervision in the training process and the explanation of how RAFT can be adapted for homography estimation.  
- The effectiveness of MARL is uncertain due to its removal of spatial information from feature maps, raising concerns about consistency and artifacts observed in the results.  
- The explanations provided do not convincingly address concerns regarding the convergence of training under large homography deformations, particularly given the reliance on content similarity supervision.  
- Insufficient experimental validation is evident, as the paper only tests on three datasets with limited modality differences, raising concerns about the generalization capabilities of the method.  
- Central claims, such as the necessity of alternating optimization and the superiority of GBT loss, lack adequate experimental support and comparisons with recent approaches.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the feasibility of their method by addressing how the Geometry Barlow Twins loss can effectively supervise the intermediate stages of iterative prediction. Additionally, the authors should provide a thorough comparison of the proposed GBT loss with the original Barlow Twins loss and include more experimental results across a broader range of challenging multimodal datasets. It would also be beneficial to discuss the motivation behind the proposed method in relation to existing unsupervised approaches for multimodal image registration. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors improve the theoretical justification for the GBT loss in enabling convergence under large homography deformations and provide clearer evidence or experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach in maintaining feature map consistency. Lastly, we encourage the authors to conduct further experiments on the OS dataset to validate their claims and enhance the robustness of their findings.
