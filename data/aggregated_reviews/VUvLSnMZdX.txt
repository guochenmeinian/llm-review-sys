Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an approach to data assimilation tasks using score-based generative modeling techniques. The authors aim to compute a posterior distribution over state trajectories from observations and data distribution, estimating the score function of the posterior with a learned prior-score network and a Gaussian approximation to the observation model. To enhance scalability for long state trajectories, they propose estimating the prior score over entire trajectories by combining scores from local time windows. The theoretical foundation is supported by experiments in simulated environments, specifically on the Lorenz-63 system and Kolmogorov fluid flow.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method's presentation is clear and comprehensible.
- The integration of established techniques in a novel manner shows potential for real-world applications.
- The authors provide clean supplementary code.
- The limitations section effectively addresses open questions and outlines future work.
- The approach offers a valuable groundwork for inference in dynamical systems.

Weaknesses:
- The method has not been tested on large-scale real-world problems, raising questions about its scalability.
- The amount of training data required for large-scale tasks may be computationally infeasible.
- The Gaussian observation model is simplistic, and the method's performance under different observation models remains untested.
- The assumption of known dynamics limits the practical applicability of the framework.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on scalability, particularly regarding the method's applicability to massive-scale real-world problems like weather forecasting. Additionally, it would be beneficial to quantify the computational costs associated with the training data requirements for large-scale tasks. We suggest exploring the performance of the method with various observation models beyond the Gaussian assumption. Furthermore, a comparison with standard data assimilation techniques, including variational assimilation, would enhance the paper's contributions. Lastly, clarifying the implications of the approximations used and their potential errors would strengthen the manuscript.
