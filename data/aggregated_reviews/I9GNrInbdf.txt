Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents significant advancements in the diffusion modeling community by addressing two critical questions: (1) it proves that the encoding given by the ODE transport map of a diffusion model is an optimal transport map, and (2) it derives a low stochasticity sampler for discrete diffusion models based on optimal transport principles. The authors establish a clear link between diffusion processes and optimal transport, demonstrating that continuous probability flows correspond to Monge maps and extending this to discrete settings. The experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed sampling method in reducing variance while maintaining sample quality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper provides strong theoretical contributions, particularly in linking diffusion models to optimal transport.  
- The exposition is clear and well-structured, making complex mathematical concepts accessible.  
- The results are significant for both continuous and discrete state spaces, with potential for further research in the community.

Weaknesses:  
- The experimental section is limited, primarily focusing on toy datasets, which may not fully substantiate the theoretical claims.  
- The notation can be confusing, with several similar symbols used without clear definitions, hindering reader comprehension.  
- There is a lack of practical applications discussed for the proposed sampling framework, raising questions about its real-world relevance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including evaluations on more complex, real-world datasets to demonstrate the practical applicability of their method. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the notation throughout the paper, particularly in distinguishing between similar symbols and providing a concise overview of their meanings. It would also be beneficial to include additional derivations in the appendix, such as for the reverse-time generator, to enhance the theoretical foundation. Lastly, addressing the ambiguity in terms like "this" and ensuring clear definitions for terms such as "mutual flow" and "neighborhood" will improve overall clarity.
