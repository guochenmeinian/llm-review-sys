Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Frequency-Adapted (FADA) learning scheme that utilizes Haar wavelet transformation to decouple the frozen vision foundation model (VFM) features into low-frequency (content) and high-frequency (style) components. The authors propose to process these components separately to enhance domain-generalized semantic segmentation (DGSS). Experimental results indicate that FADA achieves state-of-the-art performance across various foundational models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and organized, with a clear presentation of the proposed method.
- The idea of using frequency tokens to separate style and content is innovative and shows promise in improving DGSS performance.
- Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the method across different datasets and foundational models.

Weaknesses:
- The adaptation strategies for low-frequency and high-frequency components lack sufficient motivation and intuition.
- The writing and logical flow are poor, with insufficient justification for key concepts and a lack of detailed analysis on style elimination.
- There is inadequate comparison with recent low-rank adaptation methods, and the paper fails to provide insights into the experimental results and implementation details.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation and intuition behind the adaptation strategies for low-frequency and high-frequency components. Additionally, the authors should enhance the clarity of the writing and logical flow, particularly in justifying the relationship between style-invariant properties and the proposed method. We suggest including a more detailed analysis of the effectiveness of instance normalization for style elimination and conducting comparisons with recent low-rank adaptation methods. Furthermore, the authors are encouraged to provide insights into the experimental results and enrich the implementation details, including the losses used and the learning rate scheduler. Lastly, adding ground truth images in Figures 5 and 6 would facilitate better qualitative comparisons.
