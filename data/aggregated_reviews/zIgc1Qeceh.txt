### Key Points
This paper presents a new inter-annotator agreement metric, HolisticIAA, based on sentence embedding similarity, aimed at measuring agreement in annotation processes, particularly for persuasion classification of text snippets. The authors propose that this metric allows for computing annotator agreement even when annotators do not label the same documents by pooling similar sentences from the corpus. The results show a correlation with traditional IAA metrics like Cohen's kappa, raising questions about the utility of the proposed metric in assessing dataset quality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel method for assessing agreement in large multilingual annotation campaigns with limited overlap among annotators.
- It is built on substantial expertise in annotation and illustrates effective practices for large-scale projects.
- The analysis of results is thorough, and the article is well-written.

Weaknesses:
- The objectives of the paper are not clearly articulated, leading to potential misunderstandings about the problem being addressed.
- The computation of the HolisticIAA metric is inadequately explained, and essential details about the experimental setup are missing.
- The subjective nature of annotation tasks is not sufficiently discussed, particularly regarding sources of disagreement.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by explicitly stating and explaining the main objectives of the paper to avoid misunderstandings. Additionally, a discussion on the role of subjectivity and the main sources of disagreement should be integrated. The authors should provide the explicit formula for the HolisticIAA metric and include essential details about the experimental setting. Incorporating the responses provided during the rebuttal phase into the revised version would also enhance the paper.
