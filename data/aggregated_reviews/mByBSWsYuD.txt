Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an empirical study on the effects of censorship on permissionless blockchains, particularly focusing on Ethereum and Bitcoin. The authors formalize the concept of blockchain censorship and quantify its impact, revealing that 46% of Ethereum blocks were created by censoring actors due to OFAC sanctions. The study highlights how censorship affects transaction latency and security, especially after Ethereum's transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), where censored transactions experienced significant delays. The authors conclude that censorship resistance is unattainable if more than 50% of validator nodes are involved in censorship.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant issue regarding censorship in decentralized blockchains.
- It provides compelling empirical evidence showing that censorship increases confirmation latency.
- The writing is clear and the methodology is appropriate, with a comprehensive literature review.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical contribution lacks depth, and the definitions of censorship are not sufficiently clear, particularly for novice readers.
- The empirical sections, especially 5.2 and 5.3, are unclear regarding implications for specific builders/proposers/relayers.
- There is a lack of clarity on the objectives of the paper, and the statistical data presented often lacks clear inferences.
- The proof regarding censorship resilience is relegated to the appendix, which may undermine its perceived significance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the problem definition and motivation in the introduction, ensuring that terms like "blockchain censorship" and "censorship resilience" are defined earlier. Additionally, providing background information on blockchain operations and terminology before the preliminaries would enhance understanding. The authors should clarify what they mean by "censorship quantification" and ensure that the observations drawn from statistical data are clearly demarcated from conclusions. We suggest revisiting the title of Section 6 to better reflect its content and consider moving the proof regarding censorship resilience to the main body of the paper to emphasize its importance. Finally, addressing the questions raised about the model expansion and the rationale behind the choice of services studied would strengthen the paper.
