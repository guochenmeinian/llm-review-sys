Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a normalizing flow (NF) model that integrates causal information through either a partial order or complete directed acyclic graph (DAG). The authors derive identifiability conditions for causal estimands and implement their algorithm on various simulated and real-world datasets. The resulting NF can compute treatment effects and counterfactual probabilities under reasonable assumptions about the data-generating process. The authors also demonstrate that structural causal models (SCMs) can be expressed as triangular monotonic increasing maps, allowing for autoregressive NFs to be causally consistent. Their empirical evaluations show that their approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in representing true data distributions and causal inference tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The manuscript is well-motivated, thoroughly researched, and presents a strong contribution to an important topic.
- The connections between SCMs, triangular monotonic increasing maps, and autoregressive normalizing flows are well articulated, opening avenues for further research.
- The implementation of interventions on exogenous variables is innovative and non-trivial.
- The writing is clear, and the experimental validation is convincing, with extensive experiments including ablation analysis.

Weaknesses:
- Some points in the paper may cause confusion, such as the interpretation of $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \mathbf{G}^n$ and the focus on causal chains of the form $X_1 \rightarrow \dots \rightarrow X_d$, which may not reflect more complex causal structures.
- The assumption of known causal ordering is a strong requirement, potentially limiting the applicability of the proposed method.
- The identifiability results are not novel, as they are derived from prior works, which may diminish the perceived contribution of the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by addressing the interpretation of $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \mathbf{G}^n$ and expanding the empirical evaluation to include more complex causal structures. Additionally, providing an example of how a learned causal NF behaves and how interventions influence outputs would enhance understanding. We suggest transferring some critical conclusions from the appendix to the main text, such as a sketch of the proof and a brief description of the dataset used. Finally, consider discussing the limitations regarding the datasets used and the potential for applying the method to high-dimensional data, as well as the necessity of domain knowledge for its implementation.
