Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical framework aimed at understanding the effects of rewards on grid cells, which encode spatial information. The authors propose a biologically-inspired artificial neural network (ANN) model that path-integrates with non-uniform weighting to induce distortions in grid cell firing patterns. The model maintains the topological structure of the neural manifold while allowing for geometric distortions, resulting in various firing patterns such as ring, diffused, and band structures. The authors also introduce a spatial saliency loss term to capture the influence of rewards.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, clear, and provides a strong motivation for understanding grid cell encoding in the context of rewards.
- The theoretical framework describing rewards as a diffeomorphism is solid and contributes to the understanding of grid cell coding.
- The simplicity of the spatial saliency loss term is commendable, building upon existing literature effectively.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical depth in Section 3 is limited, primarily listing plausible distortions without adequately addressing the empirical phenomena, particularly the absence of banded and ring units in the experiments.
- The experiments lack thoroughness, focusing mainly on diffusion without exploring how changes to the loss function correspond to various distortions. A more comprehensive analysis is needed to strengthen the contribution.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical discussion in Section 3 by incorporating a more in-depth analysis of the different types of distortions, including banded and ring units. Additionally, we suggest conducting more extensive experiments to explore a range of salience functions and their impact on firing patterns. Addressing the disconnect between the model's predictions and empirical observations is crucial, particularly regarding the global versus local nature of distortions. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the relationship between the reward-based loss function and the diffeomorphism theory presented earlier.
