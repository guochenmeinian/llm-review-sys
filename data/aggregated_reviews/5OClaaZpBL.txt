### Key Points
This paper presents a multi-hop syntax aware fake news detection method, MSynFD, which integrates graph attention models and dependency trees with transformer-based embeddings to enhance the identification of fake news. The effectiveness of this approach is validated through performance metrics across two datasets, Weibo and GossipCop, demonstrating its superiority over prior methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The incorporation of a dependency tree into graph attention models innovatively enhances focus on significant words while reducing noise.
- The paper's illustrations effectively clarify the authors' concepts, contributing to overall comprehension.
- The writing is coherent and well-structured, particularly in sections introducing key concepts.

Weaknesses:
- The framework's ability to represent news articles with multiple sentences using the dependency tree is unclear.
- The criteria for selecting central words in sentences and their quantity per article need clarification.
- The use of inconsistent symbols in Figure 2 may lead to confusion regarding operations.
- The terminology discrepancy between Figure 2 and the Methods section requires resolution for consistency.
- The limited generalizability of the study due to reliance on only two datasets is a concern.
- The Keywords Debiasing module appears disconnected from the core motivation of the study.
- The marginal performance gains (~1%) over prior approaches raise questions about the model's effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how the dependency tree represents news articles with multiple sentences. Additionally, the authors should specify the criteria for selecting central words and the number required for a news article. To avoid confusion, we suggest using distinct symbols for different operations in Figure 2 and ensuring consistency in terminology throughout the paper. Expanding the dataset to enhance generalizability is advisable, and we encourage the authors to conduct an additional ablation study involving an ensemble of the graph attention model and the transformer-based model. Lastly, we recommend a discussion on graph-based semantic enhancement methods and a breakdown of performance results by the genre of fake news articles to better understand model suitability.
