Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Label-Retrieval-Augmented (LRA) diffusion model aimed at learning from noisy labels by leveraging the neighbor consistency principle and incorporating pre-trained models. The model introduces an accelerated label diffusion process and a new conditional mechanism for pre-trained models, achieving significant performance improvements on both synthetic and real-world datasets, with accuracy boosts of 10-20 absolute points in many instances.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The idea of utilizing a diffusion model to tackle the noisy label learning problem is innovative.
- Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to multiple peer methods.
- The paper is well-written and effectively applies diffusion models to learn the probability distribution of labels in noisy settings.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental section requires enhancement, including the addition of state-of-the-art methods and discussions on the influence of label noise types and different pre-trained models.
- The motivation behind formulating the noisy label process as a diffusion process needs clearer justification and discussion of its advantages.
- The description of comparison algorithms is insufficient, and the methods listed in Table 1 are outdated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including state-of-the-art methods published in 2022 or 2023 and discussing the impact of different types of label noise. Additionally, a detailed explanation of the model's flexibility regarding various label noise types, such as feature-dependent label noise, should be provided. Clarifying the roles of different pre-trained encoders and addressing the computational implications of the diffusion model would enhance the paper's rigor. Furthermore, we suggest correcting minor errors in the presentation and ensuring that all terms and symbols are clearly defined before their first use.
