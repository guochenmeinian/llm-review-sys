Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a solution to the object removal problem in diffusion models through a plug-and-play module called CLIPAway, which utilizes Alpha-CLIP embeddings to achieve disentangled background embeddings. The authors propose a method that leverages vector arithmetic to focus on background information, demonstrating superior performance in object removal compared to existing methods. The approach is flexible, allowing integration into various diffusion-based frameworks, and is illustrated with clear examples and extensive results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively addresses a significant limitation in current diffusion models, providing a strong motivation for the proposed method.
- The method's reliance on no synthetic data or special annotations enhances its generalizability and robustness.
- The simplicity of using AlphaCLIP and vector subtraction is both intuitive and effective, supported by extensive results and user studies.

Weaknesses:
- The quality of inpainted images is inconsistent, with notable artifacts present in some examples.
- The conclusions drawn from certain figures lack sufficient evidence, and additional visual results or quantitative comparisons could strengthen the observations.
- The method's simplicity raises concerns about its transferability and potential reliance on specific architectural choices, which may limit broader applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the stability of inpainted images by addressing the artifacts observed in the results. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with the baseline “LaMa + SDinpaint” and conducting evaluations at higher resolutions to better demonstrate the method's boundaries. More failure cases should be analyzed to provide a clearer understanding of the method's limitations. Finally, exploring the method's applicability to other frameworks, such as SDXL, would enhance the comprehensiveness of the work.
