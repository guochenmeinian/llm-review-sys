Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel attention mechanism called Dic-Attn, which integrates dictionary learning and sparse coding to enhance performance in various computer vision tasks, including image classification, point cloud classification, and image segmentation. The authors propose a learnable dictionary module that replaces traditional attention models in transformers, achieving compelling results with lower computational costs. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Dic-Attn module across multiple tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed Dic-Attn module is novel and effectively combines dictionary learning with attention mechanisms, leading to improved performance on various tasks.
- The method shows significant results in point cloud classification and outperforms existing attention mechanisms in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
- The paper includes detailed analyses, ablation studies, and visualizations that enhance understanding of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- The paper suffers from organizational issues, with overwhelming technical details obscuring the main message.
- There is confusion regarding the mathematical formulations and the relationship between the dictionary and sparse representations.
- Limited experimental results are presented, particularly for image segmentation, lacking quantitative comparisons and visual examples.
- The writing lacks clarity in certain sections, making it difficult to follow the proposed methods and their implications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing to better convey the main ideas and insights of the paper. Specifically, addressing the confusion in the mathematical formulations and ensuring consistent definitions throughout would enhance comprehension. Additionally, we suggest including more comprehensive experimental results, particularly for image segmentation tasks, and providing visual examples in the main paper. It would also be beneficial to discuss the limitations of the proposed method and its broader societal implications. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore and justify the follow-up benefits of their work, particularly in relation to robustness and denoising tasks.
