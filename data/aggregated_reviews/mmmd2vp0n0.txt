Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to NeRFs, specifically designed for transient imaging using single-photon LiDAR sensors. It introduces a time-resolved volume rendering equation and adapts HDR-aware loss functions to utilize raw photon count histograms instead of traditional intensity images. The authors propose a unique dataset of simulated and real-world transient multiview scans and demonstrate that their method outperforms existing NeRF-based techniques, particularly in sparse view settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces innovative adaptations of NeRFs for time-of-flight imaging, including a tailored volume rendering formulation and loss functions.
- It provides a first-of-its-kind dataset of transient multiview scans, enhancing the field's resources.
- The experiments are well-structured and demonstrate the method's advantages over depth-supervised approaches.

Weaknesses:
- The method is tested solely in dark environments due to the limitations of single-photon LiDAR, restricting broader applicability.
- Clarity issues arise from the use of symbols and the inclusion of RGB images in the simulated data, which may confuse readers regarding the actual data utilized.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by explicitly defining the dimensionality of symbols in the rendering equations and discussing the implications of using RGB images in the simulated data. Additionally, we suggest conducting ablation studies on the HDR-informed loss function and space carving regularization to better understand their contributions. It would also be beneficial to explore the method's performance under natural light conditions and clarify the necessity of modeling the spatial footprint of the laser spot in the rendering process.
