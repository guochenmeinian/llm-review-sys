Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel algorithm called DEMIPL for multi-instance partial-label learning (MIPL), which addresses the challenge of associating a bag of instances with multiple candidate labels, of which one is presumed correct. The authors propose a disambiguation attention mechanism to aggregate instance contributions into a single vector representation and utilize a momentum-based disambiguation strategy to identify the true label from the candidate set. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets, including a new dataset for colorectal cancer classification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem setting is novel and potentially impactful, addressing the challenges of both multi-instance learning and partial label learning.
- The introduction of a real-world dataset for histopathology image classification demonstrates the practical applicability of the proposed paradigm.
- The disambiguation attention mechanism is applicable to both binary and multi-class classification, unlike existing methods limited to binary scenarios.
- The algorithm shows significant performance improvements over existing approaches.

Weaknesses:
- The synergy between the disambiguation attention mechanism and the momentum-based disambiguation strategy requires further exploration.
- The assumption of a single correct label is considered strong and unrealistic in practice, particularly in the histopathology context.
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion of its limitations and the characteristics of the datasets used for evaluation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the notation in Section 2.1, specifically replacing the first \mathcal{Y} at line 91 with \boldsymbol{S}_{i}. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the rationale behind the momentum-based disambiguation strategy and its effectiveness in ensuring correct label selection. It would be beneficial to discuss the potential for instance-level classification from MIPL datasets and provide more details about the CRC-MIPL dataset, including its acquisition process and any biases. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to consider incorporating more challenging data scenarios and to acknowledge any limitations of the DEMIPL algorithm. Lastly, proofreading for grammatical errors and providing a visual representation of the algorithm could enhance the paper's overall clarity.
