### Key Points
This paper presents a method for detecting and embedding temporal regularities (TRs) from time-stamped event data, associating a body event type \(b\) with a head event type \(h\) based on a mean relative time \(\tau\) and a universal factor \(\eta\). The authors propose Noether Embeddings (NE) to enable efficient formation and retrieval of TRs, defined through metrics such as standard confidence (sc), head coverage (hc), and general confidence (gc). The paper outlines two main tasks: TR detection, which identifies valid TRs based on general confidence, and TR Query, which determines the characteristic relative time between events. The authors claim superior performance of their method on datasets derived from large-scale temporal knowledge graphs compared to existing methods. Additionally, the authors emphasize the unique efficiency of NE in data-efficient learning and query-efficient memory of TRs, highlighting its relationship to Noether's theorem and structural biases. The methodology is designed to demonstrate NE's capabilities before comparative evaluations, and the conclusion discusses limitations and social impacts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is well-motivated by Emmy Noether's work on symmetries and conservation laws.
- The authors develop an efficient encoding approach that significantly outperforms existing methods on multiple datasets.
- The novelty of the formalism and its relationship to Noether's theorem, utilizing complex numbers for characteristic wait times, is compelling.
- Well-constructed experiments yield convincing results, showcasing NE's significant storage efficiency and potential in storage-constrained scenarios.

Weaknesses:
- The uniqueness of the authors' definition of TR is unclear, and its relation to existing definitions should be better articulated.
- The paper lacks intuitive explanations for defined terms and metrics, which could aid reader comprehension.
- Clarity regarding data partitioning for training and testing, as well as the handling of discrete time-stamps, is insufficient.
- The significance of the metrics and the interval \(\Delta\) related to \(\tau\) is not adequately discussed.
- The experimental comparisons lack strong baselines, particularly with simpler counting methods, raising questions about the fairness of the evaluations.
- The assumptions made in the model are not clearly articulated, leading to questions about the model's expressivity and the scenarios in which NE outperforms counting methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by providing more intuitive descriptions of key terms and metrics, such as standard confidence and TR Query. Additionally, the authors should clarify the uniqueness of their TR definition and its relation to existing literature. It would be beneficial to detail the data partitioning methods used in experiments and explicitly state how discrete time-stamps are handled. The authors should also discuss the implications of the interval \(\Delta\) and consider providing alternative independent measures for evaluation to strengthen the validity of their comparisons. Furthermore, we suggest incorporating counting methods as necessary baselines in the paper, as they provide ground truth and may offer better accuracy in TR detection. The authors should address the interpretability of the biases introduced by NE's scoring functions and provide empirical evidence comparing the accuracy and space complexity of NE against counting methods. Lastly, clarifying the conditions under which NE is more favorable than counting would enhance the manuscript's robustness.
