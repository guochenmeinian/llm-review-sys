Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a hierarchical diffusion-based pipeline for generating interactive 3D scenes, leveraging 2D prior from diffusion models for depth and image generation. The authors propose a method that utilizes hierarchical inpainting to control object placement in 3D environments, effectively generating complex scenes suitable for robotics and embodied AI tasks. The framework aims to improve the realism and diversity of object layouts compared to existing methods that rely heavily on large language models (LLMs).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper effectively combines various off-the-shelf models, including GPT4v and depth estimation techniques, to generate detailed and interactive 3D scenes.
2. The method demonstrates a clear approach to generating fine-grained small objects, which is crucial for embodied AI applications.
3. The proposed hierarchical inpainting method shows promise in enhancing the spatial reasoning capabilities of the generated scenes.

Weaknesses:
1. The effectiveness of the hierarchical inpainting is inadequately verified, particularly regarding the quality of generated scenes without strict 3D constraints.
2. The paper lacks comprehensive evaluations of embodied tasks, with limited results presented for important applications.
3. The retrieval of large objects from datasets may limit diversity, and the comparison with other methods, such as Text2Room, may not be entirely fair.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the verification of the hierarchical inpainting method by providing more rigorous evaluations of scene quality under 3D constraints. Additionally, we suggest including more results related to embodied tasks to substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in practical applications. Clarifying the operation of the depth map and the criteria for selecting large furniture pieces would enhance the technical clarity of the paper. Finally, addressing the controllability of object placements when using pre-trained inpainting models could further strengthen the contributions of this work.
