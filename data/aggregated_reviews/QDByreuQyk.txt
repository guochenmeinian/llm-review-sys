### Key Points
This paper presents a novel and simple differentially private algorithm for the min $s$-$t$ cut and multiway $k$-cut problems. The authors demonstrate that their algorithm achieves an $O(n)$ additive error for the $s$-$t$ mincut problem and provides a near-tight lower bound. Additionally, they adapt a standard non-private approximation algorithm for the $k$-multiway cut problem, resulting in an improved error bound of $O(\log{k})$. The empirical evaluation of the $s$-$t$ mincut algorithm is compared against a simple baseline.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The originality and simplicity of the proposed differentially private algorithms are commendable.  
- The paper provides interesting upper and lower bounds for the min $s$-$t$ cut and multiway $k$-cut problems.  
- The writing is clear, and the overall quality of the paper is high.  
- The results are significant, addressing important problems in the field.  

Weaknesses:  
- The main ideas are relatively simple, and the experiments section is somewhat limited.  
- There is insufficient discussion of related work, making it unclear if the contributions meet the standards for NeurIPS.  
- The proof of Lemma 4.1 does not align with the steps of Algorithm 2, and the experiments lack informative comparisons, particularly for the $k$-cut algorithm.  
- Some minor typos and a lack of a related work section were noted.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related work to clarify the significance of their contributions. Additionally, we suggest that the authors enhance the experiments by comparing the error of their $s$-$t$ cut algorithm with that of the non-private approximation and provide evaluations for the $k$-cut algorithm. It would also be beneficial to clarify the proof of Lemma 4.1 to match the algorithm's description. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to elaborate on advanced composition and provide explanatory figures for complex discussions, particularly in the proof of Lemma 3.2. Lastly, addressing the computational complexity implications and providing examples where there are exponentially many min $s$-$t$ cuts would strengthen the paper.
