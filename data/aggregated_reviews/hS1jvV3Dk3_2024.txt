Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel algorithm called ZOPO (Localized Zeroth-Order Prompt Optimization) aimed at enhancing prompt optimization efficiency in large language models (LLMs). The authors argue that local optima are more prevalent and can be effectively targeted, proposing a zeroth-order optimization method that integrates Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) and Gaussian processes. The paper includes empirical investigations of the objective function landscape, revealing insights about local optima and the influence of input domains on optimization performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The analysis in Section 3 is well-supported and informative, particularly regarding the insights on local optima.
- The ZOPO algorithm is theoretically faster than global optimization methods due to its NTK-based Gaussian processes.
- The visualization technique for the objective landscapes is insightful and may serve as a valuable tool for black-box optimization.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks discussion of recent prompt optimization methods, limiting its contextual relevance.
- ZOPO does not consistently demonstrate advantages over baseline methods in several figures and tables, raising questions about its effectiveness.
- The complexity of the ZOPO algorithm may hinder its practical implementation for those unfamiliar with NTK and Gaussian processes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of recent prompt optimization methods to enhance contextual relevance. Additionally, clarifying the inconsistencies in ZOPO's performance across figures and tables would strengthen the paper's claims. Simplifying the algorithm's presentation and providing more accessible explanations of the NTK and Gaussian processes would improve its practical utility. Finally, addressing the clarity of the relationship between the t-SNE visualizations and the original objective function landscape would enhance the validity of the insights derived.
