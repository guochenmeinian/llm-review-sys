### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to curriculum learning that estimates and aggregates various linguistic indices to assess overall linguistic difficulty in relation to a model's competence. The authors propose methods that incorporate linguistic complexity information, leading to improved performance on several NLP tasks. The analysis reveals that different linguistic indices have varying significance across tasks, providing insights into the challenges faced in modeling these tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces innovative methodologies for curriculum learning, including correlation and optimization methods for assessing linguistic indices.
- It provides a well-structured layout and substantial experimental validation, enhancing the credibility of its claims.
- The insights into how linguistic complexity affects model performance at different training stages are valuable and could inform future research.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental details and model settings are insufficiently detailed in the main text, with much information relegated to the appendix.
- The reliance on expert-defined linguistic indices limits the method's applicability to other languages.
- Not all proposed methods were thoroughly examined in the experiments, leading to uncertainty about their impacts on performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the main text by including more detailed information about the model and experimental settings to enhance reproducibility. Additionally, consider discussing the applicability of the approach to languages other than English and explore the possibility of reducing the set of linguistic features to those available for more languages. Clarifying ambiguous terms such as "competence-based" and "indices filtering" would also enhance reader understanding. Finally, we suggest expanding the experimental section to cover the impacts of all proposed methods on system performance.
