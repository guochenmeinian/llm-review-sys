### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative approach to Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) by integrating Virtual Receptors and Protein Language Embeddings. The authors propose that this combination has the potential to advance the SBDD domain, and while the reviewer is not an expert in this niche, the work appears useful based on its merits.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The integration of Virtual Receptors and Protein Language Embeddings represents a novel contribution to SBDD, suggesting potential advancements in the field.

Weaknesses:  
The paper lacks clarity in specifying the tasks or objectives associated with Tables 1 and 2. Additionally, the abbreviation "VR" is used without its full form being defined, which may hinder understanding for some readers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by explicitly stating the tasks or objectives related to Tables 1 and 2, including which specific protein or proteins the top 100 molecules are intended to dock with. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors provide the full form of "VR" as "Virtual Receptor" in Table 1 or its caption to enhance reader comprehension.
