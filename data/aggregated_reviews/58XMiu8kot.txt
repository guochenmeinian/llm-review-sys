Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Laplace approximation-based probabilistic retrieval approach, specifically Bayesian metric learning for image retrieval. The authors provide a probabilistic interpretation of the contrastive loss using the von-Mises Fisher distribution and address Hessian positive definiteness. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the approach's advantages in calibrated uncertainties, out-of-distribution detection, and both close-set and open-set retrieval.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel use of Laplace approximation for probabilistic retrieval, differing from prior works focused on variational autoencoders.
- Extensive empirical evaluations and a careful ablation study show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches like hedge instance embedding (HIE) and probabilistic face embeddings (PFE).
- The authors effectively utilize figures to clarify concepts, and the writing is generally clear and well-organized.

Weaknesses:
- The necessity and motivation for the probabilistic view of the contrastive loss are not well articulated, raising concerns about the unique technical contributions.
- The organization could be improved, as important results are relegated to the supplemental material, disrupting the logical flow.
- The computational efficiency of the proposed framework compared to amortized approaches is unclear, particularly regarding test-time retrieval.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and organization of the paper by integrating key results into the main text and minimizing reliance on supplemental material. Additionally, the authors should provide a stronger motivation for the probabilistic view of the contrastive loss and clarify how test-time retrieval is performed within the proposed framework. Addressing the computational efficiency and exploring alternative methods for approximating the Hessian while maintaining scalability would also enhance the paper's contribution.
