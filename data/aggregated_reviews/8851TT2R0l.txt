### Key Points
This paper presents a novel paradigm for zero-shot text classification by utilizing various types of label descriptions, including keywords, short sentences/templates, and Wikipedia definitions. The authors propose fine-tuning a pretrained text encoder model, such as RoBERTa, on these label description datasets and then applying the model for inference in a prompting format. The evaluation across multiple topic and sentiment classification tasks demonstrates that this approach significantly outperforms conventional zero-shot inference methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The novelty of the proposed paradigm is noteworthy, leveraging generic label descriptions to enhance zero-shot performance.
- Comprehensive evaluations on topic and sentiment classification tasks provide strong empirical support for the method's effectiveness.
- The paper is well-written and easy to understand, with ablation tests demonstrating the robustness of the approach.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation of the fine-tuning method lacks clarity, particularly regarding the training process on class-representative keywords, templates, and Wikipedia descriptions.
- The method's simplicity may overly depend on practitioners' understanding of labels, and it requires a pretrained model that could introduce biases.
- The results, while effective, do not significantly close the gap with supervised state-of-the-art models, and the randomized ablation tests may not be well-designed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the fine-tuning process by providing detailed descriptions or figures illustrating how the model is trained on the label descriptions. Additionally, consider including more baseline comparisons, such as a model trained on the 20NG dataset, and explore merging similar labels to create a larger dataset. Furthermore, we suggest evaluating the ablated versions with hyper-parameter tuning specific to those settings to provide a fair comparison. Lastly, clarify the choice of using only four labels from the 20NG dataset and ensure that results with InstructGPT are compared on the same sample set for consistency.
