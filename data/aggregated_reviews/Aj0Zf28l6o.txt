Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a hierarchical diffusion model for molecular conformer generation, utilizing RDKit for fragment position initialization and an equivariant neural network for the reverse diffusion process. The authors demonstrate improved performance on standard benchmarks (GEOM-QM9 and GEOM-DRUGS) compared to some previous baselines and include ablation studies to validate key design choices.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The model addresses the significant problem of molecular conformer generation using deep generative methods.
2. The proposed framework is benchmarked against standard datasets, showcasing its performance.

Weaknesses:
1. The introduction of the model as a variant of blurring diffusion is somewhat misleading, as the final formulation does not strongly relate to this concept.
2. The work lacks comparisons with recent state-of-the-art models in molecular conformer generation, which would strengthen validation.
3. While ablation studies validate some design choices, several important framework designs remain inadequately discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the model's relationship to blurring diffusion to avoid obscuring its contributions. Additionally, the authors are strongly encouraged to include comparisons with recent state-of-the-art methods, such as the molecular conformer fields (MCF) approach, to better validate their performance. Exploring alternative cheminformatic methods for fragment generation, such as BRICS, could also enhance the robustness of the model. Furthermore, the authors should provide a detailed analysis of the ratios of isolated atoms and investigate how their diffusion process compares with standard models conditioned on substructure coordinates. Lastly, clarifying how $\delta^2$ in Eq. 8 is determined in the diffusion process would be beneficial.
