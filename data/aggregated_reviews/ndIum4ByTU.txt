Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Meta Flow Matching (MFM), an extension of the Conditional Generative Modeling via Flow Matching (CGFM) framework, aimed at modeling the dynamics of probability distributions on the Wasserstein manifold. The authors propose incorporating population density into the vector field through amortization using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to enhance generalization across different initial distributions. The method is applied to individual treatment responses in a multi-patient single-cell drug screening context, demonstrating improved performance on unseen populations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem setting of integrating population interactions into flow matching is novel and well-motivated.
- The empirical benchmarks, particularly on real biological data, effectively showcase the strengths of MFM.
- The paper is clearly written, with rigorous mathematical notation and well-structured sections.

Weaknesses:
- The methodology section restates established theory rather than presenting new contributions, suggesting Section 3.1 should be relocated to the background.
- There is insufficient discussion on the fulfillment of crucial assumptions in realistic biological settings.
- The performance comparisons in synthetic experiments lack clarity, and additional metrics specific to the application are needed.
- The role of meta-learning and the GNN requires more detailed explanation and ablation studies, particularly regarding their impact on model performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology by moving Section 3.1 to the background section to avoid confusion regarding contributions. Additionally, the authors should discuss the satisfaction of the three crucial assumptions in a biological context and provide more detailed explanations of the meta-learning aspect and the GNN's role. Including more comparative methods in experiments and additional performance metrics relevant to the application would enhance the robustness of the findings. Finally, clarifying the performance correlation with varying values of k in the synthetic experiments would aid reader comprehension.
