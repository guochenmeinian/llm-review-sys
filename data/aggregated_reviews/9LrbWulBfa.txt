### Key Points
This paper presents the Locality-aware Concept Bottleneck Model (LCBM), which aims to enhance label-free Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) by addressing the challenge of capturing local concepts within small regions of images. The authors propose a patch-based method that utilizes CLIP for concept localization, demonstrating improved classification and localization performance on the CUB dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper effectively highlights the issue of locality in CBMs, presenting a novel approach that improves the alignment between concepts and specific image regions.
2. Experimental results indicate enhanced localization, as shown by increased Intersection over Union (IoU) scores, outperforming baseline methods like LfCBM.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks justification for the chosen patch size and partitioning method, which may lead to arbitrary choices that misrepresent local features.
2. The assumption that each patch contains distinct concepts overlooks the potential overlap and interdependencies of visual concepts, which could lead to flawed predictions.
3. The formulation of the loss \(L_{local}\) and influence value \(V_{k,h,w}\) is unclear, requiring better explanation and motivation.
4. The final loss is a weighted sum of \(L_{class}\), \(L_{local}\), and \(L_{concept}\), but an empirical ablation study on weight selection is needed.
5. Although the method shows improved localization, the mIoU score of 0.202 is low and may not be meaningful, indicating a need for further evaluation across additional datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the chosen patch size and discuss its sensitivity to ensure optimal representation of local features. Additionally, the authors should address the potential overlap of concepts in patches to enhance prediction accuracy. Clarifying the formulation of \(L_{local}\) and \(V_{k,h,w}\) would strengthen the paper, as would providing an empirical ablation study on the weight selection for the final loss function. Finally, expanding the evaluation to include more datasets would bolster the findings and provide a more comprehensive assessment of the method's effectiveness.
