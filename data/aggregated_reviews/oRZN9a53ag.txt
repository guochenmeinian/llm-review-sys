Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents novel theoretical results for identifying causal effects in restricted additive noise models (ANMs) and introduces a new approach to causal discovery using score matching to orient edges in mixed graphs. The authors propose a method that generalizes previous work on score matching for structural causal models (SCMs) with latent nodes, demonstrating that a NoGAM-type procedure can recover the direction of non-confounded edges in the corresponding partial ancestral graph (PAG). Additionally, they introduce AdaScore, which aims to provide theoretical guarantees on latent variable models while identifying causal directions. The theoretical results relax previous assumptions and introduce important concepts such as inducing paths and active paths. The rebuttal includes statistical tests comparing AdaScore's performance against several baseline methods, revealing that AdaScore often performs comparably or better in certain scenarios, particularly in nonlinear cases, although its performance in linear latent variable models is not superior to all baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides significant contributions to score-based causal discovery by extending methodologies to confounded restricted ANMs and introducing a novel application of score matching for causal discovery.
- The problem definition is clear and useful for readers.
- The theoretical results are novel and important, particularly Propositions 2 and 3, which address non-linearity and sufficiency assumptions.
- The authors provide detailed statistical analyses, including Whitney Mann-Whitney tests, to support their claims about AdaScore's performance.
- Experiments compare against a sufficient number of baselines, showing the proposed method's theoretical guarantees.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the paper is limited, primarily focusing on applying NoGAM to specific edges in a PAG, which does not fulfill the expectations set by the authors.
- The assumptions and benefits of the proposed methodology are not clearly specified, leading to ambiguity in its contributions.
- The experimental results lack comprehensive metrics and do not convincingly demonstrate the method's superiority over existing approaches.
- Scalability is not adequately discussed, with experiments conducted on a limited number of variables.
- The rebuttal does not adequately address concerns regarding the thoroughness of the investigation into the proposed t-test as a conditional independence test.
- The performance of AdaScore in linear latent variable models is criticized for being inferior to several baseline methods, raising questions about its practical utility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the flow of the paper by clearly defining key concepts such as restricted ANMs and active paths in the main text. Additionally, please include a more explicit discussion of the assumptions underlying the methodology and their implications. We suggest enhancing the experimental section by incorporating more diverse benchmarks and metrics, as well as providing statistical tests to substantiate claims of performance. Furthermore, we recommend improving the analysis of the proposed t-test as a conditional independence test, potentially by developing additional theoretical frameworks, such as adapting Thm. 3.2 from Zhu et al. A clearer discussion of scalability, including comparisons with existing methods on larger datasets, would strengthen the paper's contributions. Lastly, we suggest clarifying the contributions of AdaScore, particularly in the context of linear latent variable models, to better articulate its advantages and limitations.
