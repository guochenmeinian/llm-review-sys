Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Augmented Inverse Propensity Weighted cross Kernel Treatment Test (AIPW-xKTE), a doubly robust test with a valid type-I error based on kernel mean embeddings to assess distributional treatment effects. The authors demonstrate the test's performance through Theorem 4.1, which establishes the asymptotic normality of the test statistic, and validate it using synthetic and real datasets. The paper integrates concepts from kernel mean embedding, double robustness, and cross U-statistics, contributing to the literature by providing a computationally efficient alternative to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper clearly articulates its goal of testing distributional treatment effects, an important research area.
- AIPW-xKTE offers advantages over previous methods, including an analytical asymptotic null distribution and double robustness.
- The writing is clear and concise, making the technical content accessible.

Weaknesses:
- The proposal lacks novelty as it primarily combines existing ideas from cross U-statistics and augmented inverse probability weighting.
- The practical relevance of testing distributional treatment effects is questioned, as the authors do not provide concrete applications in their experiments.
- Some statistical concepts and notations are inadequately defined or explained, leading to potential confusion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of statistical concepts, particularly by defining "double robustness" and providing detailed explanations of the plug-in estimator and related quantities. Additionally, the authors should clarify the efficiency claims in the context of statistical properties rather than computational efficiency. It would be beneficial to include comparisons with related works, such as KTE and the AIPW extension from Fawkes et al. (2022), in the main text. Lastly, we encourage the authors to discuss practical applications of their test more explicitly to enhance its relevance and impact.
