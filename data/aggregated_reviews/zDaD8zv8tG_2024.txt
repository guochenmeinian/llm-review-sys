Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel teacher-teacher framework named LIghtweight kNowledge alignmEnt (LINE) that facilitates knowledge exchange between two pre-existing large language models (LLMs) to enhance clinical language representation. By leveraging complementary knowledge from general-purpose and domain-specific models, LINE aims to harmonize their knowledge within a unified representation space. The framework is validated through downstream tasks, demonstrating that the LINE model outperforms individual pre-existing models in understanding and processing clinical language. The methodology includes a contrastive loss and an alignment module, focusing on refining the alignment by recovering residual information.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. **Clarity and Structure**: The paper is well-written and structured, providing a clear motivation for the study, which enhances reader engagement.
2. **Novelty and Utility**: The teacher-teacher framework is innovative, integrating strengths of different pre-trained models without requiring new model development.
3. **Usability and Efficiency**: The framework is user-friendly and does not necessitate retraining of original models, reducing computational overhead.
4. **Empirical Validation**: Experimental results show significant improvements over existing methods, substantiating the framework's efficacy.

Weaknesses:
1. **Data Requirements and Availability**: The LINE framework's dependency on well-aligned data sources may limit its applicability in diverse clinical scenarios.
2. **Limited Scope**: The framework currently aligns only two LLMs, raising questions about its effectiveness with other combinations of models.
3. **Lack of Robust Comparisons**: The paper does not include comparisons with state-of-the-art models like GPT-4, which could provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
4. **Implementation Challenges**: Insufficient discussion on practical implementation challenges, such as computational requirements and scalability in real-world settings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of limitations, particularly regarding the narrow scope of application and the challenges of data availability. Additionally, consider including a comparative analysis with state-of-the-art models like GPT-4 to strengthen the evaluation. It would also be beneficial to explore the potential for generalization beyond medical text and to address potential hallucination issues during knowledge exchange. Lastly, we suggest incorporating a discussion on regulatory mechanisms and practical implementation challenges to enhance the framework's applicability in clinical settings.
