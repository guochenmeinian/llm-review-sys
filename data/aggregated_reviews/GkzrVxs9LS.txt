Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Low-Rank Feature Learning (LRFL) method aimed at enhancing thorax disease classification in radiographic images by reducing the impact of noise and non-disease areas. The authors implement LRFL through a self-modified regularization term and provide theoretical results on its generalization bounds, supported by Theorem 3.1, which relates to the truncated nuclear norm (TNNR) and generalization error. The method is evaluated on two datasets, CheXpert and COVIDx, demonstrating improved performance over multiple baselines. Additionally, the authors analyze the impact of synthetic data size on model performance, showing that the improvement of LRFL models (ViT-S-LR and ViT-B-LR) over base models (ViT-S and ViT-B) varies with the size of synthetic data, with performance improving up to a certain point before noise negatively impacts results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for addressing noise and background interference in disease classification is compelling.
- Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on various thorax disease datasets.
- The paper provides a detailed analysis of the impact of synthetic data size on model performance.
- The theoretical justification for the LRFL method is robust, supported by Theorem 3.1.
- The paper is well-structured, facilitating reader comprehension.
- The authors have made adjustments based on reviewer feedback, including the addition of comparative tables.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation is limited to two datasets, raising questions about the generalizability of the method to other diseases or datasets.
- Claims regarding the robustness of the method to noise are not substantiated with empirical evidence.
- The GradCAM visualizations lack convincing localization capabilities compared to other methods.
- The mathematical notation is inconsistent and may confuse readers.
- The comparison between LRFL and baseline methods may be unfair due to cross-validation optimizations that favor LRFL.
- The novelty of the method is questioned, as regularization in low-rank representation is a well-explored area.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by testing their method on additional datasets beyond thorax diseases to substantiate claims of broader applicability. Additionally, we suggest including alternative evaluation metrics, such as disease localization and average precision, to enhance the robustness of the findings. Clarifying the mathematical notation throughout the manuscript is essential to improve clarity. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide empirical evidence supporting claims about the method's robustness to noise and background interference, as well as to address the limitations of their approach more explicitly in the discussion section. To enhance the fairness of comparisons, we recommend ensuring that baseline models are also optimized across synthetic data sizes. Finally, addressing the concerns regarding the perceived novelty of their approach in the context of existing literature would enhance the paper's impact.
