Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents TrajImpute, a dataset designed to simulate missing coordinates in pedestrian trajectory prediction. The authors evaluate various imputation methods to reconstruct missing data and benchmark their effectiveness in trajectory prediction tasks. The research emphasizes practical applicability, providing a comprehensive analysis of imputation methods and insights into their effectiveness, thereby addressing real-world challenges in trajectory prediction.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a dataset that fills a significant gap by including missing values, enhancing the realism of trajectory prediction models.
2. It provides a thorough evaluation of multiple imputation and trajectory prediction methods, contributing valuable insights into their strengths and weaknesses.
3. The dataset and code are publicly available, promoting further research in the field.
4. The experimental design considers varying levels of missing data, ensuring reliability and comprehensiveness in results.

Weaknesses:
1. The work lacks significant theoretical innovation, primarily focusing on application and experimentation without introducing new algorithms or models.
2. The related work section is poorly organized, lacking detailed comparisons of existing datasets and their characteristics.
3. The dataset used in experiments is relatively small, limiting the verification of methods on larger-scale datasets.
4. There is insufficient analysis of the computational complexity and efficiency of the evaluated methods.
5. The interpretation of experimental results is shallow, lacking in-depth analysis of why certain models perform better under specific conditions.
6. The discussion on future work is minimal, with no specific suggestions or research directions provided.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors incorporate a more systematic analysis of the principles behind trajectory prediction and imputation methods to strengthen the paper.
2. We suggest restructuring the related work section logically, perhaps chronologically or by categories, to enhance clarity.
3. We encourage testing the methods on larger datasets to verify their scalability and effectiveness.
4. We recommend providing a detailed analysis of the computational complexity and efficiency of the methods evaluated.
5. We suggest offering more comprehensive interpretations of experimental results to elucidate performance variations.
6. We recommend expanding the discussion on potential future work and research directions to provide clearer guidance for subsequent studies.
7. We advise improving transitions between paragraphs for better readability and flow.
