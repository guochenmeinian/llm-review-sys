Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents STimage-1K4M, a comprehensive dataset that pairs histopathology images with gene expression data from spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies. It includes over 4 million image-gene expression pairs from 1,149 ST slides across various species and tissue types, aiming to enhance multimodal data analysis and computational pathology applications. The authors demonstrate improved performance of CLIP and PLIP models through fine-tuning on this dataset, highlighting its potential for advanced research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- **Diversity and Scale**: The dataset encompasses a wide range of species and tissue types, providing valuable resources for computational pathology.
- **Granular Data**: Detailed gene expression data for sub-tile images enables sophisticated multi-modal analyses.
- **Public Availability**: The dataset and associated code are publicly accessible, promoting transparency and usability within the research community.
- **Expert Annotations**: Inclusion of pathologist annotations for a subset of slides enhances the dataset's utility for model evaluation.

Weaknesses:
- **Insufficient Experimentation**: The experiments do not comprehensively cover all modalities and potential tasks mentioned in the paper, limiting the evaluation of the dataset's full capabilities.
- **Batch Effects**: The paper lacks a thorough discussion on batch effects, which could impact the generalizability of the findings.
- **Access Limitations**: Current access to the dataset is considered prohibitive, with suggestions for hosting on more accessible platforms like HuggingFace.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental design, particularly in section 5, by detailing the use of samples from Maynard et al. (2021) for fine-tuning versus evaluation. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the discussion on batch effects and considering the provision of a batch-corrected version of the dataset. To facilitate broader access, we encourage the authors to host the dataset on a public platform such as HuggingFace. Expanding the fine-tuning experiments to include diverse species and tissue types would better demonstrate the dataset's applicability. Lastly, we recommend providing additional documentation or tutorials to assist researchers, particularly those new to spatial transcriptomics.
