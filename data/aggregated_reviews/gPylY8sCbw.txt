Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to the learning problem of estimating an unknown ground truth matrix while providing confidence scores for each entry. The authors propose an algorithm that achieves sample complexity comparable to state-of-the-art results, ensuring that the matrix of confidence scores has sufficient coverage. Theorems 8 and 10 establish the theoretical foundations, with Theorem 8 demonstrating that the algorithm solves an NP-hard optimization problem, while Theorem 10 offers a tractable alternative with slightly weaker guarantees. The paper also explores online learning settings, providing sublinear regret bounds under adversarial sampling. Additionally, the authors conduct a thorough exploration of the Partial Matrix Completion Problem, specifically addressing the uniqueness of the defined set \( C \) in Line 223, and propose that a natural measure of convergence could be based on the distance to the set of \( C \) that maximizes \( |C| \) under the given constraints. The reviewers acknowledge the meaningful results obtained in this work and express appreciation for the authors' clarifications regarding Lemma 3 and Lemma 25.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The results are highly original and impactful, with significant innovation in the proofs and a new paradigm for matrix completion.
- The online learning results are of great theoretical and practical importance, showcasing nontrivial proof techniques.
- The authors have effectively addressed reviewer concerns and clarified key points in their responses.
- The paper is recognized for its high quality and meaningful contributions to the field.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity and self-containment, with several minor errors and unclear assumptions.
- The experimental section is preliminary, lacking comprehensive evaluations and comparisons with other baselines.
- There is a lack of clarity regarding the equivalence of MP3 to equation (7) and the implications of adding a symmetric PSD condition.
- The section on game-regret may mislead readers into thinking it can derive a bound on minimal regret, which is not applicable for bilinear objectives.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and self-containment of the paper by addressing the following issues:
1. Correct the proof of Lemma 3 in Appendix A1, specifically the equation on line 476.5, which currently ignores cross-terms.
2. Clearly state the conditions required for Theorem 18 regarding the learning rate $\eta$ and provide a complete citation for the relevant results.
3. Clarify whether Corollary 21 requires a uniform sampling distribution or if it applies to arbitrary distributions.
4. Provide a more detailed discussion on the limitations of the work, particularly regarding the experimental support and the performance under different sampling distributions.
5. Enhance the empirical evaluation section by including additional baselines and a more extensive dataset to substantiate the claims made in the paper.
6. Improve the explanation regarding the equivalence of MP3 to equation (7) and clarify the implications of adding a symmetric PSD condition in both the rebuttal and the paper.
7. Revise the section on game-regret to ensure it is presented as a motivational aspect rather than a claim of a minimax regret bound, given its applicability only to bilinear objectives.
