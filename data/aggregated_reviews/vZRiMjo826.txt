Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel optimal transport problem, extremal transport (ET), within the context of domain translation. The authors propose an incomplete transport (IT) problem as a surrogate optimization problem to approximate ET solutions, proving the theoretical convergence between IT and ET costs conditionally. The effectiveness of ET and IT is demonstrated through experiments on toy examples and public datasets, highlighting their relationship. Additionally, the authors introduce a method for generating images using learned transport maps, addressing the performance of the algorithm with varying weights. They provide clarifications regarding the dissimilarity between generated and input images, indicating that the average input-output dissimilarity decreases with increasing weight \( w \). The limitations of using \( \ell^2 \) cost, which is sensitive to low-frequency image components, are discussed, along with the suggestion that more advanced cost functions could enhance detail preservation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The optimal transport formulations, ET and IT, are novel and inspiring.
- The paper provides a thorough discussion on the technical differences and relationships with existing methods.
- The overall presentation is clear, and the paper is comprehensive, with theoretical results presented in a self-contained manner.
- The authors effectively address concerns about image dissimilarity and provide quantitative data to support their claims.
- The paper establishes a foundational methodology that can be built upon with advanced techniques, demonstrating the potential for future research.

Weaknesses:
- The scope and motivation for the work are unclear in the abstract and introduction, particularly regarding the incorporation of ET in domain translation.
- Certain statements lack sufficient explanations or supporting intuitions, such as the rationale behind the target domain's probability mass and the establishment of the ET framework.
- The relaxation of mass preservation conditions is not adequately justified, and comparisons with existing methods are insufficiently analyzed.
- The reliance on \( \ell^2 \) cost may overlook fine details in generated images, which could affect the overall quality of the output.
- The scope of the paper is limited, as it does not explore all possible modifications to the methodology.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for incorporating ET in domain translation, particularly in the abstract and introduction sections. Additionally, the authors should provide more detailed explanations and intuitions for key statements, such as the significance of the target domain's probability mass and the necessity of constructing ET for domain translation tasks. A concise comparison with current weak and partial OT methods should be included to explain the advantages of ET in this context. Furthermore, the authors should consider revising the organization of the "Related Works" section to follow the "Background on Optimal Transport" section, emphasizing the technical differences with each genre of OT methods. To enhance the assessment of image similarity, we recommend that the authors consider more advanced cost functions, such as perceptual metrics, to better capture fine details. Exploring kernel regularization and other enhancements could also strengthen the methodology and broaden its applicability.
