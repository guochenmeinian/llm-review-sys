Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical exploration of the deep neural collapse (DNC) phenomenon in non-linear deep models for multi-class classification. The authors demonstrate that while the NC1 property (within-class variability) remains optimal, the NC2 property (orthogonal class means) is not optimal in multi-class settings with more than two layers or classes. They construct a strongly regular graph (SRG) solution that achieves lower loss than the previously established DNC solutions, highlighting the influence of low-rank bias in multi-layer regularization schemes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper effectively extends the understanding of neural collapse by analyzing its implications in earlier layers of deep neural networks. The theoretical contributions, particularly Theorems 5 and 6, provide significant insights into the conditions under which DNC may not be optimal. The experiments conducted on benchmark datasets like MNIST and CIFAR10 support the theoretical findings robustly.

Weaknesses:  
There are concerns regarding the accuracy of the Sherman-Morrison formula in Lemma 12, which affects subsequent results. Additionally, the clarity of Definition 4 could be improved by breaking it into multiple parts. The experimental results lack justification for the claim that networks trained via gradient descent yield the SRG solution, and the rank observations in intermediate layers require further discussion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the verification of the Sherman-Morrison formula used in Lemma 12, as its correctness is crucial for the results in Theorem 5. Additionally, consider splitting Definition 4 into clearer components to enhance readability. In section 6.1, discuss the observed rank of singular values in intermediate layers more thoroughly, and provide justification for the claim regarding the SRG solution in section 6.3. Lastly, clarify the assumptions regarding feature class means being non-negative, as this is critical for the validity of the SRG solution.
