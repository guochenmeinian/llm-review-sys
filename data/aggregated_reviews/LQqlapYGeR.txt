### Key Points
This paper presents a new parallel method, Iteratively Parallel Generation with Pre-Filling strategy (IPGPF), designed for Document-level Event Extraction (DEE). The authors propose a pseudo-trigger-aware pruned complete graph (PT-PCG) representation to reduce computational complexity and utilize a pre-filling strategy to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of event extraction. Experimental results on ChFinAnn and DuEE-fin demonstrate that IPGPF achieves state-of-the-art performance. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed IPGPF method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several datasets, outperforming previous models.
- The introduction of the pre-filling strategy and PT-PCG representation improves both efficiency and accuracy in event extraction.
- The experiments are well-conducted on public datasets, enhancing the generalizability of the results.

Weaknesses:
- The complexity of the proposed method may hinder implementation for researchers unfamiliar with the techniques.
- The limited number of datasets used for evaluation may not adequately represent real-world diversity.
- The paper lacks a detailed error analysis, which could limit the interpretability of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the readability of figures by increasing the font size. Additionally, the authors should discuss the runtime implications of the additional steps introduced in their method. It would also be beneficial to provide a more comprehensive analysis of the errors made by the proposed method to enhance interpretability. Finally, expanding the evaluation to include a broader range of datasets would strengthen the generalizability of their findings.
