Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel image-to-multiview diffusion model that introduces a method for estimating focal length and elevation, along with a new cross-view attention mechanism. The authors claim that their approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in generating high-resolution images from single images, addressing practical challenges in 3D content generation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper tackles significant challenges in multiview diffusion, such as low resolution and inconsistent camera settings, proposing innovative solutions. It is noted as the first work to consider varying camera intrinsic matrices for image-to-3D generation, and it demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in single-view image generation tasks.

Weaknesses:  
The presentation of experimental results is lacking, particularly in showcasing the advantages of the proposed method in real-world scenarios. The paper does not adequately compare with recent methods like SV3D, and the novelty of the row-wise attention mechanism is questioned as it appears to be a special case of existing techniques. Additionally, critical details regarding optimization time, hyperparameters, and robustness testing are missing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation of experimental results by including more examples that demonstrate the method's effectiveness, particularly in real-world scenarios. It would be beneficial to add comparisons with SV3D and other relevant methods to substantiate claims of high resolution. We suggest conducting a thorough ablation study to justify architectural choices, particularly regarding the quality of row-wise attention compared to Dense and Epipolar methods. Furthermore, the authors should address the limitations related to the number of focal lengths considered in training and clarify the novelty of their contributions in light of existing literature.
