Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of the delayed latents across groups (DLAG) to a recurrent general form (mDLAG), enabling the analysis of contributions from multiple observational groups and identifying complex directions of information flow with time delay estimations. The authors validate their method on both synthetic and empirical datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in analyzing multi-region neural recordings. The approach is particularly relevant given the increasing prevalence of multi-region recordings in neuroscience.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is highly relevant for computational neuroscience, addressing the challenge of analyzing multi-region recordings.
- The technical novelty lies in the model description and the tractable inference scheme, facilitating the disentangling of latents across regions.
- The experiments are thorough, with well-made figures and clear presentation, enhancing the understanding of results.
- The model derivation is logically clear, with detailed clarification of notation and generative procedures.

Weaknesses:
- The order of latent variables across regions is unclear, raising questions about the preservation of latent ordering.
- There is a limited discussion of related work, particularly connections to multi-region LDS-based models, which could enhance the context of the contribution.
- The model assumes linearity and Gaussian observations, which may not adequately capture the spiking nature of neural activity.
- The computational cost of using a GP prior for temporal smoothing is high, potentially limiting applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the latent variable ordering across regions, possibly by including a post-processing step to ensure consistent ordering. Additionally, a literature review discussing connections between mDLAG and multi-region LDS-based models would provide valuable context. Addressing the limitations of linearity and Gaussian assumptions by considering alternative models, such as Poisson, would strengthen the analysis. Finally, including a discussion on the time and data requirements for reliable estimates from mDLAG would help practitioners assess the model's applicability.
