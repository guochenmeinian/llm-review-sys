### Key Points
This paper presents a new dataset for readability assessment focused on four low-resource Central Philippine languages. It trains random forest models using combinations of these languages and highlights the significance of cross-lingual data integration. The authors propose a hierarchical cross-lingual modeling approach for automatic readability assessment (ARA) and commit to releasing the dataset under a Creative Commons License.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a resource for underrepresented languages in NLP is timely and valuable.
- The dataset is designed for languages that have not been previously addressed in ARA.
- The paper introduces hierarchical cross-lingual modeling, which shows promising results and supports findings from previous research.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a clear rationale for the proposed method and does not adequately compare it with existing works.
- Details about the corpus, such as the meaning of L1, L2, and L3 levels, and the corpus size, are insufficiently explained.
- The results are not thoroughly characterized, leaving questions about the impact of data size on outcomes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the corpus description, including an explanation of L1, L2, and L3 levels and the corpus size. Additionally, a comparison with previous works should be included to contextualize the contributions of this paper. The authors should also address the questions regarding the choice of the random forest model and the implications of using Latin script for phonemic representation. Finally, providing a more in-depth characterization of the results would enhance the paper's rigor.
