Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a training-free method for personalized image generation using rectified flow models and classifier guidance, eliminating the need for extensive pre-training or subject-specific fine-tuning. The authors leverage a fixed-point method to stabilize the classifier-guided flow trajectory, applying it effectively to tasks such as transferring identities from reference images. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating personalized images for human faces and objects.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear motivation and theoretical support for the proposal.
- The methodology is efficient, adaptable, and allows the use of off-the-shelf image discriminators, broadening its applicability.
- Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing works.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical justification for Equation (6) is lacking, and clarity is needed regarding the "Time" column in Table 1, specifically whether it refers to training or inference time.
- The approach's reliance on pre-trained image discriminators may limit its applicability in domains without robust models, and the scope of experiments is narrow, primarily focusing on face-centric tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical justification or provide intuition for Equation (6) to enhance clarity. Additionally, please clarify whether the "Time" column in Table 1 refers to training or inference time and discuss how the gradient with respect to a classifier affects inference speed compared to other baselines. To strengthen the paper, we suggest expanding the experimental scope to include tasks beyond personalization, as the method is quite general. Finally, addressing the limitations related to the availability of pre-trained discriminators would further enhance the paper's applicability.
