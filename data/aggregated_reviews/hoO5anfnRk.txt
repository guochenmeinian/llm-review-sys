### Key Points
This paper presents a new retrieval task that connects textual queries to pairs of images and corresponding headlines, modifying the BLIP architecture for effective image-headline fusion. The authors also introduce the EDIS dataset, comprising 1 million images for cross-modal image search in the news domain, which includes entities and events. The paper evaluates existing methods on this dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper proposes a novel task that enhances entity recognition.  
- The EDIS dataset is a significant contribution, facilitating future research and evaluation.  
- The paper is well-written and provides sufficient support for its claims.  

Weaknesses:  
- The task formulation and dataset do not adequately evaluate the claims made in the abstract, particularly regarding entity understanding.  
- The proposed method shows only minor modifications to BLIP and does not consistently outperform existing methods like CLIP and BLIP.  
- There are concerns about the reproducibility of results due to underspecified parameters and the availability of training data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation of their proposed method by testing it on datasets such as MS-COCO and Flickr30K alongside other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we suggest clarifying how the dataset can effectively assess the understanding of entity names in relation to images and headlines. Finally, we encourage the authors to ensure that the parameter settings are clearly specified to enhance reproducibility.
