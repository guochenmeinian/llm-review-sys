Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into emergent communication frameworks for reasoning rules, proposing a cognition-oriented environment that encourages agents to communicate about high-level rules. The authors introduce a new benchmark, rule-RAVEN, which mitigates overfitting issues present in the original I-RAVEN dataset and promotes the development of a genuine communication protocol among agents. Through various experiments, the authors demonstrate that agents can successfully engage in reasoning tasks and develop a stable, compositional language.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of the rule-RAVEN benchmark is a significant contribution, providing a useful tool for analyzing emergent languages.
- The paper is well-written, with a clear description of the experimental setup and hyper-parameters.
- The two-stage curriculum training method enhances communication stability and allows agents to learn to communicate abstract rules effectively.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation behind the emergent communication framework is unclear, particularly regarding its relevance to human language origins or practical applications in human-agent interactions.
- There is limited comparison with prior work, which would help contextualize the results and enhance the paper's significance.
- The structural requirements of the new benchmark need further clarification, particularly regarding the necessity for unambiguous rules.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper's motivation, explicitly stating whether the focus is on studying the origins of human language or developing intelligent communicating agents. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the comparison with prior work that utilizes categorical variables in signaling games to better contextualize the findings. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide more detailed explanations of the structural requirements of the rule-RAVEN dataset and to explore the implications of ambiguous rules in communication. Finally, addressing the limitations regarding the applicability of the proposed methods to more complex, real-world tasks would strengthen the paper.
