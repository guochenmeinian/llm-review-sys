Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a unifying framework for analyzing common concept-based explainability methods in neural networks, positing that these methods can be viewed as dictionary learning in latent spaces. The authors compare various concept extraction methods, including ACE and T-CAV, and extend feature attribution techniques to concept-based explanations, concluding that the penultimate layer is optimal for concept extraction. They introduce novel evaluation metrics for assessing concept explanations and provide theoretical guarantees regarding the fidelity and completeness of these methods. Additionally, the authors discuss the relationship between their framework and LDA, suggesting a probabilistic formulation for broader applicability, and address the completeness-aware concept-based explanation (CCD) method, proposing a more general formulation that encompasses existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is generally clear and well-structured, making it accessible to readers.
- The unifying framework and proposed metrics are significant contributions that could benefit the broader explainable AI (XAI) community.
- The authors effectively address reviewer concerns, enhancing the clarity and strength of their arguments.
- The integration of various methods within their framework is well-articulated, providing valuable insights.
- The theoretical analysis is extensive, with sound mathematical derivations and compelling visualizations, particularly the strategic cluster graph.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical results lack novelty, appearing as trivial extensions of existing work, particularly that of Ancona et al.
- Some definitions are unreferenced, leading to potential confusion regarding the extension of feature-based metrics.
- The paper does not adequately address limitations of the proposed framework or discuss how it might fail to generalize to certain existing methods.
- The theoretical contributions are perceived as marginal compared to existing work, particularly that of Ancona et al.
- The paper's results are primarily focused on a limited set of methods, potentially overlooking broader implications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their theoretical results by providing a clearer distinction between their findings and those of Ancona et al. Additionally, we suggest including a more in-depth quantitative analysis of the strategic cluster graph and its practical applications, possibly through user studies. It would also be beneficial to discuss the limitations of the framework and how it could be expanded in future work. Furthermore, clarifying how methods like CCD and LDA fit within the proposed framework would strengthen the unifying claims. We also recommend extending their theoretical contributions beyond the penultimate layer to provide deeper insights and addressing the potential formulations of Gradient, Smoothgrad, VarGrad, SquareGrad, and RISE within the unifying framework. Lastly, enriching the perspective section to include the probabilistic formulation of the dictionary learning problem would frame the LDA method more comprehensively and enhance the overall presentation quality.
