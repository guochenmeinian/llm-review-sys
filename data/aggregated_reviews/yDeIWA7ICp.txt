Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to conversational query generation aimed at ambiguous user intent by utilizing social commonsense reasoning. The authors propose a query generation framework that includes a finetuned topic identifier, a fixed commonsense-based response generator (Cosmo), and a finetuned instruction-based query generator. The evaluation, conducted using the Wizard of Internet dataset, demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms considered baselines in generating queries and responses.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a practical issue of engaging passive users and shows promising results, with improvements over baseline methods.
- The evaluation incorporates both human and automatic assessments, alongside an error analysis, enhancing the robustness of the findings.
- The system is well-structured and the writing is clear and accessible.

Weaknesses:
- The generated queries are reported to be inferior to those produced by ChatGPT, and the paper does not adequately justify the advantages of the proposed framework over direct ChatGPT usage.
- There is insufficient discussion on the impact of commonsense reasoning on query generation, particularly regarding the zero-shot model's performance.
- The paper lacks a comparison of finetuned Flan-T5 without commonsense reasoning, which limits the robustness of the ablation studies.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the generated queries, particularly addressing why the zero-shot model with Cosmo achieves the highest informativeness score. Additionally, the authors should clarify the benefits of their framework compared to ChatGPT, including any efficiency analyses. We also suggest including a comparison of finetuned Flan-T5 without commonsense reasoning to strengthen the ablation experiments. Furthermore, please specify the decoding strategy and parameters used in each component of the framework to enhance reproducibility. Lastly, consider providing the distribution of errors after fine-tuning and revising the statistical significance markings in Table 1 for clarity.
