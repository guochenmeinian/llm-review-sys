Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an advancement of Distributed Alignment Search (DAS), termed Boundless DAS, which replaces brute-force search steps with learned parameters to efficiently explore interpretable causal structures in large language models (LLMs). The authors apply this method to the Alpaca 7B model, evaluating its ability to determine if a number falls between two others. The findings suggest that Boundless DAS can identify alignments with causal mechanisms and generalize across different input prompts. Additionally, the paper introduces the Interventional Influence Assessment (IIA) metric for evaluating causal circuits in neural models, proposing that this method can effectively identify causal variables. However, concerns are raised regarding the calibration of IIA and the reliability of the results, highlighting the need for additional experiments to validate the method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The increasing importance of LLMs necessitates effective interpretability methods, and the proposed scalable approach addresses this critical need.
- The application of causal abstraction to LLMs is original and has not been previously explored, making this work significant.
- The experimental analysis demonstrates soundness and robustness, particularly in sections 4.3 - 4.6, providing useful insights for the NLP community.
- The method shows potential value in identifying causal circuits at scale, with initial experiments providing some calibration for the IIA metric.
- The inclusion of robustness checks and random baselines adds credibility to the findings.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the paper is limited, primarily extending DAS without introducing significant innovative elements or addressing specific challenges.
- The method's reliance on learned parameters raises concerns about interpretability, as it may introduce additional complexity.
- The experimental scope is narrow, focusing on a single task and model, which limits the generalizability of the findings. The paper lacks a comprehensive discussion on how the method can be applied to more critical scenarios requiring interpretability.
- The IIA metric lacks clear calibration and validation, leading to skepticism about its reliability.
- Notational clarity and the definition of certain variables are insufficient, causing confusion among reviewers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 3 by providing a more self-contained explanation of DAS and its limitations, including computational complexity. Additionally, the authors should expand the experimental evaluation to include a wider range of tasks and models to enhance the robustness of their findings. A discussion on the implications of learned parameters for interpretability should be included, addressing how to maintain transparency in the method. We also recommend that the authors improve the calibration of the IIA metric by conducting experiments that compare IIA values against random models and known incorrect circuits. Furthermore, the authors should clarify their notation and definitions throughout the paper to enhance readability. Lastly, we suggest restructuring the presentation of robustness checks to emphasize their importance as a default validation method rather than a supplementary test, and elaborating on the potential applications of Boundless DAS in more complex and critical domains, such as medical or financial contexts, to strengthen the paper's relevance.
