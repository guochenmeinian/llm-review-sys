Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the vector set search problem, proposing a novel algorithm called DESSERT to enhance efficiency in this domain. The authors formalize the vector set search problem and provide theoretical guarantees for DESSERT, which integrates into ColBERT, achieving a 2-5x speed improvement with a minor quality trade-off. The paper includes both theoretical analysis and empirical validation, demonstrating DESSERT's effectiveness in semantic search applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors clearly articulate the significance of the vector set search problem and provide a formal definition.
- DESSERT employs an innovative hashing scheme, offering theoretical bounds and efficient query time complexity.
- The integration of DESSERT into ColBERT showcases notable speed improvements while maintaining reasonable memory requirements.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental validation is limited to the MS MARCO dataset, raising concerns about the generalizability of results to out-of-domain datasets.
- The marginal improvement in query time complexity compared to brute force methods is not sufficiently discussed, particularly regarding the impact of parameter L.
- The paper lacks comprehensive ablation studies and parameter studies, making it difficult to assess the effectiveness of implementation choices.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including results from additional datasets, such as the TREC Complex Answer Retrieval dataset, to strengthen the validation of DESSERT's performance. Additionally, conducting ablation studies to evaluate the proposed implementation tricks and providing a parameter study for critical parameters like L and C would enhance the understanding of DESSERT's effectiveness. Furthermore, we suggest refining the presentation by addressing minor typos and clarifying notations, particularly in Algorithm 2, to improve overall clarity.
