Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a notion of compatibility, an algorithm- and data-dependent term that bounds the excess risk of overparameterized linear regression models. The authors propose three regimes on the covariance matrix and characterize the compatible region, which indicates where gradient descent can effectively train the model while converging in terms of excess risk. The connection between compatibility and benign overfitting is established, alongside comparisons to stability bounds. The paper includes examples demonstrating how the compatibility region varies with covariance structure.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well-written and accessible, addressing the important topic of generalization in overparameterized models. It introduces existing bounds effectively and considers general anisotropic data, providing mild conditions for beneficial early stopping. The theoretical framework is solid, and the empirical results support the claims made.

Weaknesses:  
The study of overparameterized linear models with early stopping is less motivating, as early stopping equates to $\ell_2$ regularization, allowing for the application of uniform convergence bounds. The authors should clarify if the motivation is primarily to achieve better bounds and consider moving the comparison to stability bounds into the main text. Additionally, a relevant work is missing, which discusses different types of overfitting and could enhance the paperâ€™s context. Technical details, such as the constants $c_0$ and $c_1$, are not sufficiently explained, which could hinder understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for studying overparameterized linear models with early stopping by clarifying the primary aim of obtaining better bounds. Additionally, please include a discussion of the missing relevant work to relate your findings to existing literature. We also suggest providing clearer explanations of the constants $c_0$ and $c_1$, as well as addressing the technical questions raised regarding assumptions and notations throughout the paper.
