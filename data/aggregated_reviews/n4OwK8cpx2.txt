Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new explainable recommendation dataset, REASONER, aimed at enhancing explainable recommendation systems, particularly in the context of short video recommendations. The dataset features multi-modal and multi-aspect explanations labeled by approximately 3,000 real users and is claimed to be ten times larger than typical datasets used for explainable models. The authors detail the dataset's construction via a video recommendation platform and provide a library implementing ten popular explainable recommender models, along with benchmarks for various tasks. The dataset aims to address limitations in previous studies, such as the lack of real-user labeling and the narrow focus of explanations. Additionally, the authors propose to improve the dataset's quantity and diversity by expanding data collection, incorporating large language models (LLMs) for instruction fine-tuning, including various user profiles, and adding contextual variations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
1. The dataset's motivation is compelling, addressing significant limitations in prior research, including discrepancies between labeled results and actual user behavior.
2. The dataset is significantly larger than existing ones in the field of explainable recommendations, which enhances its utility.
3. The comprehensive library serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners, facilitating the construction and assessment of explainable recommendation systems.
4. The authors have made substantial revisions based on reviewer feedback, including the addition of recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and error bars in experimental results.
5. The dataset's design incorporates diverse user profiles and contextual information, enriching its applicability.
6. Extensive analyses of the dataset's features provide insights into its strengths and capabilities.

**Weaknesses:**
1. The dataset's focus on videos limits its applicability; expanding to other domains like news and music would enhance versatility.
2. While employing around 3,000 labelers is beneficial, the authors need to support claims regarding the representativeness of this sample through experimental data.
3. The dataset's size is still considered relatively small for training robust recommendation models.
4. Concerns about the quality of translations from Chinese to English and the empirical justification for the artificial rules used in data collection remain.
5. The rationale behind the artificial rules used to ensure data quality lacks empirical evidence, necessitating data-supported justifications.
6. The claim of evaluating multi-aspect explanations is not explicitly demonstrated, requiring specific examples or results for clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors expand the dataset to include diverse domains beyond videos to enhance its applicability for various recommendation tasks.
2. To validate the representativeness of the labeling process, the authors should compare the distribution gap between the 3,000 labelers and real users.
3. We suggest that the authors improve the dataset's size further by leveraging LLMs to generate additional labeled data.
4. It is crucial to provide empirical evidence supporting the rationale behind the artificial rules used for data quality assurance.
5. The authors should include specific examples or results that illustrate the dataset's capability to evaluate multi-aspect explanations, strengthening their claims.
6. A clearer discussion on potential biases in the dataset and how they can be mitigated would enhance the paper's robustness.
7. We encourage the authors to investigate the dwelling time of users in future work, as this could provide valuable insights into user behavior in short video recommendations.
