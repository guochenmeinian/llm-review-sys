Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach using large language models (LLMs) as gradient priors for lossless gradient compression in distributed learning settings. The authors propose LM-GC, which combines pre-trained LLMs with arithmetic coding to convert gradients into a text-like format, achieving compression rates that exceed existing methods by 10% to 21%. The method also demonstrates compatibility with lossy compression techniques and highlights potential applications in gradient denoising and differential privacy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper creatively leverages LLMs for gradient compression, showcasing novelty and potential applications beyond traditional uses.
2. LM-GC consistently outperforms established compression methods (PNG, FLAC, GZIP, LZMA) across various datasets and architectures.
3. Extensive experiments, including ablation studies, validate the method's effectiveness.
4. The discussion on broader impacts and future research directions is insightful.

Weaknesses:
1. The method incurs significant computational overhead, leading to relatively high compression times.
2. The approach requires careful tuning of multiple hyper-parameters, such as context window size and byte grouping.
3. The integration of LLMs with arithmetic coding may present complexities in implementation and replication.
4. There is a lack of comparison to specialized baseline methods for compressing floating-point values, raising questions about the advantages of using LLMs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical framework of the paper, potentially including a discussion in the appendix to address the new combination of LLMs and arithmetic coding. Additionally, the authors should provide comparisons to baseline methods specifically designed for floating-point data, such as adaptive entropy coders or static codebook methods. It would also be beneficial to report the energy costs associated with using LLMs versus traditional methods to give readers a comprehensive understanding of the practical implications. Finally, we suggest exploring optimizations to reduce computational overhead and improve throughput for LM-GC.
