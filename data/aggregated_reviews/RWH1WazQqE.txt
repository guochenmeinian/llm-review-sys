### Key Points
This paper presents a domain-agnostic self-refinement approach aimed at enhancing the performance of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) while avoiding external interferences. The authors introduce a novel ranking metric, Performance, Refinement, and Inference Cost Score (PeRFICS), to evaluate models based on performance and cost-effectiveness. Experimental results indicate an average performance improvement of 8.2% across various models, and three case studies demonstrate the practical applicability of PeRFICS in email response automation, NPC AIs in video games, and corporate LLM deployment.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The innovative domain-agnostic self-refinement approach enhances open-source LLM performance without external feedback.
- The PeRFICS metric offers a comprehensive evaluation by considering baseline performance, refinement improvement, and inference cost.
- Experimental validation shows significant performance improvements across different model sizes, supported by relevant case studies.

Weaknesses:
- Limited implementation details hinder reproducibility, particularly in section 3.1.1, where the self-refinement procedure is not clearly outlined.
- The methodology's reliance on GPT-4 as an oracle raises concerns about the trustworthiness of evaluation results.
- The paper lacks empirical comparisons to the original Self-Refine method in the experimental section, despite discussing it in the introduction.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of implementation details in section 3.1.1 to facilitate reproducibility. Additionally, we suggest providing a thorough analysis of Figures 1, 2, and 3 in Section 5 to clarify their implications and address the negative values in Figure 1. To enhance the robustness of the findings, the authors should include standard deviation or statistical tests for the experimental results. Finally, we encourage the authors to justify the trustworthiness of the evaluation results given the limitations of using GPT-4 as an oracle.
