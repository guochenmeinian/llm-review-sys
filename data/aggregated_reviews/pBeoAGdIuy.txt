Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new method of automated data collection from the Common Crawl corpus to retrieve domain-specific information, enhancing general LLMs. The authors propose a query generation technique that starts with keywords and uses BM25 for document retrieval, resulting in a dataset named Knowledge Pile, which shows effectiveness in improving LLM performance on various benchmarks. The methodology is innovative and offers a promising platform for future research in automated data collection.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The methodology for generating queries using LLMs is promising and scalable.
- The Knowledge Pile dataset is publicly available, benefiting the research community.
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The evidence supporting the superiority of the proposed method lacks proper baselines, such as comparisons with random or simpler datasets.
- The paper does not adequately discuss the limitations of the method or the potential for data contamination.
- Clarity issues exist, particularly regarding the methodology and dataset quality evaluation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of limitations, particularly regarding the differences in usefulness across domains and the potential for data contamination. Additionally, we suggest including proper baselines in the experiments to support the proposed approach, such as random baselines or comparisons with existing datasets. In Section 4.2, clearly listing the dataset size in terms of the number of tokens would enhance clarity. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide more details on the methodology for query generation and the dataset's quality assurance processes, including any post-processing steps. Lastly, addressing ethical considerations and including a dataset datasheet in the main text would strengthen the paper's contributions.
