Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents _Frugal Flows_, a method that learns the data distribution for causal effect estimation involving outcome \(Y\), binary treatment \(X\), and pretreatment covariates \(\mathbf{Z}\). By integrating frugal parametrization, normalizing flows, and copulas, the authors develop components for estimating the marginal causal effect \(p_{Y|do(X)}\), the probability integral transforms of \(\mathbf{Z}\), and the propensity score. The learned model can estimate the marginal effect and generate synthetic data with a fixed marginal effect for benchmarking other causal inference methods. The method is validated on small synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and addresses a significant problem in causality research, particularly in generating realistic synthetic data.
- The approach allows for general constraints on quantities of interest, such as average causal effect and unobserved confounding, enhancing its relevance in the field.
- The proposed method is novel, building on established concepts while focusing on average causal effect estimation.

Weaknesses:
- Normalizing Flows have been previously utilized in causal modeling, and contrasting this work with prior literature would enhance its context.
- Basic causal assumptions are not explicitly stated, leaving ambiguity regarding the implications of \(\mathbf{Z}\) as a mediator.
- Notation for interventional distributions is confusing, and a visual abstract could clarify the integration of different flows and distributions.
- Limited empirical validation is a concern; more extensive experiments and comparisons with prior works would strengthen the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the basic causal assumptions, explicitly stating the implications for \(X\), \(Y\), and \(\mathbf{Z}\). Additionally, we suggest clarifying the notation for interventional distributions to avoid confusion. A visual abstract could effectively illustrate how the different flows and distributions interact. To enhance empirical validation, we recommend conducting more comprehensive experiments and comparing the proposed method with prior works, such as those by Javaloy et al. and Wendong et al., to establish its effectiveness in capturing user-specified constraints on the average causal effect.
