### Key Points
This paper presents JGRM, a novel representation learning framework that integrates GPS and route trajectories using self-supervised technology. The framework employs specialized encoders to capture the characteristics of both trajectory types and utilizes a shared transformer for inter-modal information interaction. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of JGRM, demonstrating improved performance in various trajectory representation tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper proposes a joint modeling approach for GPS and route trajectories, showcasing potential for future research.
- The writing is clear and logical, with thorough explanations of prior methods' limitations.
- Comprehensive experiments are well-presented, with detailed analysis of results.

Weaknesses:
- Abbreviations such as "GAL," "TE," and "MLM" are not defined in the Introduction, requiring clarification.
- The differences between intra-road and inter-road BiGRUs are unclear, and the rationale for not using transformers in these components needs further explanation.
- The feature selection process for GPS trajectories lacks detail, and the encoding methods for these features are not adequately explained.
- Several terms, including GATLayer and TransEncoder, require definitions.
- The analysis of pre-training effects is limited to travel time estimation, with no exploration of its impact on other tasks.
- Some grammar errors and editing issues are present, affecting clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of abbreviations by defining them upon first use. Additionally, the authors should provide specific references to support claims made in section 4.1 and clarify the meaning of terms in Formula (6). It would be beneficial to elaborate on the methodology for determining hyperparameters “w_1, w_2, and w_3” in Formula (17) and to explain the significance of the dotted red line in Figure 4. We suggest conducting a module replacement analysis to explore the potential for alternative architectures, such as transformers, in the BiGRUs. Furthermore, the authors should provide a more comprehensive analysis of the pre-training impact on all downstream tasks and clarify the motivation behind the feature selection process. Lastly, careful proofreading is necessary to correct grammar errors and improve overall readability.
