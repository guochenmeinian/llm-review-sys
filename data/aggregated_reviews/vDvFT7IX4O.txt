### Key Points
This paper presents the "Tree of Clarifications" (ToC), a retrieval-based framework designed to address ambiguity in open-domain question answering by constructing a tree of disambiguations. The ToC method enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to clarify ambiguous questions, achieving state-of-the-art results on the ASQA dataset. The authors demonstrate that ToC outperforms existing baselines and fully supervised models, utilizing few-shot prompting and retrieval to generate comprehensive long-form answers.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed ToC framework is novel and effectively addresses ambiguity in question answering.
- Experimental results indicate significant improvements over standard LLMs and existing baselines on the ASQA benchmark.
- The paper includes useful ablations that clarify the contributions of different components of the framework.

Weaknesses:
- The results are limited to a single dataset (ASQA) and one LLM model (GPT-3), raising concerns about generalizability.
- The complexity of the tree structure may pose challenges for deployment in production environments.
- There is a lack of analysis regarding the effectiveness of the various components of ToC, particularly in isolating the contributions of retrieval versus the tree structure.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by including results from additional datasets. Additionally, we suggest providing a detailed analysis of the separate components of ToC to clarify the source of improvements, particularly regarding the role of retrieval in disambiguation. It would be beneficial to include latency and efficiency measurements to assess the computational costs associated with the recursive framework. Finally, we encourage the authors to consider incorporating a diversity-based reranking of retrieved passages to enhance the handling of ambiguity.
