Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of online learning in discrete and continuous data streams, introducing two novel learning frameworks: the update-and-deploy setting, which allows for discrete querying to update a predictor, and the blind-prediction setting, where predictions are made without current data observation. The authors prove an error bound for non-adaptive learners in the update-and-deploy setting and demonstrate that no learning algorithm can learn in the blind-prediction setting. Additionally, they characterize learning algorithms for continuous data streams and extend results to discrete data streams for deterministic algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper proposes two novel frameworks for learning under continuous data streams and provides substantial theoretical analysis, including error bounds and findings for both settings.
2. It contributes significantly to the understanding of different learners for pattern classes and extends results to discrete data streams.
3. The introduction of the query-learning distance (QLD) measure and the development of an optimal mistake-bound algorithm with respect to QLD are noteworthy.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks empirical validation and does not compare its results with existing solutions or extensions to their framework.
2. The writing quality is inconsistent, with unclear sections and undefined notations that hinder comprehension.
3. The paper feels overloaded with results, making it difficult for readers to follow without consulting the appendix.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by defining notations earlier and ensuring that all key concepts, such as the Littlestone dimension, are explicitly mentioned. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide empirical validation of their results and comparisons with existing solutions to enhance the paper's impact. Finally, we encourage the authors to streamline the presentation of results to avoid overwhelming readers, potentially focusing more on Algorithm 1 to create a self-contained theory paper with significant conclusions.
