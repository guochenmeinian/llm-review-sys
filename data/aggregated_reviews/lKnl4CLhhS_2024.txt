Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the residuals-to-marginals (ReM) method, a novel approach for constructing marginals from input data residuals while ensuring differential privacy. ReM estimates true residuals from noisy data and transforms these into target marginals. The authors propose two variants: ReM-LNN, which enforces non-negativity constraints for improved accuracy, and GReM-MLE, which is efficient for Gaussian noise scenarios. An extension incorporating MWEM identifies useful residuals for marginal construction, providing an end-to-end solution. Experimental results indicate that ReM significantly reduces errors compared to baseline methods and demonstrates good scalability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces ReM, a new approach to constructing marginals from residuals.
- ReM reduces errors compared to some baseline methods.
- ReM can be applied as a post-processing method to enhance the accuracy of existing techniques.
- The proposed algorithms show improved efficiency and strong experimental performance.

Weaknesses:
- The comparison of ReM against MWEM and Private-PGM omits state-of-the-art methods like AIM and PrivMRF, raising questions about its advancement in the field.
- The definition of k_tau in Algorithm 2 is unclear, and the necessity of injecting noise multiple times for each marginal is not justified.
- The discussion on computational complexity lacks clarity, particularly regarding the claim that the proposed algorithms "will not have exponential complexity."
- The paper does not compare with several notable reconstruction methods, which would help contextualize its contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definition of k_tau in Algorithm 2 and justify the multiple noise injections for each marginal. Additionally, please include the derivation of L_tau and provide a detailed argument for the closed-form solution mentioned. We suggest addressing the computational complexity concerns by discussing known hardness results related to differential privacy and clarifying why the proposed algorithms do not exhibit exponential complexity. Finally, we encourage the authors to include comparisons with other reconstruction methods to better contextualize their contributions.
