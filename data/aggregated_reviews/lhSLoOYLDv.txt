### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework for persuasive dialogue that integrates conversation semantics and strategies, utilizing a BERT-like module for semantic matching and an auto-regressive predictor for strategy generation. The proposed method demonstrates improved performance over some baselines on two datasets, including a newly constructed large-scale dataset, DebtRiskAlert.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The framework effectively combines strategy and semantic matching, showing significant improvements over older baselines.
2. The paper is well-written, with clear motivation and methodology.
3. The construction of a large dataset enhances the potential for future research in persuasive dialogue.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the proposed model is questioned, as it appears to combine existing works without sufficient innovation.
2. The evaluation metrics and results are not clearly linked, making it difficult to assess the claimed improvements.
3. The reliance on outdated baselines and the lack of public availability for the new dataset hinder reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the evaluation results by explicitly linking the claimed performance metrics to the results presented in the evaluation sections. Additionally, consider providing a notations/nomenclature table to enhance readability, and include an example in Figure 2 to clarify the flow of the proposed method. To strengthen the paper's contributions, we suggest comparing the proposed model against more recent baselines and ensuring that the dataset is made publicly available to facilitate reproducibility. Lastly, clarify how the model addresses the issue of multiple strategies in a single utterance.
