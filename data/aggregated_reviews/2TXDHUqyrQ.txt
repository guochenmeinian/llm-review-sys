Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DiffuserLite, a lightweight framework that employs a Plan Refinement Process (PRP) to generate trajectories from coarse to fine-grained levels, significantly enhancing planning efficiency by reducing redundant information modeling. DiffuserLite achieves a decision-making frequency of 122.2Hz, making it 112.7 times faster than existing frameworks, thus suitable for real-time applications. The framework can also be integrated as a flexible plugin to accelerate other diffusion planning algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including D4RL, Robomimic, and FinRL.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- DiffuserLite's decision-making frequency of 122.2Hz represents a significant speed improvement, crucial for real-time applications.
- The PRP effectively reduces redundant information in long-term planning, enhancing overall planning efficiency.
- The framework's flexibility as a plugin allows for integration with other diffusion planning algorithms, broadening its applicability.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the PRP is somewhat limited, as similar hierarchical approaches have been previously introduced in works like HDMI and HD-DA.
- The paper lacks detailed explanations of certain terms and concepts, such as "reflow" and the "uniform critic," which could benefit from clarification.
- There is insufficient theoretical justification for the experimental results, and the complexity introduced by the multi-level refinement process requires further analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of terms and concepts, particularly "reflow" and the various meanings of "PRP," to avoid confusion. Additionally, providing a theoretical justification for the experimental results would strengthen the paper. We suggest including more detailed discussions on design choices and hyperparameter selection, as well as conducting more ablation studies to enhance understanding of the method's generalizability. Finally, addressing the scalability of DiffuserLite to more complex real-world scenarios would add significant value to the paper.
