### Key Points
This paper presents a novel dataset for multimodal task guidance called Watch, Talk and Guide (WtaG), consisting of approximately 10 hours of egocentric videos where users follow a recipe under human instruction. The authors define two primary tasks: user environment understanding and instructor decision-making, framing these as classification tasks for easier evaluation. They employ a foundational model (GPT-3.5) without task-specific fine-tuning, utilizing two input strategies: scene description via BLIP-2 and object/state detection. Results indicate low accuracy due to the task's complexity and the zero-shot setting, with visual information often leading to hallucinations. The subjective quality of task guidance suggests potential for future modeling of user behavior.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is innovative and addresses the complex scenario of task guidance in real-world settings.
- The dual annotation of dialogue and classification of interactions and mistakes enhances the dataset's utility.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on a foundational model without a trained baseline limits the approach's effectiveness.
- The paper lacks details on the demographics and experience of subjects involved in data collection.
- There is insufficient analysis of the dataset's conversational examples and the interactivity between users and instructors.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the problem definition and provide a baseline model trained on their dataset to enhance the evaluation. Additionally, the authors should include more comprehensive details regarding the subjects' demographics and experiences in the data collection process. We suggest incorporating more examples of the dataset's conversations and a deeper analysis of user-instructor interactions. Furthermore, addressing the questions regarding the dataset's language and the handling of time synchronization issues would strengthen the paper.
