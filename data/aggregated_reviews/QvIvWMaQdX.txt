Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel technique for approximate nearest neighbor search (ANN) using a variant of spill trees that incorporates a penalty term in the assignment function to reduce correlation among retrieved points. The authors propose a new loss function that identifies k-alternate centroids, enhancing the efficiency of vector quantization and improving recall@k scores on benchmark datasets. The empirical results indicate state-of-the-art performance, particularly on large-scale datasets, with minimal computational overhead.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant problem in ANN search, providing a clear and sound idea supported by rigorous theory.
- The proposed method demonstrates outstanding empirical results, particularly in recall@100 metrics on larger datasets.
- The approach is characterized by simplicity and ease of implementation, with a solid theoretical foundation.
- The authors effectively articulate the motivation behind their loss function and provide a compelling correlation analysis to support their findings.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical assumption regarding uniform query distribution over a d-dimensional unit sphere is unrealistic, although the method performs well despite this limitation.
- Section 3.5 lacks detail; a more structured explanation of the final algorithm is needed, including memory considerations.
- The improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods, such as ScaNN, is marginal, necessitating a clearer discussion of trade-offs.
- A formal theoretical analysis of time and space complexity would enhance understanding of the computational requirements.
- The paper could benefit from additional results on datasets focused on inner product metrics and a more comprehensive discussion of the complexity of storage under spilled VQ assignment.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of terminology by using "partition element" instead of "partition" to avoid confusion. Additionally, please provide a definition of "quantized score error" in the main text and clarify whether spilling is done hierarchically. We suggest including more details in Section 4.1 about comparisons with spill trees and relevant literature. A formal theoretical analysis of time and space complexity would also be valuable. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to explore the impact of using multiple alternate centroids on recall performance and to provide a proper definition of "distortion" in Figure 8. Lastly, we encourage the authors to consider incorporating their method into common open-source tools like FAISS and ScaNN to increase adoption.
