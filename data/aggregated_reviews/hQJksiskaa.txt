### Key Points
This paper presents a fine-grained price of anarchy analysis for autobidders employing non-uniform bid-scaling strategies in first-price auctions. It demonstrates that first-price auctions are more efficient when autobidders are less powerful and when slices are more balanced. The authors investigate the inefficiencies caused by non-uniform bidding and propose a model that segments auctions into slices, allowing bidders to bid differently across slices while maintaining uniformity within each slice.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The theoretical analysis of the price of anarchy in first-price auctions with non-uniform autobidders is concrete and insightful.  
2. The definition of balancedness in auctions, related to the efficiency concerning autobidders, is an interesting contribution.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The main conclusions, while theoretically proven, are somewhat unsurprising, which diminishes the paper's contribution.  
2. The framework of the slice-based model is restrictive, as it assumes all bidders use the same auction partitions, which may not reflect real-world bidding behaviors. Additionally, the definition of unbalancedness lacks intuitive clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the model by explicitly stating the assumption that all bidders use the same slices and discussing its limitations. Furthermore, we suggest providing a practical scenario that fits the model's setting to enhance its applicability. Additionally, exploring the implications of bidders having different slice partitions could strengthen the analysis, even if it complicates the bounds. Lastly, we encourage the authors to offer more intuitive explanations for the definition of unbalancedness and its derivation.
