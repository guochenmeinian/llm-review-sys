Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a temporal predictive coding model designed for memorizing and recalling sequences, demonstrating improved performance over asymmetric Hopfield networks. The authors provide a theoretical evaluation linking temporal predictive coding networks to asymmetric Hopfield networks, highlighting the implicit statistical whitening process that enhances performance. The multilayer temporal predictive coding network develops higher-order representations of items and context, addressing the challenge of storing sequences with repeated items.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-structured, with clear theoretical results that elucidate the connections between temporal predictive coding and asymmetric Hopfield networks.  
- It shows good performance in complex sequential memory tasks and develops interesting representations relevant to neuroscience.  
- The mathematical grounding is strong, and the model maintains capacity despite increased feature correlation due to implicit statistical whitening.  

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty is limited, as the work is a trivial extension of prior research, particularly lacking rigorous presentation of Property 1 and failing to impose necessary conditions on the data covariance matrix.  
- There is insufficient robust retrieval evaluation, particularly regarding the model's performance under noise.  
- The paper lacks direct comparisons with neural or behavioral data, which could strengthen claims about its relevance to biological memory mechanisms.  
- Missing references to foundational works in temporal sequence association and predictive coding limit the contextualization of the research.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of the work by addressing the triviality of the extension from prior studies and rigorously presenting Property 1 with necessary conditions. Additionally, we suggest conducting further experimental evaluations to assess the model's robustness to noise in sequence storage. It would be beneficial to include direct comparisons with neural or behavioral data, such as free recall tasks, to substantiate claims about the model's relevance to biological memory. Finally, we encourage the authors to incorporate missing references and compare their work with alternative biologically plausible implementations of asymmetric Hopfield networks.
