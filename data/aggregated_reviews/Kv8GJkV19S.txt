### Key Points
This paper presents a tester-learner for halfspaces in the agnostic setting and under Massart noise, addressing the challenge of designing algorithms that do not rely on specific distributional assumptions. The authors propose a tester that simultaneously accepts all Poincar√© distributions meeting certain niceness conditions, which includes isotropic strongly log-concave distributions. Their approach allows for an error of $O(\mathrm{opt}) + \varepsilon$ in the agnostic setting and $\mathrm{opt} + \varepsilon$ under Massart noise. The work builds on previous studies by providing a more general framework that does not overfit to specific distributions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The design of tester-learners that accept a broad class of distributions is a significant advancement in making testable learning applicable in practice. The paper is well-written and presents a clear technical explanation of the tester's properties, which are essential for proving accuracy in a non-testable setting. The use of SoS to certify hypercontractivity is a notable technical contribution.

Weaknesses:  
The technical overview may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with prior work or the general area. Additionally, the results appear to be moderate improvements over previous works, which may render the contribution feel somewhat incremental. A comparison of the approximation factor with other testable and non-testable learners would enhance the paper's depth.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the accessibility of the technical overview to cater to a wider audience. Additionally, it would be beneficial to compare the approximation factor in the agnostic setting to (a) testable learners that work for a specific distribution and (b) non-testable learners for the same distribution class. Clarifying the implications of Theorem 4.1 regarding log-concave distributions and exploring the applicability of their techniques to other types of noise would also strengthen the paper.
