Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a bi-level optimization framework for toxicity classification that integrates crowdsourced annotations with soft-labeling techniques. The authors propose optimizing soft-label weights using Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (GroupDRO) to enhance robustness against spurious correlations. The method alternates between minimizing empirical risk and optimizing label weights, demonstrating superior performance in both average and worst-case scenarios compared to baseline methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of crowdsourced annotations with soft-labeling and bi-level optimization is a novel approach that effectively addresses significant shortcomings of existing methods.
- The paper provides a theoretical proof of convergence for the bi-level optimization algorithm, enhancing the credibility of the method.
- Extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms existing baseline methods and state-of-the-art models, particularly in handling out-of-distribution data.

Weaknesses:
- The methodology may duplicate existing methods, raising questions about originality and novelty.
- The proposed method's multiple optimization loops could be computationally expensive, potentially limiting scalability.
- The relevance of the method to the research context is unclear, and the experimental datasets may not adequately reflect real-world scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the differences between their method and existing approaches, particularly in citation [50], to highlight key innovations. Additionally, we suggest providing a detailed explanation of mathematical notations related to DRO, especially the definition of $\mathcal{R}$, to enhance reader understanding. The authors should also elaborate on the process of distinguishing between core and spurious features, ensuring that the mechanism is clearly articulated. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to analyze the computational overhead introduced by the bi-level optimization process and compare it with traditional methods. Lastly, we recommend expanding the experimental validation to include diverse datasets to improve the generalizability of the results and enhance the literature review by incorporating recent research published in the last two years.
