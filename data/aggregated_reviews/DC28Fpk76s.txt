Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for calculating conditional probabilities in causal Bayesian networks (CBNs) based on the independence of mechanisms, challenging Pearl's previous assertions. The authors propose that under certain conditions, specifically when outcomes are independent across different parent instantiations, counterfactual queries can be derived from CBNs, which traditionally require functional causal models for such reasoning. Additionally, the paper introduces a framework that demonstrates the usefulness of causal graphs in various applications where exogenous variables can be observed, including debugging systems, manufacturing pipelines, sports performance modeling, urban planning, agricultural yield modeling, and transportation management. Each example illustrates how their techniques can address specific queries related to the impact of various parameters on outcomes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized and presents its definitions clearly, making it relatively easy to follow despite the complex notation.
- The main idea is intuitive and significant, with helpful examples illustrating the conversion of CBNs to structural causal models (SCMs).
- The rigorous proofs provided support the claims made regarding the identifiability of interventional formulas in CBNs.
- The authors provide diverse and relevant examples that effectively showcase the applicability of their framework across multiple domains.
- They demonstrate responsiveness to reviewer feedback by clarifying concerns and proposing modifications.

Weaknesses:
- The paper suffers from imprecise language and terminology, leading to potential confusion, particularly regarding the distinction between CBNs and functional causal models.
- Many assumptions, especially concerning independence, lack sufficient justification and real-world examples, which diminishes the paper's convincing power.
- The clarity of presentation is compromised by the complexity of definitions and notations, and the connection between CBNs and SCMs is inadequately explained.
- The motivation for the paper is currently unclear due to the unavailability of Beckers' findings, raising concerns about the timing of the publication. If these findings remain unpublished for an extended period, the paper may be considered premature.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their terminology, particularly in distinguishing between "causal Bayesian networks" and "functional causal models," to avoid confusion. Additionally, we suggest providing concrete, real-world examples that satisfy the independence assumptions to strengthen the paper's arguments. It would also be beneficial to include a discussion of the limitations and implications of the assumptions made, particularly regarding unobserved variables. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to enhance the motivation for their work by ensuring that Beckers' findings are available in a timely manner and by adding a discussion that explains why the problem is deeper than just a counterexample, as indicated in their response to reviewer feedback.
