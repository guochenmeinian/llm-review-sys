### Key Points
This paper presents a method for Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) called $Sp^2GCL$, which contrasts spatial and spectral views using EigenMLP, an equivariant model that precomputes the k smallest eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors for a graph. The spatial view is derived from a message passing GNN, while the spectral view is made sign invariant and permutation equivariant. The authors utilize the InfoNCE contrastive function as the objective and apply a linear classifier for downstream tasks after self-supervised training.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper proposes an important direction of combining spatial and spectral views.
2. The method achieves competitive results compared to baselines.

Weaknesses:
1. The fixed views for each node/graph may limit the ability to obtain multiple positive views, potentially restricting learning to fixed representations that may not scale well.
2. The contribution is considered limited as traditional Graph Neural Networks (like GCN) share similarities with EigenMLP, raising concerns about the effectiveness of simply contrasting these two representations.
3. The results do not show a clear enhancement over existing methods, suggesting that the proposed approach may not introduce significant advancements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on how to obtain multiple positive views for nodes/graphs to enhance learning scalability. Additionally, we suggest providing more theoretical and empirical analysis to validate the stability of the method, particularly regarding the introduction of Fourier features and their influence. Clarifying the computational overheads of EigenMLP and addressing the concerns about the effectiveness of contrasting spatial and spectral views would also strengthen the paper.
