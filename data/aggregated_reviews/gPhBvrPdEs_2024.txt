Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an unsupervised optimization method for partial shape matching between (near-)isometric shapes, introducing the "Consistent Pairs" concept that identifies point pairs with similar geodesic distances on full and partial shapes. The authors extend existing criteria for filtering inconsistent pairs by incorporating extrinsic information, resulting in a new criterion that enhances the identification of consistent pairs. The proposed method shows competitive results on datasets such as CUTS, HOLES, PFAUST-M, and PFAUST-H, demonstrating its applicability in multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) and partial shape matching.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a relevant and challenging problem in the shape matching community, particularly in an unsupervised setting.
- The method exhibits interesting applicability in MDS embeddings and shows significant improvements over state-of-the-art results in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed method is limited to simpler cases, performing better on HOLES than on CUTS, where large missing parts hinder approximation by straight lines.
- The theoretical depth is lacking, as the method is a modification of existing ideas with limited new insights. The paper does not adequately discuss failure cases or analyze the impact of partiality magnitude on finding guaranteed pairs.
- Some presentation aspects are unsatisfactory, including cluttered explanations and inadequate visualizations for black-and-white printing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical depth of the paper by providing a more comprehensive analysis of failure cases and the impact of partiality magnitude on the proposed strategy. Additionally, enhancing the clarity of the presentation by simplifying explanations and improving visualizations would be beneficial. The authors should also consider evaluating the method's performance in the presence of disconnected components and using other correspondence techniques beyond DiffusionNet features to demonstrate broader generalization capabilities. Finally, providing specific details on the threshold for the soft mask and its sensitivity to model performance would enhance the understanding of the regularization approach.
