### Key Points
This paper presents Direct Preference Heads (DPH), a novel method for aligning language models (LLMs) with human preferences at inference time. DPH introduces an auxiliary reward head that predicts human preference scores for generated outputs, allowing the model to self-evaluate and select the highest-scoring responses. The authors argue that DPH avoids the reasoning degradation associated with traditional Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) methods and requires only a single model for both responses and rewards. The paper provides a theoretical analysis linking DPH to Conservative DPO and demonstrates that DPH consistently outperforms supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and DPO across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Theoretical Insight: The paper connects DPH to cDPO, providing proofs that support the convexity and effectiveness of the proposed loss functions.
- Novel Approach: DPH allows for preference-aligned model fine-tuning without directly affecting the output distribution, potentially reducing negative side effects like hallucination.
- Strong Empirical Results: DPH shows improved performance across multiple tasks compared to various baselines.

Weaknesses:
- Experimental Setup: The comparisons made are flawed, as the authors evaluate their method against models with different training settings rather than other alignment techniques, complicating the assessment of DPH's superiority.
- Clarity and Organization: The writing lacks clarity, with methodological sections misplaced, affecting the logical flow and understanding of the paper.
- Dependence on Initial Sample Quality: The effectiveness of DPH relies on the quality of initial responses, which could limit its practical application.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental setup by directly comparing DPH with other preference tuning algorithms (DPO, KTO, IPO) to provide a clearer assessment of its effectiveness. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the relationship between the auxiliary reward head and the backbone model updates, as the current implementation appears to contradict their claim of not altering the output distribution. Furthermore, enhancing the clarity and organization of the paper, particularly by correctly placing methodological sections, would significantly improve readability. Lastly, addressing the computational cost of sampling multiple candidate outputs at inference time would provide valuable insights for real-world applications.
