Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents K-DIAL, which focuses on knowledge-grounded dialogue response generation and aims to improve factual consistency through extended feedforward networks (FFNs) in Transformers and a reinforcement learning method for factual consistency (RLFC). The authors propose that the limitations of pre-trained language models (PLMs) contribute to factual inconsistency and introduce a new FFN unit to enhance knowledge expression. They conduct experiments on the WoW and CMU_DoG datasets to validate their approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work identifies a significant issue in knowledge-grounded dialogue generation and proposes two solutions to enhance factual consistency.
- The evaluation design is comprehensive, employing numerous metrics that could serve as a benchmark for future research.
- Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Weaknesses:
- The claim that the given knowledge is always correct is overly strong and impractical, as retrieving completely accurate knowledge is challenging.
- The paper lacks comparisons with relevant existing methods, limiting insights into its contributions.
- The organization of the paper is unclear, with ambiguous figures and insufficient details on the RLFC training process and human evaluation criteria.
- The experiments are not comprehensive, lacking necessary baselines and ablation studies, and inconsistencies in reported results raise concerns about reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization of the paper for better clarity and coherence. Specifically, they should clarify the details of the RLFC training process, including reward design and optimization objectives, and provide comprehensive information on human evaluation metrics. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with relevant existing methods to contextualize their contributions and conducting more thorough experiments, including ablation studies and evaluations on additional datasets. Finally, addressing inconsistencies in reported results will enhance the credibility of their findings.
