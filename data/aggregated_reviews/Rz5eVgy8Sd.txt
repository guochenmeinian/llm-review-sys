### Key Points
This paper presents an intent-based and annotation-free method, Intent-DQD, for detecting duplicate questions in Community Question Answering (CQA) forums. The authors propose a three-step process: intent recognition, intent matching, and duplication detection, leveraging CQA characteristics to automatically extract training data for intent recognition. Experiments across 15 domains from two datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method addresses the critical challenge of duplicate question detection in CQA forums without requiring human annotations, thus reducing labeling costs.
- Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Intent-DQD across multiple domains.
- The paper is clearly written and contributes valuable insights to the field of NLP.

Weaknesses:
- The method requires explicit mention of intents, which limits its applicability to cases where intents are implicit.
- Clarity issues exist regarding intent extraction and the connection between different components of the model, particularly in section 3.1 and Figure 3.
- The writing contains several typos and grammatical errors that hinder readability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of intent extraction methods and explicitly connect the components illustrated in Figure 3. Additionally, addressing the writing issues, such as correcting typos and grammatical mistakes, will enhance readability. It is also essential to discuss the applicability of the method to new CQA forums and provide insights into the effectiveness of the intent extraction strategies.
