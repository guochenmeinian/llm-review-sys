Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the first Pedestrian-Vehicle Collision Pose dataset (PVCP) and a solution (PPSENet) focused on estimating the 3D pre-collision pose of pedestrians from dashcam footage. The dataset includes over 40,000 frames with various annotations (2D, 3D, and human mesh), allowing for diverse evaluation protocols. The authors acknowledge that the limited data volume is a constraint due to the rarity of pedestrian collision poses in real-world scenarios. The proposed method employs a top-down approach, initially predicting 2D poses before lifting them to a 3D mesh using iterative regression and a novel pose class loss, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the PVCP dataset. The authors emphasize the dataset's potential applications in pedestrian collision warning and emergency response systems for autonomous vehicles, asserting that it can significantly enhance road traffic safety by enabling accurate estimation of pedestrian collision poses.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The dataset features multiple annotation types, providing extensive evaluation opportunities for various methods.  
2. The authors have established a comprehensive dataset creation process and published SMPL pose annotation tools, facilitating further research.  
3. The topic is relevant and addresses pedestrian safety in daily life, expanding the scope of human pose estimation.  
4. The dataset's applications extend beyond HPE to include critical areas such as collision avoidance and post-accident analysis, enhancing its relevance in autonomous driving.  
5. The authors are exploring data augmentation techniques to improve dataset generalization capabilities.  
6. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The significance of the problem is questioned, as pre-collision poses may not differ substantially from normal poses, and evidence is needed to support their importance in collision avoidance.  
2. The current scale of the dataset is relatively small, which limits its immediate applicability.  
3. The top-down method may not be suitable for real-time applications, which is critical for pre-collision pose estimation.  
4. Enhancements in real-time performance and generalization capabilities of the models are necessary for broader implementation in autonomous systems.  
5. The method's performance compared to existing datasets like COCO raises concerns, particularly regarding the effectiveness of the proposed approach.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the necessity of the PVCP dataset by addressing the following questions:  
1. Are pre-collision poses significantly different from normal poses, and can the authors provide solid evidence to support this claim?  
2. What experimental results demonstrate that pre-collision poses are crucial for reducing collision rates?  
3. Clarify the processing time (inference time) of the proposed method and whether it qualifies as a real-time solution.  
4. Discuss the performance of the method when trained solely on COCO or another large human pose dataset without fine-tuning on PVCP.  

Additionally, we suggest enhancing the discussion around the dataset's annotation process to ensure accuracy, including details on annotator recruitment and training. We also recommend that the authors actively seek collaborations with other researchers to expand data collection efforts to improve the dataset's volume. Enhancing the real-time performance of the models should be prioritized to ensure their effectiveness in practical applications. Finally, further exploration of data augmentation techniques could help in addressing the dataset's limitations and improving model generalization.
