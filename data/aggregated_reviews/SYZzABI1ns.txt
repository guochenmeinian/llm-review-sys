Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CS-Bench, a bilingual Chinese-English benchmark comprising 5000 tasks aimed at training large language models (LLMs) on general computer science (CS) knowledge and skills. The authors claim that this benchmark fills a gap in existing evaluation methods that focus primarily on foundational skills like mathematics and code generation, asserting that understanding LLM performance in CS is crucial for the field. However, the motivations provided for this benchmark lack sufficient justification, particularly the assertion that CS is fundamentally linked to reasoning abilities and human intelligence, which is not supported by existing research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The benchmark is well-designed and addresses a significant gap in evaluating LLMs in CS.
- The paper is clearly written and organized, providing a smooth reading experience.

Weaknesses:
- The motivations for creating the benchmark are inadequately justified, particularly regarding the relationship between CS and reasoning abilities.
- The broader impacts section fails to address the potential risk of the benchmark facilitating academic dishonesty in CS education.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the benchmark's significance by providing evidence for the claimed relationship between CS and reasoning abilities. Additionally, we suggest addressing the potential ethical concerns related to academic dishonesty in the broader impacts section. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to consider including more languages in the dataset to enhance its multilinguality and to evaluate the benchmark against a wider range of models beyond GPT-4.
