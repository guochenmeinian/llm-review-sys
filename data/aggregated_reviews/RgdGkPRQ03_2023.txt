Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents **WildfireSpreadTS**, a new dataset for predicting wildfire spread, consisting of time series data from 13,607 images across 607 fire events in the United States, covering the years 2018 to 2021. The dataset integrates multi-sensor satellite data, including VIIRS optical imagery, vegetation indices, and weather data, all harmonized to a common spatio-temporal framework with a 24-hour temporal and 375 m spatial resolution. The authors propose a temporal forecasting focus, extending prior work that primarily addressed live detection or single-day time horizons. They benchmark five fundamentally different models to evaluate the dataset's capabilities and emphasize ease of use for researchers through a 12-fold cross-validation approach. The dataset will be publicly released on Zenodo, ensuring accessibility and accountability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset addresses the increasing frequency of wildfires and provides a meaningful extension in temporal forecasting.
- It includes a harmonized collection of relevant variables, such as weather forecasts alongside historical data, which mitigates distribution shifts between training and production.
- The authors benchmark various models, enhancing the reliability of performance estimates and encouraging further research and development of sophisticated predictive models.
- The dataset is designed to be accessible for researchers in computer vision, promoting ease of experimentation.

Weaknesses:
- The submission primarily consists of existing publicly available data, raising questions about the novelty of the dataset.
- The dataset lacks certain features, such as fire ignitions from VIIRS and proxies for anthropogenic drivers, which could enhance its comprehensiveness.
- The reported experimental results are mixed, leading to concerns about the suitability of the chosen baselines and the dataset's design.
- The dataset is not fully ML-ready due to variable image sizes and requires careful preparation of training, validation, and testing samples.
- There are discrepancies regarding the digital elevation model used, which may affect the reproducibility of results, and the paper does not sufficiently address potential noise introduced by downscaling weather data from 27 km to 375 m resolution.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the demonstration of the practical benefits of including additional features, such as fire ignitions from VIIRS, fire radiative power, and burnt areas, through ablation studies. It would be beneficial to run experiments with varying input time lengths and subsets of input features to clarify their significance. Additionally, we suggest addressing the reproducibility concerns by releasing the utilized SRTM90_V4 digital elevation model alongside the dataset. The authors should ensure the dataset is ML-ready by standardizing image sizes and providing detailed information on the extraction of ML samples. Clarifying the methodology for downscaling weather data and addressing potential noise issues is essential. We also recommend including AUROC plots for evaluation, revising unclear figures and references for better clarity, and providing more extensive documentation on the dataset creation process, including step-by-step explanations and code comments, to enhance usability.
