### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of the accuracy-diversity tradeoff in recommender systems, proposing a new metric of user utility that accounts for consumption constraints. The authors argue that traditional accuracy metrics misalign with user utility and that utility-maximizing recommendations inherently exhibit diversity due to diminishing returns from similar items. A theoretical model is introduced, where items belong to discrete types and users have a probability distribution over these types, leading to a measure of diversity based on item type representation in recommendation sets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and accessible, with intuitive terminologies and formulations. The model structure is clear, and the design choices are well-motivated.
- It addresses a significant topic in recommender systems, providing a principled understanding of the accuracy-diversity tradeoff that could benefit practitioners.

Weaknesses:
- The paper makes strong claims without adequate support, such as the assertion that recommender systems primarily maximize accuracy. It overlooks existing metrics like precision at k and propensity weighted precision that consider user interaction limits and diversity.
- The exploration of the accuracy-diversity tradeoff is presented in a theorem-centric manner, which is well-known in the field. The application of these theorems to real recommendation problems is lacking.
- The paper is poorly organized; for instance, Table 1 is not referenced in the text, and theorems appear before their definitions, complicating comprehension. The definition of user utility is also introduced without prior context.
- Related work is not summarized in the introduction, and the primary contributions should be explicitly stated. The relevance to the Web and the track should be clarified on the first page.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by reorganizing the introduction to reduce verbosity and summarizing primary contributions explicitly. The authors should discuss existing metrics like $\alpha$-ndcg to contextualize their work and explore the mathematical implications of user utility in relation to these metrics. Additionally, we suggest that the authors ensure all tables and theorems are properly referenced and defined in the text to enhance understanding. Sharing code for reproduction would also strengthen the paper's impact.
