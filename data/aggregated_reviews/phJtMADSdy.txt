### Key Points
This paper presents the Multi-User MultiWOZ dataset, which includes task-oriented dialogues between two users and one agent, and proposes the multi-user contextual query rewriting task aimed at transforming multi-user chats into concise task-oriented requests. The authors extend the MultiWOZ benchmark to facilitate interactions among multiple users, enhancing the naturalness of dialogues through components like social chatter and deliberation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset addresses a significant gap in realistic multi-user task-oriented dialogues, supporting advancements in dialogue systems.
- The data collection process is thorough, grounded in a pilot study, and includes validation and quality assessments.
- The analysis of query writing error types is well-executed, providing valuable insights.

Weaknesses:
- The data generation method may introduce bias, as it relies on a single annotator expanding user utterances rather than simulating natural interactions between two users.
- The annotation of slot-value pairs and intents occurs post-dialogue, raising questions about dialogue state tracking and system response timing.
- The contextual query rewriting approach may lack scalability to other domains due to the need for additional annotations of original single-user utterances.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the data generation process by simulating interactions between two users to reduce potential biases. Additionally, we suggest addressing the dialogue state tracking concerns by clarifying how the system determines when to respond and considering a model for multi-user dialogue state tracking that does not rely on original single-user utterance annotations. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore the development of specific evaluation metrics tailored to the unique characteristics of multi-user task-oriented dialogues.
