### Key Points
This paper presents a multi-modal approach for decoding video stimuli from fMRI data, integrating visual, text, and audio modalities. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their framework through Ridge regression and functional alignment, achieving high identification and retrieval accuracy, particularly with the Video+Text+Audio combination. The study utilizes a substantial dataset of 1,000 short video clips from ten subjects, employing advanced computational techniques to enhance predictive accuracy. While the results are promising, the experimental setup and evaluation metrics require more precision to validate the robustness of the approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces an innovative multimodal framework that significantly improves decoding performance by integrating multiple sensory streams.
- It employs subject-specific models and functional alignment techniques, enhancing accuracy and generalizability.
- The evaluation metrics used provide a clear assessment of the decoding framework's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on pre-trained models limits the exploration of individual neural representations.
- The unexpected performance of the audio modality without sound lacks sufficient theoretical discussion.
- The study does not adequately explore generative models or provide comparisons with existing multi-modal brain decoding methods, limiting the assessment of its novelty.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- We recommend that the authors improve the exploration of the limitations of using pre-trained models for extracting embeddings and consider integrating models trained specifically on brain data.
- A more detailed investigation into the audio modality's performance without sound input would strengthen the paper's contributions.
- We suggest that the authors progress toward exploring generative models that can reconstruct original stimuli from brain activity, as this is a key interest in brain decoding research.
- Expanding the dataset to include a more diverse range of video clips and sensory modalities would enhance the generalizability of the findings.
- Clarifying the labels and visualizations in the figures, as well as addressing the statistical significance of accuracy distributions, would improve the manuscript's clarity and rigor.
