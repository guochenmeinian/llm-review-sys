Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of the discrepancies between the scaling laws of Kaplan et al. and Hoffmann et al., identifying three key factors: last-layer FLOPS, warmup duration, and hyperparameter tuning. The authors conclude that careful learning rate decay is not essential for resolving these discrepancies. Additionally, they develop strategies for selecting hyperparameters, including optimal learning rates and batch sizes, and emphasize the importance of using larger beta_2 values when training with small batch sizes using Adam.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant issue regarding the discrepancies in scaling laws, which is crucial for the design of large language models.
- It provides extensive experiments that align the two scaling laws for compute-optimal model sizes.
- The discussion on hyperparameter selection offers valuable guidance for reproducing scaling law results.

Weaknesses:
- The paper does not fully address concerns about the correctness of the scaling laws, as it primarily focuses on resolving discrepancies with limited results.
- The conclusion lacks clarity; a standard pipeline for reproducing scaling law experiments would enhance understanding.
- The focus on compute-optimal scaling laws may limit the applicability of findings, as broader scaling laws considering model sizes and training data are not addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their conclusions by outlining a standard pipeline for reproducing scaling law experiments. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explore the implications of their findings beyond compute-optimal settings to include broader scaling laws. Finally, addressing the concerns regarding the correctness of the scaling laws with more comprehensive results would strengthen the paper's contributions.
