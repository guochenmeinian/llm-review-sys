### Key Points
This paper presents a novel dataset, MathDial, consisting of 3,000 tutoring dialogues focused on multi-step math reasoning problems. The dataset is generated through interactions between real teachers and a Large Language Model (LLM) designed to simulate common student errors. The authors propose a taxonomy of teacher moves to enhance student learning and demonstrate the dataset's potential for fine-tuning language models into more effective tutors. The work aims to fill a crucial gap in the study of effective dialogue tutors at scale.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The dataset is a significant contribution to the dialogue tutoring community, providing a larger corpus than existing resources.  
- The analysis of different models and their performance is comprehensive and insightful.  
- The proposed data collection framework is reproducible and effectively captures common LLM errors, reflecting student misconceptions.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks organization, making it difficult to follow, with issues such as the misplacement of Table 1 and unclear evaluation metrics.  
- The reliance on LLMs to simulate students raises concerns about the realism and quality of the dialogues, as LLMs may not accurately reflect human behavior.  
- There is low-to-moderate agreement among annotators during human evaluations, suggesting a need for improved training or clearer annotation tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization of the paper for better clarity, ensuring that all tables and figures are introduced in a logical sequence. Additionally, we suggest providing clearer experimental details, including input-output specifications during fine-tuning and the metrics used for evaluation, particularly regarding intermediate tutoring processes. To enhance the realism of the dataset, consider exploring cognitive task analysis in math, as suggested by relevant literature. Finally, addressing the concerns about annotator agreement and the realism of LLM-generated dialogues will strengthen the paper's contributions.
