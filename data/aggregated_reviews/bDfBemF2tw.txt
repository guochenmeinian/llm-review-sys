### Key Points
This paper presents a preliminary study on using magnetocardiography (MCG) signals for individual identification. The authors propose a system utilizing two BellBloom OPMs as a gradiometer to sense cardiac magnetic fields. However, the model is tested on only five subjects, raising concerns about its classification as a foundation model. The methodology for dataset augmentation and the validation process for the model's performance require further clarification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The approach of incorporating noise to mimic real-world environments enhances the study's applicability.  
- The use of MCG as a non-invasive technique is innovative and demonstrates significant effort in system development.  

Weaknesses:  
- The limited sample size questions the robustness and generalizability of the results.  
- There is a lack of comparison with other identification methods, such as ECG or facial recognition, which undermines claims of MCG's superiority.  
- The scalability of the CNN method for larger populations is uncertain.  
- The practical application of the apparatus size is questionable.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the diversity of the sample population to enhance the model's generalizability. Additionally, please clarify the methodology for dataset augmentation, detailing how the 3276 sets were generated from five participants. Including measurements from traditional ECG devices for comparison would strengthen the evidence of the new device's validity. We also suggest elaborating on the validation dataset used to assess model performance. Finally, consider using universal anatomical terms and providing a fixed reference point for magnet induction intensity to enhance clarity and reproducibility in the study.
