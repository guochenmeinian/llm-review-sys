Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a stable hand pose estimation method that utilizes a neural network for stability estimation, trained from simulation to enhance the physical stability of estimated hand poses. The authors propose using a DeepSim model as a differentiable proxy for a physics simulator, allowing for the propagation of gradients through the simulation. The method aims to enhance the stability of hand-object pose estimation through physics simulation, with empirical results demonstrating its effectiveness. Experiments on two datasets show that the method achieves state-of-the-art results in pose estimation while improving physical realism, although concerns remain regarding the depth of discussion on network design and the appropriateness of the chosen simulator.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach effectively leverages physics to enhance vision-based systems, providing a clear motivation and intuitive formulation.
- The DeepSim model simplifies the learning of stability loss, making the optimization process more efficient.
- The paper addresses a relevant problem in hand-object pose estimation and proposes a method that shows potential for practical applications.
- Empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of the approach is provided, as seen in the ablation study.

Weaknesses:
- The method does not achieve state-of-the-art performance in hand and object pose estimation metrics, raising concerns about its overall effectiveness.
- The reliance on adhesion forces may introduce unrealistic assumptions, as it biases the model towards static grasps and does not account for dynamic interactions.
- The scope of the method is limited to stable grasps, which may restrict its applicability in real-world scenarios involving motion and varying contact dynamics.
- The design of the DeepSim network lacks thorough exploration and justification, particularly regarding its architecture and input-output representation.
- The choice of simulator, MuJoCo, may not be optimal given advancements in simulation technology, and the paper does not adequately discuss alternatives or the implications of using an older simulator.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalization ability of the DeepSim model by exploring the integration of physical priors and leveraging large-scale synthetic datasets. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the discussion surrounding the design of the DeepSim network, including a detailed exploration of network architecture choices and their implications for predicting the physical stability of grasping poses. Presenting the design process through an ablation study or supplementary material would enhance the paper's impact. Furthermore, a more detailed discussion on the modeling of adhesion forces and their implications on grasping dynamics would enhance clarity. It would also be beneficial to address how the method can adapt to non-stable grasp scenarios and incorporate rotational dynamics into the stability loss. Finally, we suggest a more in-depth analysis of the simulator's capabilities, including a comparison with more recent alternatives that support complex mesh geometries, and clarifying the integration method used in Equation 2, which should be referred to as semi-implicit.
