Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Learning from Teaching (LoT), a novel regularization technique aimed at enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep neural networks. The authors hypothesize that generalizable correlations are easier to imitate, operationalizing this concept through auxiliary student learners that assist the main model in capturing these correlations. The effectiveness of LoT is demonstrated across various tasks, including Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Reinforcement Learning, showing improved performance with fewer training steps compared to traditional methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The computation of ‘imitability’ through student models is a significant contribution.
- The experimental section is comprehensive, covering a wide range of tasks.
- The methodology is well-detailed, with clear formulations and algorithms for implementing LoT.

Weaknesses:
- The hypothesis lacks robust theoretical support, raising questions about its reliability.
- The comparison primarily focuses on a teacher-only model, with insufficient exploration of other regularization methods.
- The training process description is unclear, particularly regarding the optimization of teacher and student models.
- A fixed set of student models is used, limiting insights into the versatility of LoT.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical foundation of their hypothesis to enhance its credibility. A more thorough comparison with other regularization methods, such as dropout and batch normalization, would strengthen the validation of LoT's effectiveness. Additionally, providing a detailed analysis of the scalability and computational costs associated with LoT, especially for larger models, would clarify its practical applicability. Exploring the impact of different types of student models with varying capacities could yield deeper insights into the robustness of the approach. Lastly, elaborating on the training process and how generalization connections are captured would enhance clarity.
