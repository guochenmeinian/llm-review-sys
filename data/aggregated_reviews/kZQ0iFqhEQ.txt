### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to molecular representations by utilizing electron-derived information, achieving state-of-the-art results across various molecular benchmark datasets. The authors leverage QM9 as a source of pre-calculated electron-level data for small molecular fragments, which aids in constructing their electron-derived molecular representation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The approach is innovative, effectively improving molecular representations by incorporating electron-level information for molecular motifs. This method mitigates the high computational costs associated with large molecules while capitalizing on electron-level data from smaller ones. The authors demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across a comprehensive range of benchmarks.

Weaknesses:  
Further clarification in the notation would enhance reader understanding. Additionally, only R2 statistics are reported for benchmarking results, and there is a lack of an ablation study on the impact of electronic information. Examples of the knowledge extension step are also missing, particularly concerning molecule pairs with low similarity scores, raising questions about potential limitations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity in the notation to assist readers. Additionally, including RMSE alongside R2 statistics in the benchmarking results would provide a more comprehensive evaluation. An ablation study examining the model's performance without electronic information, while maintaining other network components, should be conducted. Finally, we suggest that the authors provide examples of the knowledge extension step, particularly focusing on molecule pairs with low similarity scores, to address potential limitations in their approach.
