### Key Points
This paper presents heuristic-analytic reasoning (HAR) strategies aimed at enhancing coherent physical commonsense reasoning in pre-trained language models (PLMs). Inspired by dual process theories in cognitive psychology, the authors implement HAR for fine-tuning and in-context learning, where models first make high-level plausibility judgments before focusing on lower-level judgments. Experiments on TRIP and a novel Tiered-ProPara dataset demonstrate that HAR significantly improves reasoning coherence by enabling models to attend more faithfully to relevant context. The key contribution lies in showing that human-inspired reasoning strategies can enhance trustworthiness in PLMs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The incorporation of complete cognitive processes, including both heuristic and analytic thinking, enhances PLMs' reasoning capabilities.
- The introduction of the Tiered-ProPara dataset and comprehensive experimental results bolster the paper's contributions.
- Visualization of Faithful Attention within LLMs effectively illustrates how HAR aids in focusing on relevant content.

Weaknesses:
- The innovativeness of HAR is somewhat limited, as it resembles a pipeline of subtasks and a "reverse" chain-of-thought method.
- Similarities with existing work, such as "Language Modeling with Latent Situations," necessitate a more in-depth comparison and analysis of HAR's unique aspects.
- The potential for cascading errors in reasoning due to sequential predictions raises concerns about generalizability to broader datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the generalizability of HAR beyond datasets with localized key information, addressing potential cascading errors in reasoning. Additionally, a more thorough comparison with existing literature, particularly regarding the similarities with "Language Modeling with Latent Situations," should be included to clarify HAR's unique contributions. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors acknowledge the drop in accuracy scores associated with the ICL-HAR method and provide a detailed analysis of this trade-off in the main text. Lastly, reducing the number of abbreviations could enhance clarity for readers.
