### Key Points
This paper presents a method for verifying claims by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to decompose claims into sub-claims and verify each through relevant knowledge retrieval. The authors propose a First-Order-Logic-Guided Knowledge-Grounded (FOLK) approach, which translates claims into First-Order-Logic (FOL) clauses, generates follow-up questions, retrieves answers, and evaluates the veracity of the claims. The method is evaluated on three fact-checking datasets, demonstrating effectiveness and improvements in performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed approach is intuitive, easy to implement, and effective, with experiments showing performance improvements.  
- The paper is well-written, providing a solid background and clear methodology.  
- The FOLK method introduces a structured prompting technique that enhances LLM performance in fact-checking tasks.

Weaknesses:  
- The justification for creating FOL predicates is unconvincing, as the authors do not utilize logical reasoning tools, and simpler prompting methods could suffice.  
- The comparison with baselines is questionable, as many do not incorporate a search engine, leading to potential biases in experimental results.  
- The ablation study lacks depth, only evaluating the removal of knowledge grounding without exploring the necessity of FOL forms.  
- There are discrepancies in reported results compared to existing literature, and the reliance on a single search result raises concerns about verification robustness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for using FOL predicates, possibly by demonstrating their necessity or effectiveness compared to simpler prompting methods. Additionally, we suggest incorporating retrieved knowledge into baseline methods like "CoT" and "Self-Ask" for a fairer comparison. The authors should also enhance the ablation study to explore the impact of FOL forms more comprehensively. Addressing the discrepancies in results with existing literature is crucial, and we advise considering multiple search results to strengthen the verification process. Lastly, we recommend expanding the evaluation of generated explanations beyond 30 examples to provide more robust evidence for the claims made in the paper.
