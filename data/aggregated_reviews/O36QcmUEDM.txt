### Key Points
This paper presents a new multilingual dataset for sign language processing, JWSign, based on Bible translations, encompassing 2530 hours of content across 98 sign languages. The authors propose sign-to-text translation systems utilizing this dataset and provide baseline evaluation results for bilingual and multilingual training. The dataset's diversity is notable, featuring contributions from approximately 1500 signers with varied demographics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The dataset significantly contributes to the sign language community and is relevant for cross-sign studies and translation evaluation.  
- It covers a wide range of sign languages and offers a detailed set of experiments, potentially serving as a valuable resource for studying linguistic differences.  
- The paper is well-written, with extensive statistics and acknowledgment of limitations.

Weaknesses:  
- The dataset's creation flow (text-to-sign) is inconsistent with common practices (sign-to-text), making it incomparable to other corpora.  
- Licensing terms are not adequately described, raising concerns about data usage.  
- The number of samples per sign language varies significantly, which may limit the dataset's utility for developing reliable translation systems.  
- Ethical concerns regarding data ownership and domain specificity are not sufficiently addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the dataset's creation process to address the inconsistency with existing corpora. Additionally, it is crucial to provide detailed licensing terms to mitigate potential usage issues. We suggest enhancing the analysis of baseline results, including exploring error patterns and similarities between sign languages. Finally, we encourage the authors to conduct an ethical review to address concerns about data ownership and the limited domain of the dataset.
