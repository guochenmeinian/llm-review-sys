Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel algorithm called Population Predictive Coding (PPC) aimed at enhancing the performance and biological plausibility of predictive coding approaches for structured generative models. The authors propose a biologically plausible version of predictive coding that utilizes local computations and can perform both classification and generation tasks. The algorithm incorporates variational EM with particle gradient descent and aims to respect the correlation structure of generative models while providing theoretical foundations and empirical validation against existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The PPC algorithm represents a significant contribution by combining recent developments in Monte Carlo sampling with predictive coding.  
- The technical derivation appears sound, and the empirical evaluation is thorough, with results demonstrating the algorithm's potential impact on the field.  
- The paper is generally well-structured, making high-level concepts accessible to readers with relevant backgrounds.

Weaknesses:  
- The presentation of core ideas is confusing, particularly in distinguishing new contributions from existing work.  
- The biological plausibility claims may be overstated, lacking sufficient discussion on how neurons could implement the required computations.  
- The performance of the model is underwhelming, with limited results reported, particularly in comparison to modern generative models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation, especially in Sections 2 and 3, by clearly delineating standard predictive coding from their proposed modifications. Including diagrams comparing the PPC algorithm to traditional methods would enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more robust discussion on the biological feasibility of their algorithm, specifically how neurons might learn log-density gradients. Clarifying the missing FID score in Table 3 and ensuring all figures are referenced correctly would also strengthen the manuscript. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore and report on the time complexity and computational efficiency of their algorithm in comparison to other predictive coding approaches.
