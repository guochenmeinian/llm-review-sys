### Key Points
This paper presents SUPMER, a method that enhances soft prompt initialization for pre-trained language models (PLMs) through self-supervised meta-learning. SUPMER employs a diverse set of meta-training tasks to learn a universal prompt initialization, enabling efficient adaptation using only unlabeled data. The extensive experiments demonstrate SUPMER's superior performance in few-shot downstream tasks and its strong domain generalization ability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Intuitive method with solid empirical evidence supporting its effectiveness in few-shot learning and domain generalization.
- Thorough ablation study that clarifies the contributions of each component of the method.
- Well-structured presentation, breaking down complex concepts and providing a rich comparison with existing methods.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance solely on unlabeled data raises concerns about real-world applicability, as many NLP tasks have available labeled data.
- Experiments are limited to one model family (T5), which may restrict the generalizability of the findings.
- Some figures, particularly Figure 2, lack clarity and could benefit from better explanations and organization.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by incorporating labeled data in their experiments to demonstrate the robustness of SUPMER against proper baselines. Additionally, expanding the model family beyond T5 would enhance the generalizability of the results. Clarifying the elements of Figure 2 and revising the introduction to better present key concepts before discussing motivations would also strengthen the paper.
