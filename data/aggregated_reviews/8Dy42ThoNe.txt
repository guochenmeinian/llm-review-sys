### Key Points
This paper presents a systematic investigation of unlearning in large language models (LLMs), focusing on three scenarios: unlearning harmful responses, erasing copyright-protected content, and reducing hallucinations. The authors propose a method that employs gradient ascent and requires only negative examples, claiming it is more efficient than traditional alignment methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). The study demonstrates that the proposed unlearning technique can effectively remove unwanted behaviors while achieving better alignment performance at a fraction of the computational cost.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and structured, clearly articulating its points with adequate experimental support.
- It introduces a pioneering approach to unlearning in LLMs, providing a thorough examination of the topic and demonstrating practical applications.
- The evaluation criteria are detailed, and the analysis on diversity and fluency is important for assessing the quality of outputs post-unlearning.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed unlearning method often results in outputs that lack fluency and coherence, which diminishes its practical applicability in real-world scenarios like chatbots.
- The novelty of the approach is limited, as the core techniques have been previously utilized in other contexts, raising concerns about the generalizability and stability of the method.
- There is insufficient discussion regarding the fairness of comparisons with RLHF and a lack of details on the calculation of running times, which may affect the credibility of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the fluency and coherence of the outputs generated after unlearning to enhance practical applicability. Additionally, addressing the stability of training during the unlearning process is crucial, as is providing a more detailed comparison with other efficient RLHF techniques. To strengthen the generalizability of the approach, we suggest evaluating the method across a broader range of undesirable behaviors and adopting standardized evaluation metrics similar to those used in RLHF studies. Finally, the authors should consider discussing potential privacy concerns more thoroughly and exploring ways to mitigate these risks.
