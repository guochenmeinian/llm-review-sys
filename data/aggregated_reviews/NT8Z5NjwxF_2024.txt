Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a dual-diffusion model for Binocular 3D Human Pose Estimation, addressing uncertainties in binocular configurations. The authors utilize 2D poses with triangulation to initialize 3D poses during the diffusion process and introduce depth conditions and pose normalization to enhance generalization. Experiments demonstrate superior performance on the MHAD and H36M datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach of using multi-view 2D poses with triangulation for initial 3D pose distribution is innovative and outperforms previous diffusion-based designs.
- The Z-embedding Condition and Baseline-width-related Pose Normalization are effective and straightforward methods that account for varying human depth and baseline-width in binocular settings.
- The dual-denoising process is a novel contribution to human pose estimation, and the quantitative results are promising.

Weaknesses:
- A comparison between triangulation and common 3D initial distributions like DiffPose is necessary to highlight the advantages of the dual diffusion structure.
- The scalability of the method to more camera views needs clarification, including its performance impact.
- The accuracy of 3D poses obtained through direct triangulation should be assessed to evaluate the necessity of the proposed diffusion process.
- Limited experiments primarily focus on one previous method, RSB-Pose, which may weaken the paper's overall convincingness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with recent methods, such as "Triangulation Residual Loss for Data-efficient 3D Pose Estimation," and discuss its relevance to their work. Additionally, the authors should explore the use of transformer-based backbones to potentially enhance accuracy. It would be beneficial to provide detailed information on the parameter sizes of different methods in their tables to ensure that accuracy improvements are not solely due to larger parameter capabilities. Lastly, extending the framework to multi-view 3D HPE and validating its superiority over existing methods would strengthen the paper.
