Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the gap between prototype and image instance embeddings in cross-domain few-shot classification. The authors propose a method called Contrastive Prototype-image Adaptation (CoPA) to adapt transformations for prototypes and image embeddings, thereby addressing the modality gap. Extensive experiments on the Meta-Dataset demonstrate that CoPA achieves state-of-the-art performance and can effectively enlarge the gap, leading to better representation clusters and lower validation loss.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well written and visually clear, facilitating understanding.
2. It systematically analyzes the modality gap and proposes CoPA as a solution, effectively adapting transformations akin to CLIP.
3. The experiments are comprehensive, validating the theoretical claims made.
4. Supplementary materials provide thorough proofs and results.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of CoPA is questioned, as it employs classical methods previously proven effective.
2. CoPA's complexity is increased with two linear heads, raising concerns about its necessity compared to simpler models like URL.
3. The rationale behind the performance improvement from enlarging the gap between prototypes and instance embeddings is not clearly articulated.
4. The temperature parameter in the symmetric cross-entropy loss may introduce unfairness in comparison to other methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the theoretical justification for why enlarging the gap enhances performance, particularly in relation to generalization ability. Additionally, consider comparing CoPA with more recent adaptation-based methods to strengthen the experimental foundation. Lastly, ensure that all equations are numbered correctly and that references are formatted consistently to enhance the paper's presentation.
