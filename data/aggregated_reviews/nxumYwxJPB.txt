Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical study on the impact of weight initialization and training epochs on the adversarial robustness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), with implications for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The authors derive an upper bound linking weight norms and training epochs to model robustness, supported by empirical results. The findings indicate that lower weight norms and appropriate initialization strategies enhance robustness without degrading clean performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The originality of the study addresses a novel aspect of adversarial robustness in GNNs, extending its relevance to DNNs.
- The theoretical analysis is rigorous, establishing clear connections between initialization strategies, training epochs, and robustness.
- The paper is well-structured and presents findings clearly, making it easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution is somewhat limited due to a lack of proposed methods based on findings and insufficient empirical validation across diverse architectures and modern adversarial setups.
- The theoretical claims are not sufficiently compelling, as they can be interpreted simplistically, and the paper lacks detailed discussions on hyperparameter sensitivity and practical implementation.
- The experimental section could benefit from more comprehensive comparisons of initialization strategies and their effects on clean accuracy and robustness trade-offs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical validation by including a wider range of architectures and modern adversarial setups, such as large-scale datasets (e.g., ImageNet-1K) and recent adversarial attacks (e.g., AutoAttack, APGD). Additionally, expanding Section 6.4 to include more experiments and insights on initialization strategies would enhance the paper's impact. Clarifying the interaction of proposed initialization strategies with existing defense mechanisms and addressing hyperparameter sensitivity would also strengthen the practical applicability of the findings. Finally, highlighting the trade-off between accuracy and robustness more explicitly in the discussion would provide valuable insights for future research directions.
