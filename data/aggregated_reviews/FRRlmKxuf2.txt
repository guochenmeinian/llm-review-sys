### Key Points
This paper presents a modified Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique, termed Cue-CoT, which incorporates an intermediate reasoning step to extract linguistic cues related to personality, emotion, and psychology from user dialogue. The authors contribute a benchmark consisting of six dialogue datasets in both Chinese and English, demonstrating that their Cue-CoT method outperforms standard prompting techniques in automated evaluation metrics as well as in human evaluations of helpfulness and acceptability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a straightforward extension of CoT for personalized response generation in dialogue systems.
- It includes a comprehensive evaluation using both automated metrics and human annotators, with well-motivated dataset choices.
- The proposed method is well-written and clearly presented, making it easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The language used in the paper is imprecise, leading to potential misunderstandings regarding the methodology and results.
- The evaluation metrics for human assessment do not convincingly link to the stated goals of personalization and engagement.
- The method lacks substantial innovation and does not thoroughly examine cue errors or their impact on results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their language, particularly in sections where the methodology is described, such as line 245 regarding user status and line 392 about pair-wise comparisons. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a clearer justification for their chosen human evaluation metrics to better connect them to the primary research question of personalization and engagement. It would also be beneficial to include comparisons with standard prompting methods to enhance the comprehensiveness of the experimental results. Finally, addressing the ambiguity surrounding "in-depth dialogue questions" and ensuring that all relevant tables and figures are referenced in the text will strengthen the paper.
