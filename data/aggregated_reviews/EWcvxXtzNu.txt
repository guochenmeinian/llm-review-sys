Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ALIDIFF, a framework that aligns pre-trained target-aware molecule diffusion models with desired functional properties using preference optimization. The authors propose the Exact Energy Preference Optimization method, which aligns diffusion models to regions with lower binding energy based on user-defined reward functions. Experiments on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark demonstrate ALIDIFF's ability to generate molecules with superior binding energies while maintaining competitive molecular properties.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- ALIDIFF effectively utilizes a preference optimization approach to generate chemically and structurally relevant molecules.
- The method's robustness is validated through extensive experiments, showcasing superior binding energies.
- The use of AutoDock Vina for binding energy evaluations ensures practical relevance in drug discovery applications.
- Comprehensive ablation studies address potential concerns, and the proposed method is well-structured and easy to read.

Weaknesses:
- The practical impact of the improvements achieved needs clearer quantification.
- The method's novelty appears limited as it builds on IPDiff and optimizes it using RL without sufficient differentiation.
- There is a lack of comparative results with other methods, such as IPO or SLiC, and the time required for pre-training, fine-tuning, and binding energy computations via AutoDock Vina is not specified.
- Generated molecules exhibit inferior drug-likeness properties, and the paper does not explore aligning the model with high drug-likeness regions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the quantification of the practical impact of their method and provide comparisons with other optimization methods beyond DPO. Additionally, including specific time metrics for pre-training and binding energy computations would enhance the assessment of the proposed approach's efficiency. It would also be beneficial to explore the alignment of the pre-trained diffusion model with regions characterized by high drug-likeness properties and report the Lipinski metric in Table 1 for a more comprehensive evaluation.
