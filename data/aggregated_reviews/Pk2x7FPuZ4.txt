Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents EHRXQA, a novel multimodal question answering dataset for electronic health records (EHRs) that integrates structured EHR data with chest X-ray images. The authors combine two existing datasets, MIMIC-CXR-VQA and EHRSQL, to create this comprehensive resource. They propose a NeuralSQL-based approach, which utilizes an external VQA API to effectively address multimodal questions in EHRs. Additionally, the authors explore GPT-4-based paraphrasing to enhance template diversity, demonstrating that increased paraphrasing improves model performance. They clarify the distinctions between EHRXQA and MIMIC-CXR-VQA, emphasizing the unique contributions of their dataset, including complex question templates and multimodal queries.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors have constructed a QA dataset that combines multimodal data, addressing an unmet need in the research community.
- The methodology for dataset construction is clearly articulated and beneficial for future research.
- The proposed NeuralSQL-based strategy demonstrates effectiveness in comparison to existing methods, showcasing its applicability in the context of large language models (LLMs).
- The exploration of GPT-4-based paraphrasing significantly enhances the diversity of templates, leading to improved model performance.
- The dataset construction process is grounded in clinical relevance, validated by medical experts, ensuring alignment with real-world information needs.
- Clear distinctions between EHRXQA and MIMIC-CXR-VQA are provided, highlighting the unique contributions of each dataset.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on existing datasets raises concerns about the generality of the approach, as noted in the discussion section.
- The SQL query method may lead to performance issues with larger datasets, potentially causing bottlenecks during complex query execution.
- The characterization of EHRXQA as merely a refactoring of existing datasets may undermine its perceived originality.
- The presentation of the paper could benefit from clearer visual aids to help readers understand the relationships between datasets and modalities.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset by incorporating text or table information to capture patient visit details, as this could enhance the dataset's utility. Additionally, consider evaluating the redundancy of combining the Chest Imagenome dataset with the external VQA API, as direct retrieval from clinical notes may be more efficient. It would also be beneficial to conduct an ablation study to assess the impact of diverse templates on model performance, as well as to explore more challenging baselines using an open-world, generative approach for question answering. Furthermore, we recommend improving the presentation of the paper by including a table that breaks down the unimodal datasets by name, their included modalities, and their remapping to new datasets. Clarifying the distinction between EHRXQA and MIMIC-CXR-VQA in the manuscript would enhance reader understanding, and providing a table summarizing the unimodal datasets could improve clarity.
