### Key Points
This paper studies the high-dimensional single index model (SIM) represented as $Y=g(X^T\beta, \epsilon)$, where $\epsilon$ and $X$ are orthogonal. The authors propose improvements in three areas: (1) extending the rank-LASSO procedure to include both convex and non-convex penalties, establishing error bounds for local optima; (2) providing asymptotically honest group inference procedures based on orthogonalization for testing joint effects of predictors; and (3) developing a multiple testing procedure to assess the simultaneous relevance of individual coefficients while controlling the FDR asymptotically. The paper also introduces a robust group hypothesis testing procedure using a data-driven transformation of the response variable, deriving the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic. The proposed algorithm for group inference is robust to heavy-tailed noise and satisfies honesty in Type 1 error.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper presents innovative solutions to inefficiencies in the SIM due to outliers and heavy-tailed distributions.  
- The proposed methods are interesting, well-written, and clear, with extensive discussions on important properties such as honesty and power.  
- Numerical experiments support the efficiency and robustness of the approaches.

Weaknesses:  
- The simulation study requires improvement, particularly in its design and comparisons.  
- Some limitations of the proposed methods are not explicitly discussed, including robustness constraints and the implications of certain conditions on link functions.  
- The choice of transformation for robustness needs further clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the background discussion of the problem to provide context. Additionally, the simulation study should include a comparison with the method where $h(Y)=Y$ to evaluate the proposed procedure's limitations transparently. A graphical comparison of different methods as $p_{out}$ increases would also enhance the study. Furthermore, we suggest explicitly discussing the limitations regarding robustness and the implications of the conditions imposed in Theorem 3.1. Lastly, clarifying the suitability of the transformation $H=F$ for robustness and addressing the relationship to Bernsteinâ€™s inequality would strengthen the paper.
