Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework for spatio-temporal precipitation downscaling, integrating a deterministic downscaling module with a diffusion model. The authors propose that their model outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, particularly in extreme events and mountainous regions. The method employs a combination of high-resolution and low-resolution data for training, demonstrating advantages in estimating the risk of extreme precipitation events.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The use of multiple loss functions, including PE and EMD, to evaluate results is innovative, particularly the discussion on the trade-off between realism and bias.
2. The model establishes a new standard for data-driven precipitation downscaling by outperforming six strong super-resolution baselines.
3. The paper is well organized, with clear motivations and method descriptions, making it accessible to researchers from other fields.

Weaknesses:
1. Experimental validation is insufficient; the effectiveness of feature sharing across modules lacks ablation studies.
2. The related work section omits relevant papers on diffusion models for downscaling.
3. The justification for using transformer-based models is weak, and the potential locality bias needs further exploration.
4. The comparisons with deterministic models are not adequately clarified, and the small sample size of 10 from the diffusion model raises concerns for extreme event risk estimation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental validation by including ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of feature sharing across modules. Additionally, we suggest expanding the related work section to include recent studies on diffusion models for downscaling. The authors should clarify the justification for using transformer-based models and consider exploring the removal of attention mechanisms. Furthermore, we advise providing clearer explanations regarding the comparisons with deterministic models and addressing the small sample size used in experiments. Lastly, we encourage the authors to experimentally demonstrate their model's capability in modeling extreme precipitation compared to traditional supervised methods.
