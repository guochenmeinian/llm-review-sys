Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical exploration of the graph matching problem, focusing on producing mappings between vertices of multiple correlated Erdös-Rényi (ER) graphs to maximize similarities. The authors aim to characterize the information-theoretic threshold for exact recovery of latent mappings among these graphs, extending prior work that addressed only two graphs. They establish both achievability and converse results for this threshold, introducing an algorithm that combines a $k$-core estimator with a transitive closure procedure to achieve full vertex mappings. Numerical experiments demonstrate the algorithm's potential for matching multiple graphs effectively.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper innovatively extends the theoretical framework of graph matching from two to multiple graphs, which is a significant contribution to the field.  
- The necessary and sufficient conditions for exact matching are established, providing a clear theoretical foundation.  
- The algorithm's ability to leverage transitivity for exact matching among multiple graphs, even when pairwise matching fails, is a noteworthy insight.  
- The paper is well-written and presents its findings clearly.

Weaknesses:  
- The proposed algorithms exhibit high computational complexity, limiting their practical applicability.  
- There is a lack of detailed discussion regarding the implications of the transitive closure technique, particularly in the simulations section, where critical parameters and error rates are not adequately addressed.  
- The paper primarily focuses on a simple ER graph model, and the authors do not sufficiently explore the implications of their findings in more complex graph models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the transitive closure's implications by providing more detailed simulations, including graph parameters and error rates before and after applying the transitive closure. Additionally, clarifying how to choose the parameter $k$ in Algorithm 2 would enhance the algorithm's usability. We suggest including a representative figure to visualize Algorithm 2, which could aid reader comprehension. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of the ER graph model and discussing potential extensions to more complex graph models would strengthen the paper's contribution. Lastly, we encourage the authors to consider conducting experimental analyses to evaluate the algorithm's performance across various graph models, as this could significantly enhance the paper's impact.
