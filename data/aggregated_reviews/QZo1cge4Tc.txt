### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to achieving counterfactual fairness through an improved algorithm that retains all input features. The authors propose generating counterfactual samples, creating counterfactually fair representations using a symmetric function, and training models that ensure counterfactual fairness. They extend their work to include path-dependent counterfactual fairness and provide both theoretical and empirical evidence of their method's efficacy across various datasets and causal models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-structured and provides a comprehensive background on counterfactual fairness.
2. The introduction of path-dependent counterfactual fairness is a significant and valuable contribution, allowing for the inclusion of features dependent on the protected attribute.
3. Extensive experiments validate the proposed method against various baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation for using a symmetric function is insufficiently detailed, raising questions about information loss and the method's performance when input features are dependent on the protected attribute.
2. The absence of TE results for CE in the results tables limits understanding of the fairness-utility trade-off.
3. The paper could benefit from a qualitative discussion on the differences between the proposed PCF and CF algorithms.
4. The initial presentation could be clearer for readers unfamiliar with counterfactual fairness literature, and a real-world example could enhance understanding.
5. Proof presentations lack formal structure; explicit proof sections for each theorem/lemma would improve clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for using a symmetric function in their method, addressing potential information loss and its implications for dependent features. Additionally, including TE results for CE would provide valuable insights into the fairness-utility trade-off. A qualitative discussion on the differences between PCF and CF algorithms would enrich the paper. We also suggest refining the initial presentation to aid comprehension, possibly by introducing a real-world example earlier in the paper. Furthermore, formalizing the presentation of proofs by including explicit sections for each theorem/lemma would enhance clarity. Lastly, addressing the questions regarding the sampling of u and the gap between theory and experiments would strengthen the paper's rigor.
