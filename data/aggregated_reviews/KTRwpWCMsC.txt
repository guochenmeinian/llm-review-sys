Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel conformal prediction (CP) approach utilizing Modern Hopfield Networks (MHNs) for time series forecasting. The authors propose a method that leverages a weighted quantile approach to enhance prediction coverage and sharpness compared to state-of-the-art CP methods. The framework is validated through extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its empirical superiority.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces a novel and sound CP algorithm based on a widely-used architecture, showing excellent efficiency across various time series datasets.  
- The structure is well-organized, and the writing is clear, making it accessible.  
- The use of proper scoring rules, such as the Winkler score, for evaluation is commendable.  

Weaknesses:  
- The theoretical guarantees of the algorithm are not adequately detailed in the main text, making it difficult to assess its robustness.  
- The contribution appears marginal, primarily reforming existing frameworks without significant novelty.  
- The method's reliance on large datasets for effective performance is noted, but other limitations are not sufficiently elaborated.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the theoretical guarantees by briefly describing the assumptions and stating the main bounds in the paper. Additionally, the authors should address the novelty of their contribution more explicitly, distinguishing between the conceptual idea of using MHNs and the specific algorithmic implementation. It would also be beneficial to elaborate on the limitations of the proposed method, particularly regarding its scalability to long time series and the impact of non-stationarity. Finally, we suggest including a comparison with advanced methods in Gaussian processes to contextualize the proposed approach better.
