Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on robustness certification for equivariant tasks, specifically defining adversarial robustness with group equivariance in terms of input and output distance. The authors introduce equivariance-preserving randomized smoothing and various smoothing schemes, demonstrating through experiments that robustness guarantees can be achieved via this method. The paper also emphasizes the need to reevaluate adversarial robustness in equivariant tasks, providing theoretical proofs and empirical validation across multiple applications, including graphs and point clouds.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for studying robustness with equivariance is clear, and the problem is well formulated.
- The theoretical framework is sound, with extensive discussion on randomized smoothing variants and their relevance.
- The proposed definition of adversarial robustness is novel and well-motivated, extending classical definitions.

Weaknesses:
- There are insufficient baselines to substantiate claims regarding the improvement of provable robustness through equivariance.
- The paper lacks direct investigation of the robustness notion, as no attacks against undefended models are performed.
- Some experiments require more justification for the choice of smoothing schemes and measure types.
- Notations related to measure-theoretic randomized smoothing are confusing and need clearer explanations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical validation by including more baselines to support the claim that equivariance enhances provable robustness. Additionally, conducting direct robustness investigations against undefended models would strengthen the paper. We suggest providing clearer justifications for the selection of different smoothing schemes and measures in the experiments. Furthermore, we advise clarifying the notations in section 3 regarding measure-theoretic randomized smoothing to enhance readability. Lastly, discussing the connection between resolvable/non-resolvable transformations and group equivariance would enrich the paper's contribution.
