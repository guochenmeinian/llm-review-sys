### Key Points
This paper presents the Social Interactive Trajectory (SiT) dataset, which captures realistic pedestrian interactions with a mobile robot in various indoor and outdoor environments. The dataset provides extensive pedestrian trajectory data collected over three hours in downtown Seoul, ensuring a broad representation of real-world situations. It supports crucial tasks for social navigation robots, including detection, tracking, and prediction, and includes rich annotations and semantic map information. The authors conducted a comparative analysis with Human Trajectory Prediction (HTP) datasets, revealing unique spatial distribution patterns and interaction behaviors. Ethical considerations were prioritized, with measures taken to anonymize data and address privacy concerns, although challenges remain regarding complete de-identification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**  
- The SiT dataset addresses a significant research gap in pedestrian trajectory forecasting, offering high-quality, real-world data that reflects complex social navigation scenarios.
- It includes multi-modal sensor data and semantic maps, enhancing its applicability for future research.
- The dataset emphasizes natural pedestrian behavior and diverse environments, which are critical for social navigation tasks.
- The paper is well-organized, clearly documenting methods and findings, and providing benchmark results that enhance the dataset's potential impact.
- Thorough ethical considerations were taken into account, with measures implemented to anonymize data.

**Weaknesses:**  
- The dataset primarily captures limited interactions between pedestrians and robots, which may restrict its representation of social navigation challenges.
- It lacks long-term pedestrian trajectories, which are essential for understanding behavior patterns in various environments.
- There are concerns regarding the ethical implications of data collection, particularly related to participant consent and privacy, as identifiable features could not be completely anonymized.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset by incorporating additional visual annotations, such as human poses, to enhance action analysis and motion prediction capabilities. Furthermore, we suggest providing a detailed analysis of the length of collected data and its distribution across different scenes to clarify dataset characteristics. Addressing the limitations regarding long-term trajectories and enhancing the representation of human-robot interactions would also strengthen the dataset's applicability. Additionally, we recommend that the authors improve the discussion on potential limitations related to privacy implications and strategies for mitigation in the final version. Lastly, we advise the authors to ensure that ethical considerations, including participant consent and privacy measures, are clearly documented and addressed in the paper, enhancing clarity regarding the dataset's practical applications in various fields.
