Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents MCLIP, which aims to finetune CLIP using image and mask data without semantic labels, adapting its open-vocabulary recognition ability to position-sensitive semantic segmentation tasks. MCLIP employs SAM or feature clusters of DINO to obtain class-agnostic masks, although these masks can sometimes be too small for consistent semantics. The authors propose an online clustering method to learn class-specific feature prototypes, validating their approach against state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The idea of solving open-vocabulary semantic segmentation without semantic labels is intriguing and well-motivated.
- Experimental results demonstrate good performance of the proposed approach.
- The paper includes ablation studies that clarify the role of each component and hyper-parameter.

Weaknesses:
- The role of the text encoder in the clustering process is unclear, and the authors need to explain how clustering with randomly initialized prompts affects results.
- The novelty of using clustering for fine-tuning is questioned, as previous works have employed similar strategies.
- The performance of MCLIP in open set semantic segmentation (O3S) settings is not addressed.
- Comparisons with existing methods, particularly regarding zero-shot mask classification, reveal that MCLIP's improvements may not be substantial.
- The scalability of the online clustering approach is uncertain, as evidenced by the limited dataset size used in experiments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the role of the text encoder in the clustering process and provide a comparative experiment to illustrate the impact of clustering with f_M. Additionally, conducting ablation experiments to demonstrate the novelty of their clustering approach compared to previous works would strengthen the paper. The authors should also explore the performance of MCLIP in O3S settings and clarify the results of using MCLIP's fine-tuned CLIP in comparison to previous methods. Finally, quantifying the costs associated with online clustering during training and addressing scalability concerns would enhance the robustness of their findings.
