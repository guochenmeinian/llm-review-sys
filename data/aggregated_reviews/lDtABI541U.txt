Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Quadratic Quantum Variational Monte Carlo (Q²VMC) algorithm, which enhances the optimization process of Quantum Variational Monte Carlo (QVMC) by employing an improved projection method for guiding the update direction of the ansatz. The authors demonstrate that their Q²VMC algorithm converges faster and achieves lower energies compared to traditional VMC, supported by empirical results. However, the paper struggles to distinguish itself from previous works and lacks a comprehensive discussion of related literature.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The derivation of a new gradient for the classical objective in VMC is well-motivated and sound, with empirical results supporting the theoretical claims.
2. The mathematical derivation for key steps is clear and easy to follow, making the algorithm easy to adapt.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper does not sufficiently differentiate itself from existing methods and lacks adequate discussion of related works, such as Wasserstein QMC and diffusion Monte Carlo.
2. The presentation is unclear in places, with notation issues and missing steps in derivations that may hinder understanding for those unfamiliar with QMC.
3. The improvements in speed and convergence are marginal, and the significance of the proposed method is questioned due to small energy differences that may be influenced by hyperparameter choices.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related work, particularly the connections to Wasserstein QMC and diffusion Monte Carlo, and provide a clearer comparison with these methods. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the clarity of the presentation by addressing notation issues and including missing steps in derivations. A more detailed ablation study should be conducted to demonstrate the significance of the proposed method, particularly regarding hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore the performance of Q²VMC on larger systems to validate its effectiveness further.
