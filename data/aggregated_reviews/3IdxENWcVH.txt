Aggregated Review:
**Key Points**  
We recognize that this paper tackles the prevalent issue of data shortage in speech-and-gesture synthesis by constructing a synthetic dataset to enhance an existing pre-trained model. The clarity and organization of the manuscript are commendable, and the authors employ a subjective evaluation mechanism typical in this field. 

**Strengths and Weaknesses**  
Strengths include the innovative combination of multiple large-scale models (GPT-4, XTTS, and Whisper) with a pre-trained speech-and-gesture model, effectively mitigating the shortage of labeled data. The simplicity of the proposed pipeline is an advantage, and the experiments demonstrate significant improvements in both quantitative and qualitative results. However, we find the novelty to be limited, as the authors primarily build upon existing works with minor modifications. Additionally, the evaluation of the synthetic data's effectiveness lacks convincing evidence, and the language used in the manuscript requires refinement.

**Suggestions for Improvement**  
We suggest conducting more rigorous experiments to validate the effectiveness of the synthetic dataset, such as establishing a baseline trained on both TWH and TSGD2 datasets and utilizing synthetic data for fine-tuning the pre-trained model. Furthermore, we recommend reviewing the manuscript for linguistic errors, particularly replacing instances of "pretrain" with "train" where appropriate, to enhance clarity and precision.
