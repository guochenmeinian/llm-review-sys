Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents theoretical advancements in using privileged information for partially observable reinforcement learning (POMDP), focusing on expert distillation and asymmetric actor-critic paradigms. The authors propose a belief-weighted optimistic asymmetric actor-critic algorithm and introduce a deterministic filter condition, which broadens the scope of tractable POMDP models. The paper also explores multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) frameworks, emphasizing the computational and sample efficiency of the proposed methods. Furthermore, the authors analyze belief learning and policy optimization within the asymmetric actor-critic framework, contrasting their approach with reward-free exploration and planning frameworks, which they argue are disconnected from practical applications. They clarify that their novel techniques are tailored for a specific $\gamma$-observability assumption and that their policy optimization algorithm remains effective even without this assumption.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The formalization of expert distillation provides a structured understanding of its limitations in observable POMDPs.
- The introduction of the deterministic filter condition is a novel contribution that ensures polynomial sample and computational complexities.
- The theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm is extensive, and the extension to multi-agent RL is a valuable addition.
- The authors provide a clear motivation for their work, focusing on practical applications and theoretical insights.
- They effectively differentiate their approach from existing frameworks, emphasizing the relevance of their algorithms in empirical settings.
- The responses to reviewer queries demonstrate a commitment to clarity and improvement.

Weaknesses:
- The effectiveness of Privileged Policy Learning is questioned due to the potential suboptimality of expert policies in practical scenarios.
- The reliance on access to the internal state of the POMDP environment limits applicability, as such states are often unobservable in real-world problems.
- The paper lacks sufficient experimental verification, particularly in practical benchmarks beyond synthetic small tabular POMDPs.
- The writing lacks conciseness and clarity in conveying key challenges and intuitions, which may hinder understanding.
- Some reviewers express concerns regarding the theoretical significance and practical implications of the proposed methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by better articulating the contributions in the introduction, specifically distinguishing between the algorithm's efficiency and its extension to the multi-agent setting. Additionally, we suggest including more toy examples alongside theoretical work to enhance understanding. The authors should also address the concerns regarding the restrictiveness of Definition 3.2 by providing more intuitive explanations and examples of $\gamma$-observability. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to move important sections from the appendix to the main text to improve readability and ensure that critical discussions are accessible. Lastly, improving the clarity and conciseness of their writing to better convey key challenges and intuitions would enhance the manuscript's impact. Addressing the concerns regarding the theoretical significance of their work more explicitly could also strengthen the paper's overall contribution.
