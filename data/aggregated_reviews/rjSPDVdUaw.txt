### Key Points
This paper presents a novel video representation learning approach called Moving Off-the-Grid (MooG), which decouples tokens from explicit grid locations in video sequences. The model predicts sub-pixel motion using a history of frames to advect latent features, allowing for cross attention between grid-aligned observed features and advected features. The authors claim three contributions: the introduction of MooG, qualitative validation, and quantitative evaluation across various downstream tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The idea is fundamental and applicable to a wide variety of tasks, with a novel and general concept.
- The qualitative experiments effectively demonstrate that the method learns a tracking representation.
- MooG allows tokens to track scene elements through videos of arbitrary length and enhances scene-grounded representation.

Weaknesses:
- The purpose of the corrector module is unclear; if the predictor functions as intended, a reconstruction loss on D(P(z)) might suffice.
- The relationship between prediction and correction is not clearly communicated in the figures.
- The evaluations are limited to niche tasks and lack comparisons with video SSL methods, which could strengthen the case for MooG.
- There is insufficient discussion on how MooG compares to similar architectures like Deformable DETR and Perceiver IO.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the corrector module's purpose and its relationship with the predictor. Enhancing Figure 1 with directional arrows and clearer representations of the predict-correct framework would aid understanding. Additionally, we suggest evaluating MooG against a broader range of tasks, including classification and segmentation, and comparing it with other video SSL methods. A deeper discussion on the differences between MooG and domain-specific models would also be beneficial. Finally, consider exploring alternative losses, such as LPIPS, to address potential over-blurring in the reconstruction task.
