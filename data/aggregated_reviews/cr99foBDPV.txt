Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel data augmentation method called Back-Modality, which utilizes cross-modal generation models to enhance data diversity. The approach involves transforming data from a source modality to an intermediate modality, applying augmentation techniques, and then reverting to the original modality. The authors propose three specific implementations: Back-captioning, Back-speech, and Back-imagination, demonstrating effectiveness in few-shot learning scenarios across various tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is straightforward and easy to implement, with potential for widespread application.
- It leverages recent advancements in cross-modal transformations, showing improved performance over existing augmentation techniques.
- The experimental results indicate significant benefits in data diversity and model performance.

Weaknesses:
- Key experimental details are lacking, such as the number of augmentations generated at each step and specifics on the augmentation processes used.
- The strategy may be overly reliant on the quality of cross-modal translators, which could limit its applicability in real-world scenarios with scarce data.
- The presentation of the paper requires improvement, including clearer examples and consistent formatting in tables.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental setup by providing specific numbers regarding the training set size and label distribution. Additionally, including more comprehensive details on the augmentation processes and the number of generated samples would enhance the paper's rigor. We suggest conducting experiments in real-world data-scarcity situations to validate the practical applicability of the Back-Modality technique. Lastly, incorporating human evaluations of the augmented samples and addressing robustness in adversarial settings would strengthen the overall findings.
