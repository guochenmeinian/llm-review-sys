Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method called Parameter Competition Balancing (PCB-MERGING) for effective model merging, which computes parameter importance through intra-balancing and inter-balancing. The authors claim that PCB-MERGING outperforms previous methods, including TIES-merging, Task Arithmetic, RegMean, and standard averaging, while being lightweight and training-free.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with a comprehensive survey of related works.
- The proposed method demonstrates superior performance across various application scenarios without requiring additional training.
- Extensive experiments validate the method, showing clear superiority in cross-task and cross-domain merging.

Weaknesses:
- The method lacks novelty, being similar to TIES with modified importance computation, and there is no theoretical motivation provided.
- Several figures and terms require clearer explanations, particularly regarding the meaning of percentages and the time complexity in MOEA.
- The introduction of hyperparameters, such as r in Eqn. (3), is not well justified, and the reliance on shared initializations limits applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Figures 1 and 2 by explicitly defining the percentages and scales used. Additionally, a thorough time complexity analysis should be included if more MOEA-related algorithms are introduced. The authors should clarify the notation in Section 3.2, particularly regarding the operations for parameter balancing. Justification for the choice of hyperparameter r should be provided, and the authors should address the implications of varying search spaces for hyperparameter lambda to avoid unfair comparisons.
