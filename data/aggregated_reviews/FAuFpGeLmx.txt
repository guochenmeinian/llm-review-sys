Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a statistical method for detecting and segmenting watermarked text generated by large language models (LLMs). The key contributions include a rigorous analysis of Type I and Type II errors for a randomization test applied to two watermarking schemes, a novel statistical approach for segmenting text into watermarked and non-watermarked substrings using change point detection techniques, and a theoretical analysis of convergence rates for estimated change point locations. The empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods using texts generated by GPT-2 and OPT-1.3b models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The originality of the statistical approach for watermarked text segmentation is noteworthy and useful.
- The rigorous theoretical analysis and thorough experimental design across multiple scenarios enhance the paper's quality.
- The clear structure and intuitive explanations contribute to the paper's readability.

Weaknesses:
- The limited model diversity in experiments, focusing primarily on GPT-2 and OPT-1.3b, weakens the findings; testing on larger models is necessary.
- The simplicity of the attack scenarios does not reflect real-world complexities, such as cross-lingual attacks or user modifications.
- The evaluation scenarios feel overly clean, lacking realistic perturbations, and the results show some false positives.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the diversity of models tested by including larger language models to strengthen their findings. Additionally, we suggest incorporating more complex attack scenarios that reflect real-world applications, such as cross-lingual attacks and varying segment lengths. Better visualizations of selected scenarios could also enhance the clarity of the proposed methodology's accuracy. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide a practical ablation study over the hyper-parameter B, examining its impact on runtime and detection effectiveness. Lastly, exploring the effects of repeating key patterns in practical watermarking scenarios would be beneficial.
