### Key Points
This paper presents FlowDCN, a convolution-based diffusion model that generates high-quality images at arbitrary resolutions. It introduces a group-wise multiscale deformable convolution block, enhancing adaptability and efficiency compared to transformer-based models like DiT and FiT. FlowDCN achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 256x256 ImageNet benchmark, demonstrating lower latency, fewer parameters, and reduced floating-point operations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The model is efficient, achieving similar performance to state-of-the-art methods with 20% lower latency, 8% fewer parameters, and approximately 20% fewer floating-point operations.
- The innovative use of deformable convolution allows for better generalization across different resolutions, which is a significant advancement over traditional transformer models.
- Comprehensive evaluation of the deformable convolution operator is provided, showcasing its versatility across various resolution settings.

Weaknesses:
- More experiments are needed to clarify how the model handles arbitrary resolutions, particularly regarding the contributions of Scale Adjustment and the MultiScale DCN Block.
- The paper lacks a related work section and could benefit from restructuring to include foundational concepts in a preliminary section.
- The ablation studies primarily focus on the CIFAR dataset; extending these to larger datasets like ImageNet-1K would provide more comprehensive insights.
- The performance on the 1:2 aspect ratio setting is inferior to FiT, raising questions about the effectiveness of training augmentations and reference statistics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the contributions related to arbitrary resolution handling by conducting additional experiments and providing a detailed analysis of the MultiScale DCN Block's role. It would also be beneficial to restructure the paper to include a preliminary section covering foundational concepts and a related work section for context. Furthermore, we suggest extending ablation studies to larger datasets and including evaluations at additional resolutions (160x480, 160x320, and 128x384) for a more robust comparison. Lastly, addressing the discrepancies in FLOPs reported in different tables and providing a deeper analysis of the Inception score would enhance the paper's rigor.
