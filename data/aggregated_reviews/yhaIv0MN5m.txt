### Key Points
This paper presents a novel application of neural networks to deterministically learn the output-to-initial conditions mapping of cosmological simulations, traditionally characterized by a one-to-many relationship. The authors demonstrate that the initial conditions of various simulation classes can be recovered with surprising accuracy. The work is well-articulated, making complex concepts accessible to a broader machine learning audience.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The authors provide a pioneering approach to mapping outputs to initial conditions in N-body cosmological simulations.  
- The clarity and organization of the paper enhance its accessibility to readers unfamiliar with the field.  

Weaknesses:  
- The authors do not include baseline methods commonly used to address this inverse problem, which could strengthen their findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by incorporating baseline methods that are generally used to solve the inverse problem, as this would provide a more comprehensive context for their results.
