Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for online learning in time series forecasting, termed OneNet, which integrates cross-variable and cross-time dependencies using reinforcement learning and online convex programming. The authors clarify that their reference to "a single model" pertains to either a cross-variable dependency-based model or a cross-time dependency-based model, rather than an ensemble of models. They argue that a single model often fails to capture the complexities of time series data, necessitating an ensemble approach. Empirical results indicate that OneNet significantly reduces forecasting errors compared to state-of-the-art methods. The authors have also investigated the performance of ensembling various models but found no significant performance gains, acknowledging the potential for misunderstanding regarding their contributions and appreciating the feedback that has led to clarifications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it easy to follow.
2. The proposed method is novel, combining reinforcement learning with online convex programming for model ensembling.
3. Comprehensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of OneNet against various baselines.
4. The authors effectively highlight the importance of combining temporal and cross-variable dependencies, which is crucial for their approach to time series forecasting.
5. The availability of code for their model supports reproducibility and further exploration by other researchers.

Weaknesses:
1. The literature review lacks depth, with insufficient exploration of existing studies on online learning and ensemble methods.
2. The technical novelty is questioned, as the authors do not provide a theoretical analysis of why their method works.
3. Minor issues exist in the motivation section, particularly regarding the relevance of Table 1.
4. The initial presentation may have caused confusion regarding the nature of their model, particularly concerning the ensemble concept.
5. The lack of validation using synthetic data may limit the perceived novelty and robustness of their approach.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by incorporating more state-of-the-art references and discussing existing studies on online learning and ensemble methods. Additionally, including an ablation study to demonstrate the necessity of the offline reinforcement learning component would strengthen the paper. We also suggest providing a more detailed algorithmic description of the training and inference processes using the \usepackage{algorithm} package. Furthermore, we recommend improving the clarity of the initial presentation to prevent misunderstandings about the nature of their model. We encourage the authors to validate their approach using synthetic data, as this could significantly enhance the value and novelty of their work. Finally, we suggest considering the publication of an extended version of this work in a journal to further elaborate on their findings and methodologies.
