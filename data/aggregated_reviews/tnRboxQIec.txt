Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DREAM-OOD, a novel framework utilizing diffusion models to generate photo-realistic high-resolution outliers for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. The authors propose a method that constructs a text-conditioned latent space using in-distribution data, enabling the generation of outlier images through denoising techniques. Empirical results indicate that DREAM-OOD enhances performance on OOD detection benchmarks compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents a clear methodology and experimental results.
- It is the first to generate high-resolution outliers specifically for OOD detection, showcasing originality.
- Comprehensive ablation studies and visualizations demonstrate the quality of the learned latent space.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the method is questioned, as it is not the first to leverage diffusion models for outlier generation.
- There is a lack of complexity analysis and computational cost reporting.
- The proposed method's performance on certain datasets, such as texture OOD, is inconsistent, and the necessity of the classifier is debated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the technical differences between DREAM-OOD and previous methods like VOS and NPOS. Additionally, addressing the potential for data leakage and discussing the implications of using pre-trained diffusion models on the quality of generated images would strengthen the paper. It would also be beneficial to explore the use of negative prompts to diversify outlier generation and to provide a complexity analysis alongside computational cost comparisons. Finally, we suggest including a discussion on how DREAM-OOD could scale to larger datasets and its applicability in unsupervised OOD detection settings.
