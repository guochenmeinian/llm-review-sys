### Key Points
This paper presents a method for predicting drug-target interactions by utilizing protein language models and contact maps, building upon the GraphDTA framework. The authors propose the use of ProtBERT, DistilProtBERT, ESM-2, and SeqVec as pre-trained protein language models, but the rationale for their selection is not provided. Additionally, the paper lacks specification of the exact ProtBERT model variant used, and the exclusion of ESM2-650M and SeqVec from certain tables requires clarification. The integration of contact map information yields puzzling results, as indicated by lower performance when included.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The approach builds on the established GraphDTA framework, indicating a solid foundation for the proposed method.  
- The use of multiple protein language models demonstrates a comprehensive approach to the problem.

Weaknesses:  
- The rationale for selecting specific protein language models is unclear.  
- The specific variant of ProtBERT used is not specified, impacting reproducibility.  
- The reasons for excluding ESM2-650M and SeqVec from tables are not addressed.  
- The unexpected results regarding contact map integration are not sufficiently explained.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their rationale for choosing ProtBERT, DistilProtBERT, ESM-2, and SeqVec as pre-trained protein language models. Additionally, the authors should specify which variant of ProtBERT was employed to enhance reproducibility. Clarifying the reasons for excluding ESM2-650M and SeqVec from the tables would strengthen the methodology's transparency. Finally, we suggest that the authors elucidate the reasons behind the unexpected results related to contact map integration to provide a clearer understanding of their experimental design.
