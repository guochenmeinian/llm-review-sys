Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for relightable 3D reconstruction using a Relighting Diffusion Model (RDM) to generate relit images, which are then distilled into a latent NeRF. The authors propose a pipeline that leverages multi-view observations to synthesize novel views under varying lighting conditions, demonstrating superior performance over traditional inverse rendering methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The writing is clear, and the paper is well-structured, providing comprehensive implementation details.
- The introduction of a novel paradigm addresses a long-standing challenge in relighting, offering a promising alternative to conventional methods.
- Extensive numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- The efficiency of the proposed method is a significant concern, as it requires optimizing a NeRF for each new lighting condition, leading to long computation times (0.75 hours using 16 A100 GPUs).
- The effectiveness of the latent NeRF is questionable, as it may average out specular highlights, resulting in less detailed images compared to baseline methods like Neural-PBIR.
- The reliance on the UniSDF reconstruction pipeline raises concerns about the method's robustness, and the paper lacks sufficient discussion on alternative reconstruction methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the efficiency of their method by exploring potential solutions to reduce the computation time associated with optimizing the NeRF for new lighting conditions. Additionally, we suggest providing a more thorough analysis of the latent NeRF's performance, particularly regarding its ability to preserve details and specularity in the reconciled images. It would also be beneficial to discuss the choice of UniSDF more comprehensively and consider including comparisons with other reconstruction methods. Finally, addressing the misleading aspects of the abstract and clarifying the normalization techniques used in the evaluation would enhance the paper's clarity and rigor.
