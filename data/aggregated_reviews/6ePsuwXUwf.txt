Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an Efficient End-to-End training (E3T) approach for zero-shot human-AI coordination, utilizing a mixture of an ego policy and a random policy to efficiently train a diverse coordination policy without requiring populations of agents. The authors also introduce a partnering module that models the partner's actions, enhancing collaboration. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over prior methods, tested with both proxy and real human partners.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is straightforward and effectively addresses the challenge of efficient zero-shot coordination with humans.
- The combination of ego and random policies leverages self-play strengths while incorporating diversity to prevent overfitting.
- The partnering module shows empirical advantages, and experiments are comprehensive, including comparisons with various prior approaches and detailed ablation studies.

Weaknesses:
- The method's sensitivity to $\varepsilon$ raises concerns; it would be beneficial to evaluate whether $\varepsilon$ needs tuning for each task.
- Minor issues include a missing epsilon in the algorithm and a typo in line 232.
- The limited novelty of the approach, being a combination of existing techniques, calls for a more detailed analysis to elucidate its effectiveness.
- The Overcooked environment used for testing is considered outdated, necessitating evaluation on more complex scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the sensitivity of $\varepsilon$ across different tasks and clarify how it is chosen in experiments. Additionally, addressing the potential integration of the partner modeling module into other baselines could provide further insights into performance enhancements. Expanding evaluations to more complex environments beyond Overcooked would strengthen the paper's contributions. Lastly, we suggest providing a more detailed theoretical analysis to clarify the significance of Propositions 1 and 2.
