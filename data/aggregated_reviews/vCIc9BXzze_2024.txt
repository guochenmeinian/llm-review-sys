Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework called tSMC that utilizes KL divergence to evaluate the moral consistency of 12 LLMs on a moral question dataset. The authors find that LLMs exhibit greater consistency on low-ambiguity questions compared to high-ambiguity ones and are influenced by position and selection biases, which their measure aims to correct. The investigation into confidence distributions, rather than solely prompt-based approaches, is a notable aspect of the study.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides critical insights into the inconsistent moral behavior of LLMs, raising ethical concerns for real-world applications.
- The tSMC framework effectively identifies biases and assesses true moral consistency, offering practical implications for LLM development.
- The findings highlight that moral consistency is affected by biases rather than intrinsic model capabilities, with varying results in high-ambiguity versus low-ambiguity scenarios.

Weaknesses:
- The central premise regarding the desirability of moral consistency is unclear, raising questions about its framing as "better."
- The introduction of key metrics and terms lacks sufficient explanation, particularly regarding the "standard method" and the definitions of "context swap" and "full swap."
- The claim of "true moral consistency" may be overstated, as it does not account for all forms of bias.
- The paper's structure and clarity could be improved, particularly in distinguishing related work from the authors' contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the central premise regarding moral consistency and its implications. Additionally, provide more detailed explanations of the metrics introduced, particularly in lines 47-51, and clarify the definitions of "context swap" and "full swap." It would be beneficial to address the potential overclaim of "true moral consistency" by acknowledging other biases. We also suggest relocating the related work section earlier in the paper to provide context and enhance the overall structure for better readability.
