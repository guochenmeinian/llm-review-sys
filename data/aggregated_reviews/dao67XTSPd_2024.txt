Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DeltaDock, a novel two-stage framework for molecular docking that integrates protein pocket prediction and protein-ligand binding refinement. The pocket prediction is framed as a selection problem using contrastive learning, while the docking process is treated as a refinement task. Experimental comparisons demonstrate DeltaDock's advantages over existing computational chemistry docking tools and learning-based methods, particularly in speed and pose accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. DeltaDock is significantly faster than the diffusion-based method DiffDock.
2. The framework is valid and useful for blind molecular docking, with strong experimental results.
3. The contrastive learning approach for pocket prediction and the bi-level refinement module are novel contributions.
4. Detailed ablation studies and generalization analyses highlight the contributions of various components.

Weaknesses:
1. The testing set lacks clear description; training and test proteins should maintain a maximum sequence identity of 40% for generalization testing.
2. Inconsistencies in the comparison methods presented in figures may lead to confusion.
3. The novelty is limited as the GPU-accelerated pose sampling algorithm is essentially DSDP.
4. The framework does not fully adopt an end-to-end approach, relying on external tools that may slow down the docking process.
5. The method neglects the flexibility of protein side chains, which could be addressed in future work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the testing set description and ensure that the training and test proteins adhere to the 40% sequence identity limit. Additionally, we suggest addressing the inconsistencies in the figures to avoid misleading interpretations. To enhance the novelty, consider integrating the pocket prediction of DeltaDock with AutoDock Vina and clarify the contributions of each component. We also encourage the authors to explore the incorporation of side chain flexibility in their model, as well as the potential for generating diverse poses and estimating pose confidence through dedicated models or scoring functions like SMINA.
