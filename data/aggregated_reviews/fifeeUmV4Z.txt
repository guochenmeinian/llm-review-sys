Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to noisy label learning through a generative framework that directly optimizes the association between data and clean labels. It introduces a new model optimization technique and a generative model estimated via a discriminative model, enhancing computational efficiency. The authors propose an informative label prior inspired by partial label learning, which serves as a supervision signal. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art results while maintaining comparable computational complexity to discriminative models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of an informative prior for the latent clean label in noisy label learning is noteworthy.
- Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method across multiple datasets.

Weaknesses:
1. The assumption that Y causes X in the generative noisy-label learning model raises concerns, as previous works suggest a more reasonable model where both latent features Z and Y influence X.
2. The algorithm's limitation to image data is unnecessary; further explanation or experiments on diverse datasets are required.
3. Some symbols, such as $y_i(j)$, $p_i(j)$, and $|\mathcal{Y}|$, need clarification.
4. Certain paragraphs, particularly those detailing the approach, require refinement for clearer communication of how the proposed issues are addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical justification for the generative model by addressing the assumptions made, particularly regarding the relationship between Y and X. Additionally, the authors should expand the scope of their experiments beyond image data to include other types of datasets. Clarifying the symbols used in equations and enhancing the presentation of the methodology will also aid in understanding. Lastly, polishing the relevant paragraphs will help articulate how the proposed framework effectively addresses the issues outlined in the abstract.
