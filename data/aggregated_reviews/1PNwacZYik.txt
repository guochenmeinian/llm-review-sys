Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel one-step drag-based image editing method called "FastDrag," which utilizes a Latent Warpage Function (LWF) to optimize pixel adjustments efficiently. The method significantly accelerates the editing process compared to traditional n-step iterative approaches. FastDrag incorporates Bilateral Nearest Neighbor Interpolation (BNNI) to address null regions and a consistency-preserving strategy to maintain semantic integrity during edits. Experimental results demonstrate that FastDrag achieves processing speeds nearly 700% faster than existing methods while maintaining comparable quality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- FastDrag offers a straightforward and efficient editing process, showcasing a substantial speed performance gain.
- The BNNI strategy effectively handles null regions, preserving semantic integrity and quality.
- The paper includes rigorous evaluations on the DragBench dataset, validating the method's claims.

Weaknesses:
- The discussion of limitations is insufficient; more failing cases and potential enhancement directions should be provided.
- The evaluation metrics lack robustness, and there is a need for more comprehensive assessments beyond visual inspection.
- The paper does not include theoretical grounding or detailed statistical measures, which could strengthen the claims made.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of limitations by including more examples of failure cases and potential enhancements. Additionally, consider incorporating a quantitative evaluation of semantic integrity to complement qualitative assessments. A user study could provide valuable insights into usability and user experience. Expanding the evaluation to include a broader variety of datasets and image types would strengthen the generalizability of FastDrag's performance claims. Finally, providing more detailed technical explanations regarding the LWF and BNNI, as well as clearer instructions for reproducibility, would enhance the paper's overall quality.
