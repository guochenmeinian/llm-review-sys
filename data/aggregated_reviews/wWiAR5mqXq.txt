Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents COPPER, a novel framework aimed at enhancing collaboration in multi-agent systems through a learnable self-reflection mechanism. The authors propose a shared reflector fine-tuned to adjust actor model prompts using a counterfactual PPO mechanism, which incorporates counterfactual rewards to tackle the credit assignment problem. The framework's effectiveness is validated through experiments on multi-hop question answering, mathematics, and chess, showing improved reflection capabilities and generalization across various actor models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is clearly written and explores a new setting in multi-agent reflection, demonstrating improved performance across all three tasks.
- The introduction of counterfactual rewards from reinforcement learning to address the credit assignment problem is innovative.
- Extensive experiments provide a thorough analysis of the proposed mechanism.

Weaknesses:
- The combination of various components makes it unclear which part is most critical, leading to marginal improvements for each component.
- The motivation for the shared reflector may not align with real-world scenarios, as embodied environments do not permit complete information sharing.
- The computational cost of calculating counterfactual rewards is high, especially as the number of agents increases.
- Claims regarding personalized reflection may not be fully substantiated, particularly in scenarios lacking defined roles for agents.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by performing ablation studies in single-agent scenarios to identify the significance of each component. Additionally, the authors should explore the applicability of COPPER to multi-step tasks, such as those in AlfWorld. It would be beneficial to compare COPPER's performance against shared parameter and loss training for all LLMs. Furthermore, providing a detailed analysis of the computational costs associated with training and inference stages, along with more case studies from additional datasets, would enhance the paper's robustness. Lastly, including the Retroformer as a baseline in the multi-agent setting could strengthen the evaluation.
