### Key Points
This paper presents a novel retrieval system named NAIL, designed to accelerate inference time by shifting workload to indexing time. The authors propose using a non-autoregressive decoder for document indexing, allowing for parallel scoring of tokens and only tokenizing queries at retrieval time. Experiments on the BEIR benchmark and MS-MARCO demonstrate that NAIL maintains performance comparable to state-of-the-art cross-encoder and dual-encoder systems while being more computationally efficient. The model captures up to 86% of the performance of cross-attention models while significantly reducing computation costs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The research question is well-motivated, and the use of a non-autoregressive decoder is novel and non-trivial.  
- Thorough experiments confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed retrieval system.  
- The paper is clearly written and easy to follow, with a comprehensive literature review.  

Weaknesses:  
- The authors did not provide detailed experimentation on how FLOPs were measured, complicating reproducibility.  
- The final step of similarity between query and document representation is unclear, as is the process for creating an index using NAIL-Exhaust.  
- The rationale for pre-training on two tasks is insufficiently discussed, and the writing contains instances of undefined parameters and confusing equations.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the final similarity step between query and document representations and provide a detailed explanation of the indexing process with NAIL-Exhaust. Additionally, the authors should clarify the rationale behind the choice of pre-training tasks. Addressing the measurement of FLOPs in detail would enhance reproducibility. Lastly, comparing NAIL with distilled models could provide valuable insights into reducing inference time computational cost complexity.
