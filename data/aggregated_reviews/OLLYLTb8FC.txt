### Key Points
This paper presents HySAE, a 3D scalable end-to-end knowledge hypergraph representation learning model that balances effectiveness and efficiency. The authors propose an efficient position-aware entity role semantic embedding method and two enhanced semantic learning strategies, which effectively capture n-ary complex semantic information with fewer parameters. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that HySAE outperforms all baselines in terms of effectiveness and scalability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- HySAE features a simple position-aware entity role semantic embedding method and two enhanced semantic learning strategies that effectively capture n-ary complex semantic information with fewer parameters.
- The paper is well-written, with a logical flow and comprehensive experimental results showcasing the model's effectiveness and scalability.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation and innovation are insufficient, lacking in-depth discussion and unique insights, with no significant differences from recent hypergraph works.
- The proposed Entity Role Semantic module is a common positional embedding, and the semantic learning strategies resemble those in prior works, leading to similar performance and efficiency.
- There is a lack of theoretical proof demonstrating the superiority of the HySAE modeling approach.
- The paper does not adequately explain the choice of specific arities for datasets and lacks clarity on the interactions between components in the model.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the motivation and innovation of HySAE, providing unique insights that distinguish it from existing hypergraph models. Additionally, we suggest including a notation table for clarity and elaborating on the logical flow and interactions between components in Section 4. To enhance the theoretical foundation, the authors should provide proof of the superiority of the HySAE approach. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to clarify the rationale behind the selection of specific arities for datasets and ensure that all components, such as the operator "RA" and functions "FC" and "Flatten," are adequately explained.
