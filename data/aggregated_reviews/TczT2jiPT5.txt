Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a variable importance framework called the Rashomon importance distribution (RID), which is designed to be robust against the Rashomon effect and dataset resampling. The authors motivate the need for this framework and survey existing methods, providing a theoretical explanation and estimation method for RID. Experiments demonstrate that RID can more reliably distinguish between important and extraneous variables compared to previous methods. A case study in HIV research illustrates RID's ability to identify previously undetected variable importance, suggesting practical value.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and presents high-quality figures and equations, ranking among the top 5% of papers.  
- The authors demonstrate familiarity with relevant prior work, particularly in the Related Work section.  
- The technical contributions are significant, advocating for the use of interpretable model classes like sparse trees.  
- The case study highlights the practical implications of RID in a critical research area.

Weaknesses:  
- The primary weakness is the current lack of applicability to non-linear model classes beyond sparse trees, which may limit its impact in fields dominated by neural networks and transformers.  
- The motivation for stable variable importance measures is not sufficiently justified, and the connection between RID and Rashomon Loss Distribution (RLD) is unclear.  
- There is potential for increased false discovery of non-important variables, which requires further clarification and experimentation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by conducting experiments on real datasets with known important/unimportant variables to validate RID's effectiveness. Additionally, enhancing the visual clarity of plot colors, particularly in figures 2 and 3, would be beneficial. It would be helpful to refer readers to Appendix Section D.3 regarding the stability of RID and to note that a timing analysis was conducted, directing them to Section D.5. Investigating the stability of RID across different dataset resampling methods (e.g., bootstrap vs. subsampling) could provide valuable insights. Furthermore, explicitly listing model classes for which RID can currently be computed would clarify its applicability. Lastly, addressing the unclear notation in Equation 2 and providing a more intuitive explanation of Assumption 1 would strengthen the paper.
