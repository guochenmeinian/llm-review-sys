Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SAMoSSA, a two-stage algorithm that integrates multivariate Singular Spectrum Analysis (mSSA) to estimate non-stationary components in time series with correlated stationary autoregressive (AR) noise. The authors provide theoretical bounds for estimation errors and demonstrate significant forecasting improvements across various datasets. The method's originality lies in its ability to jointly learn deterministic non-stationary and stationary stochastic components, addressing a notable gap in the literature.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of the methodology and theoretical results.
- The theoretical contributions, particularly the error bounds, are solid and address a crucial gap in time series analysis.

Weaknesses:
- The literature review lacks depth, particularly regarding inference for trends and comparisons with classical time series methods like STL decomposition and SES with drift.
- The empirical evaluation is limited, lacking a variety of baseline comparisons and insights into the performance of SAMoSSA relative to other models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by including discussions on related classical time series methods, such as SES with drift and matrix factorization models. Additionally, the authors should expand the empirical evaluation by incorporating more baseline comparisons and providing a deeper analysis of the results to clarify why SAMoSSA outperforms other models. Furthermore, clearer intuitions and visual aids should be included to enhance accessibility for readers less familiar with the theoretical aspects of time series analysis.
