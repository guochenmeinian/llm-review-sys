### Key Points
This paper presents a benchmarking study of molecular predictive models aimed at inferring from 3D conformer ensembles. The authors propose a research problem relevant to the NeurIPS community and structural research of molecules, highlighting an interesting direction with broad interdisciplinary interest. The methodology is well-structured and effectively explained, with the authorsâ€™ framework (MARCEL) potentially expediting the evaluation of machine learning models trained on conformer datasets. However, the authors acknowledge the need for integrating domain expertise, which is notably lacking in the main text.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research problem is closely related to the NeurIPS community and structural molecular research.
- The paper is well-structured and comprehensible for scientists.
- The methodology is clearly explained and supported by efficient results.
- The benchmark design is interesting, utilizing diverse datasets and architectures for 1D, 2D, and 3D molecular data.

Weaknesses:
- The authors provide insufficient detail on the size of the systems considered, which is crucial for understanding the applicability of their methods across different molecular scales.
- There is a lack of rationale regarding the sampling of conformer datasets from the expected in vivo-accessible free-energy landscapes.
- The distinction between supervised and unsupervised approaches is not adequately addressed, particularly concerning existing embedding strategies.
- The novelty of the work is difficult to assess, as it largely derives from existing databases and models, raising questions about the scientific impact and availability of MARCEL.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their discussion on the size of the systems being studied, specifying the range of molecular weights or atoms involved. Additionally, the authors should provide a rationale for the sampling of conformer datasets and discuss the relationship between model performance and the distribution of conformers in the conformational state space. It would also be beneficial for the authors to elaborate on related work regarding inferring from 3D conformer ensembles and to include more architectures specifically designed for this purpose. Finally, to enhance the novelty and impact of their work, the authors should consider making MARCEL available as open-source code, along with a comprehensive user manual and tutorials.
