### Key Points
This paper presents a method for active search in pharmaceutical compound discovery by formulating the problem as finding an approximate posterior distribution over desirable designs, termed Variational Search Distributions (VSD). The authors utilize variational inference to estimate the probability of improvement, approximating the posterior with a parameterized proposal distribution and maximizing the evidence lower bound. The method is scalable, diverse, and generative, with clear exposition and convincing experimental results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The problem is well motivated and relevant, approached from a practitionerâ€™s perspective.  
- The proposed method is clearly articulated, with sound derivations and thorough testing against baselines.  
- The paper is well-written and enjoyable to read.  

Weaknesses:  
- Uncertainty remains regarding the satisfaction of diversity in the variational approximation.  
- Lack of justification for the choice of batch size, with no sensitivity analysis provided.  
- The potential for incorporating prior knowledge through log-likelihoods from protein LLMs is not explored.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the measurement of the diversity of samples from the current variational approximation to address concerns about (R4). Additionally, we suggest providing a justification for the choice of batch size, potentially by consulting practitioners, and including a sensitivity analysis in the experimentation. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to experiment with using log-likelihoods from protein LLMs like the ESM family instead of a uniform prior, as this could enhance convergence speed and provide compelling evidence for the method's efficacy. Lastly, please correct "wich" to "which" in the conclusions.
