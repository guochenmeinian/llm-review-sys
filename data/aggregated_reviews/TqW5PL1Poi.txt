Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SATLM, a framework that enhances reasoning with large language models (LLMs) by translating natural language problems into formal specifications suitable for SAT solvers. The authors demonstrate that SATLM outperforms existing methods like Chain of Thought (CoT) and ProgramLM across various reasoning tasks. Empirical results indicate the effectiveness of this approach, particularly in generating declarative specifications that facilitate automated reasoning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The concept of using a SAT solver to bypass planning errors is innovative.
- Empirical results across multiple datasets are robust.
- The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with informative figures and clear ablation studies.

Weaknesses:
- The benchmarks may overestimate the model's performance, particularly in more complex, realistic scenarios.
- The relationship between the proposed framework and existing works, such as those using LLMs in reasoning algorithms, requires further clarification.
- Some sections could be condensed, and additional details on related work should be included to enhance clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how their approach fits within the existing literature, particularly regarding the integration of works like [1, 2] and decomposition-based methods [3, 4]. Additionally, we suggest condensing descriptions in Sections 2 and 3, moving some experimental details to the supplementary materials. It would also be beneficial to address the applicability of SATLM to more realistic use cases and provide insights into handling unknowns in datasets, as well as clarifying the implementation details of the approach.
