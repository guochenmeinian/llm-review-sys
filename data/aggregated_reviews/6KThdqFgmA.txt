Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents group-fair multi-matching algorithms that address uncertainty in agent-item valuations, focusing on two optimization families: Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) and robust optimization. The authors explore both utilitarian and egalitarian objectives, deriving max-min guarantees for worst-case scenarios and proposing efficient problem formulations. They demonstrate that under certain assumptions, the problems can often be reduced to linear or quadratic programming. Additionally, the paper includes a comparative analysis of the CVaR method and the robust (minimax) approach in allocation problems characterized by high uncertainty, highlighting that CVaR is particularly effective in scenarios with left fat-tail distributions. Empirical results on reviewer assignment data illustrate the effectiveness and scalability of their methods, showing that CVaR outperforms both the robust and na√Øve approaches in various scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem of uncertainty in matching algorithms is well-motivated and practically relevant, particularly in the context of reviewer-paper assignments.
- The paper is well-written, with clear organization and theoretical rigor, making it accessible to readers.
- The authors provide a comprehensive exploration of optimization techniques, including robust and CVaR approaches, and include code for implementation.
- Empirical results support the claims, demonstrating the robustness of CVaR in welfare distributions, especially when valuations are sampled from skewed Gaussian distributions.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation could be improved; key propositions should be stated informally in the main text to enhance clarity.
- The authors do not adequately compare their uncertainty-aware solutions with prior methods, leaving the benefits of their approach unclear.
- The running time of the proposed algorithms is high due to the reliance on linear programming, which may limit practical applications.
- The technical novelty of the paper remains uncertain, as noted by one reviewer.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the main paper by stating Propositions 3.1, 3.3, and 3.4 informally to emphasize their key takeaways. Additionally, consider discussing how uncertainty is captured through modeling agent-item pair valuations. We suggest expanding the experimental section to provide more context on the results, particularly clarifying the significance of normalized utilities in Table 2. Furthermore, we advise the authors to justify the inclusion of CVaR optimization more clearly, especially in light of its slower performance compared to robust optimization. Lastly, addressing the practical implications of assumptions made regarding the independence of valuation matrices would enhance the paper's depth. We also recommend that the authors improve the practical applicability of their algorithms by addressing the running time concerns and adding an experiment that further demonstrates when uncertainty-aware solutions are superior, thereby strengthening their case.
