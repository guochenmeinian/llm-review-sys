Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents improvements to the SimCSE method by addressing dropout noise and feature corruption through two strategies: off-dropout and dimension-wise contrastive learning. The authors provide empirical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of these strategies across several benchmark datasets. Additionally, the paper offers a detailed analysis of the proposed methods and their compatibility with newer SimCSE-based approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors successfully identify two significant issues in SimCSE that have been overlooked in prior research.
- The proposed strategies are simple yet effective, leading to performance improvements on multiple benchmark datasets.
- The detailed analysis provided enhances the understanding of the methods and their implications for future research.

Weaknesses:
- The paper is poorly written, containing numerous typos, grammatical errors, and imprecise terminology, which complicates comprehension.
- The evaluation is limited to 1 million randomly sampled sentences and BERT-base/large architecture, raising concerns about scalability and reproducibility.
- The authors do not clarify whether the source code will be publicly released, which could hinder reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and presentation of the paper by addressing the numerous grammatical mistakes and typographical errors. Additionally, we suggest including runtime efficiency metrics for the SimCSE++ method to clarify the computational implications of the DCL objective. It would also be beneficial to expand the evaluation setup to include larger training datasets and model sizes. Finally, we encourage the authors to analyze the conditions under which their method outperforms standard contrastive learning, particularly in relation to syntactic structure and subject replacements.
