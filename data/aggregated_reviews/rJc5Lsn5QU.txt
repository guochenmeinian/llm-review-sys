Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ARTIC3D, a self-supervised framework for reconstructing 3D articulated shapes and textures of animals from sparse and noisy online images. It employs a skeleton-based surface representation and 2D diffusion priors to enhance input images and guide 3D optimization. The framework also allows for realistic animation through fine-tuning of rendered shapes and textures under rigid part transformations. ARTIC3D demonstrates superior performance compared to previous methods in shape and texture fidelity, robustness to occlusions, and pose transferability. The authors introduce E-LASSIE, an extended dataset with noisy web images, to evaluate model robustness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- ARTIC3D can reconstruct 3D articulated shapes and textures without relying on pre-defined templates or per-image annotations, making it scalable and adaptable.
- The method utilizes 2D diffusion to enhance input images, improving the quality and robustness of 3D outputs and the optimization process.
- The diffusion-guided 3D optimization estimates shape and texture that are faithful to input images, introducing a novel technique for stable image-level gradients.
- The framework produces realistic animations while preserving articulation and detail, enabling explicit pose transfer and animation.

Weaknesses:
- The manuscript is challenging for readers unfamiliar with LASSIE and HI-LASSIE, and it heavily relies on the 3D skeleton initialization from Hi-LASSIE, which may be inaccurate for occluded or truncated bodies.
- Reconstruction results show only marginal improvements over Hi-LASSIE, raising questions about statistical significance.
- The texture quality often diverges from reference images, leading to concerns about proper reconstruction.
- User studies on animation show only slight preference over rigid transformations, with insufficient details on sample size and study design.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the manuscript to make it more accessible to readers unfamiliar with LASSIE and HI-LASSIE. Additionally, addressing the dependency on Hi-LASSIE for 3D skeleton initialization is crucial, particularly for occluded or fluffy animals. We suggest providing clearer evidence of statistical significance in reconstruction results and exploring methods to mitigate texture drift observed in the outputs. Finally, we encourage the authors to enhance the user study methodology by providing detailed explanations of sample sizes and selection criteria to strengthen the validity of their findings.
