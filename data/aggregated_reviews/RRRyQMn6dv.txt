Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for smoke segmentation that addresses the challenges of noisy labels in non-grid smoke annotations. The authors propose a conditional sample weighting (CoSW) method, utilizing a multi-prototype framework and introducing regularized within-prototype entropy (RWE) to enhance prototype stability. The approach aims to improve segmentation accuracy, particularly in the presence of noisy labels, and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on existing datasets (SmokeSeg and SMOKE5K) as well as a new synthetic dataset (NS-1K).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-organized, presenting a clear structure that includes problem introduction, methodology, and experimental results.
2. The introduction of CoSW and RWE is innovative, providing a mathematical foundation for addressing label noise in smoke segmentation.
3. The authors improve the reliability of existing datasets through careful re-annotation and create a synthetic dataset to target label noise issues.
4. Comprehensive evaluation shows significant performance improvements over existing methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The writing lacks clarity in certain mathematical derivations, making it difficult to follow.
2. Some notations are not clearly defined or are introduced late in the text, which hampers understanding.
3. The paper does not adequately explain how CoSW resolves the challenges of complex smoke edges and non-rigid shapes.
4. The explanation of hyper-parameters γ and μ is overly simplistic, lacking detail on their definitions and impact.
5. The layout and aesthetics of figures and tables require improvement for better readability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of mathematical derivations and ensure that all notations are defined clearly and early in the text. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of how CoSW addresses the identified challenges in smoke segmentation. We suggest expanding the discussion on hyper-parameters γ and μ, including their definitions and effects on the overall methodology. Furthermore, enhancing the layout and aesthetics of figures and tables will improve the paper's presentation.
