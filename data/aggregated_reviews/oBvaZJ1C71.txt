Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents GAVEL (Games via Evolution and Language Models), a method for automated board game generation using a domain-specific language (L-GDL) and a quality-diversity algorithm. The authors fine-tune a large language model (LLM) with a fill-in-the-middle objective to reconstruct game components from a dataset of approximately 500 games. Evaluations demonstrate that GAVEL produces diverse and playable games, showing promise in the game generation community.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of evolutionary algorithms with LLMs for game generation is a promising approach.
- The paper provides thorough evaluations using both automated metrics and expert human analysis, enhancing the validity of the results.
- The methodology is well-detailed, allowing for reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution may be limited, as the techniques employed are not particularly novel, and the application appears niche within the broader ML community.
- The evaluation lacks comparative studies with other methods, making it difficult to ascertain the algorithm's effectiveness.
- There is insufficient illustrative case data of generated games, and the evaluation methods may not adequately capture the degree of interest in the games.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparative analysis by including few-shot prompted code LLMs as a baseline to assess GAVEL's performance in terms of token usage and game quality. Additionally, consider providing illustrative cases of generated games in natural language to enhance clarity. Expanding the related work section to include recent advancements in AI-generated games would strengthen the paper's context. Lastly, we suggest discussing the dynamics of game evolution more thoroughly, including the rationale for stopping at 500 evolution steps and exploring the potential for discovering more out-of-distribution games with extended iterations.
