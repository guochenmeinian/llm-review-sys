Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a post-training ensemble method for image restoration that utilizes Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to enhance restoration results. The authors reformulate the ensemble problem into GMMs, estimating ensemble weights on a reference set and storing them in a lookup table for efficient inference. The method demonstrates effectiveness across 14 benchmarks and three restoration tasks: super-resolution, deblurring, and deraining.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The method is novel, well-derived, and theoretically supported, with clear pseudo-code and discussions.
2. Extensive experiments on three restoration tasks validate the method's performance across multiple datasets.
3. The approach achieves promising results that consistently outperform existing baselines.

Weaknesses:
1. The performance of the proposed method is sometimes worse than traditional averaging methods, raising questions about its effectiveness.
2. Notations regarding input and output sizes in super-resolution tasks require clarification.
3. The assumption that image noise follows a Gaussian distribution with zero mean lacks sufficient justification.
4. The method's lack of GPU acceleration needs further explanation.
5. The diversity in pixel numbers within bin sets may affect the EM algorithm's performance, particularly in cases with few pixels.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of notations, particularly regarding input and output sizes in super-resolution tasks. Additionally, the authors should provide a rationale for the assumption of Gaussian noise distribution and clarify the reasons for not utilizing GPU acceleration. It would be beneficial to address the potential issues with the EM algorithm when bin sets contain few pixels. Furthermore, conducting experiments with varying numbers of base models and including results for dehazing or enhancement tasks could enhance the generalizability of the method. Lastly, a more in-depth analysis of the experimental results, particularly regarding marginal improvements and performance degradation in certain tasks, would strengthen the paper's contributions.
