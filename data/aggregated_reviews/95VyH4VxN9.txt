Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Spiking Autonomous Driving (SAD), an end-to-end spiking neural network (SNN) designed for autonomous driving, integrating perception, prediction, and planning into a unified framework. The authors validate SAD on the nuScenes dataset, demonstrating competitive performance and significant energy efficiency compared to traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs). The research emphasizes the advantages of SNNs over ANNs, particularly in terms of sparsity and low latency during inference, and aims to advance neuromorphic computing for sustainable and robust autonomous driving solutions. The work is positioned as a significant contribution to the NeurIPS community, showcasing the potential of SNNs in complex automotive tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed idea is novel and relevant, being one of the first to apply SNNs to autonomous driving, enhancing the impact of the work.
2. The unified framework effectively integrates key components of autonomous driving, showcasing innovative architectural designs.
3. Experimental results indicate competitive performance in perception, prediction, and planning, with impressive energy efficiency.
4. The research addresses a significant gap in applying SNNs to complex tasks like autonomous driving, which was acknowledged by multiple reviewers.
5. The authors successfully resolved many concerns raised by reviewers, leading to increased scores from three of the four participating reviewers.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks comparisons with recent state-of-the-art works in the last three years, particularly in perception, prediction, and planning.
2. Energy consumption analysis is insufficiently detailed, with a need for more comprehensive discussions on memory access and its impact on energy efficiency.
3. The evaluation methodology does not include robust validation against traditional ANN models or real-world testing, limiting the assessment of the proposed method's effectiveness.
4. Some aspects of the authors' responses were seen as commitments rather than validated results, particularly regarding the deployment of the algorithm on a chip.
5. The implementation of the algorithm on hardware remains a challenging process that requires further validation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with recent state-of-the-art ANN models to strengthen the validation of their approach. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed energy consumption analysis, including how memory access influences energy efficiency and a breakdown of energy results for all steps in the process. It would also be beneficial to include experiments on additional datasets to discuss the robustness of the proposed method comprehensively. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors enhance the validation of the algorithm's deployment on a chip and provide more concrete evidence of the algorithm's performance in real-world scenarios to enhance the credibility of their research. Finally, clarifying the advantages of SNNs in safety-critical applications and addressing the limitations in the evaluation methodology would enhance the paper's overall quality.
