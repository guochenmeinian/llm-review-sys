### Key Points
This paper presents "Image Manipulation via Multi-Hop Instructions - A New Dataset and Weakly-Supervised Neuro-Symbolic Approach," focusing on image manipulation using natural language text, which necessitates complex reasoning in multi-modal spaces. The authors propose NEUROSIM, the first neuro-symbolic, weakly supervised, and interpretable model for text-guided image manipulation that does not require output images for training. They extend the CLEVR dataset to create Complex Image Manipulation via Natural Language Instructions (CIM-NLI) and CIM-NLI-LARGE datasets for testing zero-shot generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NEUROSIM competes well with supervised models, particularly in multi-hop reasoning tasks, while maintaining interpretability through a symbolic program based on a Domain Specific Language (DSL).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- NEUROSIM is a novel neuro-symbolic model that combines neural and symbolic representations, enhancing modularity, interpretability, and generalizability.
- The creation of CIM-NLI and CIM-NLI-LARGE datasets provides valuable benchmarks for evaluating image manipulation models.
- NEUROSIM shows competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines, even with limited training data, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex reasoning tasks.
- The model's interpretability allows for better understanding and debugging of its behavior.

Weaknesses:
- The paper's focus on image manipulation with complex multi-hop instructions may limit its applicability to broader NLP or image manipulation research.
- Generalizability concerns arise regarding NEUROSIM's performance on real-world images and diverse datasets, necessitating further evaluation.
- The comparison with other models lacks depth, particularly regarding NEUROSIM's performance on tasks where other models excel or struggle.
- The dataset's synthetic nature may restrict real-world applicability, and the complexity of multi-hop reasoning may not reflect typical user instructions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of NEUROSIM by evaluating its performance on a wider range of real-world datasets. Additionally, we suggest providing more detailed comparisons with other models, particularly in areas where NEUROSIM may underperform. The authors should also consider addressing the limitations of the synthetic dataset by exploring more diverse image editing scenarios. Clarifying the handling of lighting conditions and the performance of NEUROSIM with varying example sizes in Table 3 would enhance the paper's clarity. Lastly, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the effectiveness of the REINFORCE algorithm and its shallow reward structure to strengthen the understanding of its training dynamics.
