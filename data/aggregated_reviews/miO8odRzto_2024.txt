Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Online Relational Inference (ORI) framework, which identifies hidden interaction graphs in evolving multi-agent systems using streaming data. ORI utilizes online backpropagation and treats the adjacency matrix as a trainable parameter, optimized through an adaptive learning rate technique called AdaRelation. Additionally, a data augmentation method named Trajectory Mirror (TM) is introduced to enhance generalization. Experimental results demonstrate ORI's effectiveness in improving relational inference accuracy and adaptability across synthetic and real-world datasets. Furthermore, the authors propose a model that utilizes a parameterized edge representation for message passing in neural relational inference (NRI) and NRI-MPM frameworks. They clarify that the initial edges are defined by “torch.ones / 2” and provide specific code references for this implementation. The role of the 'es' variable in the online_load_nri() function is explained, emphasizing its use in identifying possible sender and receiver nodes during message passing, independent of the ground-truth adjacency matrix.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper is well-written and addresses an interesting problem.  
2. ORI is the first model-agnostic online relational inference framework for multi-agent systems.  
3. The experimental validation on both synthetic and real-world datasets is sufficient and insightful.  
4. The authors provide clear and detailed explanations of their code, enhancing understanding of the model's implementation.  
5. The implementation's quality is acknowledged, and the authors are responsive to feedback.

Weaknesses:  
1. The efficiency analysis is insufficient; the authors should include a comparison of training time.  
2. The compared baselines are weak and limited; stronger baselines from 2023-2024 should be included.  
3. The technical contribution appears weak, particularly regarding Eqn. 1, which seems a natural optimization method. Concerns about potential overfitting when minimizing Eqn. 1 are also noted.  
4. The limitations of the work are not sufficiently discussed, particularly regarding scalability and adaptation to directed graphs.  
5. One reviewer notes a lack of familiarity with the topic, indicating that the paper may not be accessible to all readers.  
6. There is a suggestion for more baseline comparisons, as only four are currently presented.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the efficiency analysis by including a comparison of training time. Additionally, the authors should consider incorporating stronger baselines published in 2023-2024 to enhance the comparative analysis. It would be beneficial for the authors to elaborate on the potential overfitting issues related to Eqn. 1 and provide a more detailed discussion of the limitations of their work, particularly concerning scalability and the handling of directed graphs. Furthermore, clarifying the role and effectiveness of the Trajectory Mirror method in the context of relational inference would strengthen the paper. To enhance accessibility, we recommend that the authors include more comprehensive discussions for readers unfamiliar with the topic.
