Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents GOMAA-Geo, a framework for active geo-localization capable of zero-shot generalization across various goal modalities, including natural language and imagery. The system integrates cross-modality contrastive learning, supervised foundation model pretraining, and reinforcement learning to enhance navigation and localization policies. It demonstrates strong performance in both same-modality and cross-modality tasks, particularly in dynamic environments without prior training on specific scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Modality Agnosticism: GOMAA-Geo's versatility in handling diverse goal specifications enhances its applicability in real-world scenarios, especially in search-and-rescue operations.
2. Zero-Shot Generalization: The framework effectively generalizes to new environments and modalities, crucial for practical applications where pre-collected data may be unavailable.
3. Robust Performance: Extensive evaluations indicate that GOMAA-Geo consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets and modalities.

Weaknesses:
1. Complex Integration: The combination of multiple complex components may pose challenges in optimization and maintenance, potentially limiting adaptability.
2. Computational Demands: The training processes, particularly across different modalities and reinforcement learning, may require significant computational resources, hindering deployment in resource-constrained settings.
3. Limited Discussion on Failure Cases: The paper lacks a detailed analysis of scenarios where GOMAA-Geo fails or performs suboptimally, which would be beneficial for future improvements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on failure cases to provide insights into potential limitations and enhance the framework's robustness. Additionally, we suggest providing more detailed information about the dataset, including data collection methods and potential biases, to validate its quality and ensure the reliability of the evaluation results. Furthermore, addressing the computational demands and exploring optimization strategies could enhance the framework's adaptability in various environments. Lastly, clarifying the relationship between the framework components in the method section would improve the overall clarity of the presentation.
