### Key Points
This paper presents a method for generating implicitly related propositions from observed text using large language models (LLMs). The authors propose that these propositions provide explicit representations of the implicit interpretations associated with reading textual information. The method is evaluated through human assessment, content clustering, and predicting legislative behaviors. The approach aims to enhance machine learning tasks in computational social science by enriching datasets with knowledge derived from LLMs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively applies LLMs to social science problems, contributing valuable insights to the NLP community.
- A thorough assessment of the method's effectiveness is conducted through practical use cases, demonstrating its utility in clustering and predicting behaviors.

Weaknesses:
- The method lacks a comparison with traditional methods for extracting common sense knowledge, which is a notable limitation.
- There is insufficient qualitative analysis of the proposed method, particularly regarding its performance in less successful cases.
- The explanation of the method is brief and primarily located in the appendix, which detracts from clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental design by providing structured details on the research questions, data formats, techniques used, and parameter selections in the main body. Additionally, the authors should clarify the relationship between the formulas presented in the paper and ensure that the title accurately reflects the content. It would also be beneficial to include a more explicit definition of "inferentially related" knowledge and to address the cost and feasibility of the human validation step in practical applications. Finally, we suggest enhancing the qualitative analysis by contextualizing examples where the method does not perform as well relative to the baseline.
