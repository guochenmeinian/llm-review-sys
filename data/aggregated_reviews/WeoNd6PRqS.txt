Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents OMG-LLaVA, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) that integrates image-level, object-level, and pixel-level understanding tasks into a unified framework. The authors propose a novel architecture that combines a perception model with a language model, achieving comprehensive functionality and competitive performance compared to existing models like LLaVA, Osprey, and GLaMM. The experimental results indicate that OMG-LLaVA performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation and goals of the paper are clear and ambitious, with a novel architecture that effectively connects LLMs and dense visual perception models.
2. The design is clean, utilizing a single image encoder and decoder, and introduces a new perception prior module that enhances object-centric comprehension.
3. OMG-LLaVA demonstrates broader capabilities and better performance than several existing MLLMs, while maintaining a simple and elegant design.
4. The writing is generally clear and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks detailed designs or ablation studies for the perception prior embedding, limiting understanding of its effectiveness.
2. There is insufficient discussion on the meta-architecture design, particularly regarding the decision to fix the image decoder and the potential benefits of using a shared decoder.
3. The absence of parameter and Gflops analysis undermines the exploration of the claimed advantages of using a single encoder and decoder.
4. Important technical details and experimental results are omitted, particularly regarding the application of the Hungarian matching algorithm and the performance on prevalent VQA benchmarks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including more detailed designs or ablation studies for the perception prior embedding to clarify its effectiveness. Additionally, a thorough discussion on the meta-architecture design should be added, addressing the implications of fixing the image decoder and exploring the potential benefits of a shared decoder. The authors should also provide a comprehensive parameter and Gflops analysis to substantiate their claims regarding efficiency. Finally, including additional experimental results on VQA benchmarks and addressing the technical details related to the Hungarian matching algorithm would enhance the paper's robustness.
