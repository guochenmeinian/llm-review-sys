### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for text classification using LLMs with a human-in-the-loop mechanism, aimed at personalized classification with minimal user feedback. The authors propose that user interaction refines class descriptions through few-shot examples, enhancing classification accuracy. A user study demonstrates that this method outperforms existing baselines, achieving significant results on an academic dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses important real-world challenges in personalized classifiers and interactive feedback.
- The methodology is sound, and the writing is clear and accessible.
- The approach is user-friendly, enabling non-experts to create high-accuracy classifiers, showing promising results with a 9% improvement over few-shot state-of-the-art methods.

Weaknesses:
- The complexity of the prompts used raises concerns about the LLM's ability to comprehend them fully, and the rationale behind their design is insufficiently discussed.
- The approach may not scale well to scenarios with many classes or fine-grained distinctions, potentially limiting its applicability.
- The paper lacks technical novelty and reproducibility due to its reliance on user interaction and evaluation on a single dataset.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the engineering of prompts, including the justification for their complexity and necessity. Additionally, we suggest exploring the scalability of the approach to multiple classes and fine-grained distinctions, and evaluating the method across various datasets to enhance reproducibility. Furthermore, providing clearer guidelines for reproducing results would strengthen the paper's contributions.
