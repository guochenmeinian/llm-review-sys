Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to address the imbalanced class problem in facial expression recognition (FER) by leveraging information from both major and minor classes. The authors propose two main components: a re-balanced attention map consistency (RAC) module to extract knowledge about minor classes and a re-balanced smooth labels (RSL) module to enhance classification performance. The authors report improved performance metrics, specifically the average F1 score, compared to existing methods, and experimental results on the RAF-DB and FERPlus datasets indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, including EAC, by effectively re-weighting attention maps. However, the limitations of the RUL method in multi-label classification are also highlighted.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The concept of learning from major classes to improve minor class recognition is innovative and well-articulated.
- The method achieves the best average F1 score among compared FER methods and demonstrates significant performance improvements, particularly for minor classes.
- The authors provide comprehensive experimental results that support their claims, and the use of state-of-the-art datasets strengthens the findings.
- The paper is generally well-written, with clear presentation of results.

Weaknesses:
- The rationale behind certain transformations, such as image flipping, is not thoroughly discussed, leaving questions about the appropriateness of other potential transformations.
- The similarity of the proposed method to existing approaches, particularly EAC, raises concerns about novelty, despite clarifications provided by the authors.
- Evidence supporting the assertion that major class samples contain useful information for minor classes is primarily subjective and lacks robust validation.
- The RUL method is noted to be unsuitable for multi-label classification, leading to low performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the differences between "overall accuracy" and "mean accuracy" to enhance reader understanding. Additionally, a more detailed discussion regarding the choice of transformations for attention consistency is necessary. The authors should also provide a clearer explanation of the "knowledge" extracted by the RAC module and the rationale behind the design of the RSL module, including the significance of the terms in Eq. (8). Furthermore, conducting additional experiments to validate the claims about label distribution learning and exploring the impact of varying the re-balanced weight would strengthen the paper. Lastly, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the discussion surrounding the limitations of the RUL method, particularly in relation to its application in multi-label scenarios, and include a discussion of the limitations regarding the method's performance across different demographic factors to provide a more comprehensive view of its applicability.
