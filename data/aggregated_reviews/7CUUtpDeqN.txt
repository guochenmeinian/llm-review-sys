Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analytical approach to Partial Information Decomposition (PID) specifically for the BROJA-PID framework, extending previous results from Gaussian distributions to a broader class of stable and convolution-closed distributions. The authors propose a minimization problem of conditional mutual information and establish sufficient conditions under which the unique information achieves zero. Additionally, the paper connects data fission and thinning results, providing an upper bound for PID applicable to various systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper generalizes PID results from joint Gaussian distributions to a wider family of distributions, enhancing the theoretical understanding of PID.  
- It effectively links PID to data fission and thinning, offering practical implications for applications in fields like neuroscience.  
- The analytical upper bound for convolution-closed distributions is a significant contribution, simplifying the computation of PID problems.

Weaknesses:  
- The analytical extension is limited to BROJA-PID, neglecting other PID measures that diverge from this framework.  
- The title is misleading as it implies a broader scope than the paper covers; it should clarify that PID is not solely about BROJA decomposition.  
- The results primarily focus on cases with zero unique information, which may restrict applicability in general systems.  
- The analysis of the proposed upper bound lacks depth, and the paper does not adequately illustrate its results, leaving readers without clear intuition.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the title to accurately reflect the scope of the paper and clarify the distinction between BROJA-PID and other PID measures. Additionally, the authors should provide more empirical validation of their results and address the applicability of their findings to real-world data. It would be beneficial to include comparisons with other numerical estimators for PID and to illustrate analytical PID values from various systems to enhance reader understanding. Furthermore, addressing the limitations regarding the analytical computation of non-zero unique information would strengthen the paper's contributions.
