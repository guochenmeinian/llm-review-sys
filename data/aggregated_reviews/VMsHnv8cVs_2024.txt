Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents NeuRes, a neural symbolic system aimed at solving the Boolean satisfiability problem of CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form). NeuRes employs a message-passing graph neural network to embed CNF information, predicting clause pairs for propositional resolution and value assignments for satisfiability. The authors propose three novel attention mechanisms to enhance clause pair selection and utilize expert iteration to optimize proof generation. Experimental results indicate that NeuRes outperforms NeuroSAT in generating resolution proofs for UNSAT problems and demonstrates some generalizability to larger instances.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The novel parallel mechanism for concurrently proving unsatisfiability and finding truth value assignments is expected to significantly accelerate the proving process.
- The distinct characteristics of the three proposed attention variants are suitable for various situations, and the expert iteration process effectively reduces proof length.
- The paper is well-written and presents its methodologies clearly.

Weaknesses:
- The absence of a thorough ablation study limits the evaluation of each proposed component's effectiveness, particularly regarding the true value assignment task.
- Concerns regarding the computational efficiency of the neural method are raised, particularly the overhead introduced by neural network-based clause selection.
- The comparison with highly-engineered SAT solvers is unclear, and the paper does not adequately address the gap between the proposed approach and traditional methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including a comprehensive ablation study to assess the effectiveness of each component, particularly the true value assignment task. Additionally, we suggest providing a clearer comparison of the efficiency of the three attention mechanisms against baseline methods, including NeuroSAT, to better contextualize the performance of NeuRes. Clarifying the relationship between the proposed approach and traditional SAT solvers, as well as addressing the scalability of the method to larger real-world instances, would strengthen the paper's contributions. Lastly, we encourage the authors to refine the presentation to ensure that the key messages are not overshadowed by potentially misleading comparisons.
