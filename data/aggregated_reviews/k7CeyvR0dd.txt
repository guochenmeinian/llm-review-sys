### Key Points
This paper presents an Epidemiology-Informed Network (EIN) model for rumor detection that integrates epidemiological theory and large language models (LLMs) to enhance classification accuracy. The authors propose a method that simulates user attitude changes during rumor propagation, addressing limitations of traditional Graph Neural Network-based models. The EIN method consists of three modules: an epidemiological encoder, LLM-based state label generation, and epidemiological representation learning. Experimental results indicate that EIN outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness across various propagation tree depths.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of epidemiology theory into rumor detection is a novel contribution.
2. The experiments are extensive and provide a thorough analysis of the model's effectiveness.
3. The paper is well-organized, with clear writing and effective visualizations.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation for using epidemiology-informed approaches needs further elaboration, particularly regarding the modeling of states (Unknown, Support, Denial) and their impact on propagation trees.
2. The reliability of LLM-generated stance labels is questionable, and the paper lacks a discussion on the quality of these labels compared to human-generated ones.
3. The improvement of EIN over existing methods, such as ResGCN and RAGCL, appears limited, and the methods section lacks a strong connection to the defined research gaps.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of how explicitly modeling the three states enhances the robustness of graph-based rumor detection methods. Additionally, the authors should consider measuring the quality of LLM-generated stance labels using either LLM-judge or a small-scale human evaluation. Clarifying the advantages of LLM-based labeling in maintaining accuracy while reducing annotation costs would also strengthen the paper. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors provide a more detailed analysis of the limited improvements observed in the Weibo dataset and ensure that the methods section is closely linked to the identified research gaps. Lastly, simplifying the overview diagram to highlight the challenges and innovations of the method would enhance clarity.
