### Key Points
This paper presents a bi-level graph model called BiGraph that utilizes image mass cytometry (IMC) to analyze patterns in the tumor microenvironment (TME) for risk-based patient stratification. The authors apply this model to 693 breast cancer patients, identifying nine diverse patient subgroups associated with survival outcomes. Additionally, the authors propose a novel graph vectorization method based on distance-weighted message passing, subtree clustering, and subtree motif counting, which is used to create a graph similarity metric for patient subtype identification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed model is novel and theoretically applicable in data-limited settings, addressing a significant challenge in cancer survival analysis.
- The method is elegant, sample efficient, and well-justified by biological insights, making impactful contributions to the understanding of tissue-level analysis in relation to patient prognosis.
- The results are interpretable, with graph-based subtypes reflecting prominent tissue components.

Weaknesses:
- The method lacks comparisons against existing subtyping methods (e.g., TCGA) or simpler approaches, leaving it unclear whether the proposed method offers significant advantages over established techniques.
- There is inconsistency in the use of subgraphs and subtrees, particularly regarding the guarantee of subgraphs being subtrees for higher values of \(h\).
- The method's handling of graphs with varying numbers of cells/nodes and total subtrees is not addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the manuscript by including comparisons with existing subtyping methods and simpler approaches to demonstrate the advantages of their proposed method. Additionally, clarifying the interchangeability of subgraphs and subtrees, particularly for \(h=2\), would enhance the technical rigor of the paper. Finally, addressing the processing of graphs with different structures and revising Figure 2 for clarity would strengthen the overall presentation.
