Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Monte-Carlo-based stopping criterion for Bayesian optimization tasks, addressing a gap in the literature. The authors propose a probabilistic regret bound estimator that determines when to stop the optimization process based on sampling the function and finding maximum points. The paper includes theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a new stopping criterion based on probabilistic regret bounds, providing a more adaptive alternative to traditional budget-based methods.
- The theoretical results are rigorous and may benefit other areas of research in Bayesian optimization and bandits.
- The problem formulation is clear, and the paper is well-organized.

Weaknesses:
- The writing quality requires significant improvement, with some sections lacking clarity and technical detail.
- The algorithm presented in Algorithm 1 is generic and requires calibration of parameters that are nontrivial, making it less applicable in practical Bayesian optimization settings.
- Assumption A.3 is not commonly accepted in the Bayesian optimization field, raising concerns about its applicability, especially in noisy cases.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and technical detail of the methodology, particularly in Algorithm 1, to better illustrate its application within the Bayesian optimization loop. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more targeted algorithm for the Bayesian optimization context rather than a generic version. It would also be beneficial to clarify the connection of Section 3.2 to the Bayesian optimization setting and to discuss scalability limitations more thoroughly. Finally, we encourage the authors to offer practical guidance on the choice of iterations to ensure that the posterior Gaussian process can provide a reasonable stopping criterion in real-world applications.
