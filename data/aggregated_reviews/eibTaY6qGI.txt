### Key Points
This paper presents Resilient Multiple Choice Learning (rMCL), an extension of Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) aimed at addressing overconfidence and hypothesis collapse in regression settings with multiple target samples. The authors propose a new loss function that incorporates a hypothesis scoring loss alongside the existing multi-target winner-takes-all (WTA) loss. The rMCL model is evaluated on both synthetic datasets and a sound source localization (SSL) task, demonstrating improved performance in handling multimodal outputs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach effectively builds on existing literature to address the overconfidence problem by adding an additional term to the loss function.
- The authors visually demonstrate the effectiveness of rMCL using a toy dataset and apply it to a real-world regression task (SSL).
- The probabilistic interpretation of the model enhances understanding and potential application across various tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The SSL experiment lacks clarity, particularly regarding the interpretation of EMD and oracle error, raising questions about the evaluation metrics.
- The method does not adequately address the hypothesis collapse problem inherent in MCL.
- Performance metrics on recent datasets like LOCATA or DCASE 2019 are not reported, and the model's performance on Oracle metrics is notably lower than competing methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the SSL experiment by providing detailed explanations of the EMD and oracle error metrics. Additionally, addressing the hypothesis collapse issue more explicitly in the discussion would strengthen the paper. It would be beneficial to include performance comparisons on more recent datasets and to justify the emphasis on multimodal EMD results despite the drop in Oracle distance metrics. Lastly, we suggest exploring the model's robustness to noise and outliers, as well as enhancing the interpretability of the probabilistic framework.
