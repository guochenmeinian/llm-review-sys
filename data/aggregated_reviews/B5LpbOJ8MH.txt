Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel model-agnostic recipe, MARIO, aimed at enhancing out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in graph contrastive learning (GCL). The authors focus on two main principles: invariant representation learning and information bottleneck. They provide extensive empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of MARIO across various datasets and settings, particularly for node-level tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1) The investigation into OOD generalization in unsupervised graph learning is both important and timely.
2) The paper includes comprehensive experiments validating the proposed method against multiple baselines.
3) The theoretical analysis of augmentations and representation contrasting is well-motivated and insightful.
4) The paper is well-structured and presents the findings clearly.

Weaknesses:
1) The writing lacks clarity in several areas, particularly in explaining concepts and equations, such as the definition of environment labels.
2) The model's complexity is high due to numerous incremental improvements, yet runtime complexity is not discussed.
3) The absence of reproducible experiments raises concerns about the validity of the results.
4) A detailed algorithm or framework diagram is necessary for clarity, as the current representation in the appendix is insufficient.
5) The sensitivity analysis does not encompass all hyperparameters, and the validity of using graph OOD benchmarks for evaluating the node OOD method needs further justification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing, particularly in section 3, by providing better explanations and possibly pseudocode to illustrate the framework. Additionally, we suggest including a comprehensive diagram of the MARIO framework to enhance reader understanding. The authors should also address the runtime complexity of the model and provide reproducible experimental details, including parameter settings for baseline methods. Finally, we encourage the authors to comment on the limitations of their method and justify the use of online clustering labels as pseudo-labels.
