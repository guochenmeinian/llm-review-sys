### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of optimal sequential batch design for functional data, introducing a KL-based decision criterion and a simulated annealing algorithm for estimation. The authors claim their method maximizes information from sparse and irregular time-series data, but the practical implications and effectiveness of their approach remain unclear due to a lack of simulation or real-world data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Addresses a previously unsolved problem in active learning and Bayesian optimization for time-series data.
- Clear exposition of the method in Sections 2 and 3.

Weaknesses:
- Unclear applicability of the proposed method and limited engagement with existing literature on Bayesian adaptive experimental design and active learning.
- Writing is intermittently confusing, particularly in the introduction and conclusion.
- The method appears unimplemented, raising concerns about its practical viability.
- Simulated annealing is questioned as a suitable optimization method given the closed-form utility function.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by providing specific use cases for their method, as this would strengthen the paper significantly. Additionally, addressing the lack of adaptiveness within batches and justifying the chosen setup would enhance the motivation for their approach. We suggest exploring first-order or second-order optimization methods instead of simulated annealing, as they may yield better performance. The authors should also consider comparing their adaptive measurement point selection to simpler, fixed-schedule approaches to illustrate the advantages of their method. Finally, a deeper engagement with the literature on information-theoretic active learning could provide valuable insights for optimizing design with multi-step lookahead.
