Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents FreeSel, a method for data selection that operates without training, thus saving significant time compared to previous methods. Utilizing a publicly available pretrained model, FreeSel selects data from datasets through single-pass inference, employing a distance-based sampling strategy based on semantic patterns of samples. The authors assert that their approach addresses generality, efficiency, and non-supervision, and they validate their method through experiments across various tasks, including classification, segmentation, and detection.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method requires no training for selecting useful examples, significantly reducing time costs.
2. The experimental results demonstrate the method's effectiveness across multiple tasks and datasets.
3. The paper is well-structured and easy to understand.

Weaknesses:
1. The method's simplicity in comparing similarities among input sample features limits its performance compared to other methods.
2. The experiments utilize outdated models and datasets; results on contemporary datasets like COCO or ADE20k with modern backbones are needed.
3. The positioning of FreeSel as an active learning method is questionable; it is more aligned with subset selection. Additional comparisons with existing active learning methods are necessary.
4. The evaluation lacks comprehensive benchmarking against recent methods, and the rationale for certain design choices remains unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the positioning of FreeSel by clarifying its distinction from traditional active learning and providing additional comparisons to existing subset selection methods. Including results on contemporary datasets and models would enhance the evaluation's relevance. Furthermore, addressing the concerns regarding the method's reliance on local features and the determination of the variable "c" would strengthen the paper's technical rigor. Lastly, we suggest incorporating more comprehensive benchmarking to validate the proposed method's effectiveness against state-of-the-art techniques.
