### Key Points
This paper presents advancements in the study of multi-armed bandits (MAB) with expert advice and contextual linear bandits (CLB). The authors propose a new lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{KT\log\frac{N}{K}})$ for MAB, improving upon the previous lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{KT\frac{\log N}{\log K}})$ and demonstrating that the upper bound $O(\sqrt{KT\log\frac{N}{K}})$ is tight. For CLB, they design an algorithm using the follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) approach with a Tsallis entropy regularizer, achieving a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{dT \log K(\min(1,S/d))})$ and proving a matching lower bound under certain conditions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively bridges the gap between lower and upper bounds for MAB with expert advice, addressing an open problem in the field.
- The reduction from best expert identification to MAB with expert advice is a notable contribution, leading to a matching lower bound.
- The use of FTRL with Tsallis entropy regularization is a significant improvement in the context of linear bandits.

Weaknesses:
- The algorithm for CLB is limited to finite contexts, which restricts its applicability in real-world scenarios.
- The implementation requires knowledge of the context distribution, posing a limitation.
- The optimality of the additional term in the regret bound for CLB is unclear, particularly regarding its relationship to $T$.
- The presentation lacks clarity in high-level intuitions and could benefit from more detailed proofs and explanations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the high-level intuitions behind the lower bound constructions in one or two pages. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the proof of Lemma 3, particularly regarding the use of the lemma for variable $p_t$. It would also be beneficial to discuss the potential for extending the algorithm to infinite or unknown contexts and clarify the unavoidable nature of the additional term in the upper bound for CLB. Finally, addressing the limitations of the current work, such as the lack of empirical results and practical applications, would enhance the paper's impact.
