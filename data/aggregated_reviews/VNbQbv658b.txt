Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the CoVoMix framework for human-like monologue and dialogue generation, addressing the limitations of previous multispeaker dialogue systems and the scarcity of high-quality datasets. The authors propose a zero-shot approach that achieves high naturalness and speaker similarity in both monologue and dialogue generations, demonstrating proficiency in dialogue turn-taking and spontaneous behavior generation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is easy to follow and introduces a novel zero-shot, human-like multi-talker conversational mixed speech generation approach.
2. It presents new dialogue evaluation metrics: Turn-taking Statistics, Para-linguistic Behaviors, and Speech Consistency.
3. The demo video effectively showcases the generated conversations' naturalness and intelligibility.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks explicit performance comparisons with previous literature, which could enhance understanding of the proposed model's effectiveness.
2. The use of the Fisher dataset raises concerns about generalizability; incorporating additional datasets is recommended to verify the model's effectiveness.
3. The method section contains unclear writing, particularly regarding the division of semantic embeddings.
4. Insufficient baseline comparisons limit the evaluation of CoVoMix's performance against other models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method section, specifically lines 149-152, to clarify the division of semantic embeddings. Additionally, we suggest incorporating comparisons with more baseline models, including Soundstorm and other open-sourced TTS models, to provide a comprehensive evaluation of CoVoMix's performance. Furthermore, utilizing additional datasets beyond the Fisher dataset would enhance the generalizability of the proposed model. Lastly, addressing the personalization aspect of turn-taking could enrich the model's capabilities, as this phenomenon varies among individuals.
