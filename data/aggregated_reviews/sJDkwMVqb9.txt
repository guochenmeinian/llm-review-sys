Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a twin-structure framework aimed at mitigating bias in link prediction tasks for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The authors investigate the bias between internal links and cross-links, proposing a method that employs supervision augmentation and an embedding fusion module to enhance debiased node embeddings. The framework is designed to improve link prediction performance while addressing the issue of information silos. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method across three datasets and six GNN architectures.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The framework effectively addresses the significant issue of bias in GNNs, with a clear and understandable logic.
- The proposed method shows consistent performance improvements across various GNN models.
- The authors conduct comprehensive experiments, including ablation studies, to validate their approach.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on only three datasets raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings, particularly regarding heterophilous graphs where cross-links may be more prevalent.
- The rationale for using the Jaccard coefficient for supervision augmentation lacks clarity, and alternative methods such as edge predictors could be more effective.
- The paper does not adequately explore the impact of community detection algorithms on results, nor does it compare the proposed method against additional baselines beyond GraphSAGE.
- Presentation issues, such as unclear figures and terminology, detract from the overall clarity of the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the robustness of their findings by evaluating their method on a wider variety of datasets, including those from the SNAP repository and synthetic datasets. Additionally, the authors should clarify the rationale for their choice of supervision augmentation and consider employing edge predictors as an alternative. It would be beneficial to include comparisons with UGE under different architectures, such as LightGCN and GAT. Furthermore, enhancing the presentation quality, particularly in figures and terminology, will improve readability. Lastly, addressing the limitations related to community detection algorithms and providing a theoretical analysis of their approach would strengthen the paper's contributions.
