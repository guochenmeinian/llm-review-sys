### Key Points
This paper presents a framework called Trident for detecting both known and unknown attacks in network traffic, particularly in the context of concept drift. Trident comprises three modules: tSieve for profiling traffic, tScissors for determining outlier thresholds, and tMagnifier for clustering. The authors claim that Trident outperforms 16 state-of-the-art methods. However, the necessity of using a series of one-class models for unknown attacks is questioned, as simpler methods like thresholding could suffice. The paper also discusses the use of multiple machine learning models (AutoEncoders, RNNs, GNNs) but lacks clarity on their comparative significance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is novel, integrating three tightly coupled components for effective detection.
- Extensive experimental evaluation across multiple datasets demonstrates the framework's capabilities.

Weaknesses:
- The requirement for separate one-class models for each traffic type may lead to computational inefficiencies in complex networks.
- The evaluation of the mechanism for labeling novel attacks is insufficient, lacking external validation.
- Some datasets used are outdated, potentially affecting the relevance of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the necessity of one-class models for handling unknown attacks, possibly by discussing simpler threshold-based methods. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the rationale behind using multiple ML models with similar performance and provide a more detailed evaluation of the mechanism for labeling novel attacks. The authors should also address the outdated datasets and consider incorporating more recent data to enhance the relevance of their findings. Finally, a thorough proofreading is essential to rectify typos and improve overall presentation quality.
