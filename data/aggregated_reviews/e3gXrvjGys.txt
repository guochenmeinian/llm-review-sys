### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to generating synaesthesia annotations for sentences by constructing a synaesthesia corpus, converting the data into a tree structure, and employing the T5 pre-trained model for sentence-to-synaesthesia tree generation. The authors propose transforming the task into multiple subtasks to enhance accuracy. The work introduces a comprehensive annotation framework that includes sensory modalities, cues, and stimuli, and demonstrates the model's effectiveness through experimental results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, organized, and presents a reliable idea by utilizing the T5 generative model for synaesthesia generation.
- The proposed annotation framework is comprehensive and beneficial for further research in understanding synaesthetic information.
- The model effectively captures interdependencies among synaesthetic elements, leading to improved comprehension and performance over baseline methods.

Weaknesses:
- The innovation of using T5 for synaesthesia generation is questioned, as it may not be significantly different from existing methods.
- The paper lacks clarity on how inter-annotator disagreements were resolved and how consistency in annotations was maintained.
- There is uncertainty regarding the generalizability of the proposed framework to other languages, and the title does not specify the focus on Chinese synaesthesia.
- The readability of section 4.3 could be enhanced, and the authors do not clarify plans for dataset availability, which is crucial for reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of section 4.3 to enhance readability. Additionally, please provide details on how inter-annotator disagreements were resolved and what measures were taken to ensure consistency in the annotation process. It would be beneficial to clarify the plans for making the dataset publicly available to foster further research. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors explore the adaptability of the proposed framework to other languages and include a comparison of the model's performance to human performance in identifying and generating synaesthetic elements.
