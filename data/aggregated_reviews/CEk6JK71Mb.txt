Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel inference approach for language models called "Meet in the Middle" (MIM), which employs bidirectional training—left-to-right and right-to-left—to enhance data efficiency and align token distributions. MIM improves performance on infilling tasks through a dual-direction infilling procedure, demonstrating superior results over traditional pre-training methods in both programming and natural languages. Extensive empirical testing supports the efficacy of MIM against strong baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The novelty of MIM is significant, particularly in the inference phase for text infilling.
2. MIM effectively addresses general text infilling across both natural and programming languages, enhancing performance regardless of the underlying neural network architecture.
3. The empirical validation is robust, with rigorous assessments against multiple benchmarks.

Weaknesses:
1. MIM incurs increased computational demands and memory usage due to the dual model approach, necessitating a comparison against an ensemble of two left-to-right LMs pretrained with different random seeds for a more comprehensive evaluation.
2. The visual presentation of the paper requires improvement, as many tables and figures are inadequately sized for legibility, which may hinder reader comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivations behind MIM, particularly in relation to the "Fill in the Middle" (FIM) framework, by providing equations and a discussion on why MIM may be simpler and more effective. Additionally, we suggest including ablation studies that quantify the additional computational cost compared to regular left-to-right pretraining and exploring the performance of MIM with larger model scales. Lastly, enhancing the visual presentation of tables and figures will facilitate better understanding of the research findings.
