### Key Points
This paper presents the Bayesian Machine Scientist (BMS) method, leveraging Bayesian inference to derive mathematical models in psychology, particularly for human information processing. The authors demonstrate that BMS outperforms conventional benchmarks through solid experimentation, including the effects of different priors on model performance. However, the study lacks an analysis of the interpretability of the BMS model and does not validate the discovered equations against the ground-truth equations from simulations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The application of BMS for psychological model discovery is novel and has the potential to provide new insights.
- The experimental setup is thorough, with comparisons against standard benchmarks and varying noise levels.
- The exploration of informed priors adds depth to the model's evaluation.
- The manuscript is well-written and accessible.

Weaknesses:
- There is a lack of in-depth analysis regarding the interpretable aspects of the BMS model, which diminishes the study's impact.
- The model's ability to recover ground-truth equations from simulations is not demonstrated, raising concerns about validation.
- The choice of benchmarks excludes symbolic regression approaches, which could enhance the discussion.
- The novelty of the study is questioned due to previous applications of similar methods in psychology.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the interpretable aspects of the BMS model to enhance the study's impact. Additionally, demonstrating the model's capacity to recover ground-truth equations from simulations would strengthen their claims. The authors should also consider benchmarking against symbolic regression methods or at least provide a qualitative comparison to address concerns about novelty. Integrating this feedback will significantly enhance the quality and relevance of the paper.
