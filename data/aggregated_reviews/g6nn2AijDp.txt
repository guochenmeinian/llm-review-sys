Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the CODE decoding method, which contrasts original images with VLM-generated image descriptions to identify missed or hallucinated content during the decoding process. The method introduces two innovations: a Bounded Divergence guided selector for dynamic combining weights and an adaptive information constraint based on Bounded Divergence. Experimental results demonstrate promising performance improvements across multiple benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and addresses a crucial problem in MLLMs.
2. The novel idea of contrasting images and captions in the VLM decoding process is compelling.
3. The CODE method is simple and effective across various benchmarks.

Weaknesses:
1. The dynamic information flow control lacks significant technical novelty, being similar to IBD.
2. The paper does not adequately discuss the advantages of contrasting image descriptions over corrupted images.
3. There is insufficient discussion on what constitutes a good image description for CODE's application.
4. The method requires generating comprehensive descriptions for each image, leading to long inference times.
5. The ablation study is limited to MMVP and LLaVA QA 90, with no analysis on other benchmarks like POPE.
6. The performance of CODE is not optimal in some cases compared to greedy decoding, particularly for specific problem types in MMVP.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the technical novelty of dynamic information flow control and clarify the advantages of contrasting image descriptions over corrupted images. Additionally, the authors should provide a detailed analysis of what makes a good image description for CODE. To address the inference time issue, consider optimizing the description generation process. We also suggest conducting ablation studies on a wider range of benchmarks, including POPE, and analyzing the performance discrepancies between CODE and greedy decoding for specific problem types in MMVP.
