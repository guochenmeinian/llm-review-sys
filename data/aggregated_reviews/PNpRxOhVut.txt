### Key Points
This paper presents a spectral viewpoint on continual relation extraction (CRE), emphasizing the role of eigenvectors in preserving class shapes and mitigating representation shift. The authors propose a class-wise feature decorrelation regularization to enhance the eigenvalues of class representations. The paper provides theoretical and empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of this method, demonstrating improvements on two benchmark datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers an interesting perspective on representation shift in CRE and effectively utilizes spectral decomposition.
- The proposed regularization technique is simple yet demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing baselines.
- The methodology is well-formulated, and the experiments validate the claims made regarding performance gains.

Weaknesses:
- There is a lack of interpretation regarding the eigenvectors with larger eigenvalues and the features they capture, with no high-level visualizations provided.
- The paper does not sufficiently compare its approach to other spectral methods or feature decorrelation techniques, nor does it clarify its novelty relative to existing works.
- The empirical performance improvements are not significantly better than baseline alternatives, and the absence of a comprehensive ablation study limits the verification of key assumptions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the interpretation of eigenvectors with larger eigenvalues by including examples or visualizations to clarify the features they represent. Additionally, the authors should discuss the relationship of their method with other spectral approaches and feature decorrelation techniques to highlight its novelty. Incorporating a detailed ablation study would also strengthen the evidence for the effectiveness of their method. Lastly, a discussion on the computational costs compared to existing state-of-the-art methods would be beneficial.
