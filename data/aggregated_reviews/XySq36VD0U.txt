Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a training-free, lightweight method for generating unanswerable questions in extractive question answering systems through antonym and entity swaps. The authors demonstrate that their approach achieves higher readability and relatedness compared to existing methods and shows improved performance on the SQuAD 2.0 dataset. The method is positioned as a strong baseline for future research and highlights its practical usefulness in enhancing question answering systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is simple, efficient, and effective, requiring no training and reducing reliance on manual annotation.
- It outperforms baseline methods in human-judged metrics such as unanswerability, relatedness, and readability.
- The paper is well-structured and easy to read, making it accessible to the QA community.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty is limited, as the methodology of antonym and entity swaps has been previously introduced.
- The reliance on a single dataset (SQuAD 2.0) raises concerns about overfitting and generalizability to other datasets.
- The approach may lack depth in semantic understanding, potentially limiting the diversity of generated unanswerable questions.
- Some experimental comparisons lack a common denominator, complicating direct evaluations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their approach by exploring additional linguistic variations and structures characteristic of unanswerable questions. It would be beneficial to extend experiments beyond SQuAD 2.0 to include datasets like NewsQA and TydiQA, which contain unanswerable questions. Additionally, the authors should provide a clearer explanation of the methodology for identifying antonyms and discuss the implications of the observed tradeoff in model performance when increasing the number of augmented unanswerable questions.
