### Key Points
This paper presents Large Language Models-guided Dynamic Adaptation (LLM-DA) for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning (TKGR), utilizing LLMs to extract temporal logical rules from historical data for interpretable reasoning. It introduces a dynamic adaptation strategy that updates LLM-generated rules with the latest events, enhancing the model's adaptability to evolving TKGs. Experimental results indicate that LLM-DA significantly improves reasoning accuracy without requiring fine-tuning of the LLM.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-structured and clearly illustrates the motivation behind extracting and grounding logic rules.  
- LLM-DA demonstrates significant performance improvements over LLM-based methods across various datasets without fine-tuning.  
- The dynamic adaptation strategy effectively captures temporal evolution patterns in TKGs, supported by intuitive figures and tables that enhance readability.  

Weaknesses:  
- The writing quality could be improved, and some figures require polishing.  
- There is limited analysis of constrained Markovian random walks and a lack of comprehensive evaluation of the generated rules.  
- The dynamic adaptation strategy is underrepresented in the figures, and minor grammatical issues need addressing.  
- Concerns exist regarding the method's robustness in long-horizon forecasting tasks where historical data may not be available.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the writing quality and refine the figures for clarity. Additionally, conducting experiments to study the impact of different LLM models would provide valuable insights. A more in-depth analysis of the experimental results is necessary to validate the proposed method thoroughly. We also suggest a comprehensive evaluation of the generated rules to assess their symbolic and logical correctness. Finally, addressing the limitations related to node semantics and long-horizon forecasting would enhance the paper's depth and applicability.
