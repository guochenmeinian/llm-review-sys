Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of the Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) algorithm, incorporating multi-step lookahead to enhance policy updates in reinforcement learning. The authors demonstrate that this modification leads to a faster convergence rate of $\gamma^h$ compared to the standard $\gamma$-contraction rate. They also propose an inexact version of the algorithm, improving sample complexity in finite MDP settings and ensuring guarantees that are independent of the state space size. The analysis extends to linear function approximation, showcasing improved performance across various settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents a novel integration of multi-step lookahead into PMD, leading to significant theoretical results, including reduced sample complexity.
- The proposed h-PMD algorithm achieves a faster $\gamma^h$-linear convergence rate and is applicable to large state spaces through linear function approximation.
- Empirical results from simulations support the theoretical claims, illustrating the benefits of the h-PMD approach.

Weaknesses:
- The analysis of Theorem 4.1 closely follows prior work, and the novelty of Theorems 5.4 and 6.3 is somewhat limited, primarily relying on existing analyses.
- The computational cost associated with the multi-step lookahead is not clearly quantified, making it difficult to assess the trade-offs involved.
- The rationale for selecting the lookahead depth $h$ is unclear, and the implications of larger $h$ on sample complexity and computational feasibility require further exploration.
- The paper lacks detailed implementation guidance for practitioners, which may hinder the adoption of h-PMD in practical scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the computational cost associated with the multi-step lookahead, possibly by quantifying the additional computation required in both tabular and function approximation settings. It would be beneficial to explicitly state where the proof of Theorem 6.3 can be found in the Appendix. Additionally, we encourage the authors to provide a more detailed discussion on how to choose the lookahead depth $h$, including its impact on sample complexity and computational efficiency. Finally, we suggest including more empirical results across diverse environments to validate the robustness and general applicability of the h-PMD algorithm.
