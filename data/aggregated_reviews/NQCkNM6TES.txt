### Key Points
This paper presents a method for human motion prediction that incorporates the environment, specifically a 3D point cloud, into the prediction process. The authors propose a model, DiMoP3D, which estimates an area of interest based on past motion, identifies objects of interest, predicts interactions with these objects, and plans trajectories to reach them. The model generates 3D motion from the end of the past motion to the end of the interaction. Additionally, the authors introduce a novel approach to diverse motion prediction in real-world 3D scenarios, addressing challenges not adequately covered by existing methods. Their framework integrates advanced techniques, including a Scene Interpreter for crossmodal analysis, a Path Planner for efficient navigation, and a Motion Generator for self-prompted trajectory generation. The authors benchmark their method against state-of-the-art techniques in motion prediction and environment-aware motion synthesis, demonstrating superior performance on two datasets, GIMO and CIRCLE.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel task of environment-aware motion prediction, leveraging static 3D point clouds.
- The approach effectively identifies likely objects for interaction, creates trajectories, and generates future motion based on these trajectories.
- The framework demonstrates improved diversity and naturalness in motion predictions, supported by quantitative evaluations.
- Extensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted, yielding qualitatively strong results.
- The paper is well-organized, clear, and detailed.

Weaknesses:
- Some results from the scene-aware motion synthesis should be included in the main paper for clarity, particularly qualitative comparisons.
- The lack of crossmodal analysis between past motion and scene limits the inference of human intentions.
- The use of diffusion in the methodology is not clearly indicated in the figures.
- Challenges in reconstructing observations during inference may negatively impact performance.
- Issues of motion incoherence and posterior collapse are noted, with existing methods introducing additional complexity.
- The novelty of the work is questioned, as similar concepts have been explored in prior studies without sufficient discussion of differences.
- The model's fixed-length motion estimation raises concerns about the naturalness of predicted motions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by moving relevant results from the appendix to the main text, especially qualitative comparisons with other scene-aware methods. Additionally, the authors should clarify the use of diffusion in their methodology in the figures. We suggest enhancing the crossmodal analysis between past motion and scene to better infer human intentions and addressing the challenges in reconstructing observations during inference to improve performance. A more robust discussion on the novelty of their approach compared to existing works is necessary, particularly addressing how their method differs from previous studies. Furthermore, we suggest evaluating the diversity and naturalness of the predicted motions more thoroughly and considering the integration of constraints to prevent issues like object penetration in generated poses. Lastly, including videos of the generated motions would enhance the visualization of results and strengthen the manuscript.
