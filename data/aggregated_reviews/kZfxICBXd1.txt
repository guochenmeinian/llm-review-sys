### Key Points
This paper presents a study of the multi-winner reconfiguration problem in the context of approval preferences, focusing on four voting rules: AV, SAV, CC, and PAV. The authors aim to find a reconfiguration path between two committees while minimizing score changes. They demonstrate that AV and SAV are solvable in polynomial time, while CC and PAV are PSPACE-complete, providing a detailed complexity analysis and proposing several FPT algorithms for special cases.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The introduction of the multi-winner reconfiguration model is novel and well-motivated with real-world examples, particularly the streaming provider case.  
- The complexity analysis is thorough and solid, with clear writing and structure.  
- The paper includes an experimental appendix that adds depth to the findings.

Weaknesses:  
- Some sections, particularly Section 3, lack organization and appear as a list of theorems without high-level implications.  
- The definition of the multi-winner reconfiguration path is somewhat limiting, as it does not accommodate other multi-winner rules not based on score maximization.  
- There are side comments in the appendix that may distract from the main content, and the experimental section could be better integrated into the main body.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization of Section 3 to provide clearer high-level implications of the results. Additionally, consider revising the definition of the multi-winner reconfiguration path to allow for broader applicability to other voting rules. We suggest integrating the experimental findings more prominently in the main text rather than relegating them to the appendix. Finally, clarify the assumptions regarding the multi-winner rules and address the concerns raised about the proof of Proposition 4 and the implications of committee reconfiguration.
