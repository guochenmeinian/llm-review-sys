### Key Points
This paper presents a study on user interactions with QA systems, focusing on how background information influences user confidence and reliance on model predictions. The authors conduct a wizard-of-oz experiment with two-hop questions from HotPotQA, analyzing user agreement and confidence across various background settings. They find that while access to background information can enhance users' ability to identify correct answers, it also leads to increased overconfidence in their judgments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The experiments are well-designed, with appropriate background settings and thorough reporting of results, including mean, variance, and p-values.
- The study addresses an under-explored topic in HCI and QA, providing insights that could inform future QA model design.
- Clear writing and explicit presentation of research questions enhance the paper's accessibility.

Weaknesses:
- The generalizability of findings is limited, as experiments are conducted on a single dataset and focus solely on two-hop questions.
- The paper identifies issues in QA system explanations but lacks effective experimental methods to address these issues.
- The implications of the study are not sufficiently articulated throughout the paper, making it difficult to understand the broader impact of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by including additional models with varying accuracy levels and exploring different question types beyond two-hop questions. Additionally, we suggest that the authors enhance the discussion of implications and potential applications of their findings throughout the paper, particularly in the Introduction and after each experiment. Finally, we encourage the authors to add a dedicated related work section to provide context for their study and address potential biases in user studies regarding information usage and confidence calibration.
