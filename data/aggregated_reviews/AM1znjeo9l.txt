Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of the effects of rescaling symmetry in Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), demonstrating that SGD favors solutions with balanced gradient noises. The authors derive an exact solution for the stationary distribution of a toy model trained by SGD, shedding light on issues like fluctuation inversion and stability in deep learning. The results are significant but are based on specific models and assumptions. Additionally, the authors propose clarifications regarding Corollary D.2, specifically the implications of $\lambda^*$ taking the value of infinity and its relation to an $O(1)$ neighborhood.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper enhances the understanding of SGD properties, introducing a novel noise balance theorem.  
- The analytical solution and its interpretation are insightful and contribute to the field.  
- The paper offers a novel contribution and presents interesting results.  
- The authors have engaged with reviewer feedback and expressed willingness to improve the manuscript.  

Weaknesses:  
- The writing lacks clarity and precision, with omitted conditions leading to confusion.  
- The novelty of the results is overstated, as previous works have derived exact solutions for SGD's stationary distribution.  
- The paper does not adequately discuss convergence to the stationary distribution or the uniqueness of stationary solutions, and the equivalence of SGD bias and weight decay lacks rigor.  
- The language precision in the manuscript needs refinement.  
- The proof for Corollary D.2 is not provided, leaving some reviewers unable to fully understand the implications.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and precision of the writing, ensuring that all conditions under which results hold are explicitly stated. The authors should revise the first paragraph in the related works section to accurately reflect the existing literature on stationary distributions of SGD. Additionally, we suggest that the authors discuss convergence to the stationary distribution more thoroughly and justify the uniqueness of stationary solutions, particularly regarding the necessity of equation (3). The equivalence of SGD bias and weight decay should be rigorously established. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the language throughout the manuscript, particularly regarding the implications of $\lambda^*$ taking the value of infinity. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors include the proof for Corollary D.2 to enhance understanding and address reviewer concerns. Finally, we advise replacing the experimental results with those using ReLU activation, as it is more relevant to the paper's focus on rescaling symmetry.
