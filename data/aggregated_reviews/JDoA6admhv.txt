### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical exploration of adversarial robustness in multi-class classification, emphasizing the necessity of class conditional distributions being "well-concentrated" and well-separated for the existence of robust classifiers. The authors demonstrate that robustness can be certified in low-dimensional linear subspaces, providing polyhedral certificates that complement existing spherical certificates from randomized smoothing. Experiments on the MNIST dataset support their theoretical findings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The theorem establishing the necessity of concentration for robustness is a novel application of the Brunn-Minkowski inequality, enhancing existing literature on measure concentration.
- The derivation of polyhedral certificates for robustness is non-trivial and offers a complementary perspective to spherical certificates.
- The paper is generally well-written and clear.

Weaknesses:
- The definition of strongly concentrated distributions is misleading, as it primarily relates to the "well-separatedness" of class conditional distributions rather than concentration.
- The sufficiency of concentration on small volume sets for robustness is questioned, as existing literature suggests that separation conditions are critical.
- The assumption of low-dimensional linear subspaces is overly restrictive and lacks motivation, as many real-world distributions do not conform to this structure.
- The utility of polyhedral certificates is limited, as they do not account for all possible adversarial perturbations, unlike spherical certificates.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Definition 3.1 to better reflect its relationship to well-separatedness rather than concentration. Additionally, the authors should address the novelty of their sufficient condition by discussing existing literature on separation conditions for robust classifiers. We suggest that the authors reconsider the assumption of low-dimensional linear subspaces and explore a broader range of distributions that meet the necessary and sufficient conditions. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the practical implications of polyhedral certificates and their limitations compared to spherical certificates. Lastly, we recommend including a discussion on the computational cost of certifying robustness and the dependence of constants in the main theorems on dimensionality.
