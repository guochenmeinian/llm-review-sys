Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a rejection-sampling technique applied to diffusion models defined on manifolds, with theoretical results on the convergence of the proposed algorithm, particularly its asymptotic convergence to reflected Brownian motion. The authors propose a new discretization of forward and backward SDEs for learning and sampling in diffusion generative models on constrained manifolds. The method is shown to be numerically simpler and faster than existing approaches. Additionally, the authors introduce a constrained diffusion model that outperforms an unconstrained counterpart on geospatial data within non-convex country borders, as evidenced by a quantitative performance metric (MMD). They provide a detailed runtime analysis comparing the scaling behavior of their Metropolis approach against the existing reflected diffusion process, demonstrating superior scalability as problem dimensionality increases. The authors clarify the relationship of their approach to prior work and outline plans to extend their proof to more general manifolds.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper applies rejection sampling to denoising diffusion models, offering a simple and modifiable algorithm that requires less intrusive modifications than alternatives.  
- The approach is theoretically justified and demonstrates numerical efficiency, making it an interesting tool for practitioners.  
- The authors provide compelling experimental results that validate the performance of their constrained model.  
- The extensive runtime analysis offers clear evidence of the superior scaling behavior of their method.  
- The paper is well-written and accounts for the state of the art, with several examples illustrating increasing complexity and clarifications on the relationship to prior work.

Weaknesses:  
- The algorithmic innovation is unclear, as rejection sampling is a standard technique applied to a trendy topic. The theoretical treatment's value is questionable, particularly when claiming superiority over reflected Brownian motion (RBM) in experiments.  
- Scalability claims lack clarity and empirical support, with only one experiment addressing it. The relevance of sampling from a cube or polytope is also uncertain.  
- The theoretical framework primarily addresses manifolds of co-dimension 0, with limited exploration of positive co-dimension cases. Definitions and assumptions regarding the manifold $\mathcal{M}$ are inconsistent and inadequately clarified.  
- The initial presentation of the paper may lack clarity, necessitating improvements for better comprehension.  
- The claims in the Abstract and Introduction may not fully represent the classes of manifolds covered by the proof.  
- Experiments are weak, particularly in baseline comparisons, with the use of a uniform distribution as a baseline being insufficient. Quantitative metrics for sampling quality are lacking, and the presentation of results could be improved.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the algorithmic innovation and the theoretical contributions of their work, particularly in relation to RBM. It is essential to provide a more comprehensive discussion on scalability, including empirical evidence supporting this claim. We suggest including additional metrics, such as the sliced Wasserstein distance, to evaluate performance more robustly. The authors should also refine the presentation of methodology, possibly by moving some mathematical content to supplementary materials and enhancing visual aids to clarify complex relationships. Additionally, we recommend improving the clarity of the paper's overall presentation to effectively highlight the strengths of their method. Lastly, we encourage the authors to adjust the claims in the Abstract and Introduction to accurately reflect the classes of manifolds addressed by their proof and to improve the experimental design by including stronger baselines and quantitative evaluations of sampling quality.
