### Key Points
This paper presents CPSample, an innovative approach to safeguarding training data within diffusion models by employing a classifier to guide the sampling process away from replication. CPSample effectively prevents the replication of training data while maintaining high image quality, as demonstrated by competitive FID scores on benchmark datasets like CIFAR-10 and CelebA. The method enhances robustness against membership inference attacks and offers a computationally efficient solution without requiring model retraining.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- CPSample introduces a unique classifier-guided sampling method that is simpler and less complex than other techniques while effectively addressing privacy concerns.
- The method achieves strong empirical results, significantly reducing the similarity between generated images and training data, and maintains high image quality.
- It is computationally efficient, requiring only a one-time training of a classifier, making it practical for real-world applications.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on assumptions about the classifier's Lipschitz constant affects the theoretical robustness and privacy guarantees of the method.
- The evaluation is limited to CIFAR-10 and CelebA, raising questions about generalization to more complex or sensitive datasets.
- There is a lack of detailed comparison with state-of-the-art differential privacy techniques, which would clarify the trade-offs between privacy and image quality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis of CPSample by providing a more rigorous evaluation of the classifier's Lipschitz constant to strengthen privacy guarantees. Additionally, conducting broader evaluations on diverse and complex datasets, particularly in privacy-sensitive fields such as healthcare, would enhance the understanding of the method's effectiveness. Finally, a more detailed comparison with differential privacy techniques would clarify the relative strengths and weaknesses of CPSample in balancing privacy and image quality.
