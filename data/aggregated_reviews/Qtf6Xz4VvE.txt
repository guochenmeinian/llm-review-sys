Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analytical and empirical investigation of second-order phase transitions in the training dynamics of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs). The authors theoretically analyze the learning dynamics of weight parameters in Binary-Gaussian RBMs and validate their findings through numerical experiments on datasets such as MNIST and CelebA. The study reveals that RBMs undergo a series of phase transitions during training, characterized by diverging correlation functions and changes in the weight matrix.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a theoretical analysis of RBM learning dynamics through the lens of statistical physics, contributing to the understanding of energy-based models.
- The empirical validation across multiple datasets supports the theoretical claims, demonstrating the emergence of phase transitions during training.
- The authors present a compelling argument for the scalability of these findings to more complex models.

Weaknesses:
- There is a disconnect between the theoretical analysis of the Binary-Gaussian RBM and the numerical analysis of the Binary-Bernoulli RBM, which may confuse readers.
- The manuscript lacks clarity and accessibility for the NeurIPS audience, with dense presentation and inconsistent notation.
- Limitations of the study are not thoroughly discussed, and the connection between theoretical and empirical results could be strengthened.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and readability of the manuscript by streamlining the presentation and ensuring consistent notation throughout. Specifically, please clarify the relationship between the theoretical and empirical analyses, particularly regarding the projections and singular value decomposition. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explicitly discuss the limitations of their work and consider addressing the non-equilibrium nature of RBM training in the final version. Finally, please ensure that all figures and equations are clearly labeled and defined to enhance accessibility for the ML-focused audience.
