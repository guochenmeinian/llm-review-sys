Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents "Test-Time Label Shift Adaptation" (TTLSA), a method designed to manage distribution shifts in machine learning by leveraging spurious correlations rather than eliminating them. The authors propose a two-step approach: training on source data with augmented labels that include nuisance variables, followed by adaptation to target data using an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. Empirical evaluations on datasets such as CheXpert and Colored MNIST demonstrate that TTLSA outperforms traditional empirical risk minimization (ERM) and invariance-based methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The originality of TTLSA lies in its unique approach to utilize spurious relations, setting it apart from previous methods.
- The methodology is well-defined, with carefully designed experiments showcasing the method's effectiveness across various benchmark datasets.
- The paper is well-written and clear, providing detailed explanations of the methodology and results.

Weaknesses:
- The method relies on a complex label shift assumption that may not hold in many real-world scenarios, particularly the requirement for the generative distribution to remain constant across domains.
- Access to labeled examples of the nuisance factor Z during training is necessary, which could limit applicability in scenarios where such data is not readily available.
- There are minor issues in writing, including missing references and unclear figure text.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their assumptions regarding the generative distribution p(x|y, z) and provide additional insights into scenarios where this assumption is likely to hold. Further discussion on how TTLSA could adapt to multiple auxiliary features would enhance the robustness of the method. Additionally, addressing the limitations related to the requirement for labeled examples of Z during training and exploring alternatives would strengthen the paper. Lastly, we suggest correcting minor writing issues, such as ensuring all figure references are properly cited and improving the readability of text in figures.
