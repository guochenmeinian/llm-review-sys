Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into working memory (WM) models, focusing on the similarities between human WM and AI memory systems. The authors propose a synthetic dataset, WorM, designed to benchmark various models, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers, across 10 tasks and over 1 million trials. The study emphasizes behavioral consistency, such as primacy and recency effects, and introduces new evaluation metrics to quantitatively assess model performance against human behaviors. The authors address limitations in current models and the need for diverse experimental designs, aiming to provide insights into the mechanisms of WM and the potential for improving AI systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach is novel, particularly the synthetic data generation technique, which can be adapted for new tasks.
- The dataset is large and diverse, facilitating a comprehensive evaluation of different WM properties.
- The authors have made significant improvements based on reviewer feedback, including additional experiments and enhanced documentation for reproducibility.
- New evaluation metrics provide a nuanced understanding of model performance relative to human behaviors.
- The implementation of detailed statistical analyses and causal evidence strengthens the findings.

Weaknesses:
- Model performance reaching 100% on several tasks limits the insights gained; tasks should be made more challenging.
- The retention phrase approach is simplistic, relying on a gray screen, which could be improved with more creative methods.
- There is insufficient detail on data generation, which could enhance the paper's contribution.
- The paper lacks sufficient quantification to support claims about performance comparisons between humans and models.
- Some sections, particularly those discussing hyperparameter selection and experiment details, could benefit from further elaboration.
- The discussion lacks depth regarding the primacy bias and its connection to gradient vanishing/exploding properties in RNNs.
- The initial absence of a related works section makes it difficult to contextualize the findings within existing literature.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the difficulty of tasks to avoid achieving near 100% accuracy, thereby enhancing the insights gained from model performance. The retention phrase method should be re-evaluated to incorporate more complex stimuli rather than a gray screen. Additionally, providing more detailed descriptions of the data generation process would strengthen the paper's contribution. We suggest improving the clarity of performance comparisons by including more quantitative measures that validate claims about human and model behavior. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore the relationship between the primacy bias and gradient vanishing/exploding properties in RNNs. Finally, we recommend adding a related works section to better situate the research within the existing body of literature and enhancing the documentation in the GitHub repository with clearer instructions on the data generation workflow.
