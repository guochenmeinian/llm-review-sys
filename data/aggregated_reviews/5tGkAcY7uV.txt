Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a linear Group RNN-based backbone for 3D object detection, leveraging linear networks like RWKV and Mamba to capture long-range dependencies in LiDAR data. The authors introduce a 3D spatial feature descriptor and a voxel generation method to address point cloud sparsity. The effectiveness of their method, LION, is demonstrated through experiments on the Waymo Open and nuScenes datasets, showcasing state-of-the-art performance and adaptability across various linear RNN operators. The integration of a 3D voxel generation strategy aims to densify foreground features, and ablation studies indicate improved performance and reduced latency compared to existing frameworks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is an early attempt to utilize linear RNNs for outdoor LiDAR-based 3D object detection.
- LION achieves state-of-the-art performance on mainstream datasets, indicating its effectiveness.
- The method demonstrates generalization across multiple linear RNN architectures such as Mamba, RWKV, and RetNet.
- The introduction of a 3D spatial feature descriptor and voxel generation strategy effectively addresses challenges in sparse point cloud scenarios.
- Experimental results indicate that LION-Mamba outperforms LION-DSVT in terms of mAPH L2 and latency, validating the proposed enhancements.

Weaknesses:
- Some claims lack clarity and supporting evidence, particularly regarding the challenges of applying linear group RNNs to sparse point clouds.
- Proposed techniques, such as voxel merging and expanding, are not novel and require further discussion to clarify their contributions.
- The ablation study for larger group sizes is insufficient; experiments with varying group sizes are needed to validate this key claim.
- A detailed runtime evaluation is necessary to assess the efficiency of each component and its impact on overall latency.
- The comparison with HEDNet may not be entirely justified, as the authors acknowledge differences in configurations and backbone architectures that could affect performance metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of claims regarding the limitations of linear group RNNs in spatial modeling. Additionally, a thorough discussion comparing the proposed techniques with existing methods would enhance the paper's novelty. Conducting experiments with different group sizes is crucial to substantiate the main claims. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide a detailed runtime evaluation to elucidate the latency of each component and its implications for efficiency. Finally, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contribution by explicitly detailing the differences between LION and HEDNet, particularly regarding the backbone architectures and configurations used, and providing a more comprehensive comparison of latency and performance metrics across different settings.
