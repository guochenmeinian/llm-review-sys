Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Monte Carlo Neural PDE Solver (MCNP), which utilizes the Feynman-Kac formula to train neural PDE solvers in an unsupervised manner. The authors propose a new unsupervised training loss for surrogate simulation networks based on the relationship between stochastic processes and PDEs, specifically sampling one-step Brownian motion to estimate PDE solutions. The method is illustrated through numerical experiments on 1D diffusion and 2D Navier-Stokes equations, with a focus on the efficiency of the approach in handling coarse time steps.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The incorporation of the Feynman-Kac formula into the neural network framework is innovative and addresses a significant problem in learning neural operators unsupervised.
- The paper is well-written, providing a good overview of related work and presenting both theoretical and numerical results.
- The method shows potential for improved performance in specific setups, particularly where PDE solutions vary rapidly in space and time.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments are limited, primarily focusing on simple diffusion equations, with insufficient documentation of simulation trajectories, making it difficult to assess the methods' behaviors.
- The presentation lacks clarity, particularly in explaining complex concepts like the Feynman-Kac formula and the implications of the proposed algorithm.
- The theoretical guarantees provided are based on several assumptions that require further discussion regarding their commonality in the PDE literature.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by providing plain English explanations of complex concepts such as the Feynman-Kac formula. Additionally, the authors should include more detailed experimental results, including simulation trajectories and insights into the behavior of various methods. It would be beneficial to expand the range of experiments to include other equations like the Poisson and Schr√∂dinger equations, and to discuss the implications of the multi-scale framework more thoroughly. Finally, we suggest that the authors provide their source code publicly to enhance reproducibility and transparency.
