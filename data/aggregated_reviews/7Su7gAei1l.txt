Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a discrete diffusion model aimed at generating permutations, applicable to combinatorial problems such as jigsaw puzzles and the traveling salesman problem. The authors explore various forward shuffling strategies and discuss the parametrization of the reverse transition, utilizing beam search during sampling to identify high-probability samples. The experimental results indicate that their method performs competitively in computational experiments. Additionally, the authors propose a probabilistic model on $\mathbf{S_n}$, which differs significantly from prior work by enabling the learning of a $\mathbf{S_n}$-equivariant probabilistic model. They argue that their work does not build a "symmetric diffusion" and seek clarification on critiques regarding this distinction.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The concept of employing riffle shuffles to create a corruption process over permutations and subsequently parametrizing its time reversal is novel and engaging.
- The paper is well-written, providing clarity without excessive mathematical complexity, and offers intuitive explanations for several concepts.
- Experimental results are promising, showing performance on par or superior to previous methods, particularly in high dimensions, with valuable ablation studies included.
- The authors provide a clear distinction between their work and prior models, emphasizing the unique contributions of their approach.
- The engagement in the review process demonstrates a commitment to addressing scientific feedback.

Weaknesses:
- Further clarification is needed regarding the limitations of random transposition and random insertion shuffling methods, as their slow mixing times may not be a significant drawback.
- The authors should address the unavailability of $q(X_{t-1} | X_t, X_0)$, which is crucial for standard diffusion models, as well as the implications of this limitation.
- The ablation studies on different shuffling methods are relegated to the appendix, despite being prominently discussed earlier, which may confuse readers.
- The description of the inverse transposition parametrization lacks intuition, particularly regarding the functions $\phi$ and $\psi$ and the form of $p_{IT}(\sigma)$.
- There is a lack of constructive dialogue among reviewers, with some resorting to personal accusations and dismissive language, undermining the review process.
- Reviewer UKH2's critiques are seen as lacking in good faith and specificity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity surrounding the weaknesses of random transposition and random insertion shuffling methods, particularly addressing the relevance of slow mixing times. Additionally, it would be beneficial to discuss the implications of not having access to $q(X_{t-1} | X_t, X_0)$ in the context of their model. We suggest moving the ablation studies from the appendix to the main text to enhance coherence. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide more intuitive explanations for the inverse transposition parametrization and consider either relegating this section to the appendix if it is not central to their experiments or expanding the discussion to clarify its significance. Furthermore, we recommend that all reviewers focus on providing constructive feedback without personal remarks, ensuring that critiques are grounded in the scientific merits of the paper. Finally, we encourage Reviewer UKH2 to articulate specific methodological concerns clearly, rather than referencing hypothetical alternatives.
