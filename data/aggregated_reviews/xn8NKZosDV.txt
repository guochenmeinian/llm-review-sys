### Key Points
This paper presents an original method for event ontology completion (EOC) that enhances the event type induction (ETI) task by incorporating clustering, type naming, and hierarchy extension. The authors propose the HierarchicAL STructure EvOlution Network (HALTON), which utilizes neighborhood contrastive clustering, in-context learning for naming, and a similarity-based approach for hierarchy expansion. HALTON demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing methods on three EOC datasets derived from ACE, ERE, and MAVEN.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an interesting and relevant problem in event ontology completion.
- The proposed solution is novel and well-articulated.
- The experimental design is robust, providing substantial insights into HALTON's performance and the EOC sub-tasks.
- The paper is clearly written and well-illustrated, particularly the architecture in Figure 2.

Weaknesses:
- The placement of the Related Work section before the conclusion disrupts the flow and may confuse casual readers.
- The incremental nature of the proposed task and method raises concerns, as clustering of untyped event mentions is already addressed in ETI.
- Reproducibility could be improved due to the lack of code and supplemental materials, leaving some details unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the structure of the paper by relocating the Related Work section to follow the introduction, enhancing readability for casual readers. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed discussion on trigger selection and the practical implications of estimating the number of unknown event types (M_u). Clarifying the classifier used for unlabeled instances and ensuring the availability of code and supplemental materials would also enhance reproducibility.
