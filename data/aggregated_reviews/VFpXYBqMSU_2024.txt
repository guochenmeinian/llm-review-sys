Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the effects of slight corruption in the conditioning information of text-to-image diffusion models. The authors empirically demonstrate that introducing synthetic corruption to datasets like ImageNet-1K and CC3M enhances the performance of over 50 conditional diffusion models. They propose Conditional Embedding Perturbations (CEP) as a method to improve training, supported by both empirical and theoretical analyses, which indicate that slight corruption increases the quality, diversity, and fidelity of generated images.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research topic is timely, addressing the potential noise in state-of-the-art diffusion models trained on vast datasets.
- The authors propose a simple yet effective modification to the training process, leading to improved performance.
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with extensive experimental evaluations that provide valuable insights into the benefits of conditioning corruption.
- The findings reveal an unexpected phenomenon that is well-explained through theoretical analysis.

Weaknesses:
- The title and main body should emphasize the study of corruption in conditioning, distinguishing it from existing works that focus on image corruption.
- The theoretical model lacks relevance to certain sections and does not adequately connect to the experimental findings.
- The notion of statistical significance regarding performance improvements is not formally tested.
- The paper does not clarify whether corruption occurs once per data sample or repeatedly across epochs, which could relate to regularization effects.
- Some minor typographical errors and missing citations detract from the overall quality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the title and main text to clearly indicate their focus on corruption in conditioning, acknowledging relevant literature on image corruption. Additionally, the authors should clarify the relationship between their theoretical analysis and experimental metrics, particularly regarding the significance of performance improvements. It would be beneficial to explicitly address the assumptions in their theoretical model and how they relate to the proposed method. Furthermore, we suggest conducting experiments to determine the statistical significance of their findings and clarifying the corruption process in training. Lastly, addressing minor typos and including relevant citations would enhance the paper's clarity and completeness.
