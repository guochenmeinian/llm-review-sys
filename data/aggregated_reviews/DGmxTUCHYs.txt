Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of standard GNN binary classifiers on Erdos-Renyi graphs, concluding that the output adheres to a zero-one law, indicating that as the number of nodes increases, the probability of classifying as 1 approaches either 0 or 1. The authors assert that their assumptions are mild and provide empirical evidence suggesting that a node count of around 1,000 to 10,000 suffices for this effect. The paper also explores the implications of this result on GNN expressiveness and includes empirical experiments to support their claims.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a novel and significant result that contributes to the theoretical understanding of GNN expressiveness, particularly regarding zero-one laws.
- The mathematical exposition is clear, and the empirical experiments convincingly illustrate the authors' claims.

Weaknesses:
- The dismissal of assumptions may overstate the practicality of the results, particularly the claim that sub-Gaussian random vectors encompass all practical setups, which overlooks other common distributions.
- The focus on GCNs, which are less commonly used today, limits the paper's impact, as it lacks experiments on more advanced GNN architectures.
- Certain theoretical definitions lack intuitive explanations, and the results are primarily confined to ER graphs, which may not reflect real-world scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding their assumptions, particularly regarding the applicability of the ER graph model and sub-Gaussian features. It would be beneficial to explore the impact of removing these assumptions and to provide a more straightforward explanation of complex theoretical concepts. Additionally, we suggest including experiments on more contemporary GNN architectures, such as those incorporating attention mechanisms, to enhance the paper's relevance and broaden its audience. Finally, adding confidence bounds for the graphs would strengthen the empirical findings.
