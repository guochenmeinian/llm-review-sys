Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies the problem of learning with noisy labels, specifically focusing on instance-dependent noise. The authors propose an extended model that combines a class-dependent transition matrix with a sparse implicit regularization term. Theoretical analyses of convergence and generalization are provided, and experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Theoretical analysis of convergence and generalization is included.
2. Comprehensive experiments are conducted, including ablation studies on various datasets.

Weaknesses:
1. The proposed method appears to be a straightforward combination of existing methods, lacking novelty.
2. Experimental results for TMR are missing for key datasets such as CIFAR-N, Clothing1M, and WebVision.
3. An important baseline, CCR, is not included in the comparisons.
4. The paper lacks an analysis of the estimation error of the transition matrix, which is crucial for understanding its performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind the residual term and its sparse structure. Additionally, the authors should include the experimental results for TMR on the CIFAR-N, Clothing1M, and WebVision datasets and incorporate the CCR baseline for a more comprehensive evaluation. An analysis of the estimation error of the transition matrix compared to other baselines would also strengthen the paper. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors provide a thorough discussion of the limitations and potential negative societal impacts of their work, including scenarios where the method might not perform well.
