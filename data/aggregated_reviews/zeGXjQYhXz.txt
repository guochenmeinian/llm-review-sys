### Key Points
This paper presents a multi-grained sparse learning framework aimed at acquiring a shared, aligned sparse space for video-text retrieval tasks. The authors propose a method to correlate textual and visual data by clustering textual tokens into concepts and aligning representations within this unified framework. The paper claims to achieve superior results across benchmarks and includes a comprehensive ablation study.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed method addresses an important problem and demonstrates superior results in video-text retrieval.  
- The paper is well-written and includes sufficient experiments to showcase the effectiveness of the method.  
- The comprehensive ablation study provides a meticulous analysis of individual modules.

Weaknesses:  
- The writing lacks clarity, particularly regarding the concept of 'sparsity' and its relevance.  
- The contributions are primarily validated through text-video retrieval, with insufficient exploration of other multi-modal tasks.  
- The impact of the introduced sparse space is not thoroughly elucidated, and the method may be biased due to reliance on initial word embeddings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing, particularly by specifying the context of 'sparsity' and its necessity. Additionally, we suggest validating the approach across various multi-modal tasks beyond text-video retrieval, such as video question answering and video-grounded reasoning. It would also be beneficial to visualize the effectiveness of the proposed method and provide a more detailed analysis of the individual performance outcomes of the sparse space. Finally, we encourage the authors to reconsider their claim of achieving state-of-the-art results in light of competing methods.
