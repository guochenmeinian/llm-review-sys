Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of an existing method for finding node-level circuits (attribution patching) to the edge domain, enabling circuit discovery at the edge level. The authors conduct experiments showing that their method, edge attribution patching (EAP), runs significantly faster than the popular ACDC method while achieving equal or better overlap with known task circuits for the IOI, Greater-Than, and Docstring tasks. However, it is noted that edge attribution patching does not serve as a good approximation of activation patching scores.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of EAP provides a faster and equally effective method for circuit-finding compared to ACDC, allowing for the discovery of circuits of various sizes without requiring multiple runs.
- Empirical results demonstrate that attribution patching is more accurate than ACDC in identifying circuits across three tasks, suggesting a complementary use of both methods for better edge identification.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation does not encompass all techniques that ACDC addressed, is limited to a small number of known circuits in small models, and lacks a measurement of faithfulness.
- The paper does not introduce new methodology for NN interpretability, merely applying a sorting algorithm to an existing technique.
- There is insufficient background information on circuits, which may hinder accessibility for readers unfamiliar with the topic.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the background section on circuits to enhance accessibility for readers new to the subject. Additionally, please clarify the necessity of the two forward passes mentioned in the abstract. It would be beneficial to acknowledge the similarities with Neel Nanda's work more explicitly and consider citing recent related works, such as Ferrando et al.'s ALTI method. We also suggest using the full allowed length of the paper to elaborate on key points and clarify any ambiguous statements, particularly regarding the metrics and thresholds used in the experiments.
