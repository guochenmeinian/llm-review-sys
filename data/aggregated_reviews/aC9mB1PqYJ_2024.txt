Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for disentangling observational and interventional data within linear structural equation models (SEMs) with Gaussian noise. The authors propose an efficient algorithm that can recover individual components of a mixture of unknown interventions, even when intervention targets are not known. The study addresses a significant challenge in causal inference, providing theoretical guarantees on identifiability and sample complexity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper tackles a relatively unexplored problem in causal inference, making it innovative and relevant.  
- The proposed algorithm is efficient and supported by rigorous theoretical analysis, including proofs of identifiability and sample complexity.  
- The writing is clear, and the paper is well-structured, facilitating understanding of the problem, methodology, and results.  

Weaknesses:  
- The methods are limited to linear SEMs with Gaussian noise, potentially restricting applicability in scenarios with non-linear relationships or non-Gaussian noise.  
- The experimental evaluation lacks comprehensiveness, primarily relying on simulations rather than real-world datasets, which raises questions about the method's effectiveness in practical applications.  
- The novelty of the approach is questioned, as it largely follows existing work on learning Gaussian mixtures and relies on assumptions that may limit broader applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the readability by providing clearer descriptions of insights related to theorems, particularly those involving matrix computations. Additionally, we suggest conducting more comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets to better assess the effectiveness of the proposed method. It would also be beneficial to analyze the method's performance in scenarios that do not conform to linear SEM or Gaussian noise assumptions. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to ensure consistent notation throughout the paper and to clarify the implications of their assumptions, particularly regarding soft interventions.
