### Key Points
This paper presents FedHGNN, a privacy-preserving federated recommender system that utilizes a heterogeneous information graph (HIN) to predict user preferences. The authors propose a semantic-preserving user interactions publishing method to address privacy concerns while maintaining the integrity of user data. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of FedHGNN, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The research topic is significant within federated recommender systems, particularly in leveraging high-order graph information.  
- The proposed method is clearly articulated, with a logical technical description.  
- Experimental results convincingly support the efficacy of FedHGNN.

Weaknesses:  
- Key concepts such as “semantic”, “semantic-guided”, and “user-related shared graph” lack clarity; examples are needed for better comprehension.  
- The final privacy budget resulting from the combination of the two stages (EM + DPRR) is unclear.  
- The best values in Table 3 should be highlighted for clarity.  
- Relevant literature on privacy-preserving FedRec and graph-based FedRec is missing from the related work section.  
- The novelty of the work is limited, as existing studies have addressed similar privacy definitions and methods.  
- Concerns exist regarding the potential privacy leakage from uploading user embeddings to the server.  
- The datasets used for experiments are not specifically tailored for recommendation tasks, which may weaken the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of key concepts by providing examples. Additionally, the authors should clarify the final privacy budget when combining the two stages. Highlighting the best values in Table 3 would enhance readability. The authors should also incorporate relevant literature on privacy-preserving FedRec and graph-based FedRec in the related work section. Furthermore, we suggest addressing the novelty concerns by clearly defining the research challenge and differentiating the proposed method from existing works. Lastly, the authors should ensure that the datasets used are appropriate for the recommendation context and provide a detailed explanation of the communication costs associated with their method.
