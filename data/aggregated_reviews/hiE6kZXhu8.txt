### Key Points
This paper examines potential attack vectors on rollup solutions, providing a general introduction to rollups before discussing their feasibility, impact, and possible mitigations. The authors propose security design principles for rollups and effectively address an emerging concept in blockchain technology. The paper serves as a concise yet thorough reference on potential attacks, making it suitable for the workshop.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well written and offers a succinct review of attack types, directly addressing their causes.  
- It provides comprehensive coverage of references and identifies systems susceptible to certain attacks.  
- The discussion on research directions, such as escape hatches, adds value to the literature review.

Weaknesses:  
- Some phrases in the abstract may be misleading, such as "the state of the rollup network" and "meaning that the rollup state cannot be changed arbitrarily."  
- Certain statements in the body, particularly regarding censorship resistance and the role of sequencers, require clarification.  
- Minor grammatical errors and typos detract from the overall quality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the abstract by revising misleading phrases for accuracy. Specifically, consider changing "the state of the rollup network" to "the state of the log that the network maintains" and clarify the statement about arbitrary changes in the rollup state. Additionally, we suggest mentioning other well-known zk rollup solutions alongside zkSync for better context. In Section 3.1, revise the claim about censorship resistance to acknowledge that a rollup might be more resistant than its underlying layer one. Clarify the argument regarding ZK rollups and censorship to avoid misinterpretation. In Section 3.3, include information about more efficient operations in zk rollup solutions. Revise the phrase in Section 3.6 to "when a transaction is included on the layer one" and address the potential for increased Sybil attacks in Section 3.7. Lastly, correct the incomplete sentence in Section 3.2 and fix the identified typos and grammatical errors.
