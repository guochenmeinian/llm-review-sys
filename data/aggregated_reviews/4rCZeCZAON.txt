Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a generalization of traditional iid settings in causal inference to exchangeability settings using the de Finetti theorem. The authors propose a new model, the causal PÃ³lya urn model, to illustrate this scheme and capture more relationships. The main result is that causal effects are identifiable in ICM generative processes, with Theorem 1 providing significant insights. The experiments indicate that the new scheme performs well with fewer than 5000 environments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a valuable framework for considering interventions in exchangeable data, with clear definitions and procedures for computing post-interventional distributions.
- Theoretical results, particularly Theorem 2, are strong, demonstrating simultaneous identifiability of causal graphs and effects.
- The presentation is generally clear and intuitive, especially in the initial sections.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical improvement over iid settings appears limited, as many conclusions can be transformed under exchangeability.
- The latter parts of the paper are rushed, leading to confusion, particularly regarding the application of causal de Finetti theorems and the clarity of Theorem 2.
- The experiments rely solely on simulated data, and there are concerns about the model generating the synthetic dataset differing from the described model.
- There are several typos and unclear notations, particularly in the appendix.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and depth of the latter sections, particularly regarding the application of causal de Finetti theorems and the explanation of Theorem 2. Additionally, we suggest including real-world datasets in the experiments to enhance the practical relevance of the findings. The authors should also clarify the relationship between the synthetic dataset and the model described in section 3.2. Finally, we advise correcting typos and ensuring consistent notation throughout the paper, especially in the appendix.
