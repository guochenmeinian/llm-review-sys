### Key Points
This paper presents PerSRV, a personalized sticker retrieval framework that enhances sticker search through multimodal semantic understanding, utility-based retrieval, and personalized style modeling. The authors propose a model that integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and historical query logs to improve sticker semantics. The framework introduces three utility metrics—sticker popularity, cross-user adaptability, and query adaptability—to assess sticker quality and enhance retrieval accuracy. The results indicate that PerSRV significantly outperforms previous methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The innovative framework effectively combines vision-language models, utility evaluation, and user preference modeling, leading to improved retrieval performance.
2. The paper is well-organized, with clear tables and case studies that illustrate the sticker retrieval process.
3. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the model, providing valuable insights into sticker retrieval.

Weaknesses:
1. The assumption of static user preferences may not reflect the dynamic nature of real-world behaviors.
2. Important ablation studies are lacking, particularly regarding the impact of various components on model performance.
3. The proposed method appears more as an engineering solution rather than a novel research contribution, as the techniques used are established in prior studies.
4. The paper contains formatting and spelling errors that detract from its clarity and professionalism.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification of design choices, such as parameter settings and model selection, to enhance the technical rigor of the paper. Additionally, conducting further experiments on publicly available datasets, such as StickerInt or MCDSCS, would allow for a more comprehensive assessment of PerSRV's generalization capabilities. We also suggest that the authors address the misleading column names in Tables 4 and 5 to clarify their meaning. Finally, ensuring that the code is publicly accessible and addressing the formatting issues will enhance the transparency and readability of the work.
