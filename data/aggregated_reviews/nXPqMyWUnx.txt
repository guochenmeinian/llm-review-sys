Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the biases introduced by unfair labeling functions (LFs) in programmatic weak supervision, proposing a bias mitigation technique using counterfactuals. The authors theoretically demonstrate that their method can improve both accuracy and fairness without increasing sample complexity, supported by empirical results on synthetic and benchmark datasets. The work highlights the critical issue of fairness in weak supervision, providing a novel and effective approach to address it.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses an important and previously overlooked problem in weak supervision: biases from unfair LFs.
2. The proposed method is compatible with traditional fair machine learning techniques, potentially enhancing performance while mitigating biases.
3. The theoretical results convincingly show that LF bias can be arbitrary yet correctable under certain conditions.
4. Strong empirical results are presented across various datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Weaknesses:
1. The proposed model is a new label model built on an existing one, which may limit user choice in label models for bias mitigation.
2. The theoretical results rely on strong distributional assumptions, and the paper should better articulate how these assumptions can be relaxed.
3. Missing related work on incorporating feature vectors in label models and standard data augmentation techniques like Autolabel.
4. Some experimental results raise concerns, such as significant F1 score drops in certain scenarios, and the absence of error ranges diminishes the credibility of the empirical findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on how biases can be mitigated if users prefer other label models. Additionally, the authors should clarify the relationship between fairness and performance in their approach, addressing the typical trade-off seen in machine learning models. It would be beneficial to include missing related work on label models that incorporate feature vectors and standard data augmentation techniques. Finally, we suggest providing a more detailed analysis of the experimental results, including error ranges and potential strategies to prevent significant F1 score drops.
