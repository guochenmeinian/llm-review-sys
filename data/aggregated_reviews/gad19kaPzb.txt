Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SLICE-100K, a multimodal dataset comprising over 100,000 G-code files, tessellated CAD models, LVIS categories, geometric properties, and renderings. The dataset is constructed from triangle meshes derived from Objaverse-XL and Thingi10K, and aims to support AI applications in additive manufacturing. The authors evaluate existing chat-based LLMs on G-code geometric transformations and demonstrate that the dataset can facilitate G-code flavor translation tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is comprehensive, including G-code, CAD models, renderings, and metadata, which supports reproducibility and detailed documentation.
- It addresses a significant gap in resources for AI applications in digital manufacturing, potentially advancing 3D printing research.
- The methodology is robust, with practical demonstrations of the dataset's utility through LLM evaluations.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset's diversity is limited due to reliance on existing datasets, and it primarily focuses on extrusion-based 3D printing.
- The uniform slicing direction may not fully represent practical slicing techniques, and there are challenges in verifying the accuracy of LVIS categories.
- Some model names are not descriptive, which could hinder the querying and browsing experience.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify how many flavors of G-code are included in the dataset and whether each data point contains multiple flavored G-Codes. Additionally, we suggest improving the accuracy of LVIS categories and exploring potential solutions to enhance their quality. To validate the quality of G-code and LVIS, we recommend including more visualizations and numerical metrics, such as multi-view 3D visualizations comparing reconstructed CAD models to ground truth models. Lastly, consider expanding the evaluation tasks beyond scaling and flavor translation to better demonstrate the dataset's versatility and potential applications in optimizing 3D printing processes.
