### Key Points
This paper presents a multi-fidelity approach for training machine learning force fields (MLFFs) for molecular simulation. The authors propose training the model initially on low-accuracy DFT data, influenced by a surrogate model based on high-accuracy data, followed by fine-tuning with high-accuracy CCSD(T) data. The results indicate improved performance compared to standard training with only CCSD(T) data, although the magnitude of improvement varies significantly by chemical system. Additionally, the authors introduce an unsupervised learning approach utilizing a scoring function derived from the Boltzmann distribution, which yielded accuracies lower than DFT but remains a viable option when computational resources are severely constrained. The research questions are well-articulated, and the experimental designs are robust.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The multi-fidelity approach effectively reduces computational costs while enhancing performance.  
- The methodology is valuable in scenarios with limited access to accurate data.  
- The research questions and experimental designs are well-structured.  

Weaknesses:  
- The variability in the magnitude of improvement across different chemical systems raises concerns about the generalizability of the results.  
- The unsupervised learning approach resulted in accuracies lower than DFT, which may limit its applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the consistency of the performance across various chemical systems to enhance the generalizability of their approach. Additionally, further investigation into the factors contributing to the lower accuracies in the unsupervised learning approach could provide insights for refinement.
