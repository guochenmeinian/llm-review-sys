Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a bilevel optimization framework for meta-reinforcement learning (Meta-RL) named BO-MRL, aimed at enhancing policy adaptation through a universal policy optimization algorithm. The framework improves data efficiency by implementing multiple policy optimization steps during task-specific adaptation. The authors provide theoretical guarantees, including upper bounds on the expected optimality gap over a task distribution, and conduct empirical validation on several benchmarks, demonstrating the algorithm's superior effectiveness compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- Theoretical Contributions: The paper offers a solid theoretical foundation, including convergence guarantees and upper bounds on the expected optimality gap, enhancing understanding of the method's performance.
- Empirical Validation: Comprehensive empirical results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating practical applicability.
- Novel Approach: The introduction of a universal policy optimization algorithm within a bilevel optimization framework effectively addresses optimality and data-inefficiency issues in Meta-RL.

Weaknesses:  
- Complexity of Implementation: The framework may be complex to implement due to bi-level optimization and hypergradient computation, potentially limiting accessibility.
- Limited Discussion on Practical Implications: A more detailed discussion on practical implications, including computational resources and scalability, would be beneficial.
- Comparison with Broader Range of Methods: The paper could improve by including comparisons with a broader range of methods beyond the immediate Meta-RL context.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the practical implications and potential limitations of the proposed method in real-world applications, addressing computational resources and scalability. Additionally, we suggest expanding the related work section to include a broader range of Meta-RL algorithms and justify the choice of specific baselines for comparison. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide insights into the sensitivity of the proposed method to hyperparameters and its scalability with respect to the number of tasks and state-action space size. Lastly, including a synthetic experiment to demonstrate the performance differences when adapting a predefined policy could clarify the advantages of the proposed approach.
