Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the interventional factor model (IFM), a graphical model designed to generalize from past interventions to new unseen interventions. The authors provide necessary and sufficient conditions for causal effect identifiability and propose algorithms for estimating outcomes based on this model. The empirical evaluation is conducted using semi-synthetic data, comparing the proposed methods to existing approaches like DAGs and black box estimation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an important problem in causal inference and proposes an innovative IFM model along with a message passing algorithm for identification.
- The authors provide a thorough empirical evaluation and include conformal inference for uncertainty intervals, enhancing the paper's contributions.
- The writing is clear, and the inclusion of detailed examples aids reader comprehension.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks sufficient real-world examples to demonstrate the applicability of the IFM model, relying heavily on semi-synthetic simulations.
- There is a disconnect between the identifiability results and the learning algorithms, raising questions about their necessity and effectiveness.
- The presentation is at times confusing, particularly regarding the deep energy-based models and the clarity of the algorithms discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation, particularly in the sections discussing the deep energy-based models and the message passing algorithms. Providing definitions and examples for key concepts like junction trees and hypervertices in the main text would enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest that the authors elaborate on the algebraic formulation of the problem and clarify the empirical evaluation details, including the generation of outcomes and the relevance of the proposed methods compared to existing approaches. Finally, including more concrete real-world examples would help contextualize the model's utility and address concerns regarding the high number of interventional datasets required.
