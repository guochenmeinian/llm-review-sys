### Key Points
This paper presents a Conditional Variational Autoencoder-based anomaly detection method that incorporates frequency information to enhance the performance of VAEs in detecting anomalies in univariate time series. The authors propose the Frequency-enhanced Conditional Variational Autoencoder (FCVAE), which utilizes a "target attention" mechanism to extract valuable information from the frequency domain, aiming to address the limitations of existing VAE methods in capturing both long-periodic heterogeneous patterns and detailed short-periodic trends.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized, featuring high-quality figures and a clear structure that maps identified challenges to the designs of the LFM, GFM, and attention mechanisms.
- The evaluation section provides comprehensive insights into the implementation and impact of the proposed designs.

Weaknesses:
- The challenges proposed lack a thorough assessment of current anomaly detection methods, particularly regarding the limitations of VAEs in capturing detailed trends.
- The motivation for incorporating frequency information is unclear, and the connection between heterogeneous periodic patterns and frequency domain information requires further clarification.
- The novelty of the proposed method is questionable, as it primarily combines existing techniques without significant innovation.
- The method shows strong advantages over baselines on only one dataset, with marginal improvements on others.
- The evaluation is limited to the F1 score, lacking other important metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, which would provide a more comprehensive understanding of performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind incorporating frequency information and provide a more comprehensive assessment of existing methods in the context of their challenges. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the novelty of their approach and enhance the evaluation by including metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to better understand the performance of their solution. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the computational cost of their method compared to state-of-the-art solutions would be beneficial. Lastly, we encourage the authors to refine the introduction to frame the paper's relevance to the track more effectively.
