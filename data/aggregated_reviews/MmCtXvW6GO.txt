Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies the trade-offs between interpretability, consistency, and efficiency in removal-based explanation methods, establishing the Impossible Trinity Theorem, which asserts that these properties cannot coexist. The authors introduce interpretation error as a metric to quantify inconsistencies and inefficiencies, proposing algorithms based on standard polynomial basis to minimize this error while relaxing efficiency to a new property termed "truthfulness." The paper demonstrates significant reductions in interpretation error compared to existing methods across various tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper presents a well-structured mathematical framework that effectively addresses the interplay between efficiency, consistency, and interpretability.
2. The authors demonstrate a solid understanding of existing explainability methods and provide insightful connections to Boolean functional analysis.
3. The experiments are extensive, showcasing the proposed methods' superior performance in minimizing interpretation error.

Weaknesses:
1. The presentation is often unclear, requiring readers to consult the Appendices for critical results, which may detract from the main text's accessibility.
2. Definitions of key terms like consistency and efficiency lack rigor and clarity, diverging from established literature without sufficient justification.
3. The paper introduces complex concepts that may obfuscate simpler ideas, leading to potential confusion regarding the significance of the proposed metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by ensuring that the main text is self-contained and does not rely heavily on the Appendices. Additionally, we suggest providing rigorous definitions for consistency and efficiency, contrasting them with existing literature to clarify their significance. The authors should also enhance the motivation for consistency, possibly by discussing its importance relative to efficiency in various contexts. Furthermore, we encourage the inclusion of concrete examples of output explanations and a clearer explanation of the algorithms' notation. Lastly, addressing the limitations of the proposed methods explicitly would strengthen the paper's contributions.
