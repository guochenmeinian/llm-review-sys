### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to protein structure prediction by fine-tuning regression models (AlphaFold2, ESMFold) through a flow-matching generative model. The authors propose using flow-matching to generate protein conformer ensembles, demonstrating preliminary results that indicate a promising direction. They validate their method on three case studies, focusing on functional states and ligand-binding proteins.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The novelty of using flow-matching for protein ensemble sampling is well-motivated and executed.
- The model shows strong results in accurately generating different functional states.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments are limited to a small number of test proteins, leading to marginal improvements compared to existing models (e.g., AlphaFold2, ESMFold).
- The disorder prediction section lacks convincing quantitative measures, relying primarily on visual inspection of contact maps.
- There is no distribution evaluation; broader evaluations or additional benchmarks would enhance the robustness of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the disorder prediction section by incorporating more quantitative measures to support their findings. Additionally, expanding the number of test proteins and including distribution evaluations would strengthen the overall conclusions and mitigate concerns regarding potential cherry-picking of results.
