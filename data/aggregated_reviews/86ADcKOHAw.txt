Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into contextual bandits within a nearest-neighbor framework, where contexts are situated in a metric space, allowing for similar contexts to yield the same optimal action. The authors propose an algorithm that operates in an adversarial setting, utilizing flagged past contexts to inform current decisions, and analyze its regret based on the similarity between contexts. The algorithm's complexity is supported by intricate search tree constructions. Additionally, the paper introduces a metric, \Phi(y), to bound regret, reflecting the likelihood of differing optimal actions among closely related contexts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The assumption of closeness-based similarity among contexts is natural, enabling meaningful bounds even in infinite context spaces.  
- The algorithm is novel and theoretically sound, with clear regret guarantees.  
- The paper is well-structured and generally well-written.  

Weaknesses:  
- The presentation is somewhat heavy on pseudocode and notation, which may hinder understanding; more intuitive explanations of components would be beneficial.  
- Some notations, particularly in section 2, are not intuitive and may be difficult to interpret.  
- The algorithm's practical implementability is questionable, as it relies on complex data structures without empirical validation.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the ternary tree definition in Section 4.2 by providing an intuitive explanation before introducing formal notation. Additionally, we suggest including empirical results to validate the claims of computational efficiency and to compare the proposed algorithm with existing methods, particularly in terms of computation and regret. Furthermore, addressing the potential hidden constants in the theoretical claims through numerical simulations would enhance the practical applicability of the proposed methods. Lastly, we encourage the authors to expand the discussion on the novelty of the regret bound to highlight its significance.
