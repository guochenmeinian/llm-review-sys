### Key Points
This paper presents a novel detection method called BridgeGuard to address cross-chain bridge attack transactions. It conducts an extensive analysis of 49 cross-chain bridge attack incidents, utilizing cross-chain transaction execution graphs (xTEGs) and a two-stage detection framework that integrates global and local graph mining techniques. The authors claim that BridgeGuard achieves a 36.32% improvement in recall over state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is the largest to date, encompassing 49 cross-chain bridge attack incidents.
- BridgeGuard introduces a novel approach using graph representation and network motif techniques, demonstrating strong empirical results.
- The methodology is well-structured, providing a clear explanation of attack patterns and business logic.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a detailed comparison with existing solutions, particularly with more recent methods beyond XScope and DeFiScanner.
- There is insufficient discussion on the limitations of the proposed approach and how it handles potential false positives.
- The experimental design lacks an independent validation set, raising concerns about the rigor of the results.
- The choice of normal transactions and the rationale for the 5% blending rate are unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the differences between BridgeGuard and related works, such as SmartAxe, to clarify the unique contributions of their approach. Additionally, the motivation for using xTEGs should be elaborated to explain their advantages over existing tools. The authors should provide clearer details on the calculation of the 36.32% recall improvement and the dimensions generated by graph2vec for xTEGs. Furthermore, the authors need to address the inconsistency in the blending rate of attack to normal transactions and clarify the definition and selection process for normal transactions. Finally, we suggest including a more comprehensive analysis of potential limitations and ethical considerations related to the implementation of BridgeGuard.
