Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of imitation learning (IL), particularly examining the sample complexity of offline behavior cloning (BC) in relation to trajectory horizon. The authors demonstrate that under certain conditions, offline BC does not suffer more from long horizons compared to online BC, providing a new understanding of horizon dependence in IL. They also introduce techniques for analyzing IL methods, including a sharp horizon-independent regret decomposition for deterministic and stochastic experts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers extensive theoretical results that clarify the relationship between offline and online IL, suggesting that offline IL can match online IL under specific conditions.
- The presentation is clear and well-structured, making complex concepts accessible.
- New analytical techniques are introduced, which could inspire future research in IL.

Weaknesses:
- There is a disconnect between theoretical results and practical applications, particularly regarding the assumption of a well-controlled policy class.
- Some formulas and claims are misleading, particularly concerning stationary and non-stationary policies.
- Key related works are not adequately addressed, such as those discussing adversarial imitation learning and its implications for horizon independence.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the connection between theory and practice by addressing the assumptions made about the policy class and its implications for real-world applications. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the treatment of stationary versus non-stationary policies in their formulations. It would also be beneficial to incorporate discussions of relevant related works, particularly those that explore adversarial imitation learning and its horizon-independent sample complexity. Finally, we encourage the authors to include a figure that distinguishes between supervised learning and imitation learning to enhance understanding.
