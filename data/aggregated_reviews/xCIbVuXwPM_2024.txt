Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies surrogate loss design and the trade-off between surrogate consistency and loss dimension. The authors propose a method called polytope embedding, which embeds multiclass predictions onto real numbers, and examine properties such as hallucination and calibration. Key contributions include: (1) characterization of the hallucination region indicating irrational predictions, (2) construction of a calibrated surrogate under low-noise conditions, and (3) decomposition of property elicitation into low-dimensional problems. The paper also introduces the notion of partial consistency, allowing for lower-dimensional surrogate losses.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- **Well-motivated problem**: The investigation into consistent/calibrated surrogate losses addresses the restrictive nature of existing analyses, particularly in pathological distributions.
- **Interesting instances**: The exploration of calibrated surrogates under low-noise conditions provides practical scenarios and demonstrates the benefits of incorporating noise level knowledge in loss function design.
- **Clear trade-off analysis**: The paper quantifies the trade-off between the strictness of low-noise assumptions and the scoring function's dimension.

Weaknesses:
- **Clarity of results**: The structure of the paper is unclear, making it difficult for readers to grasp the authors' arguments.
- **Need for dimensionality conditions**: The result for the unit cube may require the condition \(d \geq n\), which is not explicitly stated, potentially obscuring the trade-off between consistency and dimensionality.
- **Limited guidance on distributions**: The paper identifies distributions where consistency holds for low-dimensional surrogates but lacks guidance on how to identify such distributions for specific surrogate losses.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper's structure to enhance reader comprehension. Specifically, consider adding high-level explanations before important theorems and a paragraph outlining the paper's structure. Additionally, we suggest formalizing the definition of partial consistency in the main text to clarify its implications. Addressing the dimensionality conditions explicitly, particularly for the unit cube case, would also strengthen the paper. Lastly, it would be beneficial to discuss the potential increase in inference costs compared to traditional scoring functions, as this concern is significant for practical applications.
