### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to temporal knowledge graph completion (TKGC) through the proposed method NeuSTIP, which integrates an intuitive rule language with Allen algebra relations and knowledge graph (KG) relations. The method aims to enforce temporal consistency between neighboring predicates and performs both link and time interval predictions in a neuro-symbolic setting, enhancing human interpretability and effectiveness with limited data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that NeuSTIP outperforms existing methods, particularly when combined with the KG-embedding model TimePlex.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces the first neural-symbolic TKGC approach that effectively addresses both link and time interval predictions.
- The integration of Allen algebra with KG relations is a novel contribution that enhances temporal consistency modeling.
- The proposed scoring functions for ranking candidate answers represent significant advancements in the field.
- Empirical results on challenging benchmarks (WIKIDATA12k and YAGO11k) validate the method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a figure to illustrate the overall methodology, which affects readability and presentation.
- The core performance of the NeuSTIP method is lower than competitors, with significant gains observed only in the ensemble model.
- Some formulas, particularly Formula 2, are challenging to understand without prior context, and the writing style in certain sections requires improvement.
- There is insufficient discussion on the statistical richness of the obtained rules and the computational complexity of the model.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper's presentation by adding a comprehensive figure to illustrate the proposed method clearly. Additionally, we suggest rearranging the order of Formulas 2, 3, 4, and 5 to enhance comprehension. Clarifying the writing style in sections such as Part 6 and ensuring that the human interpretability of logical rules is expressed more clearly will also benefit readability. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide more experimental evidence regarding the impact of different Allen relations on model performance and to compare the ensemble model with other ensemble approaches. Lastly, addressing the questions regarding the model's ability to predict future links and the computational complexity of its components would strengthen the paper.
