Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Fast Tree-Field Integrators (FTFI), a novel method for integrating tensor fields on trees, which constructs an auxiliary binary "IntegratorTree" for efficient computation. The authors demonstrate the efficiency of FTFI through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, including applications in Topological Vision Transformers. Additionally, the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of Transformers with FTFI, showcasing their state-of-the-art efficiency for image data and introducing new experiments with video modalities. The authors propose additional figures to clarify algorithmic concepts and provide insights into the performance of tree-based metrics, emphasizing that their findings are supported by extensive experiments across various datasets and architectures.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- FTFI significantly improves runtime compared to previous tree integration algorithms.
- The authors have conducted a thorough set of additional experiments, confirming the efficiency of Transformers with FTFI.
- The paper includes new data modalities, such as video input, enhancing its relevance and applicability.
- The illustrations (Figures 1 & 2) effectively convey relevant concepts, and clarifications and additional figures improve the presentation and understanding of the algorithmic concepts.

Weaknesses:
- Figure 5 suggests FTFI achieves similar accuracy to the brute-force BGFI, yet BGFI outperforms FTFI on most datasets with accuracy gains of over 1%.
- Some reviewers noted the need for clearer visualizations, particularly in Figure 4, where overlapping points could obscure data interpretation.
- The paper does not address theoretical guarantees or qualitative patterns for using FTFI as approximate integrators for non-tree graphs.
- Claims of speedups of 5â€“13x in the conclusion lack support from all experiments and should be presented more cautiously.
- There is a request for further insights from other reviewers with stronger backgrounds in the topic.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on how general graphs are transformed into trees, including the information lost and any theoretical considerations. Additionally, we suggest providing more examples or figures to enhance clarity, particularly in Section 3.2. It would also be beneficial to conduct experiments using advanced methods for embedding graphs to trees to potentially improve accuracy. Furthermore, we recommend improving the clarity of Figure 4 by providing a version where the points do not overlap. We encourage the authors to seek feedback from other reviewers with expertise in the topic to strengthen the paper's evaluation. Finally, if there are specific experiments regarding Transformers on image data that reviewers would like to see, we encourage the authors to inquire and conduct those experiments.
