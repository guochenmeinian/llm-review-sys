### Key Points
This paper presents xMIL-LRP, an explainable Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) method that integrates layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to enhance interpretability in histopathology. The authors aim to address the limitations of previous instance score-based methods by providing positive and negative evidence towards labels, allowing integration into existing MIL frameworks. The experimental results demonstrate improved faithfulness scores across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The experimental setup is robust, covering both toy datasets and real-world Whole Slide Image (WSI) tasks, effectively showcasing the proposed method's performance.  
- The paper is logically structured, with well-illustrated figures that facilitate understanding.  
- The development of explainable MIL methods is crucial for real-world applications, emphasizing the importance of model interpretability.

Weaknesses:  
- The method's novelty is limited, primarily applying existing explainable AI techniques to the MIL domain without substantial innovation.  
- The description of the relevance score is unclear, particularly regarding its definition and propagation within the context of attention-based MIL.  
- There is an absence of fair comparison with Additive MIL, as performance is cited without conducting new experiments under consistent conditions.  
- The methodology appears restricted to binary classification, raising questions about its adaptability to multi-class problems and continuous endpoints.  
- The lack of motivation and explanation for LRP may confuse readers unfamiliar with the concept.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the relevance score definition and its application within the context of attention-based MIL. Expanding on how LRP can be concretely applied to different architectures, such as AB-MIL and TransMIL, with step-by-step explanations would enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments to compare xMIL-LRP with Additive MIL under the same conditions to provide a fair assessment of performance. Addressing the adaptability of the method to multi-class classification and continuous endpoints is also crucial. Finally, incorporating a structured description of novelty in the introduction and clarifying the relaxation of instance independence assumptions in the Abstract would enhance transparency and clarity for readers.
