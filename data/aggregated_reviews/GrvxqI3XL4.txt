### Key Points
This paper presents a method for generating fact-based counter narratives (CNs) to combat online hate speech by utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. The authors propose integrating relevant background knowledge from various sources to enhance the factuality and effectiveness of CNs. The manuscript includes an experimental evaluation against a couple of baselines, discussing results in terms of toxicity, factuality, persuasiveness, informativeness, and linguistic quality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a critical issue of online hate speech and offers a systematic approach to generating CNs, contributing valuable insights to the field.
- The integration of external knowledge sources is a thoughtful approach that could improve the quality of generated responses.
- The manuscript is well-organized, and the authors comprehensively evaluate their method using multiple metrics, including human evaluation.

Weaknesses:
- The perceived lack of innovation is a primary concern, as the method appears to apply the RAG paradigm without introducing distinctive design elements or novel contributions.
- The experimental section is limited, comparing the proposed method against only two 2021 baselines, raising questions about the thoroughness and generalizability of the findings.
- The absence of ablation studies makes it difficult to ascertain the individual contributions of the document retrieval, summarization, and critique model components.
- The validity of the experimental metrics is questionable due to unclear evaluation criteria and the demographics of human evaluators, undermining the reliability of assessments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their approach by introducing distinctive design elements or novel technical contributions that differentiate it from existing work. Additionally, expanding the experimental section to include more baselines, particularly RAG-based ones, would enhance the robustness of the evaluation. We suggest incorporating ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of each component of the proposed framework. Clarifying the evaluation criteria and providing details about the demographics and background of human evaluators would strengthen the reliability of the metrics used. Finally, addressing potential data leakage concerns and exploring open-source alternatives to proprietary models would enhance reproducibility.
