Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents theoretical guarantees for the optimal solution of the generalized eigenvalue problem with generative priors. The authors propose an algorithm to approximate the optimal solution within a guaranteed distance and demonstrate that under suitable conditions, the optimal solution vector attains the statistically optimal rate. They supplement their theoretical analysis with experiments on the MNIST dataset, comparing their approach with existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The results are new and rigorously proved, providing a unified view of PCA, Fisher's Discriminant Analysis, and Canonical Correlation Analysis with generative priors.  
- The optimization problem and corresponding algorithm appear to achieve the statistically optimal rate under specific assumptions.  
- Numerical experiments show clear empirical improvements over existing methods.

Weaknesses:  
- Assumption 2.4 is considered too strong and unconvincing, with a lack of examples satisfying this condition.  
- The conditions in Theorem 3.3 are presented without identifying classes of matrices that satisfy them, which diminishes their interest.  
- The paper lacks clarity in the presentation of the problem, particularly regarding the derivation of Algorithm 1 and the relevance of the generative prior.  
- The computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm is questioned, especially concerning the projection on the prior set and its comparison to other methods like PPower.  
- The numerical experiments are conducted on toy data, making practical application unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by explicitly stating that Eq 3 is a Rayleigh quotient and refining the derivation of Algorithm 1. Additionally, please provide at least one class of matrices $(\mathbf{E}, \mathbf{F})$ that satisfies Assumption 2.4 and identify classes of $(\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B})$ that meet the conditions in Theorem 3.3. We suggest including a theoretical analysis that accounts for the approximation in the projection step and comparing the compute time of the proposed algorithm to other methods. Furthermore, a discussion on the implications of using generative models, especially in sensitive applications, should be included to address ethical concerns.
