Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel evaluation metric called Topological Precision and Recall (TopP&R) for generative models, addressing the unreliability of existing metrics in the presence of noise and outliers. The authors propose a metric based on Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) under topological conditions, which provides robust support estimation and captures significant features in data. The paper includes theoretical and experimental evidence demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of TopP&R, making it a valuable contribution to the evaluation of generative models. Additionally, the authors explore the concept of "ideal ground truth diversity," emphasizing that it should align with population recall, $recall_{P}(Q)=P(supp(Q))$. They clarify that while $supp(P)=supp(Q)=\mathbb{R}^{d}$ implies diversity is always 1, this does not reflect the reality of mode collapse scenarios. The authors assert that their metric is essential for evaluating generative models' ability to produce diverse samples, aligning with recent trends in the field.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of TopP&R offers a systematic approach to robust support estimation, crucial for accurately assessing sample quality.
- The metric is resilient to outliers and non-IID perturbations, ensuring reliable evaluation results.
- The paper provides both theoretical and experimental validation, demonstrating the metric's effectiveness across various datasets and models.
- The authors provide a thorough explanation of the relationship between sample size, support, and diversity, acknowledging the need to revise the definition of diversity to better reflect current research trends.
- The authors offer code implementation for TopP&R, promoting reproducibility and accessibility.

Weaknesses:
- The paper may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with persistent homology and topological data analysis, lacking sufficient background information and intuitive explanations.
- The discussion on the dimensionality of the problem and the choice of projection dimensions lacks clarity and justification.
- Limited experimentation on real-world datasets raises questions about the practical applicability of the proposed metric.
- The paper does not adequately address the computational complexity and efficiency of the proposed method compared to existing metrics.
- There is confusion regarding the definition of diversity, particularly in relation to the performance of TopR compared to previous works.
- The experimental setup lacks clear justification for parameter choices, which may leave practitioners uncertain about their appropriateness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the accessibility of the paper by providing additional background information on persistent homology and topological data analysis, along with intuitive explanations of key concepts. It would be beneficial to include a clear discussion on the dimensionality of the problem and justify the choice of projection dimensions used in experiments. We suggest conducting comprehensive evaluations on real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness of TopP&R in practical scenarios. Additionally, including a comparison of computational costs and runtime with existing metrics would enhance the paper's clarity regarding efficiency. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definition of diversity to ensure it aligns with the intended evaluation metrics and reflects the nuances of mode concentration. Lastly, we suggest that the authors provide a more rigorous justification for the parameter choices made in the experimental setup to guide practitioners effectively.
