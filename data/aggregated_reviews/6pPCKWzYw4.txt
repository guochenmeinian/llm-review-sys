### Key Points
This paper analyzes code-switching (CS) patterns in the New Mexico Spanish-English Bilingual corpus using two metrics: M-Index, which measures multilinguality, and I-Index, which assesses the probability of CS. The authors propose that multi-word CS typically occurs at the boundary between prosodic units, while single-word incorporations are subject to syntactic constraints. The findings suggest that CS modeling should differentiate between these behaviors.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a thorough and linguistically sound analysis of code-switching.
- It offers a comprehensive literature review and introduces relevant concepts clearly, making it accessible to a general NLP audience.
- The methodology is well-explained, and the metrics used are clearly defined.

Weaknesses:
- The paper is limited to corpus analysis and does not discuss applications of its findings to NLP.
- Some results may overlap with previous findings in the original corpus by Torres Cacoullos and Travis (2018), raising questions about novelty.
- Ethical concerns arise from the potential identification of speakers due to the disclosure of their names and professions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by addressing the following:
- Summarize the novel contributions of this paper compared to the findings in the book by Torres Cacoullos and Travis (2018).
- Clarify the reasoning behind the preference for code-switching at prosodic boundaries, considering the Equivalence Constraint.
- Ensure that the transcription of Intonation Units (IUs) is verified for reliability.
- Reword overly long sentences for better readability, such as those found in lines 77-82 and 110-115.
- Consider using standard language abbreviations (EN and ES) instead of E and S for clarity.
- Address ethical concerns by anonymizing speaker identities if real names are used.
- Provide additional details on the Pearson correlation calculation mentioned in line 176.
- Include heatmaps for more speakers in the appendix to enhance the analysis.
