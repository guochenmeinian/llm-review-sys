Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents MemVLT, a memory-based vision-language tracker that utilizes memory mechanisms inspired by human cognition to enhance tracking performance. The model features a Memory Storage Module (MSM) for managing long-term memory and a Memory Interaction Module (MIM) for generating adaptive prompts. The authors demonstrate superior performance compared to recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) trackers such as MMA, CAI, and OVLM, with extensive experiments validating MemVLT's state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, particularly on challenging datasets. The authors conducted thorough comparisons with various recent models, including CiteTracker and Xmem, highlighting the effectiveness and novelty of their method. The generalizability of their memory mechanism was affirmed through discussions with reviewers, leading to improved ratings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The integration of memory mechanisms with adaptive prompts is a novel approach for vision-language tracking.
2. The paper is well-written, organized, and includes appropriate citations.
3. MemVLT demonstrates strong performance across multiple benchmarks and provides a comprehensive analysis against recent SOTA trackers, showcasing its superior tracking performance.
4. The novelty of the long and short-term memory modeling is well-articulated and acknowledged by reviewers.
5. The generalizability of the memory mechanism is supported by additional analyses, positively influencing reviewer ratings.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the long and short-term memory network design is questioned, as similar concepts have been explored in prior works.
2. Performance comparisons are deemed unfair due to the use of a HiViT backbone and higher input resolution, which may skew results.
3. The writing lacks clarity in explaining the methodology, and the paper does not sufficiently address recent state-of-the-art trackers in comparisons.
4. Concerns regarding the computational efficiency of the model were initially raised but later addressed through detailed discussions and analyses.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology section to enhance understanding. Additionally, the authors should provide ablation studies on the backbone and input resolution to substantiate claims of performance improvements stemming from the memory mechanism rather than the backbone or resolution. We suggest that the authors include comparisons with recent state-of-the-art trackers and clarify the conditions under which comparisons are made. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors elaborate on the computational efficiency of MemVLT to preemptively address any lingering concerns. Finally, addressing the potential applicability of the memory mechanism in single-modality visual tracking would strengthen the paper.
