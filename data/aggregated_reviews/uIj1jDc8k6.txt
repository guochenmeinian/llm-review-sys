Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a crowdsourced dataset of stereotypes in India, collected through a survey of university students across various regions. The dataset significantly expands the number of stereotypes from approximately 200 to around 1200, uncovering numerous identities and attributes not found in existing datasets. The authors conduct a Natural Language Inference (NLI) analysis, revealing varying levels of offensiveness associated with different identities, notably showing the least offensiveness with Hindu identities and the most with Muslim identities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
- The paper is well-structured, clear, and generally easy to follow.
- It provides the most comprehensive list of stereotypes across intersectional categories to date and makes this resource available for further research.
- The methodology is well-motivated, focusing on non-western stereotypes and community engagement.

**Weaknesses:**
- The dataset is limited to university students, introducing potential age bias and filtering out experiences of older populations.
- The analysis lacks depth, with limited visualization of offensiveness scores and no comprehensive comparison with existing datasets.
- There are several typographical and grammatical errors, as well as formatting issues in the tables.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the dataset's value by providing more insight into the novel stereotypes collected, possibly through a supplementary list of the most popular new stereotypes. Additionally, visualizing the offensiveness scores for all stereotypes and providing statistics on the average and standard deviation of articles associated with stereotype pairs would enhance the analysis. The authors should also address the limitations regarding the narrow age range of respondents and consider including a broader demographic in future studies. Lastly, we suggest simplifying the abstract and introduction to improve clarity and directly stating the motivations and intentions of the paper.
