### Key Points
This paper presents "Prompt Tuning with Perturbation-based regularizer" (PTP), which aims to reduce training instability and enhance the performance of prompt tuning through two types of perturbations: random-noise-based (PTP-RN) and adversarial-based (PTP-ADV). These perturbations serve as implicit regularizers applicable to both text and embedding spaces. Experiments on super-glue and few-glue benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements over standard prompt tuning. However, the authors claim to be the first to investigate the instability of prompt tuning, which is contested by prior work.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The PTP concept with two implicit regularizers is impressive and yields significantly better results.
- The writing is clear, and the proposed algorithm is simple yet effective, allowing for future flexibility in studies.
- Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the approach's effectiveness in reducing instability.

Weaknesses:
- The approach is limited by the quality of "perturbed data," requiring more detailed methods for dataset construction and performance changes in multilingual and multi-task scenarios.
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion of the stability of vanilla fine-tuning and related neural models, which is crucial for context.
- Variance scores are inadequately reported, with some results appearing cherry-picked or incomplete.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the stability of vanilla fine-tuning and related neural models, referencing key literature on this topic. Additionally, we suggest providing a detailed comparison of prefix-tuning with PTP, including potential combinations. The authors should also clarify the computational budget used across different methods to ensure fairness in comparisons. Finally, including actual variance figures alongside the heatmap in Figure 3 would enhance the interpretability of the results.
