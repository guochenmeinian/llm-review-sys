Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel encryption mechanism for isolation forest algorithms that preserves the Gini impurity metric, combining it with CKKS for random forest training and prediction. The authors provide theoretical evidence supporting the mechanism's effectiveness against attacks and conduct extensive experiments demonstrating its accuracy and security. The work also introduces a privacy-preserving training and prediction algorithm for random forests, achieving minimal communication and computational complexities compared to prior methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed encryption mechanism is innovative and presents intriguing findings.
- The authors provide solid technical details and extensive experimental results across various datasets, showcasing the scalability and promising performance of the proposed methods.
- The paper is well-written, with a novel perspective on privacy-preserving machine learning, particularly in preserving minimum Gini impurity.

Weaknesses:
- Concerns exist regarding the solidity of the proof for the theoretical guarantee in the security analysis (Theorem 3), as it relies on experimental analysis rather than a traditional mathematical proof.
- The writing quality requires improvement, with numerous typos and grammatical errors throughout the paper, and a need for clearer explanations of the motivation behind the proposed mechanism.
- The application scenario appears limited, and the paper lacks a related work section to contextualize the contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the rigor of the proof for Theorem 3 by providing a traditional mathematical proof rather than relying solely on experimental analysis. Additionally, enhancing the clarity of the writing is essential; addressing the identified typos and grammar mistakes, and providing more background knowledge would significantly aid reader comprehension. We suggest that the authors explain the motivation behind the proposed mechanism using more informal language. Furthermore, expanding the application scenarios and including a related work section would strengthen the paper's context and relevance.
