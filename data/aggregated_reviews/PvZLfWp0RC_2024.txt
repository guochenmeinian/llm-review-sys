### Key Points
We note that the manuscript presents ExpertsMedSAM, a framework utilizing Mixture-of-Experts methodology to enhance fundus image segmentation. The primary expert is based on a baseline decoder, supplemented by a secondary expert trained on new data. While experimental results indicate improved segmentation performance, this enhancement may compromise performance in other modalities, highlighting the need for additional experts tailored to various modalities and comprehensive validation experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
We recognize the paper's completeness and accuracy in describing the proposed method, which appears effective for the tested experiments. However, we identify significant weaknesses, including inconsistencies in the author list, numerous writing and formatting errors, and a lack of clarity in the presentation. The paper also fails to specify how modalities are selected for multi-expert fusion and does not provide computational speed improvements, with only marginal gains over the baseline in performance metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We suggest the following improvements: 
1. Clarify the weights of basic and new outputs in the fusion method and whether these weights change with training epochs.
2. Specify if any additional data from the competition was used alongside the four new fundus image datasets.
3. Provide detailed descriptions of the areas where improvements were made and potential degradation effects.
4. Include specific statistics on the increase in inference time due to the additional decoder.
5. Resolve contradictions regarding the loss function, ensuring consistency between the text and Table 3.
6. Address the numerous writing errors, including spacing, spelling, punctuation, and terminology issues, to enhance clarity and readability before resubmission.
