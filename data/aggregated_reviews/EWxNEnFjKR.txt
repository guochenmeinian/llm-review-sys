Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the ImOOD framework to tackle class imbalance issues in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. The authors identify critical biases through Bayesian analysis and propose a unified regularization technique to enhance detection performance. Extensive experiments validate ImOOD's effectiveness on CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and ImageNet-LT datasets, revealing a class-aware bias between balanced and imbalanced OOD detection.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- It offers a solid theoretical foundation, explaining class-aware bias and providing a unified regularization approach.
- Strong experimental results demonstrate consistent performance improvements across various benchmarks.

Weaknesses:
- The method relies on external OOD data, which is often difficult to obtain in OOD detection settings.
- Comparisons in CIFAR and ImageNet experiments appear inconsistent, with fewer methods evaluated on ImageNet, where ClassPrior seems to perform better.
- The proposed parametric mapping complicates network optimization and lacks sufficient experimental evidence to show its effectiveness over existing methods from long-tailed learning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including more recent OOD detection methods and comparing them with the proposed approach to provide a more comprehensive assessment. Additionally, the authors should clarify the implications of using long-tailed learning methods in conjunction with OOD detection and address the concerns regarding the erratic behavior of the curves in the figures. Finally, we suggest testing the benefits of the method with varying levels of imbalance to better understand its performance dynamics.
