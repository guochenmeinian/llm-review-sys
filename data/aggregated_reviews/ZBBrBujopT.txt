Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to controlling partially observable linear dynamical systems (LDS) in the presence of adversarial disturbances, introducing the GPC-PO-Simplex algorithm. The authors leverage mirror descent and approximate solutions to sub-problems, providing theoretical guarantees for performance and empirical evaluations demonstrating effectiveness in controlling population dynamics and other systems. Additionally, the paper explores the simplex LDS model, extending online linear control tools to achieve sublinear regret against linear controllers with bounded mixing time.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- Originality: The paper introduces a significant departure from traditional methods by combining mirror descent with a new parameterization method for partially observable LDS.  
- Quality: The theoretical foundations are robust, with detailed proofs and clear assumptions, including regret bounds that highlight near-optimal performance.  
- Clarity: The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a well-motivated problem and a step-by-step methodology.  
- Significance: The proposed method has broad implications across various fields, including epidemiology and economics, with potential applications to real-world problems.  
- Empirical Validation: Experiments complement theoretical results, testing algorithms in regimes where theory may not hold.

Weaknesses:  
- Idealized Assumptions: The algorithm's reliance on known transition matrices and Gaussian noise limits its applicability in real-world scenarios.  
- Limited Generalization: The algorithm's performance in highly non-linear or complex systems remains untested.  
- Sensitivity to Parameters: The algorithm's performance is sensitive to parameter choices, necessitating more guidance on selection or adaptive methods.  
- Experimental Scope: Validation is limited to simulated environments; real-world experiments are needed for stronger evidence.  
- Clarity of Technical Conditions: Some technical conditions are hard to interpret, and further insights on their necessity would enhance understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by relaxing idealized assumptions, such as known transition matrices and Gaussian noise, to enhance applicability. Additionally, conducting experiments on higher-dimensional systems and in real-world environments would strengthen the findings. Providing more detailed guidance or a method for adaptively selecting parameters is crucial for practical usability. Including simple examples of simplex LDSs in the introduction would aid reader intuition. Finally, addressing the clarity of technical conditions and discussing the motivations for the simplex LDS setting would improve the overall presentation. We also suggest enlarging the figures and label text for better readability.
