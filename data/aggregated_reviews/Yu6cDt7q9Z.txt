Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Logistic Schedule, a novel noise schedule aimed at resolving the singularity problem in traditional noise schedules for text-guided image editing. The authors identify that conventional DDIM inversion methods suffer from accumulated prediction errors, which negatively impact content preservation and edit fidelity. By implementing the Logistic Schedule, the authors claim to enhance inversion stability and provide a better noise space for image editing, validated through experiments on eight editing tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The Logistic Schedule effectively addresses singularity issues in traditional noise schedules.  
2. It is compatible with various existing editing techniques without requiring additional retraining, enhancing its applicability.  
3. The method demonstrates superior performance in content preservation and edit fidelity across extensive experimental validation.  
4. The paper offers a thorough theoretical analysis of DDIM inversion failures, providing a well-founded solution.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The proposed Logistic Schedule is similar to the sigmoid schedule, as noted in existing literature; the authors should clarify the differences and whether the beta sigmoid schedule can also address the singularity problem.  
2. There is a potential contradiction between preserving original content and editing ability; the authors should explore this relationship further.  
3. Additional comparisons with other noise schedules or inversion techniques are needed to strengthen the findings.  
4. The results of Null-text, NPI, and Direct should be included for better comparative analysis.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the differences between the Logistic Schedule and the sigmoid schedule. Additionally, the authors should investigate the balance between original content preservation and editing ability to address potential contradictions. We suggest including more comprehensive comparisons with other noise schedules and inversion techniques to bolster the paper's findings. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide results for Null-text, NPI, and Direct to enhance the comparative analysis.
