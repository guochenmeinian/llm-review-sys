Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ZSC-Eval, a comprehensive toolkit and benchmark for evaluating Zero-Shot Coordination (ZSC) algorithms in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). The authors propose generating evaluation partners through behavior-preferring rewards, selecting them using Best-Response Diversity (BR-Div), and measuring ZSC capability with the Best-Response Proximity (BR-Prox) metric. Empirical evaluations in environments like Overcooked and Google Research Football reveal insights into ZSC capabilities and limitations, demonstrating the toolkit's effectiveness in generating diverse partners and aligning results with human evaluations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- ZSC-Eval addresses a significant challenge in MARL by providing a robust evaluation framework for ZSC algorithms.
- The toolkit generates diverse evaluation partners, overcoming limitations of existing methods that produce similar training and evaluation partners.
- It introduces innovative metrics, BR-Div and BR-Prox, which enhance the assessment of ZSC performance.
- The paper is well-grounded in theoretical principles and supported by experimental validation.

Weaknesses:
- The writing lacks clarity in certain areas, particularly regarding specific equations and terms.
- Empirical validation is limited to a few environments, which may restrict generalizability.
- Some figures, such as Figure 3, lack quantitative metrics and detailed statistical analysis.
- Insufficient details on the design and implementation of behavior-preferring rewards and computational resources used for experiments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing, particularly by explaining terms like $\pi^{-i}$ and the equations in lines 107 and 110. To enhance generalizability, we suggest testing ZSC-Eval in a wider variety of environments beyond Overcooked and GRF. Additionally, providing quantitative metrics and detailed statistical analysis for Figure 3 would strengthen the validation of behavioral diversity. Clear guidelines on the design and implementation of behavior-preferring rewards should be included, detailing how to select events and assign weights. Finally, specifying the computational resources used in experiments would aid in understanding the feasibility and reproducibility of the results.
