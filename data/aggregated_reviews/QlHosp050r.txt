Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for Weakly-Supervised Concealed Object Segmentation (WSCOS) that leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to generate segmentation masks from sparse annotations. The authors propose techniques such as multi-augmentation result fusion and entropy-based filtering to enhance the quality of pseudo labels. Additionally, a novel multi-scale feature grouping (MFG) module is integrated into the WS-SAM framework, demonstrating significant improvements in various segmentation tasks, including semi-supervised and fully-supervised semantic segmentation, as well as concealed object segmentation (COS). The method is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets, achieving competitive results and notable performance enhancements.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation for the study is clearly articulated, making the challenges and tasks understandable.
2. The performance of the proposed method is commendable across most benchmark datasets, with the MFG module showing substantial improvements.
3. The paper effectively distinguishes the proposed method from existing frameworks, particularly in its handling of augmentations.
4. Reviewers acknowledge the authors' responsiveness to concerns, enhancing the paper's overall quality.

Weaknesses:
1. The literature review is insufficient, lacking references to significant works in weakly-supervised segmentation, which could provide context for the proposed methods.
2. The techniques of multi-augmentation fusion and entropy-based filtering are not novel, as they are commonly found in existing literature.
3. The paper does not adequately highlight its major contributions, particularly regarding the novelty of employing SAM for concealed object segmentation.
4. Limitations of the proposed method are not discussed.
5. Some reviewers note that the overall impact of the paper may not be substantial enough to warrant a higher rating.
6. There is a suggestion to further clarify the differences between the proposed method and existing weakly-supervised approaches.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by including relevant studies on weakly-supervised segmentation tasks, such as those listed in the review. Additionally, the authors should clarify the novelty of their contributions, particularly in relation to SAM's application. It would be beneficial to demonstrate the efficacy of the multi-scale feature grouping module on other segmentation tasks beyond concealed object segmentation. Furthermore, the authors should address the computational burden associated with using SAM, especially during inference with multiple augmentations. Lastly, we suggest revising the theoretical aspects of the mask generation method to correct inaccuracies and enhance clarity, while also emphasizing the unique aspects of the WS-SAM framework in relation to other methods to strengthen the paper's impact.
