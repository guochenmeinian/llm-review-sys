### Key Points
This paper presents WiseStart, a novel "hot-start-based" slow start mechanism that utilizes a priori knowledge to optimize initial parameters in mobile web services. Extensive experiments in a production environment with over 10 million daily active users demonstrate WiseStart's effectiveness, particularly in reducing First AFT. The design continuously probes new connections to adapt to fluctuating network conditions and includes mechanisms to address application-limit scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant issue in mobile web services, optimizing loading time for the first page, which is crucial for user experience.
- WiseStart introduces a promising "hot-start-based" approach that adapts dynamically to network conditions.
- Real-world implementation in a popular mobile web service adds credibility to the findings.

Weaknesses:
- Initial hit rates for WiseStart were low, suggesting a learning curve and complexity in achieving optimal performance.
- The generalizability of WiseStart to other services or network conditions is not clearly discussed.
- The paper lacks clarity in presentation, with some results and terminology needing consistent definitions and explanations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by defining acronyms like 'FCT' upon first use and ensuring consistent descriptions of terms like 'BtlBW.' Additionally, reference numbers should not be placed within numerical values to avoid confusion. The authors should also enhance the pseudocode of Algorithm 1 to include maintenance and decision phases for better comprehension. To strengthen generalizability, we suggest evaluating WiseStart's performance across a broader range of services and conditions, and considering the long-term stability and scalability of the mechanism. Finally, addressing how WiseStart integrates with emerging network technologies would provide valuable context.
