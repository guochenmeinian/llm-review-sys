Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of the Langevin quasi Monte Carlo (LQMC) algorithm, which substitutes standard Gaussian random variables with completely uniformly distributed quasi-random numbers generated by the LFSR method. The authors derive a bound on the estimation error that scales as \(O(n^{-1 + \delta})\) for smooth and strongly convex potentials, demonstrating that LQMC outperforms traditional Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) in various numerical experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The integration of quasi-Monte Carlo methods into Langevin dynamics represents a significant theoretical contribution, with a clean proof and clear demonstration of the method's utility.  
- The paper is well-structured, making it easy to follow, and the empirical results are promising, indicating substantial performance improvements.  
- The originality of using non-random Gaussians is noteworthy, and the thoroughness of the experiments across different settings enhances the credibility of the findings.  

Weaknesses:  
- The focus on relatively simple cases raises concerns about the generalizability of results to more complex scenarios, such as non-convex losses or real data applications.  
- The dependence of error bounds on the dimension \(d\) is not explicitly addressed, which may mislead readers regarding the applicability of LQMC in high-dimensional settings.  
- The theoretical assumptions made in the analysis may limit the broader applicability of the results, and the empirical work relies heavily on toy models rather than real-world data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by exploring extensions of their results to more complex scenarios, including non-convex losses and real data applications. Additionally, clarifying the implications of the \(d\) dependence in the error bounds and explicitly stating the conditions under which the assumptions hold would enhance the paper's robustness. Finally, incorporating a discussion on the potential applications of LQMC in realistic tasks and providing more empirical examples with real data would strengthen the case for its practical utility.
