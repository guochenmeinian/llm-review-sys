Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new approach to open-set domain generalization (OSDG) by proposing the Evidential Bi-Level Hardest Domain Scheduler (EBiL-HaDS), which adaptively sequences domains based on their reliability assessed through a follower network. The authors demonstrate that dynamically adapting the domain scheduler can enhance training strategies and improve outcomes across three benchmarks: PACS, DigitsDG, and OfficeHome.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors focus on a novel problem in OSDG, suggesting that dynamically adapting the domain scheduler may improve performance.
2. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive domain scheduler.
3. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation for considering the training order of domains is unclear, particularly in the absence of temporal correlation in the datasets used.
2. The proposed method shows limited performance improvement over the existing MEDIC model on certain tasks.
3. The complexity of the framework may hinder reproducibility, and the lack of source code availability is a significant drawback.
4. The paper contains grammatical mistakes and formatting issues that need correction.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the motivation for the training order of domains and provide a more detailed definition of domain reliability, demonstrating its real-world significance. Additionally, the authors should compare max rebiased discrepancy evidential learning with other similar techniques to highlight its advantages. To enhance reproducibility, we urge the authors to make the source code publicly available and consider including more ablations on ViT backbones, as they have shown strong domain generalization performance. Finally, we suggest a thorough proofreading of the paper to correct grammatical errors and formatting inconsistencies.
