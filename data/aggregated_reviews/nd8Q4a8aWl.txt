Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for estimating the local intrinsic dimension (LID) of data manifolds using diffusion models, specifically through the FLIPD estimator, which leverages the Fokker-Planck equation to enhance efficiency and accuracy. The authors build upon theoretical foundations, culminating in Theorem 3.1, and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through empirical results on benchmark tasks, including high-resolution images. However, practical applications reveal issues, particularly regarding the stability of estimates when using low-dimensional manifolds and the behavior of different architectures like UNets. The paper emphasizes the importance of knees in FLIPD curves but may conflate this observation with the implications of the theoretical results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces a compelling and well-motivated approach to LID estimation using diffusion models, significantly simplifying the process and improving computational efficiency.  
- The theoretical contributions, particularly Theorem 3.1, are significant and merit publication, with a robust theoretical background and thorough empirical validation through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.  
- The multiscale interpretation and the use of PNG compression as a proxy for evaluating complexity are informative and add value to the findings.  

Weaknesses:  
- Some technical issues arise in the presentation, particularly in Section 3.2, where the insights from key equations are not clearly articulated.  
- The practical application of the theory encounters issues, notably the instability of estimates and the unclear relationship between the theory and observed behaviors in different architectures.  
- The computational advantages of FLIPD over existing methods are not sufficiently demonstrated with detailed comparisons or analyses.  
- The focus on knees overshadows critical issues related to the practical implementation of the proposed estimator, and the transition from MLPs to UNets in experiments is abrupt, leading to confusion regarding the consistency of findings across different architectures.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 3.2 by providing more detailed explanations of the Fokker-Planck equation and its relevance to LID estimation. Additionally, surface and discuss the issues of estimate stability and the relationship between theory and observed behaviors early in the introduction and throughout the experiments section. Include a thorough theoretical analysis or experimental evidence to substantiate claims regarding the computational efficiency of FLIPD compared to prior methods. It would also be beneficial to restructure the experiments section to clearly delineate findings related to MLPs and UNets, ensuring that the complexities introduced by the latter are adequately addressed. Finally, consider reducing the focus on knees and instead provide more insight into utilizing estimates across various hyperparameter settings, as commonly done in robust estimation, and revisit the wording in the abstract regarding the claim that the work "addresses all the aforementioned deficiencies," as significant questions about the accuracy of estimates remain unresolved.
