Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a normative model of decision confidence that extends the planning-as-inference framework by incorporating an optimality variable proportional to the softmax over the reward distribution. The authors validate their model using data from two behavioral tasks, comparing it to other models of confidence. The motivation for the study is clear, and the separation between perceptual and decision confidence is well-articulated.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation is compelling, and the model is novel yet rooted in existing literature.
2. The text is well-written, clear, and easy to follow.
3. The statistical analysis is robust and appropriate.
4. The empirical evaluation, while mixed, shows favorable results for the proposed model in value-based decision-making tasks.

Weaknesses:
1. The proposed model only explains confidence reports for a fraction of participants in both tasks, indicating a need for deeper exploration of the underlying issues.
2. The representation of epistemic uncertainty is absent, which is crucial for decision confidence.
3. The normative justification for Equation 7 is not adequately formalized, appearing heuristic instead.
4. The results do not consistently favor the proposed model, and the transformation of reward sum to probability of optimality lacks clarity.
5. There are inconsistencies in terminology and notation throughout the paper, which could confuse readers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the normative justification for Equation 7 and clarify its derivation. Additionally, we suggest incorporating a representation of epistemic uncertainty into the framework. To solidify the model's findings, we encourage the authors to propose experiments that explore neural activity related to confidence and to consider the implications of different models explaining participants' confidence reports. Furthermore, we advise enhancing the clarity of the writing by addressing inconsistencies in terminology and notation. Lastly, a more detailed discussion on the limitations of the model and its applicability across different decision-making scenarios would strengthen the paper.
