Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for generating egocentric videos from multi-view exocentric videos using a diffusion-based approach. The authors propose a multi-view exocentric encoder and an Exo2Ego view translation prior to tackle the challenges of viewpoint variation and dynamic motion. The method demonstrates good visual performance and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the Ego-Exo4D dataset, although it faces criticism regarding its novelty and evaluation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a challenging problem and achieves impressive performance.
2. The proposed method is innovative, effectively leveraging camera poses and multi-view video features.
3. The application of a diffusion-based framework is interesting and shows potential for real-world scenarios.

Weaknesses:
1. The method lacks specific designs tailored for the "Exocentric-to-Egocentric" task, particularly in generating dynamic hand-object interactions.
2. The view translation prior is similar to existing work (ReconFusion), necessitating clearer differentiation.
3. The evaluation dataset is limited, with only five categories selected, raising concerns about generalizability.
4. The writing quality requires improvement, particularly in clarity and consistency.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the specificity of designs focused on the "Exocentric-to-Egocentric" task, particularly regarding hand-object dynamics. Additionally, clarify the differences between the proposed view translation prior and ReconFusion. We suggest conducting further experiments to evaluate the impact of the number of exocentric videos on performance and to validate the method's generalizability across diverse datasets. Finally, enhance the clarity of the presentation, particularly in the method section, and ensure consistent terminology throughout the paper.
