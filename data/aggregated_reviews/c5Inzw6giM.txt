Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for privacy-preserving CNN training using homomorphic encryption, incorporating techniques such as transfer learning, Quadratic Gradient, a new loss function called Squared Likelihood Error (SLE), and a matrix-encoding method named Volley Revolver. The authors claim to demonstrate the feasibility of homomorphic CNN training and achieve state-of-the-art performance in convergence speed.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1) The application of homomorphic encryption to neural network training is novel.
2) The feasibility of homomorphic CNN training is demonstrated.
3) The proposed SLE loss function is a significant contribution.
4) The algorithm shows impressive convergence speed in experiments.

Weaknesses:
1) The introduction of related works is overly simplistic, hindering the evaluation of the paper's contributions.
2) The quality of writing and presentation is poor and difficult to read.
3) The paper lacks strong novelty in its cryptographic aspects and relies heavily on non-peer-reviewed references.
4) The title is misleading as the paper primarily focuses on logistic regression rather than CNN training.
5) The threat model and architecture of the proposed scheme are inadequately described, raising concerns about practical applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by providing a more comprehensive review of related works to clarify their contributions. Additionally, enhancing the writing quality and presentation is crucial for readability. The authors should clarify the proposed architecture and the specific role of homomorphic encryption in the transfer learning process. It is essential to address the security targets and benefits of the proposed scheme. Lastly, we suggest that the authors reconsider the title to accurately reflect the content, focusing on logistic regression training rather than CNN training.
