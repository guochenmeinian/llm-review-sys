Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a deep state-space model architecture with non-linear transitions and emissions, effectively disentangling latent representations for dynamics and observed data at each time step. This allows for improved state estimation and missing data imputation. Inference is conducted using a deep Extended Kalman Filter, leveraging an RNN architecture for efficient computation of the Kalman Gain and smoothing gain. The method is validated against various simulated and realistic datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to competing architectures.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses the challenges of parameter learning and state estimation in non-linear/deep state-space models, providing an interesting solution.
2. The method's scalability surpasses traditional Kalman Filter-based approaches due to the dynamics network approximation while maintaining effectiveness.
3. The authors introduce useful novel components, building on existing literature.
4. Extensive experiments and ablations are conducted, comparing the proposed method with many state-of-the-art models.
5. The appendix contains detailed information, including "A.11.1 Python intuitive code."

Weaknesses:
The paper's readability is hindered by the presentation of derivations, requiring careful review. The notation is unconventional for the ML community, necessitating clarification:
1. The use of o^+ notation in Section 4 needs explanation within that section.
2. The notation "s" in line 219 is unclear and should be defined.
3. The definition of "gt" in line 229 requires justification.
4. The SI perspective may confuse readers; consider relocating it to the appendix.

Concerns regarding novelty arise, as the final model resembles the Kalman VAE (KVAE) more than claimed. Clarification of differences between the proposed model and KVAE is needed, especially regarding the description in line 96 and Table 6. 

Minor comments include typographical errors and unclear definitions that should be addressed for clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the derivations and notation used throughout the paper, particularly in Section 4. Specifically, clarify the meaning of o^+ notation, the significance of "s" in line 219, and the necessity of defining "gt" in line 229. Additionally, consider relocating the SI perspective to the appendix to avoid confusion.

To enhance the novelty discussion, we suggest that the authors explicitly differentiate their model from the KVAE, addressing the similarities and clarifying the unique contributions of their approach. Finally, we encourage the authors to conduct further evaluations on more challenging datasets to strengthen the empirical validation of their claims.
