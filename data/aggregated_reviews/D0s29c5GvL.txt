Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CosAE, a novel autoencoder architecture that utilizes Fourier series to encode images for restoration tasks. By representing images with frequency coefficients, CosAE achieves significant spatial compression while maintaining fine detail. The authors demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on super-resolution and blind image restoration, showcasing its generalization across various image degradations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper is well-written and clearly presented, with effective figures and tables.  
2. The novel observation that Fourier space enables extreme compression ratios is intriguing.  
3. Extensive experiments on face and natural image restoration validate the proposed method's performance across multiple benchmarks.  
4. The derivations of the autoencoder are straightforward and well-justified, providing a solid foundation for further research.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The necessity of a highly compressed latent space for image restoration is unclear, especially since skip connections can mitigate downsampling loss.  
2. The paper lacks theoretical interpretations regarding the advantages of Fourier space over previous latent space methods.  
3. Comparisons with VAE or VQ-VAE are missing, making it difficult to assess progress.  
4. The decoding network's structure is not sufficiently justified, and an ablation study on this aspect is needed.  
5. There is a lack of visual comparisons with previous methods beyond LIIF.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical framework by providing interpretations of the superiority of Fourier space over traditional methods. Additionally, the authors should include comparisons with VAE or VQ-VAE to clarify the advancements made. Expanding the discussion and conducting an ablation study on the decoding network would enhance the understanding of its structure. Furthermore, we suggest adding more visual comparisons with other methods to strengthen the paper's claims. Lastly, addressing the potential for the method to construct a low-dimensional latent space for image generation could broaden its applicability.
