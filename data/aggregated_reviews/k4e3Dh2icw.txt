### Key Points
This paper presents the DVIB framework, which integrates variational information bottleneck techniques with self-distillation to enhance the robustness of multimodal recommendation systems (MRS). By shifting perturbations from the input layer to the hidden layer, DVIB effectively reduces noise and redundancy without altering the original model architecture. Theoretical analysis supports the framework, and extensive experiments demonstrate consistent performance improvements across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The DVIB framework is innovative, combining VIB and self-distillation to address noise and redundancy in MRS.
2. Theoretical evidence robustly supports the efficacy of DVIB, with mathematical formulations convincingly demonstrating its benefits.
3. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple datasets show significant performance enhancements.

Weaknesses:
1. The absence of real-world case studies limits the practical demonstration of the framework's effectiveness.
2. There is a lack of detailed analysis regarding the computational cost and training efficiency, particularly for larger datasets.
3. The paper does not adequately discuss the generalization of DVIB to other domains beyond MRS.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including performance comparisons between the proposed framework and existing methods specifically addressing inherent noise and redundant information. Additionally, conducting a complete ablation study to investigate the effectiveness of moving perturbations from the input to the hidden layer is essential. The authors should also provide a parameter sensitivity analysis and explore the scalability of the adaptive noise mechanism with larger datasets. Finally, including evaluation metrics beyond Top-5 rankings could offer deeper insights into the framework's robustness and generalization capabilities.
