### Key Points
This paper presents a polite interpersonal psychotherapy dialogue system that incorporates user factors such as gender, age, persona, and sentiment. The authors propose a novel dataset, “PSYCON,” annotated at both dialogue and utterance levels, and utilize GPT-J for dataset construction and GPT-2 for response generation through fine-tuning and policy fine-tuning. The model, e-Therapist, is evaluated against competitive baselines, demonstrating effectiveness in integrating various conversational elements essential to psychotherapy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset collected is a valuable resource for future research, combining LLM prompting with expert interventions to enhance quality.
- The introduction of a novel dialogue system utilizing a reinforcement learning framework for fine-tuning shows promise.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks detailed analysis and statistics regarding the significance of results, particularly concerning the diversity of polite expressions and their relation to user attributes.
- Essential references are missing, and comparisons with existing datasets like ESConv and EmpatheticDialogues are not adequately addressed.
- Ethical considerations are insufficiently managed, particularly regarding the risks associated with using GPT-J for data distillation.
- The dataset creation process lacks clarity, especially regarding the selection of cases and the qualifications of annotators.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the elaboration and analysis of the significance of their results, particularly in relation to the diversity of polite expressions and their connections to gender, age, and persona. Additionally, the authors should include missing references and provide a comparative analysis with existing datasets. We suggest using a more secure and controllable data distillation model, such as ChatGPT, to address ethical concerns. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the dataset creation process, including the selection criteria for cases and the qualifications of annotators. Lastly, we recommend conducting experiments to verify the contribution of each fine-grained reward to the overall performance of the model.
