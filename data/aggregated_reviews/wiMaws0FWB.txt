Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of the implicit bias of the mirror descent algorithm, focusing on its optimization trajectory in a continuous flow context. The authors introduce the concepts of horizon shape and horizon function \(\phi_\infty\) to characterize mirror flow properties at infinity. They demonstrate that under a linear exponential-tail classification setting, the mirror flow converges directionally to a maximum \(\phi_\infty\)-margin solution. The findings enhance the understanding of mirror descent's characteristics across various potential functions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The results are robust, covering a general class of potential functions, and the authors derive a calculation rule for \(\phi_\infty\).
2. The paper is well-structured and informative, particularly in section 3, where the authors clarify convergence reasons using gradient descent as an example.

Weaknesses:
1. The practical implications of mirror descent are underexplored, particularly regarding the similarities in implicit bias with steepest descent as illustrated in Figure 1.
2. The assumption of an infinitely small learning rate may be overly strong for simple linear classification problems, necessitating a discussion of the discrete optimization challenges of mirror descent.
3. The application of the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem to an uncountably infinite set appears questionable.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the implications of their results, particularly regarding the similarities in implicit bias with steepest descent. Additionally, the authors should clarify the technical challenges associated with the discrete optimization process of mirror descent. We also suggest revisiting the application of the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem to ensure its correctness. Lastly, providing empirical evidence of the convergence rate, as mentioned in the reviews, would enhance the paper's contributions.
