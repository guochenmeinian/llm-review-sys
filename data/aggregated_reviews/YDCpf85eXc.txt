Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for finding optimal counterfactual action sequences in sequential decision-making problems characterized by continuous state spaces. The authors formalize the problem using a structural causal model (SCM) and demonstrate that the solution is NP-hard. They propose an A*-based search algorithm to efficiently tackle this problem, applying their method to clinical sepsis management data and showing promising results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant research problem relevant to the community.
- The formulation of the problem and its NP-hardness is a valuable contribution.
- The proposed A*-based algorithm is sound and well-motivated.
- The empirical evaluation on clinical data demonstrates the utility of the approach.

Weaknesses:
- The worst-case complexity of the method matches that of brute-force search, raising concerns about efficiency.
- The assumptions regarding bijectivity and Lipschitz continuity of the SCM may limit the applicability of the method.
- The discussion of related work is limited, making it difficult to assess the paper's impact.
- The empirical results lack adequate baselines for comparison, which complicates interpretation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the abstract, possibly by simplifying the first half and using real examples for context. Additionally, spell out "ICU" before its first use and provide a visual quadrant to illustrate the gap their work fills in the MDP landscape. It would be beneficial to elaborate on the causal sufficiency assumption and its implications, as well as to discuss the potential for soft interventions in their model. We suggest including a diagram to explain Algorithm 1 and revising the structure to present the problem statement earlier in the paper. Finally, we recommend providing more extensive empirical comparisons, including naive baselines and a discussion on the conditions under which their method operates efficiently.
