### Key Points
This paper presents a model that formalizes the process of creating new solutions through the recombination of existing elements, specifically in the context of drug design via a Combinatorial Discovery Game (CDG). The authors investigate how domain knowledge influences a rational agent's decision-making within this framework, revealing that novices not only earn fewer rewards but also explore less systematically than experts. An online behavioral experiment supports these findings, which are deemed valuable for developing new exploration methods in reinforcement learning, such as knowledge-guided exploration. However, concerns arise regarding the technical contributions, as the extensions to existing models appear trivial.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a relevant and timely topic in AI and decision-making under uncertainty, crucial for understanding innovation processes.
2. A solid theoretical framework is provided, extending previous work on combinatorial discovery games to include domain uncertainty, with appropriate use of Bayesian modeling and Thompson Sampling.
3. The inclusion of a behavioral experiment with a substantial sample size (n=300) adds empirical weight to the theoretical predictions.
4. The methodology is clear and replicable for both the theoretical model and experimental design.
5. The interdisciplinary approach bridges theoretical computer science, decision theory, and behavioral psychology, enhancing its value for a top AI venue.

Weaknesses:
1. The study's focus on a specific type of combinatorial discovery game may limit its generalizability to real-world innovation processes.
2. The binary categorization of "expert" versus "novice" oversimplifies the spectrum of domain knowledge in real-world scenarios.
3. There is limited discussion on why novices interact with more item types despite being less exploratory, which warrants deeper analysis.
4. The paper does not adequately address the long-term implications of observed short-term behaviors on innovation outcomes.
5. There is a lack of discussion on practical applications of the findings in real-world AI development or innovation strategies.
6. The experiment's cover story (alien crystals) may introduce unintended biases or misunderstandings among participants.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors expand the discussion on the unexpected finding of novices interacting with more item types to provide insights into different exploration strategies. Additionally, consider running further experiments with varying levels of expertise to create a nuanced understanding of how domain knowledge impacts exploration. It would be beneficial to elaborate on how these findings might be applied in real-world AI development or innovation processes. Conducting sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the model under different parameters and assumptions is also advisable. Finally, including a section on limitations and future work would address potential criticisms and outline next steps for this line of research.
