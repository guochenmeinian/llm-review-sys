Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on contract design, where a principal aims to create a reward structure for various outcomes influenced by a self-interested agent. The authors introduce a novel Discontinuous ReLU (DeLU) network to model the principal's utility function, which is piecewise affine with discontinuities. They propose two inference methods—Linear Programming (LP) and a gradient-based approach—to derive the optimal contract using the trained DeLU network. Empirical results demonstrate the optimality, sample complexity, and efficiency of the DeLU network compared to conventional ReLU networks. Additionally, the paper emphasizes boundary alignment in utility functions and proposes an algorithm to assess whether contracts are on true or DeLU boundaries, utilizing a piecewise linear principal utility function. The performance of the "sub-"argmax method is shown to correlate with boundary alignment. The authors acknowledge the relevance of their approach to broader economic contexts and express intent to explore additional applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The representation of the principal's utility function using a neural network is a novel and insightful approach, opening new research avenues in contract design.
2. The motivation for the DeLU network is well-justified, as it effectively captures the piecewise affine nature and discontinuities of the utility function.
3. The paper is well-organized, integrating theoretical analysis, methodology, and experimental results seamlessly.
4. The paper addresses a fundamental problem in economic theory, particularly relevant in the context of the digital economy.
5. The algorithm for boundary alignment is clearly articulated, providing a robust framework for analysis.
6. The authors demonstrate responsiveness to reviewer feedback, indicating a commitment to improving the paper's quality.

Weaknesses:
1. There is insufficient motivation for employing deep learning in optimal contract design, leaving unclear why this approach is beneficial in this context.
2. The method of approximating the optimal contract as the argmax of the approximated utility function raises concerns about its reliability, particularly regarding boundary inaccuracies.
3. The paper lacks theoretical analysis on generalization error/sample complexity and the convergence of the proposed optimization methods.
4. The focus on contract design may limit the exploration of DeLU in other relevant economic problems.
5. The discussion on boundary alignment could benefit from more comprehensive analysis and motivation in the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for using deep learning in optimal contract design, clarifying its relevance and advantages in this domain. Additionally, addressing the reliability of the argmax approximation in the presence of boundary inaccuracies is crucial. The authors should also include theoretical analyses regarding the generalization error and convergence of both the gradient-based and LP methods. We suggest improving the discussion on boundary alignment by motivating and analyzing it after the lemmas in Sec. 3 and examining the influence of MSE loss in Sec. 4.2. Furthermore, we recommend introducing the "sub-"argmax approach in Sec. 4.2.2 and adding a new experimental subsection that details the boundary check algorithm and its relationship with DeLU performance. Lastly, we encourage the authors to expand on the applicability of their findings to other economic problems and consider methodological extensions to multi-agent scenarios and mixed payment-penalty settings in the Limitation section.
