### Key Points
This paper presents an empirical study of frame selection for Text-To-Video Retrieval (TVR), classifying existing methods into text-free and text-guided categories. The authors propose two frame selection methods: Redundancy-Aware frame selection, which uses the k-medoids++ clustering algorithm to eliminate redundant frames, and Low Quality-Aware frame selection, which employs a score network for assessing frame quality using paired text as weak supervision. The experiments demonstrate that these methods enhance retrieval efficiency without compromising performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed Redundancy-Aware and Low Quality-Aware methods effectively improve frame selection for TVR.
- Experimental results indicate that the proposed methods outperform existing baselines in both text-free and text-guided scenarios.
- The paper is well-written and provides a thorough evaluation of state-of-the-art techniques.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation indicators, particularly R@sum, are not commonly used in TVR literature.
- The paper allocates excessive space to the impact of frame selections on retrieval performance, while the significant improvements in retrieval efficiency receive insufficient attention.
- The effects of hyperparameter K on the results are not adequately addressed, and the novelty of the proposed methods compared to existing techniques is not clearly established.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental design, particularly regarding the training of the LQ-A module and how it interacts with the Redun-A method. Additionally, we suggest providing a more rigorous analysis of the impact of different frame selections on retrieval efficiency. The authors should also address the novelty of their methods in relation to past techniques in the video summarization literature. Lastly, we advise correcting the identified writing errors and enhancing the explanations for the effectiveness of their proposed techniques.
