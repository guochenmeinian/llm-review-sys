### Key Points
This paper presents DemoNSF, a multi-task demonstration-based generative framework designed to address input perturbations in slot-filling tasks within dialogue systems. The authors propose three novel noisy auxiliary tasks—noisy recovery, random mask, and hybrid discrimination—during the pre-training stage to capture semantic structural information of perturbations. Experimental results indicate that DemoNSF significantly outperforms baseline methods, demonstrating strong generalization across various perturbation scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a critical issue of input perturbations in slot-filling tasks.
- It introduces a novel framework, DemoNSF, which enhances performance and generalization.
- The writing is clear, and the experiments are thorough, marking the first comprehensive investigation of diverse input perturbations in generative frameworks.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty appears limited, as improvements could be anticipated from introducing noise during pre-training and fine-tuning.
- The study does not include GPT-style models, which could provide additional insights.
- Important experimental results, such as ablation studies and ChatGPT experiments, are relegated to the appendix.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty by incorporating GPT-style models into their experimental comparisons. Additionally, we suggest moving key experimental results from the appendix to the main paper to enhance the overall clarity and impact of the findings.
