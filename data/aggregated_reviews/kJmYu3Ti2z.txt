Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of when graph-aware models outperform graph-agnostic ones in node classification tasks, focusing on the Contextual Stochastic Block Model for Homophily (CSBM-H). The authors conduct a theoretical analysis using Probabilistic Bayes Error (PBE) and negative generalized Jeffreys divergence to quantify node distinguishability across various representations. The experiments demonstrate that models with more distinguishable representations generally perform better and propose a classifier to predict the performance of graph-aware models based on original and aggregated features.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The theoretical analysis of PBE and Jeffreys divergence is intuitive and clarifies the benefits of different aggregation types across homophily regimes.
- The experiments are well-designed and provide substantial empirical support for the paper's claims.
- The paper addresses a significant topic in the field of GNNs and is well-organized.

Weaknesses:
- The analysis relies on a specific aggregation method (random walk), raising concerns about the generalizability of the conclusions.
- The paper is limited to heterophilous datasets, which may have inherent drawbacks.
- The proposed measure for predicting GNN performance is straightforward and lacks complexity.
- Several sections are difficult to follow, and the overall writing could be improved.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing more detailed explanations in unclear sections, particularly lines 168-172. Additionally, consider addressing the limitations of the study more explicitly. We suggest enhancing the writing style to maintain reader engagement, especially in the initial sections. Clarifying the relationship between Sections 3 and 4 would help delineate their contributions more effectively. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore the implications of using different aggregation methods beyond the random walk approach.
