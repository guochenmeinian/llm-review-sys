Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a game-theoretic framework for representation learning, structured as a three-player game where one player selects the representation parameters, another chooses the downstream task, and the last selects the model parameters based on the reduced inputs. The authors theoretically analyze linear dimensionality reduction under the MSE loss function and propose a greedy algorithm for general cases, supported by empirical evaluations. The findings highlight the utility of randomized representations and the importance of prior knowledge about downstream tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with a clear introduction that effectively outlines the problem and motivations.
- The theoretical results, particularly in the linear case, are precise and provide new insights into PCA-type techniques.
- The iterative greedy algorithm is interesting and potentially practical for practitioners.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation of the proposed framework lacks concrete metrics; comparing performance using exact MSE against conventional representations would clarify advantages.
- The connection between the linear case and the general three-player game is insufficiently demonstrated, particularly regarding convergence of the iterative algorithm.
- The rationale for the three-player setup over a two-player game is unclear, as the focus primarily remains on the regret of one player, neglecting the role of the second player.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation of their framework by including comparisons of exact MSE performance between conventional and proposed representations. Additionally, incorporating experiments with real-world datasets would strengthen the findings. Clarifying the necessity of the three-player game structure and its practical implications would enhance the paper's coherence. Finally, addressing the time complexity of the proposed algorithms and providing more explicit connections between the linear and general cases would be beneficial.
