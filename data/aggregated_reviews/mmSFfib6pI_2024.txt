Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new distance measure, Spherical Convolutional Wasserstein Distance (SCWD), for validating climate models by comparing their outputs to reanalysis data. The authors apply SCWD to evaluate historical outputs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) phases 5 and 6, demonstrating modest improvements in phase 6 models. The methodology is rigorously developed, with a strong mathematical foundation and extensive empirical validation. The paper effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by accounting for spatial variability and local differences in climate variables.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, providing clear explanations and adequate background on the methodology and climate model inter-comparison.  
- The introduction of SCWD is innovative and addresses existing method limitations.  
- The methodology is robust, allowing for effective visualization of differences and extensive validation experiments.  
- The presentation is excellent, with clear motivation and connections to previous work established.

Weaknesses:  
- The methodology, while novel, is a minor extension of existing methods and heavily focused on a specific application, suggesting a more suitable venue would be one primarily focused on climate informatics.  
- Some mathematical derivations, particularly regarding the convolution slicer and kernel functions, could be explained more clearly.  
- The paper lacks exploration of additional experiments on different climate variables and temporal resolutions to enhance generalizability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the mathematical derivations, particularly those related to the convolution slicer and kernel functions. Additionally, we suggest exploring the application of SCWD to other climate variables and different temporal resolutions to strengthen the generalizability of the findings. It may also be beneficial to consider demonstrating the method on a simpler toy problem where the ground truth is better established before applying it to complex reanalysis-vs-model comparisons.
