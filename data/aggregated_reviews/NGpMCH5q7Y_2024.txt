Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new framework (hhk-MARL) that integrates human abstract knowledge with hierarchical reinforcement learning to address challenges in large-scale multi-agent systems. The framework utilizes fuzzy logic to represent human knowledge and employs a graph-based group controller for enhanced agent coordination. Experimental results from the StarCraft Multi-agent Challenge indicate that the proposed approach significantly accelerates training and improves agent performance, even with imperfect human prior knowledge.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
* The hhk-MARL framework effectively integrates human knowledge with hierarchical reinforcement learning, offering a flexible and adaptive solution for multi-agent systems.
* The use of fuzzy logic and hypernetworks allows for dynamic weight generation based on agent observations, facilitating the combination of human and agent preferences.
* Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the framework's efficacy and robustness, showing significant improvements over baseline methods.

Weaknesses:
* The paper lacks detailed comparisons with prior research and thorough explanations of the human knowledge utilized. Section 3.1 does not justify the choice of fuzzy logic over other methods that could also manage uncertainty and abstract knowledge.
* The differences between the proposed method and prior works, such as KoGuN and Shi 2021, are not clearly articulated, which obscures the unique contributions of this work.
* Section 3.2 should more distinctly highlight the novel aspects of using hypernetworks for knowledge integration compared to similar methodologies.
* Appendix A.6 presents suboptimal human knowledge rules without clarity on their determination and limitations, which is crucial for understanding their applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for selecting fuzzy logic in section 3.1 by comparing it with alternative methods like Bayesian networks or neural network-based representations. Additionally, clarifying the distinctions between their approach and prior works such as KoGuN and Shi 2021 will enhance the understanding of their contributions. In section 3.2, the authors should emphasize the innovative elements of using hypernetworks for knowledge integration, differentiating it from existing methodologies like HAMXCS and Hierarchical RL for Self-Driving. Furthermore, a clearer explanation of the suboptimal human knowledge rules in Appendix A.6, including their limitations and adequacy, is necessary for readers unfamiliar with StarCraft.
