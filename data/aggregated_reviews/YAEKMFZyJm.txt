Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents NeMo, a method that identifies and deactivates neurons responsible for memorization in diffusion models (DMs), specifically within U-Net architectures. The authors successfully identified 200 neurons in the first value layer, constituting 62.5% of that layer's total neurons. By deactivating these neurons, the authors aim to prevent the reproduction of sensitive images, enhance output diversity, and mitigate data leakage, thus promoting responsible use of DMs. They empirically evaluate NeMo on the Stable Diffusion model, demonstrating its effectiveness in increasing image diversity while maintaining prompt alignment. The authors argue that memorization is distributed across multiple neurons, asserting that deactivating neurons related to one prompt does not affect others, provided they do not share the same neurons. They emphasize that their findings challenge the notion of a fixed set of neurons responsible for all memorization, highlighting the distinct training objectives of diffusion models compared to supervised learning models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper introduces a novel methodology for localizing memorization within DMs, which has not been previously studied in the context of text-to-image generation.  
2. It effectively identifies a significant proportion of neurons related to memorization in diffusion models.  
3. The authors provide clear explanations of the proposed methodology and present interesting empirical findings regarding memorization neurons.  
4. The writing is clear and well-structured, making the paper easy to follow.  
5. The SSIM-based detection method offers a practical approach for identifying memorized prompts at inference time.  
6. The authors provide a clear distinction between the memorization mechanisms in diffusion models and those in supervised learning.

Weaknesses:  
1. There is insufficient comparison with existing methods, particularly the work referenced as [1], which limits the assessment of NeMo's novelty and effectiveness.  
2. The argument against the existence of a fixed set of memorizing neurons lacks empirical evidence.  
3. The method lacks practical mitigation strategies, as deactivating neurons requires prior knowledge of which neurons are involved in memorization.  
4. The reliance on a benchmark dataset from Wen et al. may limit the generalizability of the findings.  
5. The authors claim that most memorization occurs in the value mappings of cross-attention layers, but they do not demonstrate that these neurons are solely responsible for memorization, leaving open the possibility that other neurons may also contribute.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison of NeMo with existing methods, particularly addressing the novelty in relation to [1]. Additionally, we suggest providing a practical mitigation method that does not rely on prior knowledge of neuron involvement in memorization. A more thorough investigation into the side effects of neuron deactivation would also enhance the paper. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors provide empirical evidence to support their claims regarding the absence of a fixed set of memorizing neurons. Expanding the discussion on the implications of their findings for broader applications beyond the benchmark dataset would strengthen the overall argument. Finally, clarifying the limitations regarding the requirement to observe all memorized prompts and the implications of not identifying a fixed set of neurons would enhance the paper's impact.
