Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for Few-shot Font Generation (FFG) of Chinese characters using Ideographic Description Sequence (IDS) tokens, aiming for style-content disentanglement. The authors propose a VQGAN-based pipeline that utilizes reference font images and target character IDS to autoregressively decode output images as quantized codebook tokens. The results indicate that this method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in one- and few-shot settings, particularly across varying font styles.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The formulation of the problem using IDS is novel and compelling.
- The qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate convincing results, showcasing the method's ability to generate high-quality glyphs.
- The presentation is generally clear, making the paper easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The exposition can be confusing; specific outputs of the network should be shown before assembling them into glyphs.
- The generalizability of the method to other writing systems, such as Roman characters, is questionable and should be addressed.
- The significance of the differences in metrics when ablating components is not convincingly justified, particularly regarding the IHA component.
- The paper lacks clarity on the structure of the IDS encoder and the implications of using multiple equivalent IDSs during training.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the exposition by explicitly showing the network's outputs before glyph assembly. Additionally, the authors should discuss the limitations of generalizing the method to other writing systems in the limitations section. An ablation study should be included to verify the effectiveness of encoding only IDS compared to other modalities. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the structure of the IDS encoder and address how ambiguities in representing character shapes are resolved. Lastly, we suggest expanding the discussion on limitations related to novel font styles that deviate from typical character topologies.
