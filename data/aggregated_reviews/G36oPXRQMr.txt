Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the vulnerabilities of cloud-based email filtering services, demonstrating how attackers can bypass these filters to directly access organizations' mail servers. The authors conducted an empirical evaluation of approximately 1,600 domain configurations, revealing that 80% are susceptible to such attacks. They propose a methodology to identify email service providers and assess the effectiveness of filtering mechanisms, highlighting significant misconfigurations that could facilitate spam and phishing campaigns.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work is well-written and easy to understand, effectively motivating the research and presenting the methodology.
- The empirical findings are valuable, revealing a critical oversight in email filtering configurations across a broad spectrum of services.
- The paper addresses a niche yet significant issue, potentially paving the way for future solutions.

Weaknesses:
- The practical relevance and scalability of the bypass attack remain unclear, as the paper lacks a defined attacker model.
- Ethical concerns arise from the authors' failure to notify affected domain owners directly about vulnerabilities, instead opting to inform filtering services.
- More discussion is needed regarding domains using multiple filtering services and the implications for the integrity of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the attacker model to better evaluate the practical impact of the bypass attack. Additionally, we suggest that the authors notify the vulnerable domain owners directly to address ethical concerns. Expanding the list of domains analyzed to include a wider variety of TLDs and enhancing the crawling methodology would strengthen the study. Finally, consider releasing the testing tool developed for public use to facilitate large-scale testing and further research.
