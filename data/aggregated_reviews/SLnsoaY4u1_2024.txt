Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the 'diffusion plug-and-play' (DPnP) framework, which integrates a proximal consistency sampler and a denoising diffusion sampler to address nonlinear inverse problems. The authors provide theoretical results demonstrating the robustness and performance guarantees of DPnP, supported by numerical experiments showing its effectiveness across various tasks. However, the paper's novelty is questioned due to existing works on similar frameworks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and logically structured, making it easy to follow.
2. The theoretical analysis offers valuable contributions, particularly in addressing robustness to sampling errors.
3. Experimental results indicate that DPnP outperforms the established DPS technique in several metrics.

Weaknesses:
1. The mathematical notation could be improved for clarity, particularly in differentiating scalar and vector quantities.
2. The experimental evaluation lacks depth, particularly in comparing with contemporary solvers and conducting ablation studies on hyperparameters.
3. The novelty of the approach is diminished by the existence of similar methods in the literature, which the authors should clarify.
4. The paper does not adequately address the high computational cost of the proposed technique and lacks a discussion on potential acceleration methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the mathematical notation to enhance readability, particularly by clearly distinguishing scalar from vector quantities. Additionally, we suggest expanding the experimental evaluation to include comparisons with more contemporary solvers, such as ReSample, and conducting in-depth ablation studies on hyperparameters to clarify their impact. It would also be beneficial to discuss the connections between the proximal consistency sampler and existing projection-type approaches, especially for linear inverse problems. Finally, we encourage the authors to address the computational cost of the algorithm and explore ways to optimize it.
