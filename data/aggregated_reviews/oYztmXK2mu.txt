### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method of deep ensemble called SO/SO+, which minimizes a tighter upper bound on Bayesian risk and incorporates a diversity term into the classification loss. The method enhances computational efficiency by computing the network Jacobian to increase variance in weights, allowing ensemble members to operate without communication. The authors propose two optimization strategies: second-order (SO) and randomized second-order (SO+), with the latter avoiding the full Jacobian computation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The formulations and proofs of the theorems are largely accurate, with mostly clear notation.
- Evaluation results on benchmarks are legitimate and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the discussed tasks.
- Extensive experimentation across various datasets and model architectures, with performance comparisons to multiple approaches for inducing diversity in ensembles.

Weaknesses:
- Section 3.4 lacks evidence that the approximate Hessian computation is faster than the precise one, with complexity concerns suggesting it may be equally expensive.
- The tightness of the Hessian approximation is unclear, and there is no comparison with non-ensemble models like WideResNet/LetNet/MLP.
- The paper does not address potential communication savings, a key aspect of the proposed method.
- Clarity issues exist throughout the paper, particularly in the methodology section, with convoluted statements and unclear terminology.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and flow of the methodology section to enhance readability. Specific statements should be clarified, such as the meaning of "biasing the minima" and the implications of the ensemble size increasing quadratically. We suggest including comparisons with non-ensemble architectures and providing a clearer discussion on the computational gains or losses associated with the proposed strategies. Additionally, we advise the authors to refine the proofs and formulations of the main theorem to ensure mathematical rigor and clarity.
