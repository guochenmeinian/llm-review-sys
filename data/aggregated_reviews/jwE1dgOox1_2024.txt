Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents TOPF, a topological feature extraction mechanism for point cloud data, utilizing Vietoris-Rips/$\alpha$ filtrations to compute persistent homology. The authors propose a heuristic for selecting significant features from barcodes, projecting them onto harmonic spaces to construct point-level feature vectors. The methodology employs homology representatives rather than cohomology representatives, computed using the involuted persistent homology algorithm, which, while computationally intensive, offers advantageous properties. The authors argue that potential issues with lifted representatives not being in the kernel of the (co)boundary are rare, supported by empirical evidence. They clarify terminology regarding "parallel simplices" and "generalized holes," detail their parameter selection process for spectral clustering, and apply the methodology to a new topological point cloud clustering benchmark, with experimental results reported on various datasets, including synthetic data and protein atom coordinates.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors leverage Hodge Laplacian and Hodge decomposition for feature vector computation, which is a novel approach.
- The paper is well-structured and comprehensively details prior art alongside the proposed algorithm.
- The introduction of a new benchmark dataset for topological clustering is a valuable contribution.
- The authors provide a clear distinction between homology and cohomology representatives, highlighting the advantages of their approach.
- Empirical analysis supports the reliability of TOPF, with extensive testing on over 3000 homology representatives showing consistent results.
- The inclusion of diverse datasets strengthens the validation of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- Claims regarding existing approaches are overstated, particularly the assertion that they cannot represent higher-order topological information.
- The methodology relies heavily on heuristics, particularly in feature selection and hyperparameter choices, which may lack robustness.
- Experimental evaluation is limited to clustering, primarily focusing on topologically spherical shapes, which restricts the generalizability of the findings.
- The authors acknowledge the need for experiments beyond synthetic datasets to fully establish the method's applicability.
- Some terminology used in the paper was initially imprecise, which could lead to misunderstandings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification of claims regarding existing methodologies, particularly concerning their ability to capture higher-order topological information. Additionally, the authors should clarify the theoretical foundations of Theorem 4.1 and the implications of harmonic representatives taking values in {0, -1, 1}. 

To enhance the robustness of the methodology, we suggest providing a clearer explanation of the feature selection process and the rationale behind hyperparameter choices, particularly the thresholding parameter delta. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to expand the experimental evaluation beyond synthetic datasets to include real-world applications and comparisons with modern machine learning methods, such as graph neural networks. We also recommend improving the clarity of their terminology, particularly regarding "generalized holes," and providing a more detailed explanation of their parameter selection process for spectral clustering to enhance reproducibility.
