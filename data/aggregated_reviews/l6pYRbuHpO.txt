Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of online learning in a contextual setting using feedback graphs, where the learner observes losses from actions in the graph-neighborhood of the chosen action. The authors propose a general framework (Theorem 3.1) that reduces the problem to solving a convex program at each time step, achieving regret rates similar to the non-contextual version. They extend previous work by Foster et al. (2021) and demonstrate that their algorithm outperforms existing methods when side observations are available, particularly in the strongly and weakly observable cases.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem addressed is well-motivated and relevant.
- The regret bounds align with the lower bounds established by Alon et al. (2015), indicating tightness.
- Empirical results support the claim that richer feedback structures enhance regret bounds compared to the bandit case.
- The authors provide detailed results for notable classes of feedback graphs.

Weaknesses:
- The paper appears incremental following the introduction of equation (3), which requires knowledge of the feedback graph, limiting its applicability to informed settings.
- The introductory model suggests time-varying feedback graphs, yet the theoretical results assume deterministic and known graphs.
- The algorithm necessitates knowledge of the feedback graph's independence number, which is challenging to compute.
- The theoretical results for stochastic graphs are not adequately addressed, and the experimental setup lacks clarity regarding the nature of the graphs used.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the relationship between their work and the foundational techniques from Foster et al. (2021), particularly by highlighting the main challenges in deriving their theoretical results. Additionally, we suggest providing more intuition behind the proofs of key theorems and addressing the implications of using stochastic graphs more thoroughly. Finally, it would be beneficial to include a discussion on the adaptive choice of gamma and its impact on regret bounds.
