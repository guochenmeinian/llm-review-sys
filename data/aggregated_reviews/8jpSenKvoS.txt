Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a channel simulation algorithm, PolarSim, based on polar codes, aiming to improve performance in channel simulation. The authors claim that their method scales as \(O(n \log n)\), offering a sub-exponential runtime that does not depend on dithered quantization. The paper includes theoretical results and runtime data demonstrating that PolarSim is significantly faster than existing schemes like GPRS, which have exponential complexity in \(n\). The authors provide a runtime comparison table showing that PolarSim is over 600 times faster than GPRS in specific setups. However, the formulation, proposed solution, and applications may not align with the conference's core focus, suggesting a more suitable fit for information theory venues. The paper also lacks sufficient detail in the experimental setup, particularly in the comparison study, making results difficult to interpret.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors propose a novel method for channel simulation that leverages error correction codes, which could significantly impact the field.
- The theoretical results support the correctness and efficiency of the proposed scheme.
- The performance of PolarSim is impressive, approaching the mutual information lower bound as demonstrated in experiments.
- The paper provides a clear theoretical framework comparing the complexities of different algorithms, highlighting PolarSim's efficiency.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks sufficient detail in the experimental setup, particularly in the comparison study, making results difficult to interpret.
- The focus on polar codes is not well justified, and the scope is limited to symmetric binary-input channels, which restricts applicability.
- Many statements and proofs are incomplete or inaccurate, and the writing requires significant improvements for clarity and rigor.
- The presentation of the paper requires significant improvements, including typographical issues and a need for better organization and rigor.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the description of the experimental setup for the comparison study to enhance replicability. Specifically, include the analytic form of the mutual information in Section 3.2 and provide detailed experimental conditions in the main text and appendices. Additionally, consider discussing practical applications of the proposed scheme and conducting more extensive experiments to demonstrate its usefulness. Clarifying the computational complexity of generating uniform variables \(Z_i\) and providing a rigorous problem formulation would also strengthen the paper. We suggest revising the organization of Section III for better clarity and coherence. Furthermore, we recommend addressing typographical issues and enhancing the overall organization of the content. Including a statement at the start of Section 3 to clarify that the first part provides an intuitive exposition, with formal statements and guarantees following, would help readers locate the rigorous development of ideas more easily. Lastly, we encourage the authors to include the runtime comparison table in Fig. 3 to further support their efficiency claims.
