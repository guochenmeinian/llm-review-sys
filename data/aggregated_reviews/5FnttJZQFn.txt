Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Waymo Open Sim Agents Challenge (WOSAC), aimed at stimulating the design of realistic simulators for evaluating and training behavior models in autonomous driving. It proposes a benchmark and metrics for joint multi-agent motion prediction from a simulation perspective, with a related challenge and leaderboard established at CVPR 2023. The authors provide a comprehensive evaluation framework for autoregressive traffic agents, including analyses of various baseline methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The challenge has already seen participation from multiple teams, indicating community interest.
2. The evaluation framework is well-developed and includes an online leaderboard.
3. The task definition is clear and comprehensive, supported by a solid dataset.

Weaknesses:
1. The metrics may penalize methods that generate diverse futures in favor of accuracy, potentially undermining the evaluation of rare and adversarial cases.
2. The ego-centric data collection may lead to occlusion issues, affecting trajectory completeness and model performance.
3. The paper could benefit from more discussions and comparisons with existing benchmarks in the field.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the benchmark by addressing the potential penalization of diverse future generation, possibly by incorporating metrics that explicitly reward diversity. Additionally, consider revising the data collection approach to mitigate occlusion issues, perhaps by adopting a "god's perspective" for data gathering. It would also be beneficial to provide more detailed discussions on the implications of different scenarios, especially regarding safety-critical aspects, and to enhance the Related Work section with further references on generative model evaluations.
