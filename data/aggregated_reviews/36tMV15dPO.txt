### Key Points
This paper presents X-Ray, a novel 3D sequential representation that encodes a 3D object into surface frames at various layers, facilitating the generation of 3D models from single images. The authors propose a method that utilizes ray casting to capture both visible and hidden surfaces, enabling effective single image-to-3D mesh generation through a video diffusion model. Experimental results indicate that the X-Ray approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D generation tasks, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for addressing the challenge of reconstructing complete 3D models from single images is compelling and timely.
- The use of ray casting to encode interior mesh details is a novel approach that enhances the method's effectiveness.
- The experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods, with a focus on both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.
- The writing is clear, and the design choices are well articulated.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks sufficient evidence to support the claim that general, accurate, and efficient 3D representations are essential for 3D generation.
- The ablation study is inadequate; further analysis on X-Ray frames and the impact of frame complexity is necessary.
- The novelty of the X-Ray representation is not convincingly established, with insufficient differentiation from existing techniques like depth peeling and multi-plane images.
- Limitations regarding the number of intersection points and their impact on encoding complex shapes are not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by providing a clear citation or evidence to support the necessity of general, accurate, and efficient 3D representations. Additionally, conducting a more comprehensive ablation study on X-Ray frames, including the effects of video or image diffusion techniques, would strengthen the findings. The authors should also clarify the differences between the X-Ray representation and existing methods, particularly in relation to depth peeling and multi-plane images, and provide a quantitative analysis of the efficiency of X-Ray compared to voxel grids and point clouds. Finally, expanding the evaluation metrics to include generative quality assessments and visualizations of generated shapes would enhance the paper's contributions.
