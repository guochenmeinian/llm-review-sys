Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Convolution Neural Operator (CNO) framework built on a UNet-like architecture for learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs). The authors assert that their architecture maintains a Continuous-Discrete Equivalence (CDE) property while providing universal approximation proofs. They benchmark their method against existing approaches, demonstrating superior performance across various PDEs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper builds on a substantial body of work in operator learning, emphasizing the significance of architectures that respect CDE.
- The presentation is generally clear, and the writing is well-structured.
- The proposed CNO architecture enhances performance across a comprehensive suite of problems and appropriate baselines.
- The inclusion of numerous evaluations and ablation studies in the appendix adds depth to the analysis.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty is somewhat diminished as the building blocks of the CNO architecture have been previously introduced in earlier works.
- Many definitions are derived from a recent preprint, which may limit accessibility.
- The additional up-sampling and down-sampling layers in the UNet architecture significantly increase training time and complexity compared to other methods.
- The evaluation across resolutions is unclear and potentially misleading, particularly regarding the representation of high-frequency details in the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the evaluation across resolutions, particularly by replacing figure 2 with results from other cases in the appendix that better represent high-frequency details. Additionally, we suggest providing a detailed discussion on the performance impact of the CNO compared to the regular UNet, including computational requirements such as memory and training time. It would also be beneficial to clarify the implications of using windowed-sinc filters on the CDE property in practical implementations. Finally, we encourage the authors to address the limitations of their benchmarking approach, considering the unique characteristics of different PDEs.
