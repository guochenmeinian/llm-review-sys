### Key Points
This paper presents a two-pass decoding method utilizing an mT5 model for direct translation between related languages. The authors first split a source sentence into chunks for independent translation, followed by a second round where these chunks are concatenated with neighboring chunks as context, and the previous translations are reused as target context for a text in-filling task. The experiments demonstrate that this method outperforms previous prompting techniques, particularly for longer sentences and low-resource languages, by enabling direct translation without relying on English.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The two-pass decoding method is innovative, leveraging independent chunk translation and contextual translation effectively.
- The proposed method shows improved translation performance over existing prompting methods across various language pairs.
- The approach may inspire future research on translation for non-English or low-resource languages.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks sufficient experiments to validate the necessity of the two-round decoding process, particularly comparing the performance of the first and second rounds.
- The effectiveness of few-shot prompting is not adequately explored, raising questions about the necessity of the first stage.
- The method's complexity and inefficiency due to multiple inference calls in the contextual translation stage are concerning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental design by including comparisons of translation performance between the first and second decoding rounds to clarify the necessity of the two-pass approach. Additionally, the authors should explore the impact of few-shot prompting in zero-shot scenarios to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of their method. Addressing the efficiency of the contextual translation stage and considering alternative chunking strategies that maintain semantic integrity could enhance the overall effectiveness of the proposed framework. Lastly, we suggest incorporating recent relevant literature to strengthen the paper's foundation and context.
