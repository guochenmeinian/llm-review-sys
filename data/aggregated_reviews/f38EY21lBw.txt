Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel scheme for auditing differentially private machine learning systems using a single training run, significantly enhancing computational efficiency compared to traditional methods that require hundreds of training rounds. The authors propose a method that involves randomly selecting data points for inclusion or exclusion during the training process, allowing the auditor to infer membership status based on the algorithm's output. The theoretical contribution includes a rigorous analysis that establishes tight bounds on privacy guarantees, supported by experimental results auditing DP-SGD training on a WideResNet model with the CIFAR10 dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces the first one-round privacy auditing scheme, offering a fresh perspective in the field.
- The theoretical foundation is robust, particularly Theorem 3.1, which connects privacy auditing with statistical inference.
- Experimental results convincingly validate the authors' claims regarding the method's effectiveness.
- The writing is clear and insightful, enhancing the reader's understanding of the topic.
- The work is likely to inspire future research in differential privacy auditing.

Weaknesses:
- Some reviewers noted a lack of clarity in comparing the proposed method to existing auditing techniques, particularly regarding practical applications and performance in black box settings.
- The organization of the experimental section could be improved for better comprehension.
- Certain parts of the writing, especially in the limitations discussion, were considered too dense.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of comparisons with existing auditing methods, particularly addressing how their results stack up against those from recent works. Additionally, restructuring the experimental section to provide a clearer overview at the beginning would enhance readability. Finally, we encourage the authors to revise the denser sections of the writing, particularly in the limitations discussion, to facilitate better understanding.
