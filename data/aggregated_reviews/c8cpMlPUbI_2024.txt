### Key Points
This paper presents a two-stage learning method for sequential decision-making, leveraging offline expert demonstrations to address the issue of unobserved contextual information. The authors propose using expert data to establish a prior distribution, followed by online reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance learning efficiency. The approach combines imitation learning with model-based RL, focusing on the heterogeneity between the contexts of the expert and the online agent.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem setting is significant, addressing the challenge of utilizing offline expert demonstrations for online decision-making.
- The proposed method is conceptually clear, combining imitation learning with online RL while considering context heterogeneity.
- Theoretical and empirical justifications are provided, with simulations supporting the proposed approach.

Weaknesses:
- The empirical evaluation is limited to simple domains, lacking discussion on the absence of more complex environments, which raises questions about scalability.
- The comparison to ExPLORe is unclear; it would benefit from using the same actor-critic algorithm to clarify differences.
- The paper does not sufficiently discuss related work, particularly ADVISOR, and its performance in high-dimensional domains.
- Notation and terminology can be confusing, with specific issues noted regarding the q-function definition and the use of "parametric" versus "non-parametric."
- Some figures require clearer explanations, including axis definitions and annotations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical evaluation by including more complex environments to demonstrate the method's scalability. Additionally, clarify the comparison with ExPLORe by employing a consistent actor-critic algorithm. The authors should also discuss the differences with ADVISOR more thoroughly, particularly regarding performance in high-dimensional settings. To enhance clarity, we suggest revising the notation and terminology sections, ensuring all definitions are complete and unambiguous. Finally, provide explicit explanations in figure captions and ensure that all annotations are accurate and informative.
