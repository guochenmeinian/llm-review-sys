Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents "PointAD: Comprehending 3D Anomalies from Points and Pixels for Zero-shot 3D Anomaly Detection," a novel framework that leverages both point clouds and RGB images for zero-shot 3D anomaly detection. The authors propose a hybrid representation learning approach that utilizes the generalization capabilities of CLIP, rendering 3D anomalies into multiple 2D views and projecting them back into 3D space. This method captures generic anomaly semantics across unseen 3D objects and optimizes learnable text prompts using auxiliary point clouds.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The integration of CLIP for 3D anomaly detection and the hybrid representation learning approach are innovative contributions.
2. The theoretical foundations are solid, supported by comprehensive empirical validation.
3. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with effective visual aids enhancing understanding.
4. The approach addresses a significant gap in the field, with potential implications for future research and applications.

Weaknesses:
1. The method's sensitivity to rendering angles and the number of views requires further exploration.
2. While experimental results are strong, additional validation on more diverse datasets would bolster claims.
3. The discussion on limitations and future work could be more extensive to provide a fuller perspective on the method's applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the exploration of the sensitivity to rendering angles and the impact of varying the number of views on detection performance. Additionally, validating the method under different environmental conditions, such as varying lighting and occlusions, would enhance robustness. We suggest including comparisons with existing zero-shot anomaly detection methods, particularly focusing on technical differences rather than just data differences. Finally, enhancing the clarity of figure overlays to ensure all components are self-explanatory would improve reader comprehension.
