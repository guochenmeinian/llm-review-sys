Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of repeated auctions where agents utilize no-regret learning algorithms, particularly focusing on the Multiplicative Weights Update (MWU) algorithm. The authors extend previous findings on second-price auctions to all deterministic auctions, revealing that the runner-up bidder may not converge to truthful bidding based on their learning rates. They demonstrate that randomized auctions can yield better revenue guarantees than second-price auctions with reserves. Additionally, the concept of auctioneer regret is introduced, measuring revenue guarantees in learning agent settings compared to truthful bidding.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The results regarding bidding convergence and auction revenue in the context of learning algorithms are significant.
2. The introduction of auctioneer regret as a metric for analyzing revenue guarantees is both interesting and innovative.
3. The paper provides clear and concrete theoretical proofs.

Weaknesses:
1. The focus on MWU as the sole learning algorithm limits the generalizability of the results; a broader exploration of other learning algorithms would enhance the findings.
2. The assumption of persistent values for bidders is strong, making the results in Sections 4 and 5 relatively straightforward and less impactful compared to more complex settings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generality of their results by considering a wider range of learning algorithms beyond MWU. Additionally, addressing the persistent value assumption and exploring scenarios with independent valuations would strengthen the paper's contribution. We also suggest clarifying the claim regarding the runner-up bidder's convergence to truthful bidding, ensuring it accurately reflects the conditions under which it holds. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the black-box transformation from incentive-compatible auctions to strictly incentive-compatible auctions in Section 4 and to provide formal definitions and proofs for key results to enhance clarity and rigor.
