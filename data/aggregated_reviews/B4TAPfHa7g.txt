Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Constrained Proximal Policy Optimization (CPPO) for solving constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) problems. The authors propose a first-order feasible region method that simplifies the optimization process by avoiding dual variables and second-order techniques. The method is evaluated across various environments, demonstrating comparable or superior performance to baseline methods, although a direct comparison with CVPO is lacking.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed CPPO method is computationally efficient and simplifies the policy optimization process.
- The recovery update method enhances constraint satisfaction performance.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of CPPO is questioned, as it closely resembles CVPO with only incremental modifications.
- The paper lacks a thorough theoretical analysis and empirical comparisons, particularly against CVPO.
- Several imprecise statements and unclear mathematical formulations hinder the clarity and rigor of the presentation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature survey to include relevant works such as Borkar (2005) and Bhatnagar (2010) to provide context for their contributions. Additionally, we suggest providing a convergence analysis for their algorithm, as seen in previous literature. The authors should clarify ambiguous statements, particularly in Proposition 3.1 and Assumption 3.5, to ensure precision. Furthermore, enhancing the clarity of definitions and notations, especially in the context of Q-values and policy updates, would benefit reader comprehension. Finally, we encourage the authors to include a direct comparison with CVPO in terms of computational complexity and performance metrics to substantiate the claimed improvements.
