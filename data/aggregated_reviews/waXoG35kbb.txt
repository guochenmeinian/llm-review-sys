Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an exponential family where the sufficient statistic \( T(x) \) includes all non-constant monomials of degree \( \leq d \), with a background density \( h(x) = \exp(-\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^{d+1}) \) and a parameter \( \theta \) constrained by an infinity norm bounded by \( B \). The authors demonstrate that finding the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is NP-hard, implying that computing the MLE requires exponential time in the random vector dimension \( n \), unless \( \mathsf{NP} = \mathsf{RP} \). They also establish that both the MLE and score matching exhibit asymptotic sample efficiency of \( (nB)^{O(d^3)} \), but score matching can be solved in polynomial time in \( n \) when \( d \) is constant, due to its convex objective in \( \theta \).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Clear contribution to the understanding of score matching versus MLE.
- Relevant related work is discussed thoroughly.
- Significant result demonstrating the computational advantages of score matching.

Weaknesses:
- The paper is somewhat difficult to follow, particularly in connecting the mathematical statements; for instance, the relationship between Lemmas 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 was unclear on initial reading.
- Lack of numerical experiments to support theoretical claims.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the mathematical exposition, particularly in connecting theorems and lemmas to enhance readability. Additionally, including numerical experiments would provide practical insights into the trade-offs between score matching and MLE, addressing the computational efficiency and statistical performance in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, clarifying the necessity of excluding nonzero constants from the sufficient statistics and exploring simpler estimators that might be both computationally and statistically efficient would strengthen the paper.
