Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel gradient coding (GC) protocol aimed at improving distributed learning systems by addressing the inefficiencies caused by stragglersâ€”workers that are slower or fail to complete tasks. The authors propose new approaches that utilize the partial work of these stragglers, enhancing both computation and communication efficiency while ensuring numerical stability. They claim that their algorithm is approximately twice as fast in exact gradient reconstruction and significantly reduces mean-squared-error (MSE) in approximate gradient reconstruction.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed GC idea is novel, particularly in its approach to distributed gradient encoding.
- The mathematical formulations appear correct, and the example in Section 2.2 enhances readability.
- The study addresses a relevant and increasingly important topic in machine learning.

Weaknesses:
- The writing lacks clarity, making it difficult to follow, despite the helpful example.
- There is insufficient comparison with baseline methods, leaving unclear how the proposed algorithm performs against simpler alternatives.
- The approach does not adequately consider the error rates of workers, which is crucial for assessing the algorithm's optimality.
- The overall presentation could be improved for better readability and understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing to enhance readability. Specifically, consider providing the illustrative example before detailing the algorithm to guide the reader through the proposed steps. Additionally, we suggest including a more comprehensive comparison with baseline methods, particularly addressing how the proposed algorithm performs in terms of memory, computation, and communication. It would also be beneficial to analyze the algorithm's performance under varying failure rates of workers and to clarify how data chunks processed by multiple workers are handled. Finally, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the measures taken to ensure numerical stability and to include empirical results from realistic scenarios to strengthen the paper's practical relevance.
