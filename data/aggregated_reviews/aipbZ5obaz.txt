### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for comparing politeness knowledge in language models (LMs) across four languages: English, Spanish, Chinese, and Japanese. The authors propose a two-step approach to create multilingual lexica and aggregate features into appropriate lexical categories, contributing to a multilingual politeness dataset. The study reveals insights into politeness variations influenced by cultural differences, enhancing the explainability of LMs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Well-motivated and clear writing.
- Simple yet effective framework applicable to other style lexicons.
- Provides a detailed insight into politeness in multilingual LLMs.
- Release of code and a large, open-access multilingual politeness dataset.

Weaknesses:
- Experiments could be more extensive.
- Low inter-annotator agreement (Fleissâ€™ kappa = 0.153) raises concerns about annotation quality.
- The introduction is lengthy and lacks focus.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the coherence across sections by using a simple storyline to enhance reader understanding. Additionally, we urge the authors to address the inherent bias and errors that may arise during the lexicon expansion and filtering process. It would also be beneficial to shorten the introduction, focusing on motivation, challenges, and contributions. Lastly, we suggest rephrasing the paper title to better reflect its specific focus on politeness dimensions, and consider condensing the paper's content to align with the contributions made.
