Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ESPL, a meta-RL method for generating explainable symbolic policies through a differentiable framework that utilizes a symbolic network and a path selector for compact policy formulation. The authors claim that ESPL achieves good average performance and interpretable symbolic policies across various RL environments, leveraging a single RL loop for efficient data utilization from interactions with the environment. The paper aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of their method compared to the state-of-the-art DSP baseline, emphasizing the novelty in their framework's design and training algorithm. However, the paper faces scrutiny regarding its novelty and theoretical analysis, particularly in comparison to existing methods like DSP.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of symbolic and neural structures in ESPL is noted as a novel aspect.
- The method demonstrates promising results in multiple RL environments, showcasing good average performance and sample efficiency.
- The architecture is innovative, employing a probabilistic mask for sparsity and compactness in symbolic expressions.
- The proposed method efficiently leverages data from the environment through a single RL loop, enhancing performance.
- The authors provide a comprehensive comparison with the DSP baseline, demonstrating superior results in various environments.
- The paper includes a detailed discussion of the symbolic operators and their arrangement, contributing to the understanding of the framework.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed symbolic policies are criticized for being messy and not significantly improving interpretability.
- The novelty of the approach is questioned, with some reviewers suggesting it applies existing methods to new domains rather than presenting significant advancements.
- There is a lack of theoretical analysis and comparisons with guaranteed optimal policies in environments like CartPole.
- The interpretability of the method is not superior, leading to suggestions for removing certain tables that do not enhance the paper's goals.
- The evaluation procedure lacks clarity and may not sufficiently justify the experimental design.
- The paper does not adequately address limitations or explore more complex environments, raising questions about the generalizability of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and interpretability of the symbolic policies, as the current representations appear noisy. Additionally, we suggest incorporating theoretical analysis to substantiate claims of interpretability and comparing ESPL's performance against established optimal policies. It would be beneficial to conduct experiments in more complex environments with rich semantics, such as Minecraft, to demonstrate the method's applicability beyond low-dimensional control tasks. Furthermore, we advise revising the title to accurately reflect the contributions of the paper and to avoid overclaiming novelty in interpretability. We also recommend improving the clarity and detail of the evaluation procedure, ensuring it aligns with the tasks' needs, and providing a more thorough discussion of the novelty of the approach. Lastly, consider removing Table 1 if it does not contribute to the interpretability claims and ensure that the paper cites related works comprehensively to strengthen the context of the research.
