Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the quality of posterior likelihood based on coreset, quantified through KL divergence between posterior likelihoods derived from coreset and full data. The authors provide new lower and upper asymptotic bounds on KL divergence under milder assumptions than previously used, contributing to the approximation theory of Bayesian coresets. The results are applied to analyze the performance of various coreset construction algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The Bayesian coreset approach is interesting and well-studied, providing important insights into asymptotic performance.  
- The paper is well-written, with clear structure and good intuition about the theorems, facilitating understanding even for less technical readers.  
- The main technical results are clearly presented, addressing gaps in the analysis of Bayesian coreset methods, particularly regarding the poor performance of importance sampling-based construction methods.  

Weaknesses:  
- The tightness of the upper and lower bounds is unclear, raising questions about their practical applications.  
- There is insufficient experimental evidence to support the theoretical results, and the examples used are relatively simple.  
- Some statements in the text appear overly strong and lack necessary proof, which could mislead readers about the applicability of coreset methods in large-scale data problems.  
- Notation used around measures is somewhat confusing and unorthodox, which may hinder comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the gaps between the upper and lower bounds of KL divergence, potentially providing examples to illustrate their relationship. Additionally, we suggest including more complex empirical examples to validate the theoretical results. The authors should also consider refining overly strong claims and providing proofs to support them. Clarifying the notation used, particularly around measures, would enhance readability. Finally, we encourage the authors to discuss the applicability of their theories in misspecified regimes and to define notations such as $\Omega_p$ and $\omega_p$ for better understanding.
