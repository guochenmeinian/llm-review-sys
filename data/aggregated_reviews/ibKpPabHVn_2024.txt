Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a deep-learning-based method for "knockoff"-based feature selection, introducing a new optimization problem with a four-part loss. The method is evaluated on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world data, demonstrating comparable or improved performance over existing baselines. The authors propose DeepDRK, which aims to generate knockoff features that satisfy the strong swap property while addressing the challenge of reconstructability in complex covariate distributions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a fundamental problem in the model-X knockoff framework, focusing on the construction of valid and high-quality knockoffs, which is crucial for the method's applicability.  
- Extensive numerical simulations and real-data examples show that the proposed method exhibits satisfactory performance, particularly in complex covariate distributions and small sample sizes.  
- The ablation study clarifies the benefits of various algorithmic choices, enhancing understanding of the method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:  
- The motivation for the problem is unclear, lacking a compelling rationale for the importance of knockoffs.  
- The paper's organization is confusing, failing to clearly articulate the problem and how the proposed method addresses it.  
- The theoretical foundation is weak, relying heavily on empirical results and heuristics without sufficient theoretical justification for the chosen loss functions and optimization strategies.  
- The presentation of results is disorganized, making it difficult for readers to grasp the significance of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation section by clearly articulating the relevance of knockoff methods in feature selection. Additionally, the authors should clarify the definitions of key terms, such as "reconstructability," and ensure that fundamental concepts like FDR are defined in the main text rather than relegated to the appendix. The organization of the paper should be enhanced to clearly answer the questions of what the problem is and how the proposed method addresses it. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors provide a more robust theoretical justification for their choice of loss functions and clarify the process for selecting hyperparameters, particularly the alpha parameter, to avoid potential overfitting. Lastly, presenting results in a more coherent manner, such as through 2D FDR vs. Power scatter plots, would facilitate better comparisons among methods.
