### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework, SearChain, aimed at enhancing the interaction between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Information Retrieval (IR) systems for question answering. The approach involves generating a query chain through LLMs, which includes IR subqueries and their answers, with unresolved subquestions marked. An IR engine verifies or provides information for these unresolved queries, allowing the LLM to regenerate a new query plan iteratively. The results indicate that SearChain outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on complex knowledge-intensive tasks, improving accuracy, credibility, and traceability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The innovative integration of IR and LLMs at the chain level significantly enhances reasoning capabilities.
- Comprehensive experimental design demonstrates SearChain's superiority over existing methods across multiple metrics.
- Detailed case studies illustrate the workflow and effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Weaknesses:
- The innovation is somewhat limited, as SearChain relies on previous retrieval methods, and some claims may be overhyped.
- The evaluation of query generation lacks depth, particularly regarding segmentation in terms of quantity and difficulty.
- Increased complexity in problem-solving may raise efficiency concerns compared to traditional methods.
- The paper does not adequately address scenarios where both LLM and IR outputs are inconclusive.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions by reducing references to previous approaches and focusing on the unique aspects of their work. It would be beneficial to discuss the limitations of SearChain, particularly regarding the cost of multiple LLM calls and scenarios where results may be suboptimal. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed analysis of the efficiency of the proposed method compared to traditional LLMs with IR integration. Clarifying the evaluation of the "[Unsolved query]" tagging process and exploring the framework's performance with various IR systems would also enhance the paper. Finally, addressing the questions regarding the generalizability of the framework and the statistical significance of the results would strengthen the overall presentation.
