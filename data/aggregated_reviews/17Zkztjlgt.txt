Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CaST, a novel framework aimed at addressing challenges in Spatio-Temporal Graph (STG) forecasting, particularly focusing on temporal out-of-distribution issues and dynamic spatial causation. The authors construct a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to uncover causal mechanisms, utilizing back-door and front-door adjustments to mitigate confounding biases. The framework employs the Hodge-Laplacian operator for edge-level convolution, capturing the ripple effect of causation across space and time. Empirical results demonstrate that CaST outperforms existing methods while maintaining interpretability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The novel design of CaST effectively addresses limitations in current STGNN models.
- The paper provides thorough quantitative and qualitative analyses, including extensive experiments that validate the model's superiority.
- The authors offer a clear interpretation of temporal and spatial confounders, making the application of adjustments well-motivated.

Weaknesses:
- The numerous design decisions complicate the validation of individual components' contributions to model performance.
- The paper lacks a clear explanation of the connection between backdoor adjustment and temporal disentanglement, raising doubts about the effectiveness of the temporal disentanglement module.
- Insufficient ablation studies and complexity analysis hinder a comprehensive understanding of the model's components and their interactions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the connection between estimating \( p(Y|do(X)) \) via backdoor adjustment and temporal disentanglement. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed discussion on the assumptions made regarding the independence of spatial and temporal environments. The authors should also enhance the ablation studies to include analyses on loss functions corresponding to the disentanglers and clarify the implications of using the Hodge-Laplacian operator. Finally, we advise including comparisons with other established methods in the literature to strengthen the paper's contributions.
