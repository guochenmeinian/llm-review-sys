### Key Points
This paper presents a new loss function for training deep learning classifiers in the Learning under Label Proportions (LLP) setup, supported by a PAC learnability theorem. The authors propose a weighted combination of a modified total variation distance and self-supervised contrastive loss, demonstrating its effectiveness through experiments on five text classification datasets. While the paper provides theoretical justification and an extensive parameter analysis, it lacks specificity regarding its NLP applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposal of a new loss function for LLP with theoretical backing.
- Good experimental results and a simple ablation study.
- The paper is relatively clearly written and explores an interesting application of LLP.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for the approach is unclear, particularly regarding the necessity of the claimed properties of the loss function.
- The experimental setups utilize small bag sizes (16/32), which may not reflect practical scenarios.
- Missing details in the experimental design, such as cross-validation and parameter tuning methods.
- The relevance of the theoretical foundations to the main topic is not fully established.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for their approach by providing citations and discussions on the necessity of the claimed properties of the loss function. Additionally, the authors should consider using larger bag sizes in their experiments to better reflect practical applications. Clarifying the experimental setup, including details on cross-validation and parameter tuning, is essential. Furthermore, addressing the unclear relationship between LLP and weak supervision, as well as providing significance testing for the results, would strengthen the paper. Lastly, improving the clarity of writing, particularly in defining key terms and metrics, will enhance the paper's accessibility.
