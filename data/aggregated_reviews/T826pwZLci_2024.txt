Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on online prediction from experts (OPE) under differential privacy (DP) constraints in a federated setting. The authors propose a protocol for differentially private OPE (DP-OPE) that operates over multiple rounds, selecting experts based on previous adversarial observations. The work introduces Fed-DP-OPE, which achieves a $\sqrt{m}$ multiplicative regret reduction in a stochastic adversary setting and demonstrates logarithmic communication costs. The authors also analyze the limitations of federated learning under oblivious adversaries, showing that improvements are possible with certain relaxations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is clearly written, with significant contributions that demonstrate how federated collaboration can enhance accuracy under privacy constraints without incurring high communication costs.  
- The $\sqrt{m}$ speedup is noteworthy, and the relaxation of the oblivious adversary is a realistic consideration.  
- The authors propose novel techniques for reducing communication and regret, alongside a new proof technique for lower bounds.  
- The theoretical analysis is rigorous, and the empirical results are reproducible.

Weaknesses:  
- The motivation for the problem could be better articulated, particularly regarding the implications of accurate OPE.  
- The concept of DP in the online setting needs clarification, especially the relationship between loss functions and sensitive data.  
- The experimental study is limited, lacking real-world dataset evaluations and broader applicability discussions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by better motivating the implications of accurate OPE. Additionally, clarifying the link between sensitive data and the notion of neighboring input would enhance understanding. We suggest extending the experimental study to include more datasets and ablation studies to strengthen the paper's contributions. Furthermore, providing specific potential applications of the proposed algorithms would clarify their practical relevance.
