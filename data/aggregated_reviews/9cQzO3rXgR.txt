Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the MagDM framework, which connects diffusion maps (DM) and the magnetic transform (MT) to address the asymmetric kernel case in diffusion representation. The authors propose a method to convert asymmetric matrices into Hermitian ones, facilitating the use of standard techniques like eigen-decomposition. Experimental results indicate that MagDM outperforms existing dimension reduction techniques, demonstrating its effectiveness in separating clusters in asymmetric data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The presentation is clear and easy to follow.
- The discussion on the scaling parameter selection is helpful for implementation.
- Experimental validations support the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- Concerns about novelty and theoretical justification arise, as previous works have explored similar magnetic transforms, questioning the originality of the approach.
- The paper lacks clarity regarding the significance of the parameter $t$ and the role of diffusion, with experiments not adequately demonstrating how $t$ influences results.
- The absence of quantitative results limits the ability to assess the advantages of MagDM over existing techniques.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical justification of the magnetic transform by clearly distinguishing their approach from previous works, particularly in relation to the connection Laplacian. A comparison with the paper by Singer and Wu should be included. Additionally, the authors should clarify the importance of the parameter $t$ in their experiments and provide quantitative evaluations to substantiate the claims regarding the performance of MagDM. Finally, enhancing the geometric interpretation of diffusion distances would further clarify the framework's significance.
