### Key Points
This paper presents a machine learning-based ad blocker that utilizes 27 features and employs various boosting algorithms. The authors conduct a longitudinal study over six months, demonstrating solid comparisons with three state-of-the-art works, yielding favorable results. The approach is noted for being lightweight while outperforming existing ML-based ad blockers in effectiveness and computational efficiency. However, the novelty of the work is questioned due to the established nature of the problem and the absence of newer ML techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a highly relevant topic and demonstrates practical improvements in ad blocking.
- The longitudinal study provides valuable insights into feature drift and performance stability.
- Clear presentation and a commitment to user privacy are commendable.

Weaknesses:
- Claims are sometimes stronger than the evidence provided, particularly regarding the robustness of the ML model compared to traditional methods.
- The evaluation lacks comparisons with non-ML ad blockers, limiting the assessment of practical efficacy.
- Insufficient detail on the development and selection of new features raises concerns about their systematic identification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the substantiation of claims regarding user privacy and the effectiveness of automated filter rule generation. Providing evidence for statements about the model's robustness and the impact of obfuscation-related features would enhance credibility. Additionally, we suggest a more detailed explanation of the feature development process and a comprehensive evaluation against traditional ad blockers, such as uBlock Origin, to clarify the practical implications of their approach. Addressing the impact of false positives and the latency of the entire page load would also strengthen the paper's findings.
