Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to address the long-tailed classification problem through data augmentation, specifically by mixing backgrounds from majority classes with foregrounds from minority classes. The authors propose an optimal transport-based image-mixing (OTmix) method that incorporates class-level and sample-level information to enhance performance on imbalanced datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OTmix outperforms existing methods, including augmentation-based and cost-sensitive approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper identifies a critical issue with previous mixup-based methods, proposing a sound solution that enhances semantic alignment.
- The writing is coherent and the methodology is easy to follow.
- The proposed method can be integrated as a plug-in module with existing long-tailed methods.
- Empirical evaluations validate the effectiveness of OTmix across various datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The performance improvement on RIDE compared to CMO is limited, indicating a constrained contribution.
- The technical advancements are largely incremental, relying on established image-mixing techniques.
- The rationale for using the confusion matrix to learn class-level information is insufficiently explained, complicating reader comprehension.
- There is a lack of visualization for semantically similar pairs, which is crucial for understanding the method's effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the rationale behind leveraging the confusion matrix for class-level information, as this will enhance reader understanding. Additionally, including baseline comparisons with established methods like Focal Loss and Class-Balanced Loss would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of OTmix. We also suggest visualizing some pair results to illustrate the effectiveness of finding semantically similar pairs. Furthermore, conducting ablation studies on hyperparameter sensitivity and exploring the impact of patch size on classification performance would strengthen the analysis. Lastly, a discussion of the limitations and potential failure modes of the method should be included to provide a balanced view of its applicability.
