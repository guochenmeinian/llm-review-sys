Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Stable Control Representations (SCR), a method that extracts representations from a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model for learning downstream robotics control policies. The authors investigate how to extract features from the model by addressing three questions: which layers, which diffusion timestep, and which text prompts enhance downstream task performance. They evaluate SCR on various robotics tasks, including manipulation and navigation, demonstrating competitive performance compared to existing baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a novel approach to using diffusion models for robotic control tasks, marking a significant contribution to the field.
2. Extensive ablation studies validate the design choices, and the paper is well-structured and easy to follow.
3. The method's ability to handle complex environments suggests potential for broader applications.

Weaknesses:
1. The connection between the diffusion mechanism and the proposed method appears loose, particularly as the best performance is achieved with timestep=0, questioning the necessity of using diffusion models.
2. The paper lacks real-world validation, which would enhance the credibility of SCR.
3. The theoretical analysis explaining why diffusion-based representations outperform other methods is insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical backing of their claims regarding SCR's effectiveness compared to other baselines. Additionally, conducting real-world validation of SCR would significantly enhance its practical applicability. We also suggest that the authors clarify the connection between the diffusion process and the performance of SCR, particularly in relation to the optimal noising timestep selection across different tasks. Lastly, addressing the performance gap between SCR-FT and R3M in specific scenarios would provide valuable insights into the method's generalizability.
