### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative solution to address polysemy within CLIP's embedding space by proposing a novel approach that decomposes CLIP embeddings into distinct subspaces, each representing a specific part of speech. This technique facilitates the isolation of different parts of speech within sentences, enhancing manipulation in downstream tasks. The authors provide a closed-form solution for projecting CLIP representations into these subspaces, demonstrating its effectiveness qualitatively in text-to-image generation and quantitatively through zero-shot classification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces a novel approach to decompose the embedding space of CLIP, supported by compelling theoretical analysis and experimental results that effectively disentangle properties related to different parts of speech.  
- The closed-form solution allows direct application to CLIP-based models without additional training, and qualitative results indicate effectiveness in certain examples.  
- The work is well-structured, clearly motivated, and presents a principled approach to handling the non-Euclidean nature of CLIP embeddings.

Weaknesses:  
- The exploration of subspace decomposition primarily addresses polysemy related to part of speech, yet some instances of polysemy cannot be disambiguated solely based on this criterion.  
- The paper lacks comparisons to recent works on diffusion generation that control content and appearance, limiting its contribution.  
- The role of subspaces in quantitative results is unclear, and qualitative examples do not guarantee preservation of the original image's style. Additionally, the visualization for lambda selection is unclear, complicating the assessment of point cloud distributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the role of subspaces in quantitative results and provide additional experiments demonstrating the impact of ignoring the geometry-aware formulation on downstream task performance. It would also be beneficial to include comparisons with recent diffusion-based works on guided generation to contextualize the contributions of this paper. Furthermore, we suggest enhancing the visualization of lambda selection to better illustrate the spread of point clouds and addressing the preservation of underlying styles in generated images when manipulating subspaces.
