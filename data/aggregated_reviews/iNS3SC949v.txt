Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a multi-instance learning (MIL) approach that utilizes a smoothing operator to enhance localization and classification by leveraging spatial dependencies among training samples. The authors propose a novel smoothness mechanism to integrate local and global interactions, supported by theoretical foundations and empirical evaluations across three datasets. Their method reportedly outperforms existing techniques, with detailed ablation studies reinforcing their claims.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The writing is concise, and the contributions are clearly articulated. The proposed smoothness mechanism is an interesting concept that effectively integrates local and global information. The paper includes both quantitative and qualitative experiments, such as attention maps, which illustrate the model's focus on different regions within a slide.

Weaknesses:  
Three major concerns arise:  
1. The inconsistency in encoder selection across datasets lacks justification. The authors should either standardize the encoder or include additional encoders like ViT or Swin to enhance generality.  
2. The paper does not adequately compare against established graph-based methodologies in the MIL literature, which could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of their approach.  
3. The authors should address the lack of comparison with recent MIL methods that utilize pseudo-labeling for instance localization, as these are closely related to their work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the consistency of encoder usage across datasets, potentially by using the same encoder or adding a transformer-based backbone. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with standard graph-based MIL methods and recent pseudo-labeling techniques to strengthen the evaluation. Clarifying the relationship between the smoothness operator and its impact on both classification and localization tasks is essential, as is addressing the potential for over-smoothing in the attention maps. Lastly, providing qualitative insights into the effects of the alpha parameter on attention maps would enhance the reader's understanding.
