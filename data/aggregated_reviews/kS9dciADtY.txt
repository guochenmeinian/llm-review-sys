Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Ti-FAD framework for zero-shot temporal action detection (ZSTAD), aiming to locate and classify unknown action classes. The Ti-FAD incorporates a mutual cross-attention integration module and utilizes text-related sub-action information to address the action bias problem in ZSTAD. The method demonstrates strong performance on the THUMOS14 and ActivityNet v1.3 datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation for the study is compelling, particularly regarding the common sub-action bias affecting classification.
2. The text-infused cross-attention and foreground-aware head are technically robust and show strong effectiveness in the ablation study.
3. The paper is well-written and accessible.
4. The achieved performance is state-of-the-art on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet v1.3.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks clarity on the specific text used for feature extraction, only mentioning a text encoder without detailing the textual prompts.
2. There is insufficient breakdown of the proposed cross-modal baseline's performance to identify its most effective components.
3. The evaluation relies solely on I3D visual features; incorporating CLIP features could demonstrate generalization across different features.
4. Limitations are not adequately discussed in the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by specifying the textual prompts used for text feature extraction. Additionally, providing a detailed performance breakdown of the cross-modal baseline would help identify its strengths. Evaluating the model with CLIP features would enhance the demonstration of generalization ability. Finally, we suggest that the authors explicitly discuss the limitations of their approach within the paper.
