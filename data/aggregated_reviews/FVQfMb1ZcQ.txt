### Key Points
This paper presents HeatSnap, a continuous snapshot system for virtual machines that optimizes snapshot performance by leveraging hot page characteristics. The authors propose novel approaches for hot page detection, dynamic incremental snapshots, and snapshot compression, demonstrating significant improvements in snapshot duration (17.4% reduction), VM performance loss (48.4% reduction), and storage costs (46.7% reduction) compared to existing methods. The introduction effectively outlines existing VM snapshot methods and their limitations, while the evaluation section compares HeatSnap with existing systems, showcasing its advantages.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Innovative hot page-aware mechanisms and dynamic strategies for snapshot optimization.
- Clear performance improvements over traditional snapshotting methods.
- Well-structured presentation with thorough explanations of methodologies and experimental setups.
- Practical relevance for cloud infrastructure and large-scale web environments.

Weaknesses:
- Limited theoretical analysis of the hot page detection algorithm and its threshold choice.
- Insufficient discussion on scalability and resource consumption, particularly in multi-tenant environments.
- Lack of comprehensive evaluation against a wider range of baseline systems and real-world web applications.
- Formatting issues, such as small text in figures and inconsistent capitalization, hinder clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical justification for the hot page detection threshold and provide sensitivity analysis regarding its impact on performance. Additionally, the authors should include a detailed discussion on the resource consumption costs associated with hot page detection and snapshot compression strategies. To enhance the evaluation, we suggest incorporating diverse workloads, particularly those representing modern cloud-native applications, and conducting stress tests under extreme conditions. Furthermore, the authors should address formatting issues, such as adjusting figure text size for readability and standardizing capitalization throughout the paper.
