Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Moderation Using LLM Introspection (MULI), a novel approach for detecting toxic prompts in large language models (LLMs) by leveraging the logits of the first response token. The authors demonstrate that this method incurs negligible additional inference costs and shows superior performance compared to existing methods, particularly in achieving high true positive rates at low false positive rates. The paper includes experimental results on ToxicChat and LMSYS-Chat-1M datasets, highlighting the method's efficiency and practical implications for real-time applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is simple, original, and effective for toxicity detection.
- MULI achieves near-zero additional computational cost, significantly improving upon existing methods that require additional classifiers.
- The experimental setup is robust, with clear presentation and sound explanations of methods and evaluations.
- The approach is practical for real-time applications, such as streaming APIs.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on the first token for toxicity detection lacks justification, and the method may struggle with adversarially designed prompts.
- The evaluation is limited to specific datasets, raising concerns about generalizability across different types of toxic content.
- The method's effectiveness is highly dependent on the quality and alignment of the underlying LLM, which may not be reliable for poorly aligned models.
- There is insufficient analysis of failure cases or scenarios where MULI might not perform well.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for focusing solely on the first token logits and include a discussion on potential adversarial prompts. Additionally, we suggest expanding the evaluation to a broader range of datasets to ensure generalizability. A dedicated limitations section should be included, addressing the method's dependency on LLM quality and the implications of using specific refusal tokens. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore how MULI could be adapted for multi-class toxicity classification tasks and to provide qualitative analyses of failure cases to enhance understanding of the method's limitations.
