### Key Points
This paper presents a new dataset, ToViLaG, aimed at evaluating the toxic degeneration of visual-language generative models (VLGMs). The authors propose a metric, WInToRe, to quantify toxicity and a detoxification method, SMIB, designed to reduce toxicity without significantly compromising generation quality. The study systematically investigates the toxicity problem in VLGMs, providing theoretical proof of the metric's effectiveness and conducting extensive experiments across multiple models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a critical issue in visual-language generation, highlighting the social and ethical implications of toxicity in generated content.  
- The comprehensive dataset, ToViLaG, includes both toxic and innocuous text-image pairs, serving as a valuable resource for evaluating detoxification methods.  
- The proposed metric, WInToRe, offers a more accurate evaluation of toxicity by considering both input and output toxicity.  
- The detoxification method, SMIB, is theoretically grounded and demonstrates effective results in experiments.  
- The paper is well-written and presents its insights clearly.

Weaknesses:  
- The SMIB method appears to degrade generation performance in most cases, raising concerns about its overall effectiveness.  
- The applicability of the proposed metric and method to unimodal generation tasks remains unclear.  
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion of related studies and the potential transferability of detoxification methods from natural language generation (NLG) to VLG.  
- The relationship between the proposed metric and the Wasserstein metric is not adequately clarified.  
- The performance of the detoxification method requires further investigation, particularly regarding its impact across various tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related work to include more studies and insights on the transferability of detoxification methods from NLG to VLG. Additionally, the authors should provide further clarification on the relationship between Equation 3 and the Wasserstein metric, particularly regarding the use of an L-p norm. To enhance the robustness of the SMIB method, we suggest conducting comparisons across various text-to-image tasks to validate its efficacy. Finally, addressing the performance degradation observed in the experiments would strengthen the argument for the proposed method's effectiveness.
