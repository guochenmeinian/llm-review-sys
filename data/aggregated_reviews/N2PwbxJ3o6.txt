Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework called Partial2Global for ranking in-context examples in visual language models. The authors propose a transformer-based list-wise ranker and a consistency-aware ranking aggregator to approximate global optimal prompt selection. The effectiveness of this framework is validated through experiments on tasks such as foreground segmentation, single object detection, and image colorization, demonstrating improved performance over existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The analysis includes a comprehensive examination of the sensitivity of different components and backbones to the order of in-context learning (ICL) selection, highlighting the importance of prompt ranking in segmentation tasks.
2. The writing is clear and well-structured, making complex ideas accessible.
3. The proposed method is novel, utilizing a unique transformer-based ranker and a consistency-aware aggregator, with extensive experiments providing strong evidence of its effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. The workload appears low; further exploration of the impact of models with a larger number of shots on ICL is needed, along with an investigation into data quality in alternative datasets and the importance of different parts of the loss in the ranking model during ablation experiments.
2. Some conclusions presented in charts, such as Figure 4, lack intuitiveness; for instance, displaying the similarity of the proposed method alongside the visual similarity of VPR in the same chart would enhance clarity.
3. The paper does not include ablation studies on critical parameters like δ and τ, which are essential for assessing model robustness. Additionally, there is no analysis of the computational complexity and time cost associated with the proposed methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the exploration of the impact of larger shot numbers on ICL and the analysis of data quality in alternative datasets. Additionally, including ablation studies on critical parameters such as δ and τ would provide valuable insights into model performance. Clarifying the methodology for calculating visual similarity in Figure 4 and addressing the computational complexity of the proposed methods would also enhance the paper's rigor.
