### Key Points
This paper presents a novel feature selection method for diffusion models, emphasizing the importance of evaluating a broader range of activations, particularly in diffusion U-Nets. The authors identify three universal properties—**asymmetric diffusion noises**, **in-resolution granularity changes**, and **locality without positional embeddings**—to filter out suboptimal activations. Their comprehensive approach enhances performance in discriminative tasks such as semantic correspondence, semantic segmentation, and label-scarce segmentation, demonstrating superior results compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces an efficient qualitative analysis for filtering low-quality activations, which reduces computational costs compared to traditional methods.
- The authors clearly articulate their observations, supported by extensive visualizations and experiments that validate the effectiveness of the proposed method across multiple tasks.
- The findings and methodologies are applicable beyond the specific models studied, providing a foundation for future research in feature selection for diffusion models.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks detailed comparisons with traditional U-Nets, which would provide better context for the unique properties identified.
- The qualitative filtering approach's scalability and efficiency in large-scale settings are not fully demonstrated, raising questions about its applicability.
- There is a need for more theoretical analysis and mathematical proofs to support the proposed methodology and properties of diffusion U-Nets.
- Some visualizations and notations could be clearer, and there are minor typographical errors that need correction.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of visualizations, particularly Figure 3(c), and provide a more detailed comparison with traditional U-Nets to contextualize their findings. Additionally, we suggest incorporating more theoretical analysis to strengthen the claims made and addressing the scalability of the qualitative filtering approach in large-scale settings. Finally, we encourage the authors to correct typographical errors and enhance the definitions of various activations and components within the diffusion models for better clarity.
