Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on universal Online Convex Optimization (OCO) with gradient-variation-dependent regret bounds, aiming to create a single algorithm that adapts to various curvature types (convex, strongly convex, and exp-concave) and their coefficients. The proposed algorithm achieves optimal gradient-variation bounds for all curvature types, improving the number of base learners from $(\log T)^2$ to $\log T$. The main results have broad applications, including the SEA model and dynamic regret bounds. The authors utilize an innovative approach to analyze empirical gradient variation and incorporate a negative Bregman divergence term to enhance the analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper provides detailed observations and insights leading to improved and optimal regret bounds, along with a simpler algorithm design.
- The literature review is comprehensive, and the incorporation of Bregman divergence is straightforward and effective.

Weaknesses:  
- The presentation is dense, and some sections, particularly on dynamic regret, lack clarity. The setup for dynamic regret is not well-defined, and the improvement in the number of base learners is not sufficiently explained.
- The contribution appears limited to logarithmic improvements, and the optimality of results concerning $V_T$ and $F_T$ is not discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction of $F_T$ and the small-loss bound by specifying that the loss functions are non-negative. Additionally, the authors should clearly define the problem setup for dynamic regret, including the type of loss function and whether strong convexity or log-concavity is known. It would be beneficial to elaborate on how the improvement in the number of base learners is achieved and to discuss the optimality of the results concerning $V_T$ and $F_T$. Furthermore, consider moving the last section on dynamic regret to the appendix to enhance the overall presentation.
