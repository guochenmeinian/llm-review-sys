Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents EigenVI, a novel black-box variational inference method that utilizes orthogonal function expansions and minimizes the Fisher divergence. The authors propose a score matching approach that reduces to an eigenvalue problem, allowing for effective modeling of complex distributions. The method is claimed to provide closed-form calculations for lower-order moments and facilitate posterior sampling.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
* The originality of using orthogonal function expansions in variational inference is notable and potentially impactful across various fields.
* The clarity of the exposition is commendable, particularly in introducing complex concepts like orthogonal function expansions and score-based divergences.
* The method's ability to avoid gradient-based optimization and its applicability to a wide range of problems without requiring extensive calculations are significant advantages.

Weaknesses:
* The method's scalability is limited due to the exponential growth of basis functions with dimensionality, raising questions about its practicality compared to MCMC methods.
* The evaluation lacks comprehensive comparisons with a broader range of existing non-parametric variational families, focusing too narrowly on Gaussian variational families.
* The reliance on preprocessing steps for standardization complicates the method's implementation and may undermine its appeal.
* EigenVI's performance is sensitive to the choice of basis functions and importance samples, yet guidance on selecting these parameters is insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including comparisons with a wider array of non-parametric variational families to better contextualize EigenVI's performance. Additionally, addressing the scalability issue and providing empirical evidence of computational efficiency relative to MCMC methods would strengthen the paper. Clarifying the process for solving the eigenvalue problem and discussing potential methods for improving scalability, such as randomized linear algebra techniques, would also enhance the work. Finally, we suggest that the authors provide practical insights on selecting the number of basis functions and importance samples to aid practitioners in applying their method effectively.
