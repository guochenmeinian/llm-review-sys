### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework (MAS) to mitigate association-engendered stereotypes in Text-to-Image (T2I) models. The authors propose to address stereotypes arising from object associations, utilizing a Text-Image-Text CLIP (TIT CLIP) and a Sensitive Transformer to align generated image distributions with stereotype-free distributions. A new evaluation metric, Stereotype-Distribution-Total-Variation (SDTV), is introduced to assess stereotypes effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in mitigating both single and association-engendered stereotypes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors address a relatively unexplored area in stereotype mitigation for T2I models, focusing on associations rather than individual objects.
- The paper is well-structured, presenting a clear problem, methodology, and results, with a solid context for the need to address association-engendered stereotypes.
- The MAS framework innovatively models the stereotype problem as a probability distribution alignment issue, contributing valuable insights to the field.
- Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, supported by detailed appendices.

Weaknesses:
- The complexity of the MAS framework may pose challenges for practical implementation, particularly for developers with limited resources.
- The validity of the TIT CLIP's ability to learn mappings from prompts to stereotypes requires further explanation, as stereotypes are not directly observable in single images.
- Technical details regarding the training of the Sensitive Transformer are insufficient, including its training objectives and how it handles stereotypes across multiple attributes.
- Clarity is needed on how to obtain the probability distribution for evaluation, particularly regarding the accuracy of sensitive attribute classifiers in multi-object scenarios.
- The paper lacks a discussion on limitations and societal impacts, despite claiming to address these in the checklist.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the TIT CLIP's mapping process by providing examples of stereotype descriptions used for training. Additionally, the authors should include more details on the training objectives of the Sensitive Transformer and how it manages stereotypes across multiple attributes. It would be beneficial to clarify the method for obtaining the probability distribution for evaluation and to provide ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of each proposed component. We also suggest renaming the TIT CLIP acronym to reflect the project's serious nature and addressing the claim regarding default representations of identity groups. Finally, the authors should include a discussion on the limitations and potential societal impacts of their method.
