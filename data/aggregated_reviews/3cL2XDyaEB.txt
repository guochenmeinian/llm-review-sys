Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new method, EGonc, for open-set node classification in graphs, utilizing energy-based models for density estimation and generating synthetic out-of-distribution samples. The authors claim that EGonc achieves a distinguishable margin between in-distribution (IND) and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection scores. The experiments compare EGonc against various baseline methods and include ablation studies, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a significant problem in open-set node classification, relevant for real-world applications.
2. The incorporation of energy-based models into graph learning is a novel approach.
3. Experimental results indicate that EGonc outperforms a range of baseline methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The claim regarding the theoretical properties of the method lacks supporting analysis.
2. The experimental design is insufficient, particularly in the diversity of OOD examples and the absence of comparisons with key OOD detection baselines. Error bars are not reported, and an ablation study for energy propagation is missing.
3. Major presentation issues exist, including formatting errors, unclear explanations of loss functions, and vague descriptions in Proposition 1.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis to substantiate claims about the method's properties. Additionally, the experimental design should be enhanced by including a wider variety of OOD examples and comparisons with important OOD detection baselines. Reporting error bars and conducting an ablation study for energy propagation would also strengthen the findings. Furthermore, we suggest addressing the presentation issues by correcting formatting errors, clarifying the roles of the loss functions with examples, and refining vague descriptions in mathematical statements.
