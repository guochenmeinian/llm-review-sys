Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents LayoutPrompter, a novel approach for generating high-quality, cross-domain graphic layouts using large language models (LLMs) with few-shot learning. The authors propose techniques such as dynamic prompting and a layout ranker to facilitate layout generation without extensive training. The method demonstrates competitive performance across various conditional layout generation tasks, leveraging existing knowledge in LLMs and addressing the challenges of geometric layout tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach enables LLMs to perform a novel and challenging task in layout generation without the need for extensive training data.
- The integration of dynamic prompting and layout ranker is innovative and could benefit future research in layout generation.
- The paper is well-structured and presents solid empirical evidence supporting its findings.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on the existing dataset's coverage raises concerns about the generalization ability of the model in generating novel UIs.
- The lack of detailed information regarding the new dataset, WebUI, and its collection process limits the reproducibility and understanding of the results.
- The ablation study does not convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of dynamic prompting and layout ranker, and the paper lacks in-depth analysis of experimental results and failure cases.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and organization of the dataset setup explanation, possibly by including a table that lists the tasks and corresponding datasets. Additionally, the authors should provide more detailed information about the WebUI dataset, including its collection process, sources, and format. We suggest conducting further ablation studies to explore the effects of different prompting examples and to include qualitative analyses of the generated layouts. Finally, we encourage the authors to consider conducting a user study to evaluate the layouts based on design principles and human preferences, as current metrics may not fully capture the quality of the generated designs.
