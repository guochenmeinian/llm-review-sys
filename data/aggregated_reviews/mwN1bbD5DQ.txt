### Key Points
This paper presents a fine-tuning strategy called debiased LoRA to address the long-tail distribution problem in remote sensing datasets. The authors propose a three-step approach: clustering biased features from a pre-trained model, computing debiased cluster centers for tail classes, and training a LoRA module to predict debiased features from biased ones. The performance of this method is evaluated on two different remote sensing datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well written, with helpful visualizations that clarify the proposed approach.
- The method addresses a significant issue in remote sensing and has potential applications beyond this field.
- Results indicate that the approach does not negatively impact head and middle classes and may even enhance their performance.

Weaknesses:
- The absence of ablation studies raises concerns about the model's robustness to hyperparameter choices, particularly regarding the selection of K for clustering.
- Experiments are limited to a small number of datasets, making it difficult to ascertain the generalizability of debLoRA across various long-tail scenarios.
- The writing quality could be improved for clarity, particularly in the abstract and the "why it works" section, which lacks rigorous mathematical justification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and readability of the writing, particularly by simplifying complex clauses and avoiding ambiguous sentence structures. The abstract should clearly define the scope of the work, specifying whether the method is intended solely for remote sensing or has broader applicability. We suggest enhancing the "why it works" section with more rigorous mathematical justification. Additionally, conducting ablation studies across multiple datasets would provide valuable insights into the robustness of the model's hyperparameters. The authors should also explore a wider range of remote sensing datasets and compare their approach with other commonly used methods, such as contrastive learning techniques. Finally, a more detailed analysis of the learned features, particularly in relation to biased features, would strengthen the paper's contributions.
