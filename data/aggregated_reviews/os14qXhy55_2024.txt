Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents OctreeOcc, a novel occupancy predictor that employs an octree structure to enhance efficiency in occupancy queries. The octree is initialized with semantic information and iteratively refined to accurately represent driving scenes. The authors claim that OctreeOcc surpasses previous methods in prediction accuracy and reduces computational overhead by 15% to 24% compared to dense-grid approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The octree representation offers a new and effective solution to the computational challenges posed by dense grid methods.  
2. OctreeOcc demonstrates improved accuracy in occupancy prediction while also reducing latency.  
3. The paper includes extensive ablation experiments and clearly presents the network components.

Weaknesses:  
1. The method requires an additional segmentation model for octree initialization, which may hinder efficiency.  
2. A fair comparison between OctreeOcc with and without extra semantic information is lacking.  
3. The complexity of the pipeline, particularly in the Iterative Structure Rectification Module, raises concerns about generalization.  
4. The reported memory consumption discrepancies and the training process's complexity are notable drawbacks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the octree query updating process and provide more details on the segmentation model used for initialization. Additionally, we suggest including a comparison of training times with other methods to highlight efficiency. It would also be beneficial to clarify the metrics used in the experiments and ensure that the reported memory usage aligns with previous works. Finally, we encourage the authors to include results from other commonly used datasets to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of OctreeOcc.
