Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a bi-level optimization framework called SeeX to address visual distractions in unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL). The authors propose using separate world models to distinguish between endogenous and exogenous information, thereby improving the accuracy of intrinsic rewards based on dynamic uncertainty. The method is evaluated across multiple tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing URL methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The idea of separating exogenous and endogenous information to enhance intrinsic rewards is innovative.
- The writing is generally clear, and the diagrams are visually appealing.
- The theoretical foundation of the algorithm is well-motivated, and the experimental results are robust.

Weaknesses:
- The assumption of decoupled endogenous and exogenous transitions may not hold in all scenarios, such as in robot manipulation where obstacles can influence movement.
- The mask model used for combining endogenous and exogenous reconstructions may fail when distractions and embodiments are inseparable.
- The proposed EX-BMDP appears similar to existing frameworks, raising questions about the novelty of combining these approaches.
- Some figures and results may be misleading or lack sufficient data points for accurate interpretation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by providing additional visualizations for decoded observations, such as $\hat{o}_t^-$, $m_t$, and trajectories with different embodiments. It would also be beneficial to conduct ablation experiments on environments beyond Quadruped, as the results there are noisy. Additionally, we suggest including 1-2 data augmentation baselines in the camera-ready version, as this could provide valuable insights into the similarities and differences between the proposed method and existing strategies. Finally, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the limitations of their approach, particularly regarding the handling of task-relevant moving objects.
