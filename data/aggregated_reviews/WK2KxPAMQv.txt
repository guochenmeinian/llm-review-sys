### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach called RECURVE (Representation trajEctory CURVaturE) for boundary/change point detection in time series data, utilizing curvature measurements of representation trajectories rather than distances. The authors argue that representation trajectories change more sharply at intra-segment points compared to inter-segment points, which aligns with the goal of capturing gradual transitions in real-world data. The method involves deriving representation trajectories through a time-series representation learning method and calculating curvature to identify boundaries.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written, clear, and easy to follow, with informative graphics and extensive evaluation tests.  
- The proposed method is innovative, demonstrating promising empirical results across various datasets.  
- The theoretical foundation is rigorously analyzed, supporting the method's validity.

Weaknesses:  
- The reliance on class-separated representations is questionable, as there is no guarantee of such separation in complex datasets. The authors should clarify this dependency and propose a method to assess representation quality.  
- The normalization of change metrics limits comparability across samples and affects threshold selection for change point identification.  
- Missing baselines, particularly a distance-based change point detection model using the same representation learning framework, hinder a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method's advantages.  
- The rationale for using curvature as a metric is not convincingly articulated, and the method's dependence on learned representation quality raises concerns similar to those of distance-based models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the necessity of class-separated representations and provide a method to evaluate their quality. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on the implications of normalizing change metrics and include a distance-based baseline for comparison. It would be beneficial to strengthen the argument for using curvature over existing methods and clarify the relationship between curvature and distance metrics. Finally, we suggest including a figure that illustrates CPD scores over time and providing performance results across multiple error margin values in the appendix.
