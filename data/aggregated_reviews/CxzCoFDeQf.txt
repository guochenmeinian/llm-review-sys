Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel machine learning (ML) attack capable of recovering sparse binary, ternary, and small Gaussian secrets, improving upon previous methods like SALSA and Picante. The authors propose enhancements that allow for effective attacks on Learning With Errors (LWE) systems, particularly with larger dimensions and smaller moduli, while also reducing preprocessing time. The approach involves training an ML model on samples to predict secret values, thereby addressing a significant gap in the parameter choices for LWE-based cryptosystems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and provides a clear introduction to the LWE problem.
- The proposed method achieves a more effective attack on LWE systems, demonstrating the potential of ML in cryptanalysis.
- The theoretical explanations for the attack's performance enhance understanding.
- Improvements in preprocessing speed and efficiency are notable.

Weaknesses:
- The purpose of the paper lacks clarity, particularly regarding the novelty of the contributions compared to existing schemes.
- The rationale for certain architectural choices, such as the encoder-only model and the positional embedding method, is insufficiently justified.
- There is a need for more ablation experiments to demonstrate the individual contributions of enhancements.
- The paper does not adequately address why full recovery of Gaussian secrets is infeasible.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper's purpose and explicitly articulate the novelty of their contributions in relation to prior work. Additionally, we suggest providing more detailed explanations regarding the architectural choices made, particularly the encoder-only model and the positional embedding method. To strengthen the empirical findings, we encourage the authors to conduct more ablation studies and comparisons to highlight the benefits of each proposed enhancement. Finally, including a thorough discussion on the challenges of recovering Gaussian secrets would enhance the paper's depth.
