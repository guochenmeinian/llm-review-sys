### Key Points
This paper presents the concept of vertical scientific discovery, which involves incrementally building scientific equations by starting with simple models that consider a limited number of variables and progressively expanding them. This methodology reflects the experimental practices of human scientists who isolate variables to study their effects. The authors propose Control Variable Genetic Programming (CVGP) for symbolic regression, which uses genetic programming to learn equations incrementally. Experimental results indicate that CVGP outperforms several baseline methods in learning symbolic expressions with multiple independent variables. The second case study addresses materials science, specifically modeling nanoscale crystalline defect evolution, demonstrating that a vertical discovery schedule improves the learning of phase-field models for dendritic solidification. The paper highlights the potential of vertical scientific discovery to accelerate AI-driven scientific exploration.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces a novel methodology that mirrors human scientific experimentation.  
- CVGP shows superior performance in symbolic regression compared to baseline methods.  
- The writing is clear and accessible, making complex concepts easier to understand.  

Weaknesses:  
- The exploration of experimental results could be more comprehensive.  
- The findings from the materials science example are somewhat unexpected and would benefit from additional examples for clarity.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the depth of the exploration of experimental results to enhance the overall quality of the research. Additionally, we suggest extending the two examples provided and incorporating more examples to strengthen the arguments made in the paper.
