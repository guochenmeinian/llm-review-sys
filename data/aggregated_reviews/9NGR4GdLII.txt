### Key Points
This paper presents a dual encoder model for frame identification using contrastive learning, introducing a two-stage coarse-to-fine learning procedure to balance training with and without lexicon filtering. The authors propose COFFTEA, which efficiently models the alignment between frames and targets, gradually learning to differentiate frames with varying degrees of similarity. The method demonstrates strong performance on frame identification benchmarks, particularly without lexicon filtering.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a clear motivation for the proposed method.
- The dual encoder structure efficiently computes similarity between targets and frames.
- The coarse-to-fine learning approach addresses limitations of training solely with or without lexicon filtering.
- Each component of the framework is effective and straightforward, with promising prospects for replication.

Weaknesses:
- The overall dual-encoder framework and contrastive learning lack novelty, presenting an incremental advancement rather than a new methodology.
- There is insufficient experimental analysis regarding the ability to address out-of-vocabulary targets.
- Minor issues, such as typos, need revision, and the mutual benefits of the two-stage training approach require clearer validation, particularly regarding specific metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of the framework by incorporating new methodologies or insights. Additionally, we suggest providing experimental analysis to validate the claims regarding out-of-vocabulary targets. Clarification on the mutual benefits of the two-stage training approach, especially in terms of specific metrics like ACC, would enhance the paper's rigor. Finally, addressing minor typographical errors will improve the overall presentation.
