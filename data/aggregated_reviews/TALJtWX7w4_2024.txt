Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for confidence calibration under label shift using unlabeled samples from the target domain. The authors propose estimating the label distribution of the target domain and computing a calibration parameter based on reweighted source domain samples. The method aims to apply standard calibration techniques, such as temperature scaling, to unlabelled target data, demonstrating its effectiveness across various datasets with different label shift strengths.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed method yields good calibration results and is theoretically justified as a consistent estimator of class-wise expected calibration error (class-wise ECE).
- The paper is well-written, with clear presentation of methods, high-quality figures, and comprehensive experiments that include statistical error measures and ablation studies.

Weaknesses:  
- There is a significant lack of novelty, as the method closely follows existing calibration techniques for covariate shift, applying similar principles to label shift without adequately distinguishing its contributions.
- The choice of baselines for comparison is inappropriate, as they are designed for covariate shift rather than label shift, undermining the validity of the results. Key recalibration methods for label shift, such as those by Alexandari et al. and Wen et al., are notably absent from the analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of the paper by clearly articulating how their approach differs from existing covariate shift methods. Additionally, it is crucial to include relevant label shift recalibration baselines in Table 2 to ensure a fair comparison and substantiate claims of state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, we suggest discussing the data hunger of the calibration error estimator and its implications for practical applications in the limitations section. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore the effect of the recalibration step on calibration error estimation and provide insights on this relationship.
