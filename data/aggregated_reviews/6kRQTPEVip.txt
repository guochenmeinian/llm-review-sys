Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a set of methods for modeling chemical reactions involving radicals, addressing the limitations of existing datasets like USPTO in terms of reaction interpretability and multi-step processes. The authors introduce the RMechDB dataset, which includes radical pathways, and describe their methods based on OrbChain, which standardizes the representation of chemical reactions. They propose predictive methods such as two-step prediction, plausibility ranking, contrastive learning with a reaction hypergraph, and text-based sequence-to-sequence models. Experiments demonstrate varying performances across these methods in accurately describing radical reaction pathways.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Originality: The paper offers a novel perspective on radical chemical reaction modeling, enhancing interpretability for classical chemists.
- Quality: It analyzes four relevant methods for radical modeling with clear motivations for their significance.
- Clarity: The authors effectively motivate the problem and provide necessary background information.
- Significance: The work expands machine learning capabilities to yield interpretable reaction models with multi-step processes, impacting various chemistry-related challenges.

Weaknesses:
- The context of results related to the original problem is unclear; the authors should clarify how their methods enhance interpretability in chemical reaction modeling.
- The brief description of pathway search lacks context regarding the implications of a 60% recovery rate and the interpretability of the reaction tree.
- Frequent references to the appendix hinder understanding; more significant information should be included in the main text.
- The description of the RMechDB dataset is insufficient, particularly regarding comparisons with existing modeling methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the context surrounding their results, specifically how the described methods enhance interpretability in chemical reaction modeling. Additionally, providing more context for the pathway search results, including the implications of a 60% recovery rate, would be beneficial. We suggest incorporating more critical information from the appendix into the main paper to enhance understanding. Furthermore, the authors should clarify whether the RMechDB paper included any modeling methods for comparison with their proposed approaches.
