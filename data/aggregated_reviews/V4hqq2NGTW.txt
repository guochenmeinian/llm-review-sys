Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on optimal causal filtering under a perfect perceptual-quality constraint, introducing the Perceptual Kalman filter as a solution. The authors propose a recursive formula for perceptual filters and validate their approach through experiments on video reconstruction and other dynamic systems. The work contributes to understanding the perception-distortion trade-off, which has received limited research attention.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The work is well-contextualized within the literature, addressing an important theory.
2. The problem formulation is reasonable, and theoretical derivations are detailed.
3. The paper is technically sound, with formal proofs of theoretical assumptions.
4. The appendix materials are well-prepared, aiding comprehension, and the open-source code enhances community access.

Weaknesses:
1. Generalizability of the proposed tool to other fidelity measures beyond MSE is unclear.
2. Experimental validation is limited to a single sample; more diverse scenarios are needed.
3. Readability is hindered by oversimplified formula derivations, particularly in Formula 16.
4. The paper lacks a conclusion section summarizing findings and future research directions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their tool by exploring additional fidelity measures. We suggest conducting more extensive experimental analyses across diverse video scenarios to strengthen validation. Additionally, we advise enhancing the readability of the paper by revising the formula derivations for clarity. It would be beneficial to add a conclusion section to summarize the paper's findings and outline potential applications and future research interests. Finally, we encourage the authors to compare their method with other state-of-the-art perceptual-quality constrained methods to enhance persuasiveness.
