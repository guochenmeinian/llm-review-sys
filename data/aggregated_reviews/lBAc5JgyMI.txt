### Key Points
This paper presents a system for automatic narrative detection, focusing on the characterization of narrative use in health misinformation on Twitter. The authors manually annotated a misinformation tweet dataset for narrative presence and built text classifiers, with a fine-tuned RoBERTa model yielding the best results. The findings indicate that narrative style correlates with higher engagement, particularly in misinformation contexts. The authors conclude that narratives can enhance engagement with misinformation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a valuable dataset that may aid in modeling user narratives related to misinformation.
- The statistical analysis effectively explores the relationship among narrativity, misinformation, follower count, and user engagement.
- The thematic analysis added during the rebuttal phase was well-received.

Weaknesses:
- The quality of automatically annotated samples raises concerns, particularly regarding the systematic errors of the RoBERTa classifier.
- The results from the GLM analysis appear inconclusive, with unclear relationships between misinformation and narrative.
- The interpretation of results is insufficient, lacking coherent findings and depth in discussing main themes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how the remaining tweets were labeled by the RoBERTa model, particularly regarding the annotation process. Including examples of annotated data would enhance understanding. A more thorough discussion and interpretation of results, especially in section 5, is necessary to contextualize findings and address counterintuitive observations. Additionally, we suggest providing effect sizes to help readers interpret the strength of relationships. The authors should also consider the relevance of the narrative arc analysis and whether it adds value, given the short nature of tweets. Lastly, addressing the quality control of automatically generated samples is essential for ensuring reliability.
