### Key Points
This paper presents the Inference and Prediction Tool (RTF) framework, which enhances the predictive ability of Language Models (LM) by integrating inference and dynamic data retrieval. The authors propose a hierarchical system of ReAct agents, where a high-level agent directs lower-level agents equipped with specialized toolkits. The empirical results demonstrate that RTF outperforms base LLMs and, in some cases, human forecasters, marking a novel contribution to the field. The significance of this work lies in its potential applications in critical areas such as public health and the economy, where timely forecasting is essential.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper presents a well-defined problem and a novel approach, with strong empirical results showing RTF's effectiveness.
- The methodology is sound, detailing the hierarchical structure of agents and their interaction with external tools.
- The evaluation metrics (Brier score and accuracy) are appropriate and well-explained, demonstrating that RTF can match or outperform human forecasters.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a detailed discussion of the limitations of using Google Search API for information retrieval and the computational resources required for RTF compared to simpler methods.
- The related work section is brief and could benefit from more detailed comparisons to existing methods.
- The evaluation is primarily based on data from Manifold Markets, which may not generalize to specialized or less popular domains, and there is uncertainty regarding the universality of various prediction tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by adding examples or charts to explain complex concepts related to the ReAct framework. Additionally, we suggest including a more detailed discussion of the potential limitations of the Google Search API and an analysis of the computational resources required to run RTF. Expanding the dataset to include more diverse and domain-specific questions would also enhance the generalizability of the findings. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore the ethical implications of using AI for forecasting in high-stakes scenarios.
