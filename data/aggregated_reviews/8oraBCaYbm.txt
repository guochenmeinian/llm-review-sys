### Key Points
This position paper proposes using TRNG co-processors to enhance the performance of ML/AI accelerators. The authors suggest that this approach could significantly benefit future AI/ML systems, especially those requiring extensive random sampling. The paper aims to influence the design decisions of upcoming AI/ML accelerators.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- Compelling idea with strong initial motivation.  
- Quantifiable recommendations provided, guiding future work.  

Weaknesses:  
- Insufficient quantification of the current impact of PRNGs on AI/ML performance to better motivate the position.  
- Lack of detailed explanation regarding the selection of the proposed guidelines.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including more quantification of the current impact of PRNGs on AI/ML performance to strengthen the motivation for their position. Additionally, we suggest providing a more thorough description of how and why the guidelines were chosen to enhance clarity and understanding.
