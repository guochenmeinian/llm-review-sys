Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a model addressing the collaborative learning problem, specifically focusing on the adverse selection phenomenon in federated learning due to varying data quality among agents. The authors formalize the "unraveling" issue, where only the worst agents remain in coalitions, and propose a probabilistic verification-based mechanism to achieve optimal collaboration at Nash Equilibrium with high probability. The paper also discusses the implications of hidden information on participation incentives and presents a mechanism to estimate clients' dataset qualities to mitigate the unraveling effect.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a clear and rigorous mathematical model of collaborative learning, identifying critical issues such as "unraveling."
- The proposed mechanism effectively incentivizes participation without requiring payments, relying instead on algorithmic adjustments.
- The authors justify their model design choices well and cover related work comprehensively.

Weaknesses:
- Empirical validation of the "unraveling" problem and the proposed mechanism's effectiveness is lacking.
- The notation used is confusing, particularly with the use of $\underline{n}$ to denote $\arg\max_{n}\cdots$.
- The paper does not adequately address whether agents report their type profiles truthfully, relying instead on approximations by the aggregator.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical implementation of the mechanism in section 4.2 to demonstrate the occurrence of the "unraveling" problem and the mechanism's practical effectiveness. Additionally, clarifying the notation and addressing the confusion surrounding the VCG section would enhance the paper's clarity. It would also be beneficial to discuss why clients might reason through statistical guarantees rather than expected rewards and to explore the implications of excluding agents from the collaboration.
