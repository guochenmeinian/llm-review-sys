### Key Points
This paper presents valuable insights into vulnerabilities in aligned large language models (LLMs) for chat templates, specifically exploring Message Overflow Attacks and Format Mismatch Attacks as extensions of jailbreak techniques. The authors propose comprehensive experiments and critical discussions that inform future countermeasures against these vulnerabilities, addressing important safety issues related to general-purpose LLMs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The exploration of safety risks related to chat templates is intriguing and highlights potential risks in instruction tuning for LLMs.  
- The study provides comprehensive insights into how malicious users can exploit vulnerabilities, such as ChatBug, to bypass safety alignment mechanisms.

Weaknesses:  
- The experiments lack comprehensiveness as they do not include LLMs from other languages, like ChatGLM or Qwen, which could validate the generality of the conclusions.  
- The evaluation would benefit from the inclusion of GPT-4o.  
- There is uncertainty regarding the proposed method's capability to handle multi-turn jailbreak scenarios, necessitating further discussion or experimentation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comprehensiveness of their experiments by including LLMs from other languages, such as ChatGLM or Qwen. Additionally, incorporating GPT-4o in the evaluation would strengthen the assessment. Finally, we suggest that the authors provide further discussion or experimentation on the proposed method's ability to handle multi-turn jailbreak scenarios.
