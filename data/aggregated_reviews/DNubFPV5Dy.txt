Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on value-based control agents for Weakly Coupled MDPs (WCMDPs), introducing Weakly Coupled Q-Learning (WCQL) and Weakly Coupled Deep Q-Network (WCDQN). The authors generalize a Lagrangian relaxation approach to action-value methods, using a Lagrange multiplier to create an overestimate of \(Q^*\) called \(Q^{\lambda*}\). The methods are empirically tested against established baselines on three WCMDPs: electric vehicle charging, multi-product inventory control, and ad matching problems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides self-contained descriptions of WCMDPs and Lagrangian relaxation, making it accessible to a broader audience.
- The theoretical results in the tabular setting are interesting and appear correct, with clear proofs in the appendix.
- The experiments are conducted in realistic domains, yielding strong empirical results.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on discretizing \(\lambda \geq 0\) into a finite set \(\Lambda\) for approximating the upper bound is not adequately discussed, particularly regarding its impact on empirical performance.
- The computational requirements of the proposed methods are understated; additional Q-functions are needed for the upper bound, which increases computational expense.
- The implications of applying tabular theory to deep function approximation are not fully addressed, particularly concerning the soft constraint's potential to lead to suboptimal learned returns.
- The audience for this work may be limited, as it introduces WCMDPs to the deep RL community, which may not be familiar with this problem setting.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the choice of the set \(\Lambda\) and its empirical impact. Additionally, the authors should provide a more balanced view of the computational requirements, clarifying the additional Q-functions needed. It would be beneficial to explicitly address the implications of soft constraints in the context of deep function approximation and include plots showing constraint violations in experiments. Furthermore, we suggest adding a clear example in the initial description of WCMDPs to enhance reader understanding and ensuring all figures, such as Figure 3, are properly labeled and formatted.
