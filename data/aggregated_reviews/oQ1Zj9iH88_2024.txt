Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a penalty-based algorithm for simple bilevel optimization problems, specifically addressing cases where both the upper- and lower-level objectives are convex and potentially non-smooth. The authors propose a single-level reformulation of the bilevel problem and establish the relationship between the solutions of the penalized problem and the original problem. They demonstrate that the proposed accelerated proximal gradient method (PB-APG) converges under a Hölderian error bound condition to approximate global optimal solutions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a theoretically interesting class of bilevel problems where global solutions are attainable, and the proposed method converges to these solutions rather than those of a reformulation.
- A comprehensive summary of algorithms for simple bilevel optimization is provided, enhancing the paper's contribution to the field.

Weaknesses:
- The problem class considered is overly simplistic, with strong convexity and specific assumptions limiting its applicability to more complex scenarios.
- The proposed algorithm appears to solve a standard minimization problem rather than introducing significant novelty in algorithm design.
- There is a lack of detailed literature comparison regarding existing penalty-based bilevel optimization methods, which diminishes the context of the proposed approach.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the distinction between types of subdifferentials used, especially given the mention of applicability to nonconvex objectives. Clarifying this aspect is crucial for the validity of the results. Additionally, we suggest incorporating the results currently relegated to the appendix into the main text, as they are significant and should not be treated as unreviewed material. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to enhance the practical relevance of their work by including more meaningful applications beyond the presented examples. Lastly, we advise providing a clearer comparison with existing penalty-based methods to highlight the advantages of the proposed approach.
