### Key Points
This paper presents a study on list-decodable covariance estimation, focusing on the challenge of estimating the covariance matrix of a multivariate Gaussian distribution in the presence of outliers. The authors propose a polynomial-time algorithm that outputs a list of hypotheses, ensuring at least one is close to the target covariance in relative Frobenius norm. This approach contrasts with previous methods that required $d^{\mathrm{poly(1/\alpha)}}$ time and samples, which are infeasible for practical applications. The authors also extend their techniques to robustly learn mixtures of non-spherical Gaussians.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The problem addressed is significant in robust statistics, with direct applications in learning Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs).  
- The algorithm proposed is simpler and more efficient than existing methods, achieving a better sample complexity and running time.  
- The paper is well-written, providing a clear proof overview and organized presentation of results.

Weaknesses:  
- The relation to previous work (IK22) is initially unclear, particularly regarding the equivalence of error metrics.  
- The organization could be improved, especially by integrating the stability section into the main body and adding a discussion section.  
- The main theorems focus solely on covariance recovery, lacking guarantees for the mean and covariance pair.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the relationship to IK22 early in the paper, particularly regarding the equivalence of error metrics and how they relate to $\mathrm{poly(1/\alpha)}$. Additionally, consider including a complete result that guarantees both the mean and covariance recovery. We also suggest enhancing the organization by integrating the stability section into the main text and adding a discussion section at the end to summarize findings and implications. Lastly, addressing the choice of the relative Frobenius norm and exploring other potential metrics could enrich the discussion.
