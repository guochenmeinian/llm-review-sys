### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to dependency parsing by proposing two labeling schemes: a 4-bit scheme for projective trees and a 7-bit extension for 2-planar non-projective trees. The authors demonstrate that their encoding results in 16 distinct tags for projective trees and can be extended to 128 tags for non-projective trees. The evaluation on multilingual treebank data shows that the proposed methods achieve higher parsing accuracy compared to baseline labeling schemes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed encoding scheme is simpler and more intuitive than previous methods, leading to better performance.
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the labeling schemes and their coverage.
- The empirical results indicate that the parsers using the 7-bit label set outperform baseline methods significantly.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed method is not surjective and relies on heuristics during decoding, which raises concerns about decoding errors.
- There is a lack of comparison with state-of-the-art graph-based parsers and other types of dependency parsers, particularly regarding speed and accuracy.
- The paper does not provide sufficient context for 2-planar trees or the plane assignment, which may hinder reader comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including a comparison of speed and performance with other state-of-the-art parsers, particularly biaffine parsers. Additionally, it would be beneficial to provide statistics on decoding errors resulting from non-surjectivity and discuss their impact on overall performance. We also suggest elaborating on the plane assignment in section 3 for clarity and considering a comparison with Hexatagging in the camera-ready version. Lastly, including an example that necessitates the 7-bit schema would enhance reader understanding.
