Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents novel training techniques for Neural Min-Sum (NMS) decoders of LDPC codes aimed at enhancing performance in the error floor region. The authors propose a two-stage decoding method, where a base decoder addresses the waterfall region and a post decoder focuses on uncorrected codewords. Additionally, a block-wise training schedule is introduced to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, and distinct weights are assigned to unsatisfied check nodes to optimize performance. The results demonstrate significant improvements in error-floor performance compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The novelty of the proposed methods is commendable, particularly the boosting learning technique and block-wise training schedule, which show substantial performance improvements.  
- The extensive evaluation across multiple LDPC settings indicates the effectiveness of the proposed NMS decoder.  
- The paper addresses an important issue in BP/MS-based decoders without requiring architectural modifications.

Weaknesses:  
- The experimental setup lacks elaboration on the parameters selected for training, and the clarity of presentation could be improved.  
- Comparisons with existing NMS methods may not be entirely fair, as recent advancements in NMS algorithms should be considered.  
- The paper does not adequately discuss the initialization of weights or the potential for ASIC hardware implementation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental setup by detailing the parameters used for training and providing a clearer description of the problem addressed, including the type of channel considered. Additionally, addressing the comparison with recent NMS algorithms and including an ablation study of the proposed methods would enhance the paper's rigor. We also suggest that the authors clarify how weights are initialized and updated during training, and consider discussing the potential for hardware implementation of the proposed NMS decoder.
