### Key Points
This paper presents a new test pipeline and two metrics aimed at enhancing the testing of program translation models. The authors collect a test suite across four programming languages, demonstrating that their approach can lead to increased model failures for both open-source and closed-source models. The proposed metrics, Syntax Unit Test Accuracy (SUT Acc) and Syntax Element Test Score (SETS), are claimed to be more aligned with human judgment. The authors also introduce a novel method of decomposing unit tests into syntax elements to compute failure rates.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed approach simplifies the testing process for code generators, leveraging Python unit tests.
- The top-down approach for collecting test suites is innovative and reminiscent of behavioral testing in NLP.
- The decomposition of unit tests into syntax elements is novel and could benefit the NLP community.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for the work is inadequately articulated, particularly regarding the utility of program translation.
- The authors fail to provide a detailed validity analysis of the test suites.
- Presentation issues exist, including unclear dataset construction and evaluation details, as well as inaccuracies in reported metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for their work, explicitly detailing the relevance of program translation. Additionally, the authors should provide a comprehensive validity analysis of the test suites to confirm the correctness of the test cases. We suggest including per-category error rates in the results and addressing the inaccuracies in Table 2. Furthermore, elaborating on the dataset construction process and how it can be extended to new programming languages would enhance the paper's clarity. Lastly, addressing the presentation issues, such as the meaning of colors in figures and the specifics of average performance calculations, is essential for improving the overall quality of the paper.
