Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a failure-aware Gaussian process optimization algorithm that addresses the challenge of observing an unknown function when failures occur, such as when a numerical simulator returns NaN. The authors propose a UCB-type acquisition function that restricts the domain to feasible regions where failures are less likely, and they provide a bound on simple regret in this context. The algorithm is evaluated through numerical experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness on certain benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem formulation is novel and relevant for practical Bayesian optimization.
- Theoretical derivation is solid, with a clear mathematical problem statement.
- Practical issues are considered, and numerical experiments show potential effectiveness, particularly in low-dimensional settings.

Weaknesses:
- There is a gap between the theoretical analysis, which assumes a fully solved NP-complete set covering problem, and the numerical experiments that use a heuristic approximation.
- The algorithm does not demonstrate dominant superiority across all numerical benchmarks.
- Details of the proposed algorithm are unclear, particularly regarding the definition and behavior of the "failure-safe space" and the role of \(\theta_t\).
- The empirical analysis is limited to low-dimensional problems, and the quasicrystal experiment lacks sufficient detail for proper contextualization.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the algorithm's description, particularly regarding the "failure-safe space" and the conditions under which \(\theta_t\) is adjusted. A more intuitive explanation alongside equations would enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest expanding the empirical analysis to include higher-dimensional problems and providing more detailed descriptions of the quasicrystal experiment. It would also be beneficial to clarify the scaling of regret with dimension and to ensure that all equations are numbered for ease of reference. Finally, we encourage the authors to tighten the discussion on prior work to free up space for more critical content.
