Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ZeroMark, a novel method for dataset ownership verification that leverages boundary gradients to assess authorship without disclosing the watermark pattern. The authors conduct extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and Tiny-ImageNet datasets, evaluating ZeroMark against four backdoor attack methods, and propose that it effectively addresses the verification of watermarks while maintaining soundness and novelty. The method aims to enhance copyright protection by ensuring that adversaries cannot easily detect or remove watermarked data during verification. The authors also acknowledge the importance of generalizability and flexibility across different datasets and model architectures, including evaluations on ResNet, VGGNet, and transformer models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a significant problem in dataset watermarking, focusing on protecting the watermark pattern during verification.
2. The proposed method offers a new perspective on dataset ownership verification, potentially inspiring further research.
3. The authors provide solid experimental evaluations, demonstrating the method's effectiveness.
4. The paper demonstrates good soundness and presentation.
5. Extensive experiments are conducted, showcasing the method's effectiveness against clean-label backdoor attacks.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the approach is limited, as it resembles existing methods that utilize backdoor behaviors.
2. Concerns arise regarding the clarity of the relationship between cosine similarity and the proposed verification method, particularly in Theorem 1.
3. The method's practicality is questionable, as it requires predicted logits that may not be available in commercial applications.
4. The experiments lack sufficient detail, such as error bars and comparisons with other verification methods that utilize logits.
5. The limited experimental settings (CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet) may not sufficiently verify the general applicability of the method.
6. There is a lack of theoretical guarantees regarding the privacy of the trigger pattern, raising concerns about the robustness of the proposed method against adaptive attacks.
7. The paper does not adequately address the applicability of ZeroMark to other data formats or model architectures.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Theorem 1 and its implications for the proposed method. Additionally, the authors should justify the phenomenon observed in Figure 2 and provide more context on how their method relates to existing watermarking techniques. Conducting an ablation study on the normalization process in cosine similarity calculations would also be beneficial. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors improve the generalizability of their experiments by including more diverse datasets and model architectures beyond CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet. Providing a theoretical guarantee on the privacy of the trigger pattern would strengthen the persuasiveness of their claims regarding the method's effectiveness in privacy-preserving tasks. Lastly, addressing the limitations of ZeroMark in terms of robustness and efficiency, as well as including discussions on the applicability of ZeroMark to discrete data formats, would enhance the paper's overall impact.
