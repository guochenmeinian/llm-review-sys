Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of higher-order dynamics in network games with pairwise interactions, focusing on dynamics that depend solely on the sequence of payoff signals received by players, termed uncoupled dynamics. The authors demonstrate that linear versions of these dynamics can locally converge to isolated mixed Nash equilibria (NE). However, they also reveal that for each dynamic, there exists a simple anti-coordination game where the dynamic fails to stabilize the unique isolated mixed NE. Additionally, the paper argues that linear dynamics converging to a mixed NE may lack meaningful interpretation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides existence results for uncoupled dynamics that locally converge to mixed Nash equilibria, overcoming limitations of lower-order dynamics.
- The main takeaways are clearly articulated, and the results are likely novel, contributing important insights to the study of multi-agent learning dynamics.

Weaknesses:
- The paper is not self-contained, heavily relying on prior literature and the appendix, making it challenging to read.
- The notation is complicated, and some derivations are difficult to follow, leading to a lack of clarity in understanding the results.
- The motivation for the main dynamics is inadequate, and the practical and theoretical implications of the results may be limited.
- The authors could have engaged more with recent literature on convergence dynamics to NE in games.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the self-containment of the paper by providing clearer definitions and explanations of key concepts, particularly those introduced in the appendix. Additionally, we suggest that the authors enhance the exposition of the motivation for the dynamics discussed, ensuring that it is accessible to a broader audience. It would be beneficial to include more recent references in the literature review and to clarify the relationship between their dynamics and previously studied methods. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to consider moving some of the worked examples from the appendix to the main text to aid comprehension. Lastly, proofreading for minor typographical errors and improving the clarity of figures would enhance the overall presentation.
