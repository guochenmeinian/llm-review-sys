### Key Points
This paper presents a novel issue of Intersectional Unfairness within the fair recommendation field, proposing the Intersectional Two-sided Fairness Recommendation (ITFR) method. The authors demonstrate that their approach minimizes utility differences among various intersectional groups while achieving state-of-the-art overall performance. The empirical study effectively illustrates the necessity of addressing intersectional fairness in recommender systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles an important and underexplored aspect of fairness in recommender systems.
- The proposed ITFR method is comprehensive, addressing the issue from multiple perspectives.
- The empirical analysis convincingly demonstrates the existence of intersectional unfairness.

Weaknesses:
- The definitions of intersectional groups and intersectional unfairness are not clearly articulated, potentially leading to confusion.
- The motivation for addressing intersectional unfairness is inadequately presented, with general reasons that could apply to any two-sided fairness paper.
- The choice of ICV and UCV as metrics is questionable, as they are not common in the literature, and their normalization may be problematic.
- The rationale for using BPR loss as a proxy is unclear, raising questions about the method's applicability to other models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definitions for intersectional groups and intersectional unfairness in Section 1 to enhance reader understanding. Additionally, the authors should provide a more robust explanation of the motivation behind tackling intersectional unfairness, focusing on its unique implications. We also suggest including experiments that explore the feasibility of transforming the two-sided fairness problem into a single-sided framework. Furthermore, the authors should clarify their choice of metrics and consider providing results from newer conventional recommendation models, such as LightGCN, to better contextualize their findings. Lastly, we encourage the authors to address the undefined terms and unclear equations noted in the reviews to improve the technical clarity of the paper.
