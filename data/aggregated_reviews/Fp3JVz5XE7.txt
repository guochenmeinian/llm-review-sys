Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents BlackFed, a federated learning framework for semantic segmentation that eliminates the need for gradient transfer and model architecture knowledge, thereby addressing privacy concerns. The authors propose a split neural network approach, utilizing first-order optimization for the server and zero-order optimization for clients. The method shows promising results across various benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The writing is clear, making the method easy to follow.
2. The combination of split learning and black-box optimization is an interesting approach.
3. The experiments are thorough, demonstrating the method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. Privacy issues remain, as the two-layer CNN at the client may allow attackers to reconstruct training data from intermediate outputs. Further discussion on this is needed.
2. The process of computing first-order gradients at the server is unclear, raising privacy and communication cost concerns.
3. The introduction of a new two-layer CNN at clients prompts the question of whether the DeepLabv3 network could be directly split between clients and server.
4. There is a lack of comparison with other federated learning algorithms that utilize black-box tuning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on privacy concerns, particularly regarding the potential for data reconstruction from client outputs. Additionally, please clarify the gradient computation process at the server and consider including comparisons with other federated learning methods, such as FedSeg and FedSM. It would also be beneficial to explore the possibility of directly splitting the DeepLabv3 network and to conduct experiments with different segmentation architectures to strengthen the results.
