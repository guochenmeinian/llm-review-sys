Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to inverse protein folding (IPF) using discrete diffusion models. The authors propose specific enhancements to discrete diffusion, including a BLOSUM weighted transition kernel, secondary structure auxiliary prediction, and the use of DDIM for accelerated sampling, achieving state-of-the-art performance on established benchmarks. The exploration of non-autoregressive models is particularly significant due to its potential for improved accuracy and speed. The paper also analyzes accuracy across different residue classes, such as surface exposure and designability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and effectively communicates complex ideas, making it accessible.
- It introduces a novel application of discrete diffusion models to IPF, leveraging biological knowledge to enhance sampling.
- The method demonstrates superior performance in terms of perplexity and recovery rate, with a focus on generating diverse sequence candidates.

Weaknesses:
- There is insufficient comparison with alternative discrete diffusion methods, lacking a thorough discussion on the merits of D3PM versus other approaches.
- The analysis of foldability is limited; the relationship between sequence recovery and foldability needs more exploration, as higher recovery rates do not always correlate with better foldability.
- The paper contains some inconsistencies in benchmark numbers and lacks clarity in the use of secondary structure information during sampling.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on alternative discrete diffusion methods, providing a more comprehensive comparison with approaches like analog bits and latent diffusion. Additionally, including a benchmark on foldability would enhance the understanding of the relationship between sequence recovery and foldability. Clarifying the discrepancies in benchmark numbers and providing a detailed explanation of how secondary structure information is utilized during sampling would also strengthen the paper. Finally, addressing the minor typographical errors and improving the clarity of mathematical notation would enhance the overall presentation.
