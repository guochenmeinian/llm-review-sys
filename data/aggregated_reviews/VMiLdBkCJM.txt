Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an augmentation technique in the frequency domain, motivated by frequency bias and shortcut learning, aimed at enhancing domain generalization (DG). The authors propose Adversarial Amplitude Uncertainty Augmentation (AAUA) and Adversarial Amplitude Dropout (AAD) to adversarially perturb and drop out frequency components that models over-rely on for classification. The combination of AAUA and AAD is intended to improve domain generalization by avoiding frequency shortcut learning. The paper demonstrates that these techniques enhance model performance across various benchmarks, including image classification and instance retrieval tasks. The authors also explore the connection between corruption robustness and DG, suggesting that Out-of-Distribution (OOD) robustness may be a single-source DG problem, and clarify that dominant frequencies in natural images are typically low frequencies, which carry significant information.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction effectively outlines the domain generalization problem and its relation to frequency bias and shortcut learning.
2. The proposed method shows improved domain generalization without sacrificing in-domain accuracy on PACS.
3. The ablation study provides insightful observations on the necessity of applying both AAUA and AAD together to mitigate shortcut learning, indicating that certain domains benefit from the AAUA method focused on low frequencies.
4. The authors provide additional evaluations on PACS and CIFAR-10, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach in mitigating frequency shortcuts.

Weaknesses:
1. The contributions could be presented more compactly, and the claim of being the first to address frequency shortcuts in domain generalization is uncertain, given the broad nature of the topic.
2. The paper lacks a comprehensive review of related works beyond FACT and SADA, omitting techniques like VIPAug, AFA, and HybridAugment++.
3. The discussion on the relationship between DG and general robustness lacks clarity and measurable criteria for distribution shifts.
4. The evaluation metrics for frequency shortcuts, specifically average TPR and FPR, may not be robust, as indicated by inconsistencies with prior studies.
5. Some statements, such as those in lines 327-328, are vague regarding the comparison methodology.
6. The theoretical justification in Section 3.2 lacks direct mathematical relevance to the proposed techniques.
7. The definitions of masks for low and high-frequency components require clarification, particularly the choice of h_min and w_min.
8. The experimental evaluation is limited, lacking comparisons with other frequency augmentation techniques and comprehensive tests on larger datasets like ImageNet-1k.
9. Hyper-parameter selection and its potential impact on empirical results need further clarification to avoid overstating method performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and compactness of the contribution points and provide a more thorough literature review that includes additional related works. We suggest clarifying vague statements regarding comparison methodologies and ensuring that theoretical justifications directly relate to the proposed techniques. Additionally, the authors should clarify the definitions of frequency masks and consider expanding their experimental evaluations to include comparisons with other frequency augmentation techniques and larger datasets. We urge the authors to improve the clarity of the connection between corruption robustness and DG by providing measurable criteria for distribution shifts. A more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method's effectiveness in mitigating frequency shortcuts is necessary, potentially incorporating both average and class-wise metrics. We encourage the authors to detail the hyper-parameter selection process, including the space of hyperparameters searched and the external validation set used, to enhance the transparency of their results. Finally, the authors should clarify their motivation regarding the relationship between frequency shortcuts and DG performance to avoid misinterpretation of their methodology.
