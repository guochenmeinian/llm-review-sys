### Key Points
This paper presents an approach to affective reasoning in conversation, formulated as a causal discrimination task aimed at classifying causal relationships between conversation turns. The authors propose an autoencoder architecture that incorporates i.i.d. noise to address implicit causes, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing methods in tasks such as Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction (ECPE) and Emotion-Cause Span Recognition (ECSR). The study highlights the limitations of current models in capturing specific causal relationships and introduces a structural causal model (SCM) to overcome these challenges.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized and clearly describes the task and problem.
- It demonstrates a strong understanding of existing research and provides a valid hypothesis with technical descriptions.
- The proposed methods significantly outperform state-of-the-art models, including GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, in affective reasoning tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The treatment of confounding bias and the backdoor problem is relatively weak compared to previous studies on causality.
- The task description lacks clarity, leading to concerns about the triviality of the causal relationships identified.
- The writing is often opaque, with numerous abbreviations that may confuse readers, and some technical terms are not well-defined.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the task description to address concerns about the triviality of causal relationships. Additionally, we suggest providing more intuition regarding the connection between "implicit causes" and "i.i.d. noise" to strengthen the theoretical foundation. The authors should also consider reducing the number of abbreviations and ensuring that all terms are clearly defined to enhance readability. Finally, polishing the presentation of results and the abstract could further improve the paper's overall clarity and impact.
