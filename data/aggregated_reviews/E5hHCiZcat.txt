### Key Points
This paper presents a novel protocol that utilizes secure multi-party computation (MPC) techniques to perform differentially private selection in distributed settings. The authors propose an innovative approach combining integer secret sharing with MPC, addressing significant challenges in distributed computing and privacy. The Noise-and-round mechanism achieves near-central model utility in a distributed environment, and the empirical evaluation demonstrates the protocol's utility and scalability, particularly in a 3-server case.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach effectively addresses a critical gap in privacy guarantees in distributed settings.
- The combination of integer secret sharing with existing MPC techniques is methodologically sound.
- The theoretical analysis is complemented by extensive empirical evaluation, showing competitive performance with centralized algorithms.

Weaknesses:
- The empirical evaluation is limited to a 3-server case, suggesting a need for broader server configurations and diverse datasets.
- The use of MPC and secret sharing may introduce significant computation and communication overhead, which could be a disadvantage in resource-constrained environments.
- The paper does not adhere to standard formatting, particularly in references and citations.
- The abstract's narrative style is unconventional for technical publications, and the lack of a dedicated conclusion section is noted.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical evaluation by expanding it to include a wider range of server configurations and more diverse datasets. Additionally, addressing the potential resource intensity of MPC and secret sharing in practical applications would enhance the paper's applicability. We suggest revising the formatting to align with standard academic conventions, clarifying the abstract's style, and including a dedicated conclusion section. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the reference to quantum computing and provide a more formal version of the Proof of Corollary 4.1, along with clearer discussions in Sections 4.2 and 4.3 for readers less familiar with MPC.
