### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of query variability and its impact on offline information retrieval (IR) experiments, particularly focusing on the TREC 2013/2014 Web Track. The authors argue that TREC titles do not effectively represent user information needs, as evidenced by their findings that query formulations from the UQV dataset yield different system performance metrics compared to TREC queries. The paper emphasizes the need for a nuanced understanding of query representativeness and the implications of using single-query test collections.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and clearly articulates the central claim regarding the inadequacy of TREC titles as representative queries.
- It contributes to the ongoing discourse on query variability and its significance in IR research, building on the UQV dataset.

Weaknesses:
- The conclusions may be overstated, as they do not sufficiently address significant overlap with prior work that remains unacknowledged.
- The paper lacks a theoretical framework connecting its findings to established concepts in information retrieval, such as the "lexical gap" or "vocabulary problem."

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical grounding of their work by explicitly connecting their findings to established theories in information retrieval. Additionally, the authors should review and cite relevant literature, particularly the TOIS22 paper, to clarify the novelty of their contributions. It would also be beneficial to include a discussion on the potential effects of using TREC judgments alongside UQV judgments to provide a more comprehensive analysis. Furthermore, clarifying the methodology, including details on the 15 system variants and the rationale for excluding certain systems, would enhance the paper's clarity. Lastly, revising the presentation of figures to focus on the most relevant data points would improve readability.
