Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a methodology for predicting a model's performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) data without access to labels during testing. The authors identify pseudo-label shift as a key issue leading to underestimation of OOD errors and propose Confidence Optimal Transport (COT) and its variant, Confidence Optimal Transport with Thresholding (COTT), to address this. The effectiveness of these methods is validated through experiments on 10 datasets with various distribution shifts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation is clear, explaining the under-estimation issue through pseudo-label drift and leveraging optimal transport theory.
2. The code is available, enhancing reproducibility.
3. The experiments compellingly demonstrate that COT and COTT outperform existing methods in estimating OOD errors.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper's mathematical symbols are confusing, complicating understanding. For instance, the notation for predicted error varies, and the meanings of certain symbols need clarification.
2. The relationship between pseudo-label drift and true target error is inadequately explained, particularly regarding its status as a lower bound.
3. The work may be vulnerable to imbalanced test sets and cases where the test label space is a subset of the training set.
4. The theoretical support for the method is insufficient, and the assumptions regarding label distributions may conflict with the goal of detecting OOD errors.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by harmonizing mathematical symbols and providing explanations after each equation. Additionally, we suggest elaborating on the relationship between pseudo-label shift and true target error, particularly in Section 2.4. It would be beneficial to discuss the potential vulnerabilities of the method concerning imbalanced test sets and subsets of label spaces. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the assumptions regarding label distributions and provide more theoretical support for their methodology. Lastly, addressing the role of the Wasserstein distance and the significance of the proposed lower bounds would enhance the manuscript's rigor.
