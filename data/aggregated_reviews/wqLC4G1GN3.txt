Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to solving inverse problems using optimal control theory, specifically through the iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) algorithm. The authors redefine the generative process of diffusion models as a discrete optimal control problem, enabling the handling of various differentiable forward measurement operators. The proposed method, termed diffusion optimal control, demonstrates promising results in tasks such as super-resolution, inpainting, and deblurring, establishing a new baseline in image reconstruction. Additionally, the authors claim robustness to score approximation errors, differentiating their method from existing algorithms like DPS by utilizing true simulated forward dynamics. While the authors provide additional empirical results that address some reviewer concerns, questions remain regarding the theoretical underpinnings of their claims and the competitiveness of their results against state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The introduction of a framework based on optimal control theory represents a significant theoretical advancement over traditional probabilistic sampling methods.  
2. The empirical performance is strong, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets such as FFHQ.  
3. The writing is generally clear and concise, providing good intuitions and theoretical support for the proposed method.  
4. The authors have provided detailed responses and additional experiments that clarify previous concerns and improve empirical evaluation.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The method's complexity, particularly the need to compute Jacobian and Hessian matrices, may hinder implementation and understanding for practitioners unfamiliar with optimal control theory.  
2. The computational cost is high, with concerns about the runtime and efficiency of the iLQR algorithm, which may require many iterations to converge.  
3. The experiments are limited, lacking diverse datasets and comparisons with additional baseline methods, particularly in nonlinear inverse problems.  
4. The theoretical justification for the claimed robustness to score approximation is unclear, as it relies on assumptions that need further clarification.  
5. The proposed method's performance is not competitive with existing methods, particularly in terms of runtime and empirical results across different datasets.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including more diverse datasets, such as MRI reconstruction or other medical images, to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method. Additionally, a detailed runtime analysis of the proposed method compared to other baselines should be included to clarify its computational efficiency. We also suggest that the authors address the questions raised regarding the purpose of injecting control vectors, the use of gradients and Hessians within the framework, and provide clearer explanations of notations and assumptions throughout the paper. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the theoretical framework by clearly defining the assumptions regarding \(x_t\) and the conditions under which their method operates. Finally, providing comparative results against a broader range of baselines, including FPS and recent resampling strategies, will better assess the performance of their method and enhance the manuscript's clarity.
