Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of causal inference within additive noise models (ANMs) by introducing the concept of "$R^2$-sortability," which generalizes var-sortability and is invariant to rescaling. The authors demonstrate that sorting variables based on $R^2$ can yield effective causal discovery performance and investigate how data generation parameters influence $R^2$-sortability. The paper also critiques existing benchmarks, highlighting potential issues with simulated datasets that may exhibit high $R^2$ sortability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The clarity of the paper is commendable, effectively motivating the introduction of $R^2$-sortability and detailing the experimental setup.
- The contribution is significant as it addresses deficiencies in current evaluation methods for causal structure learning, particularly in synthetic data contexts.

Weaknesses:
- The practical implications of $R^2$ sortability are not thoroughly explored; the paper lacks concrete examples of real-world datasets to substantiate the significance of the findings.
- The experimental results are sometimes unclear, particularly regarding the performance comparison between $R^2$-SortnRegress and Var-SortnRegress, with some results appearing tautological.
- The theoretical analysis is limited, leaving questions about the generalizability of the findings beyond linear ANMs and the influence of linear parameters in non-tree structures.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the take-home messages from the experiments, particularly in relation to the performance of $R^2$-SortnRegress compared to Var-SortnRegress. Additionally, the authors should provide more concrete examples of real-world datasets to clarify the practical significance of $R^2$ sortability. A more comprehensive theoretical analysis would enhance the understanding of whether the issues identified are specific to linear models or applicable to nonlinear cases. Furthermore, addressing the clarity issues raised in the weaknesses section, such as the notation inconsistencies and the motivations behind certain equations, would strengthen the paper.
