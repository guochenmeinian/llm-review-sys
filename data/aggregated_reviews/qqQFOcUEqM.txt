### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for zero-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) detection by utilizing pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) and constructing a Conjugated Semantic Pool (CSP) to enhance the semantic pool for OOD labels. The CSP employs modified superclass names to cluster similar properties across categories, aiming to increase the activation probability of OOD labels while ensuring low mutual dependence among them. The authors demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing methods, achieving a 7.89% enhancement in FPR95.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Originality: The introduction of conjugated semantic labels for enriching the semantic pool is a valuable contribution to OOD detection.
2. Theoretical Underpinnings: The authors provide a robust theoretical framework, including mathematical models that justify the CSP's effectiveness.
3. Empirical Validation: Extensive experiments validate the proposed method's superiority over current state-of-the-art techniques.
4. Clarity: The paper is well-structured and easy to understand, with a clear definition of the problem and proposed solutions.

Weaknesses:
1. The ablation study indicates competitive performance without the CSP, raising questions about the OOD score function's contribution when CSP is not used.
2. The paper lacks a thorough exploration of how the CSP addresses synonym issues and potential semantic overlap within the CSP.
3. A more systematic analysis of the CSP's impact on the Place and Texture datasets is needed, particularly regarding design principles.
4. The distinction between citations and contributions is ambiguous, particularly concerning the NegLabel framework.
5. The method's description is concise, making it difficult for readers to grasp the implementation details, such as superclass selection and the impact of negative labels.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the ablation study by explicitly detailing the performance sources when CSP is not employed and how the OOD score function can be utilized in such scenarios. Additionally, we suggest a deeper exploration of how the CSP mitigates synonym issues and addresses potential semantic overlap. A systematic analysis of the CSP's effects on the Place and Texture datasets should be included, linking performance improvements to specific design choices. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the relationship between their work and the NegLabel framework by providing explicit references and discussing the originality of their contributions. Lastly, we advise expanding the method's description to include pseudocode and detailed explanations of the implementation process, particularly regarding superclass selection and the impact of negative labels on OOD detection performance.
