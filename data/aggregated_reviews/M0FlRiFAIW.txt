### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method, PatchGD, for training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on large images by processing randomly selected patches. The authors claim that this approach allows for efficient training with fewer resources while achieving results that outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. However, the evaluation results are deemed unreliable, and the contributions are vaguely formulated, particularly regarding the relationship between the proposed method and existing techniques like DeiT and PatchGAN.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- The proposed method is simple and opens avenues for future research.
- Preliminary evaluations show promising results, outperforming SOTA methods with reduced resource requirements.

Weaknesses:
- Important information is missing, including a limitations section, risks section, background study, and ablation study, making it difficult to assess the work's impact.
- The evaluation lacks depth, with insufficient details on methodology and experimental setup, raising concerns about reproducibility.
- No assessment of training and inference time is provided, which is crucial for understanding the efficiency of the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the manuscript by including a limitations section and a discussion of potential risks associated with the proposed method. Additionally, providing a background study and conducting an ablation study would enhance the evaluation of the method's impact. To address reproducibility concerns, please include links to code, details on hardware setup, and clarify the patch_extractor function from Algorithm 2. Furthermore, we suggest evaluating the training and inference time to understand the implications of patching on efficiency. Lastly, we recommend correcting the statement regarding image sizes to "<300x300 px" for clarity.
