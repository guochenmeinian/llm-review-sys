### Key Points
This paper presents a non-amortized variational inference approach for solving large-scale Bayesian inference problems using diffusion-based probabilistic models as priors. The authors propose minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between a variational posterior and the true posterior, utilizing a lower bound on the log probability of the diffusion model's marginal. This method is validated on MRI, CelebA, and Cifar datasets, demonstrating efficiency in training time and memory usage compared to previous methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method significantly reduces computational time and memory costs while maintaining similar performance to existing approaches.
- The problem is well-motivated, particularly in the context of real-world applications like Accelerated MRI.
- The explanation of the method is clear, allowing for reproducibility by practitioners.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation of variational inference as sampling from a true Bayesian posterior is somewhat overstated, as it only approximates the posterior distribution.
- Numerical evaluations and comparisons with other algorithms are insufficient, particularly in assessing the distance to the true posterior and the complexity of the proposed method relative to others.
- The justification for selecting diffusion models over alternative generative models is lacking, and comparisons with amortized normalizing flows should be included.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the numerical evaluation by including comparisons with analytically available posteriors and employing metrics such as the sliced Wasserstein or KL divergence. Additionally, the authors should clarify the computational complexity of their method in comparison to other posterior sampling methods. A thorough examination of the advantages and disadvantages of diffusion models as priors, including comparisons with amortized normalizing flows, would enhance the paper's contribution. Finally, addressing the concerns regarding the computational cost and scalability of the non-amortized variational inference scheme would strengthen the overall argument.
