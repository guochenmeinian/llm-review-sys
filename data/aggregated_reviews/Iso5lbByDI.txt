### Key Points
This paper analyzes Gesture Area Coverage (GAC) and introduces metrics to evaluate human gesture motion, aiming to assess human likeness independently of appropriateness. The findings suggest that these metrics, particularly the Dice Score, show potential as gesture evaluation methods, correlating with subjective human-likeness ratings, though not statistically significant.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The approach to gesture evaluation is novel and well-motivated.  
- The proposed metrics demonstrate some correlation with subjective human evaluations.  
- The methodology is intuitive, well-structured, and the paper is concise and clearly written.  

Weaknesses:  
- The caption for Figure 2 lacks a true positive description.  
- Further analysis is needed regarding the concentration of poses in specific gesture spaces, influenced by gesture style or speaker identity.  
- The comparison of the NA ground truth sequence against GENEA results may not adequately reflect human-likeness; using a complete set of poses could provide a better evaluation.  
- The coding of pixels as occupied or not does not account for frequency of gestures, which could impact the metric, particularly with varying sequence lengths.  
- There is a question regarding the sufficiency of data for using FGD.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the caption for Figure 2 by including a true positive description. Additionally, further analysis should be conducted to explore how pose concentration affects the metrics based on gesture style or speaker identity. The authors should consider using a complete set of poses for comparison to enhance the evaluation of human-likeness. It would also be beneficial to discuss the impact of gesture frequency and sequence length on the metrics. Lastly, clarification regarding the release of the code would increase the work's value.
