### Key Points
This paper presents a new dataset for cross-language question answering focused on 10 African languages, along with English and French. The authors provide a collection procedure, feature analysis, and benchmarking on the cross-lingual retrieval task. The dataset is claimed to be the first open-retrieval resource of its kind for these languages, and the manuscript is well-written and motivated.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Valuable resource creation and good benchmarking.
- Clear experiments with a large set of proposed experiments.
- Comparison of human and machine translations is well-executed.
- The dataset is released under a Creative Commons license.

Weaknesses:
- Some details regarding corpus construction and experiments are missing.
- The paper structure is unintuitive, with the related work section needing repositioning for clarity.
- Quality control measures for translations are not fully explained.
- Certain decisions lack justification, and the imbalance in unanswerable questions raises concerns.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the corpus construction details and provide justifications for their decisions, particularly regarding the selection of the 10 languages. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the quality control section to clarify how translation quality is monitored and evaluated. The authors should also consider restructuring the paper to place the related work section before the experiments for better flow. Finally, we advise addressing the imbalance of unanswerable questions and revising the claim in footnote 6 regarding Googleâ€™s coverage of certain languages.
