Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents S2GCSL (Simple yet Scalable Granger Causal Structural Learning), a novel method for learning Granger causal graphs from topological event sequences in telecommunication networks. The authors propose a scalable approach using a linear kernel to model interactions and gradient descent for optimizing the likelihood function, while incorporating expert knowledge as constraints to enhance interpretability. The effectiveness and scalability of S2GCSL are validated through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its potential for fault diagnosis in complex telecommunication networks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The originality of S2GCSL lies in its innovative formulation for Granger causal discovery tailored to non-i.i.d. topological event sequences, integrating expert knowledge to improve interpretability.
- The methodology is robust, employing linear kernels and gradient descent optimization, supported by extensive experiments that validate its performance.
- The clarity of the paper is commendable, with well-structured sections and clear explanations, making complex concepts accessible.
- The significance of the work is substantial, addressing critical scalability issues in telecommunication networks and offering potential applications in other complex systems.

Weaknesses:
- The method is implemented on batch data, raising concerns about its applicability for real-time fault diagnosis and decision-making in telecommunication networks.
- The performance relies on several hyperparameters, such as the geodesic distance k and regularization coefficients \(\lambda_1\) and \(\lambda_2\), with insufficient guidance provided for tuning these parameters.
- The assumptions regarding Poisson processes and stationarity may limit the method's robustness in real-world scenarios, necessitating exploration of adaptations for non-stationary environments and over-dispersed data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the ability of S2GCSL to enable real-time processing and decision-making, possibly by considering an online learning setting that updates the causal model as new data arrives. Additionally, the authors should provide more detailed guidelines for tuning hyperparameters across various network settings and address how S2GCSL can handle incomplete or inaccurate expert knowledge. Exploring adaptations for non-stationary environments and discussing the method's performance on different network topologies would also enhance the paper's applicability and robustness.
