Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a versatile flexible-captioning vision-language model called FlexCap, which generates region-specific descriptions with controllable lengths. The authors utilize a large-scale dataset of image-text-box triplets to facilitate this flexible region captioning task. FlexCap demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in visual question answering (VQA) and other tasks by integrating generated descriptions into a large language model (LLM).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a novel mechanism for controlling complexity in region captioning.
2. It provides a large-scale dataset that can advance research in visual-controllable captioning.
3. FlexCap achieves impressive performance in VQA and other related tasks.

Weaknesses:
1. Concerns arise regarding the dataset's construction, particularly the lack of human involvement, which may affect the correctness and diversity of generated sentences. Additionally, there is insufficient statistical analysis of description length distributions.
2. The paper lacks detailed information on baseline models, including backbone types and parameter scaling, which are crucial for performance comparison.
3. The evaluation methodology is limited, relying solely on CLIP similarity without exploring alternative mapping methods. Insights into evaluating information density for generated captions are also missing.
4. The architecture appears conventional, and the authors should clarify how FlexCap outperforms similar models and the influence of the prefix token on performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset construction process by incorporating human involvement to enhance the correctness and diversity of generated sentences. Additionally, providing statistics on length distributions of descriptions would strengthen the dataset's contribution. It is essential to include detailed information about baseline models, including backbone types and parameter scaling, in the results tables. We suggest exploring rule-based verbalization methods alongside CLIP similarity for evaluation and providing insights into how to assess information density in generated captions. Finally, the authors should discuss the unique aspects of FlexCap's architecture and clarify the impact of the prefix token on performance compared to existing models.
