Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework called Automatic Red-Teaming (ART) aimed at identifying safety risks in text-to-image models. The authors propose a multi-agent approach that integrates vision language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) to generate prompts that expose model vulnerabilities. The framework is validated through extensive experiments on popular models like Stable Diffusion and is supported by three large-scale red-teaming datasets. The results indicate ART's effectiveness in generating safe prompts that can elicit harmful outputs from target models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The ART framework represents a significant innovation in text-to-image model safety, effectively combining LLMs and VLMs.
2. The introduction of three large-scale red-teaming datasets enhances the ability of the research community to study model safety.
3. Comprehensive experiments validate ART's effectiveness across various models and settings.
4. The framework demonstrates adaptability, generalizing to diverse categories of harmful content.
5. The paper is well-written and presents a clear motivation for protecting users from unsafe content.

Weaknesses:
1. The complexity of the ART framework, involving multiple stages of fine-tuning and interactions, may hinder implementation and reproducibility.
2. The reliance on pre-trained models could limit accessibility for some researchers and developers.
3. Evaluation metrics, while comprehensive, could benefit from further detail to address nuanced aspects of model safety and performance.
4. The proposed evaluation depends heavily on the accuracy of toxic text and image detectors, which requires verification.
5. The datasets used for fine-tuning may contain biases that affect the discovery of certain harmful content types.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the evaluation metrics to encompass more nuanced aspects of model safety. Additionally, we suggest including accuracy reports for the detectors used in the evaluation to enhance completeness. It would also be beneficial to compare the proposed method with Adversarial Nibbler in the discussion and experiments to provide a clearer context for its effectiveness. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to conduct quantitative evaluations on other online models, such as Midjourney, to better demonstrate the method's performance across different systems. Lastly, simplifying the ART framework or providing more detailed implementation guidelines could facilitate broader adoption and reproducibility.
