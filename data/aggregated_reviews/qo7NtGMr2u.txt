Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for continuous symmetry detection under the manifold assumption, focusing on identifying infinitesimal generators of flows corresponding to symmetries. The authors propose a flow-based symmetry detection method that estimates a vector field by solving polynomial regression. Additionally, the paper introduces a framework for evaluating non-affine symmetry detection through vector fields and addresses concerns regarding the comparison with LieGAN, demonstrating the advantages of their method. The method is evaluated on three toy datasets and a classification dataset, showing competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods like LieGAN, particularly in scarce data regimes. However, the evaluation metrics used, particularly cosine similarity for coefficients of predetermined models, raise significant academic concerns regarding their applicability and potential for misunderstanding in future research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The connection between symmetry and invariance in dynamical systems is innovative, emphasizing the identification of infinitesimal generators rather than explicit symmetries.  
- The exposition is generally clear, with numerous examples provided.  
- The method offers a computationally efficient alternative to existing techniques like LieGAN.  
- The authors provide a clear benefit of their method over LieGAN, supported by additional experiments.  
- The discussion on evaluating symmetry detection in the space of vector fields is a notable improvement over previous approaches.  
- The introduction of a new evaluation metric that does not rely on predetermined models is a positive step forward.

Weaknesses:  
- The presentation requires significant improvement, including standardizing terminology and ensuring self-contained content.  
- The capabilities and limitations of the proposed method are inadequately discussed, particularly regarding the assumptions under which the algorithms operate.  
- Experiments primarily on toy datasets do not convincingly demonstrate applicability to real-world problems, and results for affine symmetry detection appear less favorable than those of LieGAN.  
- The evaluation metric based on cosine similarity for coefficients is incomplete and potentially misleading, particularly when the ground truth vector field does not align with the predetermined model.  
- The paper lacks sufficient discussion on how non-affine symmetry should be evaluated, which could mislead future researchers.  
- The similarity metric's dependence on the choice of bounding volume and coordinates raises concerns about its geometric interpretation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by standardizing terminology and providing explanations for unfamiliar concepts. It is essential to explicitly state the assumptions under which the algorithms operate, particularly regarding the parameterization of data and the nature of the symmetry groups. Additionally, we suggest conducting more extensive experiments on diverse datasets to better validate the method's applicability to real-world scenarios. Addressing the impact of pre-determined models for machine learning functions and vector fields in experiments would also strengthen the paper's contributions. Furthermore, we recommend improving the clarity of the evaluation metric by explicitly stating its limitations, particularly that it is not defined on vector fields themselves but depends on the choice of parametric representations. Including at least one more experiment where the predetermined model does not cover the ground truth vector field would clarify that finding a suitable evaluation metric for this scenario is an important future work. Qualitative results showing both ground truth and estimated vector fields should also be included. Lastly, please address the concerns regarding the vector field similarity's dependence on the bounding volume and the geometric meaning of the current formula for $\mathrm{sim}\left(X,Y\right)$.
