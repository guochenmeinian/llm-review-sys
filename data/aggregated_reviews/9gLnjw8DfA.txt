Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Digital Typhoon dataset, a comprehensive collection of satellite imagery focused on tropical cyclones in the Western North Pacific basin, spanning over four decades. The dataset is notable for its extensive temporal coverage and is accompanied by a Python library for user interaction. The authors provide benchmarks for various tasks, establishing a foundation for future research in machine learning related to tropical cyclones. The dataset specifically utilizes infrared images from the IR1 band due to its long history and data quality. While the authors acknowledge the dataset's limitations, including its focus on a specific geographic region and the exclusion of higher-resolution images, they indicate that future releases may incorporate multispectral images and higher-resolution data. They also address concerns regarding the interpretability of RMSE values for non-domain experts and the dataset's applicability across different regions and satellites.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset's extensive temporal coverage is a significant contribution to the field.
- Leveraging long-term IR1 data provides a robust foundation for machine learning applications.
- Integration with the Digital Typhoon website and a Python package enhances accessibility and usability.
- The authors demonstrate a willingness to address reviewer concerns and improve the paper based on feedback.
- Clear explanations are provided regarding the dataset's structure, limitations, and future enhancements.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset currently focuses solely on infrared images, limiting its potential applications.
- The exclusion of higher-resolution images and other spectral bands raises questions about the dataset's utility for certain applications.
- The dataset's focus on a specific geographic region limits its global applicability.
- The benchmarks lack additional baselines, particularly in forecasting, which could strengthen the evaluation.
- Some sections lack clarity, particularly regarding the rationale behind dataset divisions and the impact of different projections.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset by including all available data channels (visual, IR, etc.) to enhance its utility and expand its scope to include other regions and spectral bands, such as the visible spectrum. Additionally, it would be beneficial to provide a clearer explanation of the dataset construction choices, including the rationale behind the uneven division of the dataset into three buckets for the reanalysis task. We suggest that the authors include higher-resolution images in future releases and document tasks and areas for further research more thoroughly, especially for users without significant meteorological expertise. Furthermore, including a section that quantifies the impact of different projections on various tasks would be beneficial. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the expected timeframe for dataset updates and to provide end-to-end examples or code for the benchmark results to facilitate user understanding, while also addressing the clarity of certain sections and ensuring consistent terminology throughout the paper to enhance its overall readability.
