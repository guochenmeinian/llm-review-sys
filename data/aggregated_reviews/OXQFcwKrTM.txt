### Key Points
This paper presents an NLP engineering experiment focused on the development and evaluation of a SalesBot and ShopperBot using large language models (LLMs) for e-commerce. The authors propose a conversational recommender system (CRS) that not only provides product recommendations but also aims to educate users about products. The evaluation includes 150 generated dialogs rated by both LLMs and human salespeople, revealing that while SalesBot achieves fluency and informativeness, its recommendation quality falls short compared to human counterparts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors demonstrate the feasibility of a fully LLM-based chatbot development and evaluation, yielding promising results.
- A thorough literature review and evaluation methodology are presented, including comparisons with human salespeople.
- The exploration of educational value in CRS is a novel contribution, supported by a combination of human evaluation and NLI-based analysis.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation lacks detailed descriptions of quiz questions and the motivation behind the evaluation criteria and metrics.
- The framework's recommendation quality is significantly lower than that of human salespeople, and the novelty of the proposed system is questionable.
- There is insufficient comparison with other chatbots or recommender systems, and the analysis of ablation studies is lacking.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the evaluation by providing detailed descriptions of the quiz questions and the rationale for the evaluation criteria and metrics. Additionally, the authors should conduct comparisons with existing chatbots and recommender systems to establish the novelty of their framework. A technical figure illustrating the proposed framework would enhance understanding, and a more thorough analysis of the ablation study results should be included to inform future conversational agent design.
