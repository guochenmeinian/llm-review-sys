### Key Points
This paper presents a self-supervised contrastive learning method for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) aimed at addressing the scarcity of labeled data in event-based vision. The authors propose a dual pipeline that includes both a conventional non-spiking model and an SNN, optimized using the VICReg loss. The method shows improved performance in downstream classification tasks on datasets like CIFAR10-DVS and N-CARS, particularly in low-data scenarios. However, the approach's reliance on paired data for contrastive learning may limit its applicability in practical setups.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed method effectively addresses the challenge of limited labeled data for SNN pre-training.  
- Significant performance improvements are demonstrated in downstream tasks, indicating the method's effectiveness.  
- The architecture and methodology are clearly articulated, showcasing potential for broader applications in neuromorphic vision.  

Weaknesses:  
- The requirement for paired data may restrict the method's practical use.  
- The "proxy" alignment approach could complicate the contrastive learning process.  
- The paper lacks a significant academic contribution, which is essential for workshop extended abstracts.  
- Excessive citations, particularly 77 for a 4-page paper, may detract from clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their citations, particularly by reducing the number of references to enhance focus. Additionally, exploring other pre-training schemes in the literature for SNNs could strengthen the paper's context. The authors should also clarify the observed discrepancies in test accuracy across varying train set sizes, particularly in the CIFAR10-DVS and N-CARS datasets. Lastly, we suggest that the authors consider developing a method that does not rely on paired data to enhance the practical applicability of their approach.
