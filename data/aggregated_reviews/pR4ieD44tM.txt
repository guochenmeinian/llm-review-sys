### Key Points
This paper presents a detailed analysis of mobile network performance in Brazil, utilizing a large-scale dataset from a major Mobile Network Operator (MNO). The study investigates the impact of device characteristics and infrastructure on throughput performance, emphasizing the disparities between developed and developing regions. The findings are pertinent for network operators and application developers, highlighting the necessity for region-specific guidelines to enhance mobile web optimizations and infrastructure investments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The analysis employs a comprehensive dataset of 176 million measurement sessions from over 7 million devices, ensuring strong statistical significance.
- The novel statistical methodology combines traditional techniques with machine learning, providing a robust framework for understanding network performance.
- The inclusion of both pre- and post-pandemic data offers valuable insights into the evolution of mobile infrastructure.
- The findings have practical implications for stakeholders in developing regions, addressing biases in existing measurements.

Weaknesses:
- The focus on a single country limits the generalizability of the findings; data from other similar markets would enhance this aspect.
- The exclusive use of Android devices may overlook insights from iOS users, who could represent a different demographic.
- The reliance on data from a single MNO raises concerns about market representation.
- Some technical methodologies, such as the matched-pairs approach, require further elaboration for clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the accessibility of the paper by providing brief explanations of technical terms, such as SHAP analysis. Additionally, the authors should consider including data from other MNOs and iOS devices to enhance the generalizability of their findings. Clarifying the potential biases introduced by using data from a single MNO is essential. We also suggest that the authors elaborate on the causes of performance changes before and after the pandemic and discuss the implications of signal strength on throughput in greater depth. Finally, addressing the clarity of figures and providing a more rigorous citation of global versus local variations would strengthen the paper.
