Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a collaborative framework for multi-drone object trajectory prediction, named Drones Help Drones (DHD). The framework includes a Ground-prior-based BEV Generation (GBG) module for enhanced BEV representations and a Sparse Interaction via Sliding Windows (SISW) module for efficient information sharing. The authors also introduce a new dataset, "Air-Co-Pred," to support multi-drone collaborative prediction tasks. Experimental results indicate that DHD improves BEV accuracy and reduces communication bandwidth while maintaining high prediction performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper successfully implements an end-to-end multi-drone trajectory prediction system based on visual inputs, demonstrating originality in the collaborative object detection task.
- The GBG module innovatively uses inclined drone observations as geometric priors, significantly enhancing BEV accuracy for long-range aerial observations compared to existing baselines.
- The SISW module effectively balances limited inter-drone communication with the prediction task's information needs, outperforming previous strategies.
- The creation of the "Air-Co-Pred" dataset enriches resources for multi-drone research and serves as a valuable benchmark.

Weaknesses:
- The paper contains grammatical errors, typos, and formatting issues that need addressing for improved readability.
- The transmission volumes for collaboration strategies in Table 2 are unclear, and the rationale for bolding DHD results, which are not the best in every column, is questionable.
- The framework's evaluation is limited to simulated data, raising concerns about performance in real-world scenarios with sensor noise and communication delays.
- The methodology relies on established strategies from the literature, and the lack of comparison with other datasets limits the evaluation of the proposed dataset's quality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper's grammar, typos, and formatting issues, specifically addressing the errors noted in the review. Additionally, clarify the transmission volumes in Table 2 and provide a justification for the bolded results. We suggest exploring scenarios with varying numbers of drones to assess the impact on performance and discussing the effects of extrinsic bias on collaborative prediction. Furthermore, please provide more details about the Air-Co-Pred dataset, including drone settings and flight patterns, and include a detailed derivation process for the depth upper-bound equation. Lastly, consider conducting ablation studies to evaluate the contributions of each module in the DHD framework and compare the dataset with existing ones to validate its effectiveness.
