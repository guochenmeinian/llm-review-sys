### Key Points
This paper presents a scalable framework for the automatic generation of tables of contents (ToC) from ESG reports, introducing a new dataset called ESGDoc, which consists of 1093 ESG annual reports. The authors propose a method that constructs a tree structure from extracted text blocks, parsing sub-trees to capture contextual information and restructuring the tree based on node decisions. The approach demonstrates improvements in accuracy and efficiency over existing models, particularly in handling longer documents.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper contributes a new dataset that addresses more complex document structures than previous datasets.  
- The proposed method shows significant improvements in training time and performance over the baseline.  
- The experimental design is clear, with a strong baseline dataset comparison and an ablation study that enhances reproducibility.

Weaknesses:  
- The motivation for the work is underdeveloped, lacking clarity on the practical applications of the proposed solution.  
- The experiments are limited in scope, employing only one baseline and two problem sets, which raises questions about the generalizability of the results.  
- There is insufficient insight into the challenges of the ESGDoc task, particularly regarding the low accuracy of ToC extraction.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the articulation of the motivation behind their work, clearly outlining potential applications of the ToC extraction method. Additionally, we suggest expanding the experimental evaluation to include comparisons with other state-of-the-art models to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the proposed framework's effectiveness. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include an error analysis that explores the reasons behind the low accuracy in identifying ToC entries, such as the impact of document length and presentation diversity. Lastly, we advise clarifying the criteria used for annotating the ToC tree in ESGDoc and consider releasing the codebase and dataset to facilitate further research.
