Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Synthcity, a novel open-source Python library designed for benchmarking synthetic data generators. It addresses challenges in evaluating synthetic data quality, fairness, and privacy, offering a comprehensive suite of metrics, models, and user-friendly APIs. The library supports diverse use cases, enabling seamless integration of new algorithms and evaluation measures.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths include comprehensive GitHub documentation, user-friendly APIs, and a wide range of algorithms tailored for various data types. The library's structure facilitates quick learning and integration, promoting thorough evaluations of synthetic data generation models. However, weaknesses include the absence of state-of-the-art (SOTA) data generation metrics and models, particularly in privacy evaluations, which limits comprehensive assessments of privacy risks. Additionally, some users reported stability issues and unclear documentation beyond the initial pages.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the library by incorporating additional SOTA models and metrics, including:
- Data generation metrics such as the machine learning efficiency metric and metrics quantifying data copying.
- SOTA tabular data generation models like GREAT and STASY.
- Membership inference attacks, specifically LIRA and other recent likelihood-based attacks.
- Diverse privacy evaluations, including adversary instantiation for worst-case attack scenarios.

Furthermore, we suggest including usage examples in the paper to illustrate how to effectively utilize the library. Improving the organization and clarity of the writing, along with enhancing the overall documentation, will also elevate the quality and usability of Synthcity.
