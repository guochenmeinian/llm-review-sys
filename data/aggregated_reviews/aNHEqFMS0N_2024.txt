Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CREAM (Continuity-Relativity indExing with gAussian Middle), a method designed to extend the context window of large language models (LLMs) efficiently without extensive fine-tuning. CREAM addresses the "Lost in the Middle" problem by manipulating position indices and employing a truncated Gaussian distribution to enhance focus on the middle context. The authors demonstrate CREAM's effectiveness through comprehensive experiments, showing improved performance over existing methods like RandPos and PoSE.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- CREAM achieves superior performance across various long-context tasks, effectively addressing the "Lost in the Middle" issue.
- The method is novel, providing a significant contribution to the field of LLMs.
- Empirical evidence supports CREAM's efficiency, requiring fine-tuning only at the pre-trained context window size.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation of the method is unclear, particularly regarding the concepts of continuity and relativity in positional encoding, which lack sufficient explanation and formulation.
- The rationale behind splitting the pre-trained context into three segments and the effectiveness of truncated Gaussian sampling is not adequately justified.
- The generalizability of CREAM to other LLMs beyond the tested Llama2-7B model is uncertain, and the paper lacks a detailed comparative analysis with other contemporary methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by providing more detailed explanations and formulations for the concepts of continuity and relativity in positional encoding. Additionally, the authors should justify the choice of splitting the context into three segments and clarify how truncated Gaussian sampling mitigates the "Lost-in-the-Middle" problem. A more thorough comparative analysis with peer models, such as Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 and LongLoRA, is also suggested to enhance the paper's rigor. Finally, addressing the limitations of CREAM in a more explicit manner would improve the overall clarity and usefulness of the discussion.
