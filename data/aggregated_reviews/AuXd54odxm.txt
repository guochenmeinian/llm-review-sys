Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method, ERDiff, for aligning behavior-related neural population dynamics across different experimental sessions or between subjects, addressing the challenge of inter-subject variability and the low-dimensional manifold structure of neural activity dynamics. The authors propose utilizing a diffusion model to extract spatiotemporal structures from the source domain and apply maximum likelihood alignment (MLA) to the target domain. The method is validated against state-of-the-art techniques using both synthetic and real neural data, demonstrating its effectiveness in various contexts. Additionally, the authors explore domain adaptation methods for time-series data through experiments on two datasets: the Boiler Fault Detection Dataset and the City Air Quality Forecast Dataset, showing that ERDiff achieves superior performance across various domain transitions in both datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors developed a unique approach that captures latent spatiotemporal structure, enhancing time-series alignment.
- Comprehensive experimental results showcase the effectiveness of ERDiff in domain adaptation tasks.
- The method is validated against existing alignment techniques, showcasing its practical applicability.
- The inclusion of additional datasets enhances the generalizability of the findings.
- The clarity of the problem statement and the advantages of the proposed method are well articulated.
- Attention to implementation details, such as the use of LSTM_S2T as a baseline, strengthens the comparison framework.

Weaknesses:
- Clarity issues exist in figure and table legends, which need improvement for better understanding.
- The authors should clarify the novelty of their diffusion model approach compared to existing methods for discovering latent structures.
- Generalizability to other neural dynamics with varying dimensionality remains untested, raising concerns about the method's limitations.
- Some comparisons, although relevant, are not explicitly tested or mentioned in the manuscript, which may limit the perceived relevance of the method.
- There is uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of the unsupervised-CCA baseline, as it may not fully represent the capabilities of ERDiff without behavioral signals.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of figure and table legends to enhance reader comprehension. Additionally, the authors should explicitly state whether existing methods for discovering latent structures using diffusion models exist and how their architecture differs. To assess the method's robustness, we suggest evaluating its performance on data with varying dimensionality and addressing the computational costs and data demands associated with deep learning-based methods. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the manuscript by explicitly mentioning the relevant comparisons that were not tested, as this would emphasize the method's relevance. Lastly, we suggest that the authors consider comparing unsupervised-CCA with the ERDiff model that excludes behavioral signals from the source domain during VAE training, to provide a clearer understanding of the baseline's effectiveness.
