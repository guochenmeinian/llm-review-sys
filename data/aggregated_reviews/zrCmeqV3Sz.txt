Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach called Cluster Information Transfer (CIT) to address the structure shift problem in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The CIT mechanism computes cluster center representations during training, extracts cluster-independent information from node embeddings, and transfers this information to random cluster centers, enabling the model to learn structure-independent knowledge. The authors provide theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrating that CIT enhances the generalization ability of GNNs across various benchmark datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an important research problem, focusing on graph structural shifts, which is less explored compared to data distribution shifts.
- The proposed method is versatile, applicable to various GNN backbones and tasks.
- The presentation is clear, and the experiments are extensive, showing promising results.

Weaknesses:
- The CIT method lacks robust theoretical support; it does not sufficiently explain the necessity of transferring nodes across clusters or how invariant representations are learned.
- The introduction of numerous sensitive hyper-parameters complicates the method, and the accuracy improvements are not significant compared to baselines.
- The evaluation is limited to small graphs, raising questions about scalability to larger datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis of the CIT method, specifically addressing why transferring nodes across clusters is necessary and how invariant representations are achieved. Additionally, clarifying the assumptions regarding structural shifts and explicitly discussing the scope of these shifts would enhance the paper's rigor. We suggest including experiments on larger graphs and validating the method against simple baselines that modify graph structures. Lastly, addressing the clarity of experimental settings and correcting typos would improve the overall quality of the paper.
