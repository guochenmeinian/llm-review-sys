Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Effective Metric-based Exploration-bonus (EME), a novel exploration algorithm in reinforcement learning (RL) designed to enhance exploration in environments with sparse rewards. The authors critique existing methods for their limitations in scalability and theoretical guarantees, proposing a robust metric for evaluating state discrepancy that avoids approximation gaps and eliminates reliance on count-based scaling factors. EME introduces a diversity-enhanced scaling factor, dynamically adjusted by the variance of predictions from an ensemble of reward models, to improve exploration in tasks with subtle state differences. Extensive experiments across various environments demonstrate EME's superior performance and scalability compared to prior approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of existing metric-based exploration methods, effectively motivating the need for EME.
- Extensive experimental evaluation across diverse environments supports the effectiveness and scalability of EME.
- The introduction of a theoretically grounded metric for evaluating state discrepancy is backed by rigorous proofs and guarantees.
- The reward-free exploration experiment is particularly relevant for real-world applications where reward functions may be challenging to define.

Weaknesses:
- The complexity of the method may hinder reproducibility for future practitioners; clearer emphasis on Algorithm 1 could help.
- Limited ablation studies make it difficult to assess the sensitivity of EME to various hyperparameters, including the value of M.
- The performance of EME with feature encoders is mixed, potentially impacting its scalability in realistic scenarios.
- The paper does not adequately discuss computational efficiency and potential overheads introduced by EME.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Algorithm 1 by potentially moving it from the Appendix to the main paper to enhance reproducibility. Additionally, a thorough discussion of the computational complexity and runtime performance of EME compared to existing methods should be included. We suggest conducting detailed ablation studies to isolate the contributions of the diversity-enhanced scaling factor and other key components of EME. Finally, providing more intuitive explanations or examples in the theoretical analysis could help bridge the gap between theory and practical implications.
