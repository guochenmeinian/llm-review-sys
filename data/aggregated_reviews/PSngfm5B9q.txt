### Key Points
This paper studies communication-efficient topologies for decentralized learning, introducing the BASE-(k+1) GRAPH. The proposed topology offers four key advantages: (1) finite-time exact consensus; (2) a fast consensus rate with exact consensus achieved using $O(\log_{k+1} n)$ graphs; (3) arbitrary maximum degree ($1 \leq k \leq n-1$); and (4) arbitrary number of nodes. The authors assert that this is the first work to achieve exact consensus with graphs of length $O(\log_{k+1} n)$, improving upon the $O(\log_2 n)$ length of existing 1-peer exponential graphs. The algorithm employs k-peer hyper-hypercube graphs and simple base-(k+1) graphs, with a focus on reducing redundancy and enhancing efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and organized, providing clear illustrations and numerical experiments that demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed topologies.
- The BASE-(k+1) GRAPH allows for finite-time consensus for any number of nodes, and the bandwidth/speed trade-off can be controlled through the parameter k.

Weaknesses:
- The proof for the exact consensus of Algorithm 1 (k-peer hyper-hypercube graph) is insufficient.
- The proposed topologies are complex, which may limit practical applications due to potential issues like delayed communication and information loss.
- The paper lacks a detailed discussion of the state of the art, particularly in comparing finite-time consensus with efficient allreduce methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the proof for the exact consensus of Algorithm 1 to enhance its rigor. Additionally, providing a clearer description of how nodes can efficiently identify their neighbors in each graph would be beneficial. We suggest including comparisons with a broader range of existing topologies, such as Ring All-Reduce and Tree All-Reduce, to better demonstrate the advantages of the BASE-(k+1) GRAPH. Furthermore, a more detailed discussion on the decomposition of n and its impact on results would help clarify the methodology. Lastly, addressing the limitations regarding the algorithm's performance in heterogeneous networks would strengthen the paper.
