Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to learning halfspaces using unlabelled samples and strong prior information about the underlying distribution, specifically focusing on affine transformations of d-fold product distributions. The authors propose an algorithm that recovers the distribution up to total variation error, leveraging techniques such as data normalization, PCA, and sample re-weighting. The main result indicates that the direction of truncation can be efficiently discovered from unlabelled samples under certain conditions regarding the truncation region.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The theoretical results are well-presented, with a succinct proof of the main theorem.
- The paper explores an interesting connection between unsupervised and supervised learning, and the algorithm demonstrates polynomial time and sample complexity.
- Experimental results validate the theoretical claims, and the proposed techniques, such as contrastive moments, may have independent interest.

Weaknesses:
- The real-world applicability of the proposed method remains unclear, and the distributional assumptions are considered strong and restrictive.
- The paper lacks clarity in the problem definition, particularly regarding what is known and unknown to the learner.
- Some proofs, particularly those of Lemmas 1 and 4, are not sufficiently detailed, and there are inconsistencies in notation and terminology throughout the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the problem definition to specify what information is known to the learner. Additionally, the authors should consider relaxing the distributional assumptions to enhance the relevance of their results. Testing the method on real-world data would also strengthen the paper's applicability. Furthermore, we suggest providing more detailed explanations in the proofs, especially for Lemmas 1 and 4, and ensuring consistency in notation throughout the manuscript.
