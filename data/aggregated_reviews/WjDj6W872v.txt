### Key Points
This paper presents novel discoveries in policy optimization problems within reinforcement learning (RL), specifically demonstrating that the superlevel set of the objective function related to policy parameters is always connected and satisfies a stronger “equiconnectedness” property. The authors derive a minimax theorem for robust RL problems, showing that reward attack robust RL can achieve Nash equilibrium. The work enhances understanding of the optimization landscape in RL, particularly under tabular and neural policy representations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and organized, contributing significant theoretical insights into policy optimization in RL.  
- It establishes the connectedness of the superlevel set and its implications for minimax theorems, marking a novel contribution to the field.  
- The theoretical analysis and proofs are clearly presented.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks practical applications, as it does not include experiments or algorithms demonstrating the utility of the theoretical results.  
- There is uncertainty regarding the applicability of the minimax theorem to other robust RL scenarios, particularly when transition kernels are uncertain.  
- The connection between the theoretical results and algorithm design for robust RL problems remains unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the practical relevance of their work by designing a toy environment and conducting small experiments to explicitly demonstrate how the derived theorem can aid in developing better algorithms, in addition to the reward poisoning example. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors clarify the implications of their findings for algorithm design and address the challenges faced in establishing results for deep RL. Additionally, providing a discussion on the relationship between connectedness and existing properties like pseudo-linearity could enhance the paper's depth.
