### Key Points
This paper presents a method to enhance the candidate retrieval phase in few-shot entity linking tasks by employing a PLM-based keyword extractor to refine context and utilizing the BM25 retrieval model for candidate entity selection. The authors propose a distant supervision approach to extract relevant keywords, demonstrating significant improvements over traditional BM25 and dense retriever methods through experimental results on a subset of the ZeShEL dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well written, clearly organized, and presents a compelling motivation supported by experimental results.  
- The proposed method shows a significant boost in performance compared to existing approaches.  
- The study provides strong support for its claims and deepens understanding in the field.  

Weaknesses:  
- Some concepts, such as the bi-encoder and ELECTRA, require further explanation for clarity.  
- The keyword extraction method may introduce latency due to the need to predict scores for every token.  
- Evaluation is limited to a single dataset, raising questions about the method's generalizability across different datasets or domains.  
- Reproducibility may be hindered by underspecified parameter settings and the lack of widely available training/evaluation data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing detailed explanations of key concepts like the bi-encoder and ELECTRA. Additionally, the authors should consider conducting more extensive experiments across multiple datasets to validate the effectiveness of their method in diverse contexts. Addressing the potential latency issues associated with the keyword extraction method would also enhance the practical applicability of the proposed approach.
