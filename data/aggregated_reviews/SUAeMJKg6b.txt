### Key Points
This paper investigates the ability of GPT-4 to generate growth mindset supportive language (GMSL) reframings of teacher utterances in a classroom context. The authors propose a new taxonomy for annotating GMSL language, utilize it to prompt engineer GPT-4, and evaluate the perceived impact of these reframings through teacher and student feedback, as well as lexical analysis. The findings indicate that model responses are preferred over original teacher responses and encourage challenge-seeking behavior in students, as measured by survey responses. The study is notable for its novel application of large language models in education, supported by human evaluation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study effectively addresses the qualitative aspects of teacher-student dialogue, providing a dataset with two levels of critique by trained teachers.
- It exemplifies human-AI collaboration in a challenging context that could positively influence learning outcomes.
- The annotation framework and open-source dataset contribute valuable resources to the field.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation relies on hypothetical survey questions, raising concerns about the applicability of results to actual classroom settings and their impact on real student behavior and learning outcomes.
- Quantifying learning outcomes from teacher-student dialogue is complex, particularly when harsh feedback may be used to motivate students.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation methodology by incorporating real classroom scenarios to assess the actual impact of GMSL reframings on student behavior and learning outcomes. Additionally, we suggest providing more detailed descriptions of the annotation guide development process to enhance the validity of the framework. Finally, addressing how the contextual definition of GMSL varies by subject and teacher-student pairs could strengthen the study's implications.
