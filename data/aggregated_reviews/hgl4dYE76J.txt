Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the first large-scale UAV dataset aimed at addressing multi-object tracking and re-identification of wild animals, featuring 1.2 million annotations across 690 tracks in 12 video clips of 5.4K resolution. The authors provide a comprehensive description of the dataset's properties, including animal types and behaviors, alongside a detailed explanation of the data acquisition and annotation methodologies. The dataset is organized to facilitate reproduction, although it is noted to be unbalanced for object detection tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The dataset is significant for multi-object tracking (MOT) and re-identification (Re-ID) in wild animals.  
- The paper is well-written, with organized and detailed descriptions of the dataset and experiments.  
- The integration of drone technology for data collection is complex and valuable.  

Weaknesses:  
- The short length of trajectories raises questions about their adequacy for understanding animal behavior.  
- The definition of Re-ID is unconventional and may limit its applicability.  
- The dataset's imbalance for object detection tasks could lead to unreliable accuracy in model training and evaluation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset by including recent baseline methods for animal detection from notable conferences or journals, such as Fast-RCNN and YOLOv8, and consider methods specifically modified for wild animal detection. Additionally, addressing the dataset's imbalance through strategies like oversampling and data augmentation is crucial. Clarifying the role of Re-ID and discussing the biological implications of tracking performance metrics would enhance the paper's relevance. Finally, we suggest expanding the discussion on potential future directions for the dataset and its applications in both computer science and biology.
