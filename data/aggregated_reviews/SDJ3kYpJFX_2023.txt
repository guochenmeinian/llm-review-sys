Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new large-scale music dataset, DISCO-10M, comprising 11 million audio clips from 400,000 artists, collected through a systematic process involving Spotify and YouTube. The authors detail the data collection and filtering methods, emphasizing the dataset's potential for various music informatics applications, including music analysis, generative models, music genre recognition, and text embedding searches. They note that the community has begun utilizing the dataset for downstream tasks, such as music-style blending, which can enhance navigation and insights within the dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset addresses the long-standing scarcity of large-scale music data, providing a valuable resource for researchers.
- The clarity of the paper and the detailed description of data creation processes facilitate reproducibility.
- The authors acknowledge limitations and potential ethical issues, enhancing transparency.
- The dataset offers valuable tools for music genre recognition and text embedding searches, with evidence of community engagement for various applications.

Weaknesses:
- The analysis of data collection lacks depth, with insufficient systematic quality control and verification of matched YouTube videos.
- Important metadata, such as genre and lyrics, is missing, which could be significant for music information retrieval.
- The paper does not provide evidence of the dataset's effectiveness in improving music-related tasks, raising ethical concerns regarding copyright issues.
- The authors acknowledge a need for more applications to be demonstrated, and concerns regarding copyright are raised, despite their assertion of compliance with fair use in non-commercial research.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation and analysis of the data collection process, ensuring systematic quality control and verification of matched YouTube videos. Additionally, a more comprehensive comparison of DISCO-10M with existing datasets, focusing on genre distribution and overlapping tracks, would strengthen the paper's impact. We suggest demonstrating the dataset's usability through a specific task, such as self-supervised or semi-supervised learning. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the demonstration of additional applications for the dataset to enhance its utility. Providing clearer explanations of how the dataset adheres to copyright laws and the implications of fair use for potential users would also enhance the paper's credibility.
