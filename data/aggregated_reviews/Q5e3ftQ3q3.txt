### Key Points
This paper presents a novel algorithm, PSεBAI+, for ε-Best Arm Identification in Piecewise Stationary Linear Bandits (PSLB). The algorithm effectively identifies an arm with an average return close to the optimal under varying contexts and unknown changepoints, utilizing change detection and context alignment mechanisms. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for the algorithm's performance and substantiate these claims with empirical results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper proposes a new algorithm that integrates change detection and context alignment in a PSLB setting, optimized for identifying ε-optimal arms with minimal samples.
2. It includes a thorough theoretical analysis, offering proofs of high-probability performance and sample complexity bounds.
3. Empirical experiments validate the algorithm's efficiency and robustness.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a comparison with current state-of-the-art methods, which is crucial for demonstrating the novelty and superiority of the proposed approach.
2. There is no ablation study on parameters w and b, which could significantly impact performance based on past experiences replicating reference [10].
3. The justification for using a piecewise stationary model could be more robust, as real-world scenarios may involve more complex conditions.
4. The discussion on computational complexity is limited, requiring more detail on the computation for each major step of the algorithm.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with state-of-the-art methods to establish the novelty and superiority of PSεBAI+. Additionally, we suggest conducting an ablation study on parameters w and b to assess their impact on performance. The authors should also enhance the justification for the piecewise stationary model and provide a more comprehensive discussion on the computational complexity of the algorithm. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the context alignment process, including how the algorithm decides when to perform it and the methods used to judge similarity between contexts. Lastly, elaborating on the specific application of the G-optimal design in the algorithm would be beneficial.
