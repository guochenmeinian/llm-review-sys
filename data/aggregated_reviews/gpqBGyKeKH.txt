Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an empirical study of the spectral properties of finite-width neural network kernels, focusing on the linear-width regime where the sample size, input feature dimension, and layer width grow comparably. The authors analyze how the spectra of weight and kernel matrices evolve during training, revealing that the spectra remain invariant under low learning rates but exhibit spikes at higher learning rates, indicating feature learning. They categorize spectral distributions into invariant bulk, spikes, and heavy-tailed distributions, providing theoretical arguments for these observations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel perspective on analyzing feedforward networks through the linear-width regime, offering insights into spectral invariance and feature learning.
- The literature review is thorough, making the paper accessible for those new to spectral analysis.
- Experimental plots effectively illustrate the discussed phenomena, and the supplementary material includes additional experiments.

Weaknesses:
- The manuscript sacrifices depth for breadth, lacking a focused investigation of key phenomena, particularly the emergence of spikes in the spectra.
- The experiments are not systematic enough to clearly delineate the conditions under which specific phenomena occur, such as the relationship between learning rate and spectral changes.
- The theoretical results are primarily inequalities that may not be sharp, and the connection between adaptive optimizers and heavy-tailed spectra requires further elaboration.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the depth of their analysis by focusing on a smaller set of phenomena, particularly the transition region where spikes emerge in the spectra. Conducting systematic experiments that jointly sweep parameters like batch size and learning rate, similar to the approach in Atanasov et al., would clarify the conditions for spike emergence. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed empirical investigation of the heavy-tailed spectra and their implications for feature learning, as well as integrating the discussion of the BERT experiments more cohesively with the main findings. Lastly, clarifying the significance of the spectral distributions and enhancing figure clarity would improve the overall presentation.
