### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive study on the detection of polyglot files, which conform to multiple file formats and pose significant challenges for security systems. The authors propose a novel deep learning model, PolyConv, which achieves an F1 score of 99.20% for polyglot detection and 99.47% for file-format identification. Additionally, they introduce ImSan, a content disarmament tool that effectively sanitizes image-based polyglots. The research highlights the practical implications of polyglot files in cybersecurity and provides tools to enhance detection and mitigation strategies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study is the first systematic examination of polyglot file misuse in real-world scenarios, contributing valuable insights and tools.
- PolyConv significantly outperforms existing detection methods, demonstrating a high level of accuracy.
- The development of the Wild Polyglot dataset based on real-world usage is a noteworthy contribution.

Weaknesses:
- The focus on a limited set of file formats, particularly image-based polyglots, raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings.
- The model's reliance on raw bytes may hinder its effectiveness with very large files.
- The paper lacks clarity in certain definitions, such as "real polyglot," and contains inconsistencies regarding the Fazah tool's capabilities.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of definitions, particularly regarding "real polyglot," to avoid confusion. Additionally, addressing the discrepancies in the description of the Fazah tool and the number of covert formats would enhance the paper's accuracy. To bolster the model's effectiveness, we suggest that the authors explore strategies for adapting PolyConv to new file formats and consider releasing a sanitized version of the dataset for research purposes. Furthermore, a more detailed discussion on model optimization and the limitations of YARA rules would strengthen the theoretical foundation of the work. Finally, including a flowchart or diagram to illustrate the workflow of the proposed methods would improve comprehension.
