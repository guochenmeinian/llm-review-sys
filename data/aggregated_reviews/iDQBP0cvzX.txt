### Key Points
This paper presents a method for enhancing Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) by integrating text-based QA systems to address failures due to incomplete knowledge bases, particularly in the context of temporal questions. The authors propose a system that retrieves facts from a KB and employs a text-retrieval + QA system to extract missing information. They evaluate their approach on temporally restricted questions and compare it with relevant models, demonstrating significant improvements in performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively combines KBQA with text-based QA, addressing a critical gap in handling temporal information.
- The evaluation is thorough, showcasing improvements over relevant baselines and demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.
- The approach is intuitive, utilizing off-the-shelf components to enhance KBQA performance.

Weaknesses:
- There is insufficient analysis of the results when KBQA fails and the QA system assists, particularly regarding the types and numbers of failures.
- The paper does not adequately justify why the proposed method is limited to temporal questions when it could address broader KBQA challenges.
- The readability of figures, particularly Figure 1, is poor, and they do not clearly illustrate the proposed method's process.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of failure modes by including detailed statistics on parsing and execution failures. This analysis is crucial for understanding the effectiveness of the QA system in these scenarios. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the rationale for focusing solely on temporal questions and compare their method with other hybrid KBQA approaches. To enhance the clarity of the figures, particularly Figure 1, we advise using clearer symbols and real examples to illustrate the method's process more effectively.
