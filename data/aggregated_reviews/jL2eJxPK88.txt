Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents two methods to enhance the construction speed of the Partitioned Learned Bloom Filter (PLBF): Fast PLBF, which achieves a time complexity of \(O(N^2k)\), and Fast PLBF++, which operates at \(O(Nk \log N + Nk^2)\) but may yield a different data structure. The authors demonstrate that Fast PLBF++ can produce the same structure as PLBF under specific conditions. The paper includes empirical evaluations showing significant speed improvements in filter construction.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The algorithms are straightforward, supported by strong theoretical results.
2. Empirical evidence indicates that the proposed methods lead to faster PLBF construction.

Weaknesses:
1. The authors do not sufficiently explain the redundant computations in PLBF and how Fast PLBF addresses them.
2. There is a lack of clarity regarding the novelty of the proposed dynamic programming acceleration techniques compared to existing methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of redundant computations in PLBF and how Fast PLBF avoids them, as this is a critical aspect of the paper. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the differences between their solutions and established dynamic programming techniques to better establish the novelty of their contributions. Furthermore, a discussion on the potential societal impacts of their work should be included.
