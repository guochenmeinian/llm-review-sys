Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents D-LLMs, a dynamic inference framework for large language models (LLMs) that adaptively allocates computing resources based on token importance. By introducing a decision module for each transformer layer, D-LLMs can execute or skip specific layers for each token, optimizing computational efficiency. The framework incorporates a KV-cache eviction strategy to maintain compatibility with existing acceleration techniques and reduce storage overhead. Experimental results indicate that D-LLMs can significantly lower computational costs and KV-cache storage by up to 50% without compromising performance across various tasks, including Q&A, summarization, and commonsense reasoning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The originality of D-LLMs is notable, as it creatively addresses the challenge of deploying LLMs on resource-constrained platforms by dynamically determining the necessity of executing transformer layers based on token importance.  
- The thorough design and implementation of the decision modules and KV-cache eviction strategy ensure compatibility with existing techniques.  
- The clarity of the paper is commendable, systematically explaining the motivation, methodology, and experimental setup, making it accessible to a broad audience.  
- The experiments demonstrate significant reductions in computational resources without sacrificing model performance across diverse NLP tasks.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks a detailed discussion on token granularity and its impact on model performance and computational efficiency, leaving questions about the generalizability of the proposed method.  
- The conditions under which the decision module determines to skip or execute layers are not clearly defined, creating ambiguity in the decision-making process.  
- There is insufficient analysis of the computational overhead introduced by the dynamic decision module and the hyper-parameters used in the experiments, which are crucial for reproducing results.  
- The manuscript contains inconsistent terminology, such as "dynamic decision module" versus "execution decision module," which may cause confusion.  
- A deeper theoretical analysis of the dynamic decision module's behavior and its impact on model performance is needed, along with more detailed ablation studies to isolate the effects of different components.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on token granularity by including an analysis of different levels (e.g., subwords, words, characters) and their impact on model performance and efficiency. Additionally, please clarify the specific criteria or metrics used by the decision module to determine whether to execute or skip layers, including any thresholds or heuristics involved. 

We suggest providing more details on the hyper-parameters used in the experiments, particularly those related to the dynamic decision module and KV-cache eviction strategy, and discussing their sensitivity and tuning guidelines. 

Further, we encourage the authors to conduct empirical analysis or ablation studies comparing different levels of token granularity and to evaluate D-LLMs on a broader set of tasks to better understand its generalizability. 

Lastly, we recommend revisiting the manuscript for clarity, particularly in the use of terminology and the presentation of evaluation metrics, ensuring that all aspects are clearly defined and accessible to readers.
