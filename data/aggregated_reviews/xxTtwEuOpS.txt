### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the effectiveness of the STEMCORRUPT data augmentation strategy for morphological inflection, focusing on how it enhances model performance by removing spurious correlations between stems and affixes. The authors employ an information-theoretic framework and conduct extensive experiments across seven typologically diverse languages, demonstrating that synthetic data improves overall performance. They also introduce new sampling strategies based on uncertainty and diversity to optimize the selection of training subsets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to understand.
- It provides a formal analysis of the STEMCORRUPT method, contributing to the understanding of morphological processes.
- Extensive experimentation across multiple languages strengthens the findings.
- The work supports low-resource language technology, encouraging further research in morphological inflection.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental setup relies on a very small training dataset (100 instances), raising concerns about the generalizability of the results.
- There is a lack of Morphosyntactic Description (MSD) splits for evaluating compositionality, which could reveal additional insights.
- The focus on highly concatenative morphology may limit the applicability of the findings to languages with non-concatenative morphological phenomena.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental design by utilizing larger training datasets to enhance the practical relevance of their findings. Additionally, incorporating MSD splits in the evaluation would provide a clearer understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of synthetic data usage. It would also be beneficial to investigate the performance of STEMCORRUPT on languages with non-concatenative morphology to broaden the applicability of the results. Lastly, clarifying the comparison between the new sampling techniques and existing methods in STEMCORRECT would strengthen the paper's contributions.
