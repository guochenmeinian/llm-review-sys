Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SkiLD, an unsupervised reinforcement learning method that learns skills by augmenting the DIAYN reward with a graph-state dependency reward, facilitating meaningful object interactions. The authors propose a novel intrinsic reward signal to guide skill discovery, evaluated across ten downstream tasks in two domains, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The experiments are comprehensive, showcasing SkiLD's significant advantages over baselines across various tasks.
- The novel approach of utilizing local dependencies and interactions is well-motivated and contributes to the field of skill discovery.
- The paper is generally well-written, with solid notations and quality figures that enhance understanding.

Weaknesses:
- Clarity issues persist, particularly in the presentation of the method. The introduction of the Graph-Selection policy could be more effectively positioned.
- The paper lacks explicit details on the dynamics model training, algorithm overview, and the application of diversity rewards.
- The evaluation relies on a limited number of domains and may not adequately address the scalability of the method with increasing state factors.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method's presentation by introducing the Graph-Selection policy earlier in the paper. Additionally, providing more explicit details regarding the dynamics model training, algorithm overview, and diversity reward application would enhance understanding. We suggest including pseudocode linked from the main paper and expanding the appendix for further clarification. Furthermore, addressing the scalability of SkiLD in broader environments and evaluating the method's performance across more commonly used domains would strengthen the paper's contributions. Lastly, we encourage the authors to visualize the meaningfulness of learned skills by sampling and analyzing a subset of skills.
