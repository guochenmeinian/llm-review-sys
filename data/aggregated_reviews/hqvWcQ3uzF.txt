Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Freeway Traffic Anomalous Event Detection (FT-AED) dataset, the first large-scale lane-level freeway traffic dataset designed for anomaly detection, comprising over 3.7 million sensor measurements collected every 30 seconds from 49 radar sensors along Interstate 24 in Tennessee. The authors tackle the critical issue of minimizing delays in incident detection and reporting, utilizing real incident reports for anomaly labeling and establishing a benchmark for evaluating various deep learning anomaly detection methods. The results indicate a significant reduction in reporting delays, with models detecting 75% of crashes on average 10 minutes before official reports, thereby demonstrating the dataset's potential for enhancing highway safety.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The FT-AED dataset is the first of its kind, addressing a critical gap in existing datasets for lane-level anomaly detection.
2. The dataset provides high temporal resolution data, making it a valuable resource for researchers focusing on freeway anomaly detection.
3. The authors provide a comprehensive evaluation of multiple deep learning models, including unsupervised graph neural network autoencoders, establishing a baseline for future research in this novel area.
4. The public release of the dataset and preprocessing code enhances accessibility for further research.
5. The dataset captures real-world challenges, such as delayed incident reporting, which is crucial for developing practical anomaly detection solutions.

Weaknesses:
1. The dataset is limited to a single month of data, primarily focusing on weekday morning traffic, which may restrict the ability to capture seasonal or long-term traffic trends and a wider range of anomaly types.
2. It relies solely on radar sensor data, lacking additional contextual information, such as weather conditions or road construction activities, that could enhance understanding of freeway anomalies.
3. The manual labeling process may introduce biases or inconsistencies, affecting the reliability of the ground truth information, and challenges with labeling anomalies due to delays and inaccuracies in manual reporting are acknowledged, but the methods for labeling and evaluating models may not accurately reflect real-world conditions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors expand the temporal scope of the dataset to include data from multiple seasons or years and a wider range of traffic conditions and times to provide a more comprehensive understanding of freeway traffic anomalies. Additionally, incorporating contextual data such as weather conditions or road construction activities could enhance the dataset's utility. We also suggest exploring techniques to improve the accuracy and consistency of the labeling process, potentially by utilizing multiple annotators or automated methods. Finally, we recommend discussing further approaches to address the issues caused by delays in incident reporting, rather than relying solely on fixed delay assumptions, and investigating the impact of sensor sampling frequency on model performance to yield valuable insights regarding false negatives and reconstruction error metrics.
