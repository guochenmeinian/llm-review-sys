Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method called CP3ER that utilizes consistency models for policy parameterization in online visual reinforcement learning. It identifies issues with prior consistency actor-critic methods in high-dimensional observation settings through the dormant ratio metric. The authors propose incorporating entropy regularization and prioritized sampling to enhance policy stability and sample efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate CP3ER's effectiveness across 21 tasks in the DeepMind Control Suite and MetaWorld, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized and presents a thorough analysis of limitations in existing consistency policy training for visual RL.
- Comprehensive empirical evidence shows CP3ER's superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.
- The introduction of CP3ER, combining consistency models with prioritized proximal experience regularization, offers a novel approach to enhancing sample efficiency and training stability.

Weaknesses:
- The core contribution of CP3ER is somewhat muddled, as the focus on image-based observations lacks justification, and comparisons to low-dimensional baselines are missing.
- The experimental setup lacks baseline comparisons with other consistency RL methods, limiting the contextualization of results.
- The analysis of dormant ratios and their implications is incomplete, and several figures lack necessary details for interpretation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the core contribution by explicitly addressing the relevance of image-based observations and providing comparisons to low-dimensional baselines such as SAC and PPO. Additionally, we suggest including more theoretical analysis regarding the use of Eq. (8) for sampling weights and ensuring that all experimental figures include sufficient detail for interpretation. It would also be beneficial to include comparisons with other consistency RL methods and provide explanations for the normalization of results to facilitate better understanding. Lastly, enhancing Section 4 with more detailed explanations would strengthen the overall presentation.
