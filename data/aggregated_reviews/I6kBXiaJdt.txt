Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents MAP, a blockchain interoperability protocol that aims to facilitate cross-chain transactions while addressing trust, scalability, and cost challenges. The authors propose a unified relay chain architecture that utilizes zkSNARK-based hybrid light clients, achieving a theoretical reduction in on-chain light clients from \(O(N^2)\) to \(O(N)\). The paper also highlights real-world deployment, including a dataset for blockchain interoperability research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles a highly relevant topic and presents it in a clear and accessible manner.
- The theoretical reduction from \(O(N^2)\) to \(O(N)\) on-chain light clients is significant.
- Real-world deployment is impressive, with over 200,000 cross-chain transactions.

Weaknesses:
- The comparison with existing protocols raises concerns about fairness and significance, particularly regarding on-chain costs.
- The evaluation metrics are limited and not intuitive, making it difficult to assess MAP's improvements over other protocols like zkBridge.
- The system model and architecture are not clearly described, leading to confusion about the roles of provers and the implementation details.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the system model and architecture, ensuring that the relationship between MAP's components is well-defined. Additionally, we suggest providing a comprehensive discussion on the economics of MAP tokens, including their value definition and implications for running a relay chain. The authors should also clarify the measurement methodology for latency and ensure that comparisons with existing protocols, such as zkBridge, are justified and transparent. Finally, we advise revising the writing for clarity and coherence, addressing minor formatting and citation issues throughout the paper.
