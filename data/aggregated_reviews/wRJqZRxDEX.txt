Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical framework for understanding the criticality of deep neural networks at initialization, focusing on the role of LayerNorm and residual connections. The authors introduce partial Jacobians and analyze the averaged partial Jacobian norm (APJN) to establish criteria for hyperparameter selection. They provide a theoretical analysis for infinitely wide networks and apply their method to fully connected networks, ResNet, and MLP-Mixer architectures, demonstrating that criticality can be achieved regardless of initialization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces partial Jacobians and their averaged norms as effective tools for analyzing gradient propagation in deep neural networks at initialization.
2. It provides a straightforward numerical test for determining optimal initialization, enhancing practical insights for network trainability.
3. The theoretical predictions align with previously observed empirical findings, and the paper is comprehensive and well-structured, facilitating reader understanding.

Weaknesses:
1. The focus on networks at initialization with Gaussian random weights limits the exploration of learning dynamics; a discussion on extending the analysis beyond initialization is needed.
2. The novelty of the approach should be emphasized more clearly in the related works section.
3. The clarity of the presentation could be improved, as the logical flow is sometimes obscured, and additional citations are required for certain statements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by explicitly outlining the logical steps in their proofs and providing a clear explanation of the recurrence relationships used. Additionally, we suggest including a dedicated section summarizing the limitations of the work and extending the analysis to include networks with finite widths. It would also be beneficial to clarify the relationship between the APJN and previously defined order parameters, as well as to enhance figure captions for better comprehension.
