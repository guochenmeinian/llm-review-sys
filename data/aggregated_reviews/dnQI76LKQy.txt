### Key Points
This paper presents a multimodal Chinese metaphor dataset, MultiCMET, comprising 13,820 text-image pairs from advertisements, annotated for metaphor occurrence, source and target domains, and conveyed sentiments. It also develops a domain lexicon and introduces the Cascading Domain Knowledge Integration (CDKI) benchmark to enhance metaphor understanding. The work claims to be the first publicly available large-scale Chinese metaphor dataset, addressing issues of poor annotation quality in previous datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to understand.
- It provides a valuable resource for future researchers in multimodal metaphor understanding.
- The dataset's creation from advertisements is an efficient approach, yielding valuable insights.
- The domain classification approach enhances comprehension of metaphorical expressions.

Weaknesses:
- The significance of identifying source and target domains for metaphor recognition is unclear, with insufficient experimental support.
- The annotation process lacks detailed descriptions, particularly regarding annotators' backgrounds and the guidelines used.
- The choice of granularity for source and target domains is not adequately justified.
- Most appendix material is presented in Chinese only, requiring English translations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the significance of metaphor domain classification for metaphor recognition, possibly through additional experimental results. The authors should provide more detailed descriptions of the annotators' backgrounds and the annotation guidelines to address the challenges of metaphor annotation. Additionally, a discussion on the choice of granularity for source and target domains is necessary to justify their decisions. Finally, we suggest including English translations for all appendix material to enhance accessibility.
