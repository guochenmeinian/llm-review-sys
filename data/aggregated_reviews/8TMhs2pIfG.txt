Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the NAVI dataset, a category-agnostic 3D object dataset comprising 10,515 images of 36 objects captured in both controlled and in-the-wild settings. The dataset aims to provide high-quality 2D-3D alignments and camera parameters, facilitating research in 3D reconstruction and correspondence estimation. The authors detail their journey in developing the dataset, highlighting the challenges faced with existing models and the necessity of capturing their own 3D models. They transitioned from using ShapeNet models and Internet images to Google Scanned Objects, ultimately deciding to scan their own models to ensure precise alignment with self-captured images. The authors conduct various experiments to demonstrate the dataset's utility and commit to expanding the dataset over time based on reviewer feedback.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset offers a significant collection of accurately captured multiview images and corresponding 3D scans, particularly under real-world conditions.
- NAVI provides high-quality 2D-3D alignments, significantly improving upon existing datasets.
- High-quality annotations from 2D-3D alignment enhance its applicability for systematic research, supported by a thorough quantitative evaluation of alignment quality demonstrating high inter-annotator agreement.
- The authors provide easily interpretable dataset statistics, making it more accessible for researchers.
- The commitment to releasing the annotation tool and expanding the dataset is commendable, and the new Table 3 clarifies the dataset's relevance compared to existing ones.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset's limited size (36 objects) restricts its generalizability and effectiveness for broader machine learning applications, potentially limiting its applicability for training generalizable models.
- Clarity issues exist in the alignment verification steps and the dataset's construction process, particularly regarding the methodology for estimating intrinsic camera parameters.
- The manual alignment process, while ensuring quality, is not scalable and may hinder the speed of data annotation.
- Inconsistencies in texturing among 3D objects raise questions about the dataset's uniformity, and the applications highlighted may not fully leverage the dataset's potential, particularly in correspondence estimation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset design section to provide more details on the pipeline, particularly regarding the intrinsic camera parameters and alignment verification criteria. Additionally, we suggest including a table that quantitatively compares NAVI with existing datasets to highlight its advantages. To enhance the dataset's applicability, consider expanding the number of 3D objects included and exploring semi-automatic approaches to improve the scalability of the annotation process. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to address the inconsistency in texturing among 3D objects to provide a more uniform dataset and clarify the dataset's potential for real-world applications beyond those currently mentioned. Lastly, we recommend highlighting the quality of the ground truth shape more prominently in the paper and explaining the comparison between annotator variability and typical errors in detail, as well as adding more details on confidence and motion estimation, explicitly stating the use of Nister's 5-point algorithm and considering re-estimating the Essential matrix with all correspondences in consensus for improved accuracy.
