Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the trust behaviors of LLM-based agents, focusing on how these agents express trust and the alignment between agent and human trust. The authors find that LLM agents, particularly those with larger parameters like GPT-4, exhibit trust behaviors in trust games and show significant alignment with human trust behaviors. The study also addresses biases and the impact of demographic factors on trust behaviors.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The demonstration of agent trust behaviors through experimental results is commendable, with a thorough comparison to human trust behaviors.
- The use of six intuitive environments enhances the analysis, considering agent persona as a significant factor in simulations.
- The experiments are robust, supported by detailed figures and further discussions that provide valuable insights for future LLM-based agent designs.

Weaknesses:
- The paper could benefit from additional experiments in repeated trust games, as past behaviors are crucial for trustors in real-world scenarios.
- Trust games may not encompass the full spectrum of trust behaviors; thus, more discussions and future work insights are needed.
- The exploration of scenarios involving more than two players is lacking, particularly regarding group trust behaviors.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental design by incorporating more repeated trust games to reflect the importance of reputation. Additionally, we suggest expanding the discussion on trust behaviors beyond trust games to include insights on group dynamics. Addressing scenarios with multiple players would enrich the analysis. Furthermore, clarifying the implications of their findings on agent cooperation and human-agent collaboration would strengthen the paper's contributions.
