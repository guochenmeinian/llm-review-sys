Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) by framing it as a ranking problem, addressing the inconsistency in existing CAT solutions for estimating latent student abilities. The authors propose the Collaborative Computerized Adaptive Testing (CCAT) framework, which utilizes collaborative students as anchors for question selection and ability estimation. Theoretical analysis shows that with a sufficient number of collaborative students, ranking consistency errors can be minimized. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that CCAT achieves superior ranking consistency compared to traditional methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors identify a significant inconsistency issue in current CAT solutions, providing a novel and impactful research motivation.
2. The CCAT framework introduces an innovative use of collaborative students, distinguishing it from traditional CAT and collaborative ranking approaches.
3. The theoretical analysis and experimental validation are robust, supporting the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper's complexity may hinder readability, particularly for those unfamiliar with CAT concepts, necessitating clearer explanations.
2. The main idea of how collaborative students are identified requires further elaboration.
3. The discussion could benefit from additional references to collaborative ranking literature and a broader exploration of applicability beyond educational contexts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by simplifying the presentation of CAT concepts, especially for readers without a background in the field. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of how collaborative students are selected. Including more references to collaborative ranking and discussing potential applications in other fields would enhance the paper's relevance. Furthermore, addressing the limitations related to the construction of collaborative students and the algorithm's time and space complexity would strengthen the overall contribution.
