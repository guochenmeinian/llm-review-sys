### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to modeling stance detection as a dynamic relationship between texts, specifically between a target and a parent post in online discussions. It introduces an annotated dataset in Dutch and Catalan, covering various topics, and conducts initial experiments that indicate improved topic transfer capabilities of the dynamic stance detection model compared to traditional static methods. The authors also provide automatic classification results based on fine-tuning a pre-trained encoder model.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper offers a valuable annotated dataset in two languages, enhancing cross-lingual comparability.  
- It presents a new modeling framework for stance detection that is more generalizable across topics.  
- Initial experiments provide useful baseline results for future research.

Weaknesses:  
- The relationship between static and dynamic stance detection is unclear, particularly regarding whether dynamic stance detection is a standalone task or should be learned jointly with static stance detection.  
- The presentation of research questions and results lacks clarity, especially in defining "Static Training" and "Dynamic Training."  
- Some examples and claims in the paper require further validation and refinement.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the conceptual distinction between static and dynamic stance detection, explicitly defining "Static Training" and "Dynamic Training" to enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest revising examples and claims to ensure they accurately illustrate the intended points, particularly regarding the relationship between stance types. It would be beneficial to tighten the descriptions of stance labels and provide more information on adjudication processes for gold labels. Lastly, consider addressing the feedback regarding the suitability of the paper for the conference versus LREC.
