### Key Points
This paper presents the Fine-grained Visual Attribute (FiVA) dataset, which consists of 700,000 high-quality images annotated with specific visual attributes for style transfer in text-to-image diffusion models. The authors propose the FiVA-Adapter framework, enabling the decoupling and adaptation of visual attributes from multiple source images into a single generated image, enhancing customization capabilities. The dataset features a detailed taxonomy of visual attributes and aims to improve controllability in text-to-image generation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed FiVA dataset is novel, featuring a large-scale collection of 700,000 image pairs with fine-grained visual attribute annotations.
- The data generation pipeline is sound, utilizing advanced models and human validation for consistency.
- FiVA-Adapter demonstrates superior performance in attribute transfer and flexibility compared to existing methods.

Weaknesses:
- The human validation process lacks detail regarding the number of evaluators and the evaluation metrics used.
- Reliance on a single text-to-image model (Playground v2.5) may introduce biases, limiting the dataset's generalizability.
- The dataset and code are not publicly available, hindering community validation of the authors' claims.
- The paper does not address the computational resources required for training and running the FiVA-Adapter.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the description of the human validation process, including the number of evaluators and the evaluation criteria used. Additionally, clarify the rationale for using only the Playground v2.5 model for image generation and consider providing a more balanced distribution of images across visual attributes. We also suggest that the authors release the dataset and code to facilitate validation and replication by the research community. Finally, please incorporate the limitations discussed in the supplementary material into the main paper for better transparency.
