Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel transformer architecture for real-world image denoising within a self-supervised framework. The authors propose a directional self-attention (DSA) module and a Siamese architecture to mitigate performance degradation from masked regions. The model employs two pseudo-siamese sub-networks during training, with one utilizing grid-based DSA for blind-spot learning and the other employing full grid-based attention to reduce bias. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance on the SIDD and DnD datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to understand.
- It demonstrates superior denoising performance over existing methods, effectively addressing the challenges of spatially correlated noise and bias from blind-spot networks.
- The innovative application of transformer architecture captures long-range dependencies, enhancing the effectiveness of the blind-spot structure.

Weaknesses:
- Limited novelty, as the approach resembles existing methods and shares computational complexities with prior works.
- The evaluation is restricted to SIDD and DnD datasets, limiting the robustness validation.
- The computational demands remain high compared to traditional CNN-based approaches, which may hinder practical applicability in resource-constrained environments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty discussion by elaborating on how their approach differs from existing works like PUCA and LGBPN. Additionally, providing a detailed comparison of computational complexity and runtime differences between the proposed method and other comparison methods would enhance understanding. Expanding the evaluation to include more diverse datasets could further validate the methodâ€™s robustness. Finally, addressing the correlation of spatial noise in real-world images and discussing potential solutions would strengthen the paper.
