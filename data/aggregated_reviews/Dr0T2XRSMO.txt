### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of VTuber viewer engagement on the Chinese platform Bilibili, utilizing a dataset of 2.7 million livestream sessions. It identifies viewer behaviors, such as increased activity prior to membership and the influence of chat culture, while addressing challenges like membership retention and moderation. The authors propose "FanRanker," a tool aimed at helping VTubers identify potential subscribers, which shifts the focus from recommending content to recommending viewers.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper tackles a novel problem by reversing the traditional viewer-recommendation approach, filling a gap in livestreaming research.
2. The extensive dataset provides a robust foundation for examining viewer behavior, making it a significant contribution to VTuber research.

Weaknesses:
1. The technical novelty is limited; while the reverse recommendation concept is new, the underlying methods and metrics lack innovation. ChatSim's validation is insufficient, limiting its perceived contribution.
2. The absence of comparisons with established recommendation systems undermines claims regarding FanRanker's distinctiveness.
3. Evaluation metrics are primarily focused on ranking performance, lacking additional metrics like precision, recall, or F1-score, and statistical significance testing is missing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the methodological rigor by including comparisons with simpler or established baseline approaches, such as recommendations based on historical gift/superchat activity or existing viewer engagement models. Additionally, we suggest providing evidence of ChatSim's unique contribution through an ablation study. Clarifying how FanRanker is intended to be used by VTubers, including feedback on its usability, would enhance practical understanding. Furthermore, a more explicit comparison of VTuber streaming with non-virtual streaming is necessary to contextualize findings. Lastly, addressing the distribution of the VTuber audience and discussing the implications of the long tail on generalizability would strengthen the analysis.
