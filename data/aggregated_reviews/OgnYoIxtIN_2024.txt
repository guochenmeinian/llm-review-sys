Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework for zero-shot transfer of neural ODEs by leveraging function encoders to represent a space of dynamical systems. The authors propose a method that allows for rapid identification and adaptation to dynamics at inference time without additional training, demonstrating its effectiveness through experiments on Van der Pol systems, MuJoCo, and quadrotor control.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors address a significant problem in machine learning and robotics: zero-shot generalization to changes in dynamics/environment.
- The framework introduces an interesting extension of the function encoder paradigm, showing clear derivation and performance improvements.
- The writing is clear, and the experiments are well-designed, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed approach.

Weaknesses:
- There are issues with mathematical notation, specifically in equation (3) where $N$ should be $m$.
- The assumption of orthogonality for the coefficients is critical, yet the authors do not analyze its validity or provide insights on how many iterations are required to achieve orthogonality.
- The introductory paragraph of section 3 lacks motivation and clarity regarding the advantages of reasoning at the derivative level with integral trajectory data.
- The reliance on large, diverse datasets for training is a significant limitation, as is the computational overhead of training multiple neural ODEs, which may hinder scalability.
- The experiments lack diversity in evaluating robustness to completely unseen environments, and the evaluation metrics primarily focus on prediction accuracy without considering task-specific performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of mathematical notation and provide a thorough analysis of the orthogonality assumption, including empirical evaluations of its impact on performance. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the introductory paragraph of section 3 with more motivation and potentially including visual aids to clarify concepts. The authors should explore data-efficient learning methods to address the reliance on extensive datasets and investigate more efficient training algorithms to reduce computational costs. Finally, we encourage the inclusion of more varied test scenarios and additional evaluation metrics to better assess the model's adaptability and robustness in diverse conditions.
