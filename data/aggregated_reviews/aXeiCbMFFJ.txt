Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Visual CoT dataset, comprising 438k question-answer pairs with annotated bounding boxes and reasoning steps, aimed at enhancing multi-modal large-scale language models (MLLMs) in visual chain reasoning. The authors propose a multi-stage processing framework that enables models to dynamically focus on critical visual inputs, yielding significant performance improvements in complex visual tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The Visual CoT dataset is a substantial contribution, offering new resources for training and evaluating MLLMs, particularly in visual reasoning.  
2. The benchmark effectively challenges existing MLLMs in tasks requiring local region identification and reasoning.  
3. The paper is well-organized and clearly articulates the proposed method and its contributions.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The multi-stage method may increase computational complexity, potentially affecting practical applicability under resource constraints.  
2. The dataset's field distribution needs exploration to ensure balanced representation across various data types.  
3. The intermediate CoT currently consists of a single bounding box, lacking depth; incorporating more fine-grained annotations, such as textual explanations and multiple bounding boxes, would enhance interpretability.  
4. The paper could benefit from comparisons with additional state-of-the-art models and clearer reporting of experimental metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the interpretability of the intermediate CoT by incorporating more detailed annotations, including textual explanations and multiple bounding boxes for complex reasoning tasks. Additionally, we suggest comparing the proposed method against a broader range of state-of-the-art models to strengthen the validation of its effectiveness. Clarifying the metrics reported in experiments and addressing the computational complexity of the multi-stage approach would also enhance the paper's rigor. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explicitly outline the limitations, including the handling of multiple bounding boxes, in the final manuscript.
