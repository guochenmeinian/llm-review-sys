Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of the standard online selection problem through the introduction of "lookback prophet inequalities," allowing decision-makers to select previous items with values discounted by decay functions. The authors analyze the competitive ratio across adversarial, random order, and IID models, deriving upper and lower bounds, particularly noting that for the adversarial model, the bounds are tight. The paper also emphasizes a reduction from general decay functions to simpler forms, specifically linear functions of the type \(x \to \gamma x\).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a new problem, lookback prophet inequalities, which has not been previously studied.
2. The definitions and theorem statements are clear, providing good intuition through proof sketches.
3. The competitive ratio for the adversarial model is optimal.

Weaknesses:
1. The analyses for random order and IID cases are not ideal, with neither upper nor lower bounds being tight for general \(\gamma\).
2. The significance of the contribution is questionable given the existing literature on prophet inequalities.
3. Some algorithms designed for random order and IID models are sub-optimal and difficult to implement.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the technical contributions by explicitly stating the biggest technical challenge in the analysis. Additionally, we suggest emphasizing the choice of distribution with support \(\{0,a,b\}\) when proving the upper bound of the \(\gamma\)-prophet inequality, as the current theorem statements do not directly imply the necessary competitive ratio. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to address the limitations of their algorithms in the random order and IID models, potentially exploring better competitive ratios for fixed \(n\). Lastly, we advise correcting typos, such as "Inequalitites" to "Inequalities," to enhance the overall presentation.
