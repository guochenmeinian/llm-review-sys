### Key Points
This paper presents a retrieval-based approach named GOODTRIEVER to address the toxicity problem in text generation. The method utilizes two external datastores containing key-value pairs annotated as toxic or non-toxic to facilitate controlled generation. During inference, the model generates a context representation, retrieves k-nearest neighbors from the datastores, and adjusts the next token distribution by rewarding non-toxic words and penalizing toxic ones. The authors claim that this training-free method can generalize across domains and alleviate the continual toxicity problem.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art toxicity mitigation while reducing inference time by 43%.
- The paper is well-written, and the experimental results convincingly demonstrate the method's effectiveness.
- It is evaluated across different model sizes, showing efficiency in toxicity mitigation even as model size increases.

Weaknesses:
- The novelties are limited, as the approach is closely related to retrieval-augmented LMs and traditional instance-based methods.
- There is a dependency on human-annotated datastores, and the paper lacks results on the quality of these datastores and their impact on model performance.
- The evaluation metric for toxicity may not be reliable, as the Perspective API often makes mistakes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including additional experiments to assess the model's performance on other probing tasks. It would also be beneficial to provide a detailed description of how the datastores are constructed and to compare the methods with baseline models in terms of inference time and parameters. Furthermore, clarifying the potential storage and computational burdens associated with large datastores would enhance the paper's rigor.
