### Key Points
This paper presents ModelGo, a tool designed to analyze potential license conflicts, improper license choices, use restrictions, and obligations in machine learning (ML) projects. It highlights the complexities of licensing in ML, where datasets and models may have different licenses, and proposes a taxonomy linking AI activities with license language keywords. The authors demonstrate ModelGo's utility through case studies, emphasizing its significance in managing legal risks as ML projects proliferate.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Addresses a critical gap in license management for ML, which is increasingly important as the field grows.
- Provides practical application through real-world case studies.
- Introduces an innovative methodology for license analysis tailored to ML challenges.

Weaknesses:
- The tool's complexity may hinder usability for individuals without a legal or license management background.
- Limited scope in covering all possible licensing scenarios in the rapidly evolving ML field.
- Effectiveness relies on the accurate and comprehensive input of licensing data, which could be a limiting factor.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the user-friendliness of ModelGo to accommodate individuals without a legal or technical background. Additionally, the authors should consider expanding the tool's scope to include emerging or non-standard licensing types and ensure regular updates to reflect new licensing scenarios. It would also be beneficial to provide more information on how the proposed taxonomy is comprehensive and how easily it can adapt to new AI activities. Finally, the authors should address how ModelGo ensures the accuracy of licensing data input and its adaptability to rapid changes in the ML field, including variations in legal frameworks across different jurisdictions.
