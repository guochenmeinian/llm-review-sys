Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the MiliPoint dataset, which includes three primary tasks in human activity recognition: identification, action classification, and keypoint estimation. MiliPoint offers a larger and more diverse dataset with 49 distinct actions, enhancing the statistical robustness for action recognition models. The authors evaluated established point-based deep neural networks (DNNs) on this dataset, noting that action classification is particularly challenging compared to identity classification and keypoint estimation. The dataset is derived from mmWave radar point cloud data aimed at enhancing human activity recognition. The authors propose that while raw mmWave radar data could provide better performance insights, the challenges of data size and processing complexity led them to focus on point cloud data. They acknowledge limitations in generalization due to fixed distances between subjects and sensors and clarify that the paper does not address foreground extraction in complex environments, which is suggested for future work. The authors emphasize the unique advantages of mmWave radar, particularly in privacy-sensitive applications, while addressing concerns about the dataset's utility for Doppler analysis and the need for more diverse environments. Additionally, the paper examines potential locational and directional biases within the dataset, proposing to address these biases to enhance the dataset's integrity and the model's performance in relevant tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is significantly larger, providing extensive data for analysis.
- It includes a greater number of test subjects, enhancing diversity and representation.
- The multi-modality of the dataset allows for a comprehensive understanding of human activities.
- The dataset provides a focused approach to mmWave radar applications in human activity recognition.
- The authors have opened access to raw data, enhancing the dataset's utility.
- Clear explanations of the limitations and future work directions are provided.
- The authors have effectively improved the paper's accessibility and usability.
- Clear resolutions to prior ambiguities enhance the overall clarity of the work.

Weaknesses:
- The authors did not utilize a motion capture system, which could enhance accuracy.
- The dataset lacks a wider range of environments, limiting complexity and diversity.
- Improved scene complexity is needed; incorporating elements like occlusions would enhance realism.
- The dataset does not include raw or interpreted mmWave radar perception images, which are fundamental for its purpose.
- The comparison of modalities in Table 1 contains inaccuracies regarding costs and capabilities.
- Arguments comparing mmWave radar to cameras lack clarity and may be perceived as contradictory.
- The dataset's generalization capabilities are limited due to fixed distances and potential biases from the sensor layout.
- Prior work discussion is minimal, and the paper lacks comprehensive exploration of the advantages and disadvantages of different modalities.
- Potential biases within the dataset still need to be fully addressed to ensure comprehensive results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset by incorporating a motion capture system to enhance accuracy. Additionally, including a broader range of environments, such as indoor and outdoor settings, would enhance scene complexity and diversity. The authors should also consider adding diverse elements like occlusions to improve realism. Furthermore, we suggest providing raw mmWave radar data to facilitate Doppler analysis and enhance the dataset's utility. Lastly, we advise revising the comparisons in Table 1 to accurately reflect the costs and capabilities of the modalities discussed. We also recommend improving the clarity of arguments regarding the comparison between mmWave radar and cameras, ensuring that the unique advantages of radar are well articulated without implying superiority. Expanding the discussion of prior work would provide a more comprehensive context for the research. To enhance the dataset's generalization capabilities, consider incorporating a wider range of environments and user poses, as well as addressing the potential biases introduced by the sensor layout. Finally, we recommend eliminating locational and directional biases to enhance the model's effectiveness and continuing to focus on developing innovative methodologies in future work.
