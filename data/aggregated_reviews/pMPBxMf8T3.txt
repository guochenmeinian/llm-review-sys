Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on "implicit invariance learning" in the context of multi-environment low-rank matrix sensing. The authors demonstrate that the implicit bias of SGD over heterogeneous data leads to the learning of invariant solutions, while pooled GD tends to learn both invariant and spurious signals. The findings suggest that using large step size large-batch SGD sequentially in each environment can effectively mitigate the oscillation caused by heterogeneity, preventing the model from capturing spurious signals.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a novel perspective on invariant learning across multiple environments.
- It provides rigorous theoretical results supported by detailed proofs, which are potentially valuable.
- The presentation is clear and engaging, making the submission enjoyable to read.

Weaknesses:
- The setting is somewhat simplified, which is acceptable for an initial exploration of this new perspective.
- The analysis is limited to matrix sensing and a specific 2-layer NN, necessitating a more thorough discussion of the implications of this choice.
- Certain gaps and inconsistencies in the exposition hinder clarity, particularly regarding the separation between GD and HeteroSGD.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the applicability of their findings to broader representation-learning based domain generalization problems. Additionally, we suggest including a more thorough examination of the implications of the matrix sensing setting and its assumptions. It would be beneficial to clarify the reasons behind the success of standard SGD-based training despite the negative findings presented. We also encourage the authors to provide numerical simulations for scenarios where some assumptions, such as batch size, are violated. Lastly, we advise correcting minor typographical errors and ensuring consistent terminology throughout the paper.
