### Key Points
This paper tackles the Embodied Instruction Following (EIF) challenge by proposing improvements to the Episodic Transformer (ET) architecture. The authors introduce two components: 1) contrastive learning between the latent state representation for action prediction and the latent representation of language instructions, and 2) a hierarchical action prediction approach that first predicts high-level "meta actions." The paper claims to address the issue of agents not faithfully following language instructions, although this problem has been previously studied. The proposed method is evaluated on the ALFRED dataset, showing improved performance compared to existing works.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The contrastive learning approach is intuitive, simple to implement, and potentially effective, offering benefits to both modular and end-to-end systems.
- The method is clearly presented, making it easy to understand.

Weaknesses:
- The effectiveness of the proposed meta-actions (MA) is not convincingly justified by the experimental results, with conflicting data in Table 3.
- Logical flaws exist in the Ablation Studies section, particularly regarding the interpretation of results in Tables 4 and 5.
- The baseline models for comparison are outdated, and the evaluation metrics may not adequately address instruction fidelity.
- The paper lacks discussion on the relevance of path length weighted metrics and the scalability of the meta-action learning step.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the effectiveness of meta-actions through more rigorous analysis and clearer experimental results. Specifically, they should address the conflicting messages in Table 3 and provide a hypothesis for the observed performance changes. Additionally, we suggest revising the Ablation Studies section to clarify the logic behind the results presented in Tables 4 and 5. The authors should also consider including a more contemporary set of baseline models for comparison and discuss the implications of their findings on instruction fidelity. Furthermore, an ablation study demonstrating the importance of visual input and a clearer explanation of how meta actions are achieved would enhance the paper's contributions.
