Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an active learning approach utilizing Evidential Mixture Machines (EMM) to manage the large, sparse label space in multi-label problems by compressing it into a weight coefficient space. The authors propose a combination of Bernoulli mixtures with deep evidential models, leveraging multiple sources of uncertainty to enhance active sample selection. The performance of this method is validated through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces a novel and original approach to multi-class active learning, demonstrating improvements over existing methods across four domains.  
- The EMM model effectively captures label correlations and provides a richer uncertainty metric, enhancing prediction accuracy.  
- Comprehensive experiments and an ablation study support the claims made regarding the model's advantages.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks compelling motivation and intuitive explanations; it would benefit from a real-world example and a section detailing the contributions of each EMM component in layman's terms.  
- The experimental section requires expansion, including a thorough analysis of the datasets' properties and comparisons with the best-known performance metrics.  
- There are several typographical errors and ambiguities in the manuscript that need to be addressed for clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by introducing a motivating real-world example and adding a section with intuitive running examples that clarify the contributions of each EMM component. Additionally, the authors should expand the experimental section with a comprehensive analysis of the datasets, including the distribution of multi-labels and comparisons to fully supervised training performance. To enhance clarity, we suggest a thorough review of the manuscript to correct typographical errors and ambiguities. Furthermore, please provide a reference for the claim in lines 52-53, explain the sufficiency of a single pass in line 61, and clarify the details in Appendix D as mentioned in line 321. Lastly, consider using absolute numbers instead of percentages in lines 329-332 and justify the choice of those numbers.
