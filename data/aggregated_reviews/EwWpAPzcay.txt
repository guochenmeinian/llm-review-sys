Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new regularization method for Gaussian splatting (GS) that enhances the Shannon entropy of scale parameters, termed effective rank (erank), to improve 3D mesh reconstruction from GS point clouds. The authors argue that many Gaussians in prior methods approach an erank of 1, leading to needle-like shapes that introduce noise and degrade reconstruction quality. The proposed regularization shows improved results on the DTU dataset without impairing image rendering capabilities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively identifies and analyzes the issue of needle-like Gaussians in 3D mesh reconstruction, providing a clear motivation for the proposed method.
- The results demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, including 3DGS, SuGaR, and 2DGS, across various scene representations.
- The writing is clear, and the technical details are sufficient for implementation by experts in the field.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks comprehensive benchmarks for 3D reconstruction, notably omitting the Tanks and Temples dataset, which is commonly used in the field.
- Important comparisons with two relevant works, [1] and [2], are missing, which could strengthen the findings.
- There is insufficient justification for the choice of erank regularization over other potential methods, such as linear or exponential loss functions.
- An ablation study comparing erank regularization with simpler methods, such as the ratio of long to short Gaussian axes, is absent.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including additional benchmarks, particularly the Tanks and Temples dataset, to validate the effectiveness of their method. It is crucial to compare their approach with the omitted works [1] and [2] to provide a more robust evaluation. Additionally, we suggest that the authors offer a more thorough justification for the choice of erank regularization compared to other loss functions and include an ablation study to demonstrate its superiority over simpler regularization techniques. Furthermore, a deeper investigation into the causes of needle-like artifacts should be integrated into the main text, as this analysis could significantly enhance the paper's impact.
