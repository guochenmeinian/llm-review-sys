Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CharXiv, a new benchmark for chart understanding, featuring 2,323 real-world charts from ArXiv papers and over 10,000 human-annotated questions. The authors demonstrate the limitations of existing MLLMs in handling charts with multiple subplots and reasoning questions. The benchmark is notable for its rigorous data curation and extensive experiments, revealing performance gaps among various models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- CharXiv includes real chart images and human-annotated questions, providing a more accurate reflection of model capabilities in real-world scenarios.
- The data curation process is well-structured, ensuring diverse chart images and high-quality reasoning questions.
- Extensive evaluations reveal significant insights into model performance, particularly regarding descriptive and reasoning tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The benchmark's descriptive task is limited to 19 unique questions, lacking diversity, such as information retrieval questions about chart element colors.
- The evaluation protocol relies on GPT-based grading, which may introduce biases; multiple reference answers could enhance evaluation accuracy.
- All chart images are sourced from ArXiv, limiting the benchmark's comprehensiveness and diversity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the diversity of descriptive questions by incorporating a human-in-the-loop process similar to that used for reasoning questions. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the evaluation protocol by including multiple reference answers to address variations in expression. Expanding the chart sources beyond ArXiv and including evaluations of document- and chart-specific models would strengthen the benchmark's comprehensiveness. Lastly, clarifying the contribution of the paper beyond data provision would enhance its impact.
