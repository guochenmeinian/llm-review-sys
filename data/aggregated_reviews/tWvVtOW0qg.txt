### Key Points
This paper presents a decentralized data market framework that enables data buyers to query sellers for data relevance and diversity using federated data measurements based on small data samples. The authors evaluate various federated data measurements for their effectiveness in seller selection, including experiments that rank data sellers, assess correlation with downstream model performance, and evaluate robustness against malicious sellers and noisy data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of data measurements of relevance and diversity, with extensive experimental results across multiple learning tasks and scenarios.  
- The design of experiments includes various perspectives, and the framework is technically sound and well-structured.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks exploration of how to combine multiple data measurements for seller selection.  
- Clarity issues arise from insufficient detail in the presentation, particularly in the introduction and abstract, and a lack of explanation for certain terms and experimental setups.  
- The computational burden on sellers is significant, and the potential for adversarial behaviors is not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction and abstract, providing a more logical flow of background knowledge. Additionally, the authors should explore the combination of various data measurements for seller selection and discuss the motivation for using the federated data framework more thoroughly. It would be beneficial to address the computational costs associated with the proposed approach and consider potential adversarial behaviors that could arise from the framework. Furthermore, providing more detailed explanations of experimental settings and the rationale behind the choice of measurements would enhance the paper's overall clarity and impact.
