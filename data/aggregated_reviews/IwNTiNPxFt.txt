Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Stable-Pose, a novel adapter model aimed at enhancing controllable text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models by improving pose guidance, particularly under complex human pose conditions. The authors propose a coarse-to-fine attention masking strategy within a Vision Transformer (ViT) to refine pose representation, demonstrating performance improvements over existing methods on the LAION-Human dataset. Additionally, the authors introduce a new pose encoder block that leverages the self-attention mechanism of Vision Transformers to analyze anatomical interconnections, with a loss function emphasizing the pose region.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed adapter model significantly enhances pose guidance for T2I diffusion models, refining pose representation and showing improved performance on the LAION-Human dataset.
- The innovative PMSA ViT block effectively encodes pose information into the latent vector during the denoising process, as evidenced by thorough ablation studies and promising qualitative and quantitative results.
- The method demonstrates good control effects consistent with pose and text guidance, and the design is relatively simple and easy to understand.

Weaknesses:
- The method exhibits performance drops in image quality (FID) and text alignment (CLIP Score) compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, suggesting it may be more incremental than innovative.
- Limitations regarding multi-person conditions and failure cases are not adequately discussed, and the coarse-to-fine approach does not yield significant improvements based on the ablation study.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the limitations of their method, particularly regarding multi-person conditions and failure cases. It would be beneficial to visualize and analyze these failure cases to understand the boundaries of the proposed method better. Additionally, we suggest conducting ablation studies on the module structure, including the number of PMSA-ViT blocks, and reporting inference time (FPS) alongside other metrics to provide a comprehensive understanding of the method's performance. Finally, we encourage the authors to revise the claim regarding the necessity of paired human data during training to reflect the nuances of existing literature and include relevant citations.
