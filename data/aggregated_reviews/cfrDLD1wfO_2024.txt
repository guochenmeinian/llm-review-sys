Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Graph Diffusion Transformer (Graph DiT), a model designed for generating molecules with multiple properties, such as synthetic score and gas permeability. The authors propose a novel graph-dependent noise model and a Transformer-based denoiser to enhance the handling of molecular structures. The experiments demonstrate Graph DiT's effectiveness in multi-conditional generation and polymer inverse design. Furthermore, the authors discuss the significance of Uniqueness and Novelty metrics in molecular generation, reporting that Graph DiT achieves a Novelty value of 0.9702 and a Uniqueness value of 0.8919, indicating its capability to generate diverse and novel molecules. However, they caution that relying solely on these metrics may be insufficient due to potential ceiling effects, as illustrated by the AddCarbon method's high scores despite its practical limitations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The writing is mostly clear and easy to follow.
- The evaluation is comprehensive, addressing three primary questions regarding generative capabilities, polymer inverse design, and additional analyses.
- The empirical results show improvements in multiple metrics compared to baseline models.
- The authors acknowledge the importance of Uniqueness and Novelty metrics and provide quantitative results for their model, Graph DiT.
- The paper emphasizes a comprehensive evaluation approach, utilizing multiple metrics to assess model performance.

Weaknesses:
- Some comparisons, particularly in Figure 1, are not fair, as molecules ranking low on one property may not rank low on others.
- The paper lacks emphasis on its main contributions and limitations, and the presentation is difficult to follow.
- The evaluation metrics for unconditional generation do not adequately measure uniqueness, novelty, and FCD (Fr√©chet ChemNet Distance).
- Limited demonstration of multi-condition capability, as only two conditions were tested, and the exploration of texture conditions is missing.
- The reliance on Uniqueness and Novelty alone may not adequately reflect model performance, as high scores do not guarantee the generation of useful molecules.
- The discussion on the limitations of these metrics could be more clearly articulated to avoid misunderstandings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the fairness of comparisons by ensuring that the statistical graph in Figure 1(b) follows the same format as in Figure 1(a). Additionally, please specify the ratio of positive to negative samples in the input condition when calculating accuracy in Table 2, and consider using ROC-AUC as a more suitable metric if the original dataset's proportions are maintained. The authors should also clarify how the Avg. Rank is calculated in Table 2 and address the ambiguity regarding the graph-dependent noise schedule's impact. Furthermore, we suggest including metrics such as uniqueness, novelty, and VUN to provide a comprehensive assessment of the method's efficacy. Lastly, testing on more complex condition sets would substantiate the claim of multi-conditional generative capacity. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their discussion regarding the limitations of Uniqueness and Novelty metrics, specifically by revising the original sentence to: "Evaluating solely based on Uniqueness and Novelty may not be sufficient." Including the success rate of 93.3% and the corresponding table in W1 in the revision would provide valuable context for the readers.
