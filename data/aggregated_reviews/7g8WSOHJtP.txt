Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a unified heterophilous message-passing (HTMP) mechanism for heterophilous graph neural networks (HTGNNs) and introduces the Compatibility Matrix-aware Graph Neural Network (CMGNN) to enhance HTGNNs. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of HTMP and CMGNN through empirical evaluations across 10 benchmark datasets and 13 baseline models, showing superior performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The empirical support for claims is robust, with detailed comparisons across multiple benchmark datasets.
2. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, facilitating logical progression through its sections.
3. The proposed HTMP mechanism serves as a guideline for future research on heterophilous GNNs.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks in-depth qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing methods that utilize compatible matrices, which diminishes the significance of its contributions.
2. Certain claims, particularly Observation 1 and Observation 2 in Section 4, require additional theoretical analysis and formal notations for rigorous support.
3. The proposed HTMP unification should be compared against existing survey articles to clarify its unique contributions.
4. The experiments do not include a comparison of training times with baseline models, which would provide valuable insights into the tradeoff between accuracy and training time.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including detailed qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing methods that use compatibility matrices, highlighting performance metrics and robustness tests. Additionally, we suggest providing theoretical analysis and formal notations to support claims made in Observations 1 and 2. It would also be beneficial to compare the proposed HTMP unification against existing categorizations in the literature to clarify its contributions. Lastly, including an analysis of training times alongside accuracy would enhance the understanding of the proposed methods' efficiency.
