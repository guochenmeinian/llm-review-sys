Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the reliability of methods for imperceptibly perturbing images to degrade the performance of latent diffusion models for style mimicry or editing. The authors observe that such perturbations often lead to perceptible artifacts when the “protected” image is reconstructed. They propose a “purification” method that optimizes images based on a consistency objective and a similarity objective, effectively mitigating two recent imperceptible perturbation methods for image editing and style transfer. The results indicate that stronger techniques are needed to protect image data from unwanted diffusion-based manipulation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a timely issue regarding the protection of intellectual property in generative models.
- The purification approach is straightforward to implement and effective in various scenarios.
- The authors evaluate their method against adaptive perturbations and include reasonable protection and purification baselines in their experiments.

Weaknesses:
- Figures 1 and 4 are hard to read, and the labeling may mislead readers regarding the nature of the images presented.
- The choice of evaluation tasks lacks justification, and the dataset sizes are not clearly stated.
- Adaptive protection results are only shown for style mimicry, not editing.
- The computational complexity of the purification method is not discussed, and the paper lacks a thorough comparison with advanced denoising methods.
- The overall contribution may not be significant due to reliance on common denoising techniques and limited exploration of adaptive attacks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the readability of Figures 1 and 4 by adjusting the format or providing separate figures. Additionally, they should clarify the justification for the chosen tasks and provide details on the dataset sizes. Including adaptive protection results for editing tasks would enhance the evaluation. It is crucial to discuss the computational complexity of the purification method and compare it with more optimized baselines. Finally, we suggest exploring advanced denoising methods as potential baselines to strengthen the novelty of the proposed approach.
