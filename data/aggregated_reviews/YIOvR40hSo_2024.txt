Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the DiffPano framework, which generates consistent panoramic images from multiple viewpoints based on text descriptions. The authors create a panoramic video-text dataset using the Habitat Simulator, BLIP2, and an LLM, and fine-tune the Stable Diffusion model with LoRA to develop a single-view panorama model. This model is extended to a multi-view version through a spherical epipolar attention module in the U-Net. The authors address concerns regarding the generalizability of DiffPano, the significance of multi-view ERP panoramas, and the evaluation metrics for their model. Experiments demonstrate that DiffPano produces higher-quality and more consistent multi-view panoramic images than baseline methods, particularly showing improved performance on the FAED metric compared to the MVDream baseline.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper defines an interesting task of generating consistent panoramic images from multiple viewpoints, which could be beneficial for applications like VR environments.
- The introduction of a new dataset for multi-view panoramic generation is significant, aiding further research in this area.
- DiffPano demonstrates the capability to generate realistic panoramas, as evidenced by improved performance on various evaluation metrics, including FID, FAED, IS, and CLIP Score, highlighting strengths in text-image consistency and generation speed.
- The adaptation of epipolar-aware attention to panoramic images is effectively derived mathematically.

Weaknesses:
- The description of panorama generation as a “style transformation” overlooks the geometric constraints necessary for realistic 360-degree panoramas. Clear evaluations of realism, such as using FAED, are needed.
- The absence of qualitative examples of perspective projections limits the evaluation of generated panoramas, which is crucial for assessing realism.
- Concerns exist regarding the generalizability of DiffPano across diverse text prompts, as the two-stage fine-tuning on panoramic data may restrict the diversity inherent in the original Stable Diffusion model.
- The correlation between the CLIP score and the realism of generated panoramas remains unclear.
- The claim regarding "making scalable panoramas possible" is ambiguous and requires further elaboration, particularly concerning the trade-off between speed and generation quality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation of the realism of generated multi-view panoramas by including quantitative metrics and qualitative examples of perspective projections. Addressing the geometric constraints in the generation process is essential. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the experimental setup and parameters used for LoRA-based fine-tuning, and discussing the scalability of their approach to more complex scenarios. We also recommend improving the clarity of how the CLIP score relates to the realism of the generated panoramas and elaborating on the statement regarding scalable panoramas to justify the trade-offs involved. It would be beneficial to include more discussion on the use cases of multi-view panoramas, particularly in enhancing immersive 3D scene generation and their applications in interior home design. Finally, we encourage the authors to incorporate more related work in panoramic 3D scene generation to strengthen their paper further.
