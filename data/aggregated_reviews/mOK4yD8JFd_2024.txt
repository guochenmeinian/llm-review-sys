### Key Points
This paper presents a method for polarimetric image enhancement by fusing noisy and blurry image pairs to produce clean polarized snapshots. The authors propose a three-phase fusing scheme that effectively utilizes the complementary advantages of short and long exposure images while adhering to the physics constraints of polarimetric imaging. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing techniques in polarimetric image enhancement.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The first method for polarimetric image enhancement by fusing noisy and blurry pairs.  
- A novel fusing scheme that retains polarimetric cues by directly processing Degree of Polarization (DoP) and Angle of Polarization (AoP).  
- Sufficient experimental validation showing effective restoration of polarimetric cues, critical for downstream tasks.  
- Well-written and clearly presented, with reasonable network module designs tailored to the fusing process.  

Weaknesses:  
- Limited clarity on real-world experiments and the generation of synthetic datasets, including exposure times and sensor noise considerations.  
- Lack of justification for the choice of the PLIE dataset over other available datasets like LLCP.  
- The proposed method does not significantly improve the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of DoP and AoP, despite enhancements in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).  
- Requiring two shots may be undesirable for some applications, and visual comparisons in the ablation study are needed for better understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the real-world experiments by providing more details on how reference images are obtained and addressing the questions regarding the synthetic dataset generation, including exposure times and sensor noise. Additionally, we suggest justifying the choice of the PLIE dataset over alternatives like the LLCP dataset. To enhance the evaluation of the proposed method, we encourage the authors to include comparison results from other methods in their figures and to clarify the differences between the “reflection-contaminated input” and the “reflection-removed output.” Lastly, addressing the SSIM improvements and the implications of PSNR enhancements on downstream tasks would strengthen the paper.
