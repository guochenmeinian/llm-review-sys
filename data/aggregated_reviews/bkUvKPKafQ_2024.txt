Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ChatQA, a suite of models that outperform GPT-4 on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and conversational question-answering (QA) tasks. The authors propose a two-stage instruction tuning method to enhance generative capabilities and a dense retriever optimized for conversational QA. The ChatQA models demonstrate superior performance on RAG and conversational QA tasks, even when built on foundation models perceived as weaker than GPT-4. Additionally, the paper introduces the ChatRAG Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating RAG and conversational QA models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The two-stage instruction tuning method is a novel approach that significantly enhances context-aware and RAG-based QA capabilities.
2. The research is meticulously conducted, with rigorous experiments and comprehensive evaluations, including valuable ablation studies.
3. The paper is well-written and clearly structured, making it accessible to a broad audience.
4. The findings challenge assumptions about the necessity of synthetic data from OpenAI models, promoting innovative training strategies.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks technical novelty, focusing on fine-tuning a language model using existing datasets without elaborating on the innovative aspects of the methodology.
2. There are unclear definitions and formalizations of tasks, obscuring distinctions between concepts and existing works.
3. The evaluation of "unanswerable" scenarios is limited, and a broader evaluation could enhance robustness.
4. The study primarily focuses on Llama2 and Llama3 models, limiting insights into the generalizability of the proposed methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of task definitions and formalizations to better delineate their methodology's relevance to the RAG framework. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more detailed analysis of the innovative aspects of their approach to highlight its novelty. Expanding the evaluation of "unanswerable" scenarios and including a wider range of base models could enhance the robustness and generalizability of the findings. Finally, we encourage the authors to address potential ethical implications or biases present in the developed models and the ChatRAG Bench.
