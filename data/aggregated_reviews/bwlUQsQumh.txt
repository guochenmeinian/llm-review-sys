Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a general framework for estimating the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) using instrumental variables (IV) in the presence of unmeasured confounding. The authors propose two efficient estimators, IV-RDL1 and IV-RDL2, which demonstrate robustness and efficiency through simulations and real data applications. The method extends Direct Learning (DL) by incorporating an additional scaling factor for outcomes, which is the CATE of the instrument on the treatment.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed method exhibits robustness and efficacy, supported by theoretical proofs and simulation studies.
- The paper is self-contained and presents a well-structured logical framework for estimating CATE and optimal individualized treatment regimes.

Weaknesses:  
- The focus on binary variables limits the generalizability of the findings; a discussion on extending the framework to continuous instrumental variables is needed.
- The literature review is lacking, particularly regarding related work that could provide richer context.
- Assumption 2f is critiqued for being overly strong and potentially non-testable, requiring further discussion on its validity in practical settings.
- The paper lacks a detailed comparison of the proposed estimator's convergence rate with other methods, particularly MRIV.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by including a discussion of related works, such as the paper on fast-converging CATE estimators using instrumental variables. Additionally, the authors should clarify the motivation for using the direct learning approach in the introduction, outlining its advantages over traditional methods. We suggest providing more analysis on the rate of convergence concerning nuisance parameters and justifying why the proposed estimator converges faster than its competitors. Lastly, addressing the limitations of Assumption 2f and exploring its implications in practical scenarios would strengthen the paper.
