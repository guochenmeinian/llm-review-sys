Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an optimal-transport-based distribution robustness framework on model space, establishing a connection between distributional robustness and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM). The authors demonstrate that SAM is a special case of their framework when a Dirac delta distribution is utilized. The framework is validated through experiments showing improvements over baseline methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is theoretically sound and well-written, making it easy to follow.
- The proposed approach shows empirical improvements compared to existing methods like SGD and SAM.

Weaknesses:
- The practical methods in Section 4.2 are difficult to follow; a pseudocode would enhance clarity.
- The theoretical and empirical results lack novelty and do not include a generalization analysis, which is crucial in learning theory.
- The experimental results do not provide standard deviations, undermining their robustness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the practical methods in Section 4.2 by providing pseudocode. Additionally, the authors should conduct a generalization analysis and include standard deviations in the experimental results to strengthen their claims. It would also be beneficial to discuss the limitations of the proposed algorithm, such as the increased computational complexity associated with Bayesian neural networks and the multiple particle setting. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors fully address related works in the PAC-Bayes community to contextualize their contributions better.
