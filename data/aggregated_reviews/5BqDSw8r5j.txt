Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a normalization technique called Slicing Adaptive Normalization (SAN) aimed at addressing non-stationary behavior in time series forecasting. The authors propose to normalize local slices of time series data using their mean and standard deviation, while also predicting the statistics of the target series based on the input series. The method is designed to be model-agnostic and can be integrated into various forecasting models, demonstrating effectiveness through experiments on benchmark datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem of non-stationarity is well-addressed, providing a mechanism to mitigate its impact on predictions.
- The fine-grained normalization approach allows for a more accurate representation of statistical properties within each slice.
- The incorporation of a statistics prediction module enhances the model's adaptability to evolving trends.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed normalization is non-causal, as it uses future values from the input series, making it unsuitable for forecasting.
- There is insufficient comparison with similar existing works, such as DAIN, which may limit the perceived novelty of the approach.
- The experimental section lacks sufficient baseline comparisons, particularly with advanced models like PatchTST and Crossformer.
- The methodology for slicing lacks clarity, and the choice of hyperparameters requires further justification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the causal nature of the normalization method to avoid future value leakage. Additionally, a thorough comparison with existing methods, particularly DAIN, should be included to clarify the novelty of SAN. The authors should expand the experimental section to include advanced baseline models and conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of hyperparameter choices, such as the number of input and output slices. Furthermore, a clearer explanation of the slicing methodology and its implications on performance would enhance the paper's clarity and depth.
