Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents MolPeg, a framework aimed at enhancing the efficiency and generalization of training models in molecular tasks using pretrained models. MolPeg introduces a novel dynamic programming technique that maintains two models with different update paces during training, leveraging loss discrepancies to score and select informative samples. This method is applied in a source-free data pruning scenario, eliminating the need for access to original pretraining data. Extensive experiments across multiple molecular tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the MolPeg method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a novel approach to data pruning by leveraging pretrained models and a loss discrepancy scoring mechanism.
2. The organization of the paper is clear, effectively presenting the problem, proposed solution, and experimental results.
3. Comprehensive experiments across various datasets provide empirical evidence supporting the efficacy of MolPeg.

Weaknesses:
1. The effectiveness of MolPeg is contingent on the quality and suitability of the pretrained models; if suitable models are unavailable, the benefits may not be fully realized.
2. Maintaining and updating two models increases implementation complexity and computational overhead compared to simpler pruning methods.
3. The experimental validation is limited to three molecular datasets, which may not be as persuasive as mainstream datasets like ImageNet. Testing MolPeg with more widely-used datasets is crucial.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the exploration of the motivation behind MolPeg, particularly regarding how to ensure that out-of-distribution samples crucial for each task are not pruned. Additionally, clarifying the definition of 'hard cases' and their task-specific nature would enhance understanding. To strengthen the validation of MolPeg, we suggest including comparisons with mainstream datasets such as ImageNet and other important molecular datasets like MUV.
