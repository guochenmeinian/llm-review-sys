### Key Points
This paper presents a principal-agent model to explore the elicitation of evaluation metrics from agents, focusing on when agents will reveal metrics unknown to the principal and the implications for social welfare. The authors analyze both a binary metric model and a continuous garbling model, validating theoretical insights with real-world Uber-Lyft data. Key contributions include conditions for signal revelation, welfare changes with unknown signals, and the benefits of revealing noisy signals.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
* The paper is well-written and structured, making it easy to follow.
* The analysis is rigorous, with well-justified assumptions and interesting welfare implications in the garbling section.
* The use of real-world data demonstrates the model's applicability to practical scenarios.

Weaknesses:
* The application of the study appears limited, particularly when the principal has prior knowledge of the metric, reducing it to a classic principal-agent problem.
* Some model assumptions are strong and may not hold in general settings, raising questions about the robustness of the insights derived.
* The focus on a single agent overlooks scenarios with multiple agents interacting with the evaluator, and the model does not fully address other influencing factors like reputation or fairness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the applicability of their model in settings where the principal has prior knowledge of the metric. Additionally, the authors should specify which assumptions are violated in their experiments using real data and justify the necessity of these experiments given the results proven in theorems. Furthermore, we suggest exploring the extension of the model to multi-agent settings and considering the impact of various factors beyond economic incentives on information sharing. Finally, connecting their work to existing literature on strategic disclosure and unawareness could enhance the theoretical framework.
