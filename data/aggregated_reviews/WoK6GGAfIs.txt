### Key Points
This paper presents a novel region-based solution, the Centre-Negative algorithm, aimed at mitigating center bias in visual saliency evaluation. The authors propose a low complexity negative map construction method with a time complexity of O(1), which is used to calculate saliency scores. The quality of negative maps is compared across various metrics, demonstrating that those constructed with Centre-Negative yield the highest scores on public datasets. The authors also introduce a new metric for comparing saliency predictions with ground truths from eye tracking, emphasizing the need to balance central and peripheral region importance while penalizing center bias.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The definition of the quality of a metric is well-articulated, aligning the negative map with a solid quality measure.
- The experimental design is robust, with comprehensive comparisons of multiple metrics, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion of the proposed metric's limitations, particularly regarding its additional parameters, which may introduce variability.
- The relationship between the proposed metric and existing metrics is not fully explored, leading to claims that may overlook the adaptability of other techniques.
- The method's specification is incomplete, particularly concerning the standard deviation of the Gaussian center bias.
- The paper is overly lengthy, with some sections containing redundant information.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the necessity of a new bias-specific saliency metric and clarify how existing methods fall short. The potential broader impacts of addressing center bias in medical computer vision should be elaborated upon, along with any known limitations of the Centre-Negative approach. The authors should provide a detailed explanation of how ground truth is determined for the datasets, especially regarding central biases, and validate the generality of the Centre-Negative approach with datasets exhibiting non-central biases. Additionally, we suggest conducting statistical tests to substantiate the claimed performance improvements and discussing scenarios where Centre-Negative may not be the optimal solution. Finally, the authors should consider optimizing deep learning architectures using the new metric and clarify the handling of dense fixation distributions near the center.
