Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Amplified SCAFFOLD, an optimization algorithm for federated learning designed for periodic client participation and heterogeneous data. The authors demonstrate that it achieves reduced communication costs, linear speedup, and resilience to data heterogeneity through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. The algorithm is shown to converge faster than baseline methods, particularly under varying conditions of data heterogeneity and client participation. Additionally, the paper analyzes Amplified SCAFFOLD's performance relative to Amplified FedAvg, focusing on the role of $\bar{K}$, the number of groups in cyclic participation patterns. The authors clarify that $\bar{K}$ does not influence data heterogeneity but affects client participation in training. They assert that changes to $\bar{K}$ should not alter the relative performance of Amplified SCAFFOLD compared to Amplified FedAvg, although empirical evaluations suggest the necessity of testing various $\bar{K}$ values for a comprehensive performance comparison. The authors provide additional experimental results demonstrating that Amplified SCAFFOLD consistently outperforms all baselines across different $\bar{K}$ settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of Amplified SCAFFOLD is well-motivated, with a solid theoretical foundation supporting its advantages over existing methods.
- Extensive experimental validation on both synthetic and real-world datasets (Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10) showcases the algorithm's effectiveness and robustness.
- The authors effectively clarify the notation and its implications for understanding the paper's findings.
- The additional experiments convincingly show that Amplified SCAFFOLD outperforms other algorithms across various $\bar{K}$ values, reinforcing the robustness of their approach.

Weaknesses:
- The algorithm's description lacks detail; a comprehensive explanation is necessary rather than a mere overview.
- Experiments are limited to only two datasets, and additional experiments would better illustrate the performance of Amplified SCAFFOLD.
- Some assumptions, particularly regarding the bounded objective function gap, are overly strong and may not hold in practical scenarios.
- There is uncertainty regarding the performance of Amplified Fedprox on the Fashion-MNIST dataset, with a request for further clarification on the algorithm used.
- The theoretical predictions regarding performance under cyclic participation do not align perfectly with empirical results, raising questions about the underlying reasons for observed discrepancies.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the algorithm's description by providing a detailed breakdown of its components and workings. Additionally, expanding the experimental section to include more datasets and scenarios would strengthen the validation of Amplified SCAFFOLD. Revising the assumptions, particularly in Table 1, to utilize a less restrictive measure of bounded gradient dissimilarity would enhance the relevance of the comparisons made. Furthermore, clarifying the rationale behind hyperparameter choices and providing a notation table would improve the paper's clarity and accessibility. We also suggest that the authors improve clarity by providing a detailed description of the algorithm used for Amplified Fedprox, particularly in relation to the Fashion-MNIST dataset. Lastly, we recommend that the authors further investigate and explain the mechanisms by which Amplified SCAFFOLD maintains performance as $\bar{K}$ increases, as this could enhance the theoretical understanding of their findings.
