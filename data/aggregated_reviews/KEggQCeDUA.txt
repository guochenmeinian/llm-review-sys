### Key Points
This paper presents a structured framework applying measurement theory from social sciences to analyze the validity of red teaming metrics, such as Attack Success Rate (ASR). The authors argue that ASR and similar metrics cannot always be meaningfully compared across systems or over time, supported by illustrative examples. The paper also highlights the lack of attention to detail in experiment design and evaluation measurement within machine learning and industry benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- Identification of the important problem of insufficient attention to evaluation metrics.  
- Clear clarification of measurement theory terms relevant to red teaming.  
- Section 2 provides a comprehensive overview of red teaming, aiding reader understanding.  

Weaknesses:  
- The abstract does not encapsulate the full contributions of the paper.  
- The title fails to indicate the focus on measurement or comparison.  
- The paper lacks practical metrics and approaches for current researchers.  
- Effective communication of measurement theory to the machine learning audience is inadequate.  
- Citations on lines 35, 61, 63, and 69 are improperly formatted, with "e.g." placed incorrectly.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the abstract to reflect the broader contributions of the paper beyond just numerical attack success rates. The title should be revised to hint at themes such as experiment design, measurement theory, metric design, and metric comparison. Additionally, we suggest incorporating empirical case studies or experiments comparing red teaming metrics across different AI systems to demonstrate their limitations. The authors should also provide concrete examples of effective metrics and suggestions for transforming existing evaluation frameworks like HarmBench. Finally, enhancing the communication of measurement theory to practitioners will strengthen the paper's impact.
