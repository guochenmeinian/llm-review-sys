Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Hierarchical Planning with Foundation Models (HiP), a framework aimed at enhancing long-horizon decision-making in novel environments through the integration of multiple data modalities and hierarchical reasoning. The framework employs a large language model for symbolic plan construction, a video diffusion model for generating observation trajectory plans, and a pre-trained robot ego-centric action model for mapping these plans to control space. An iterative refinement approach is proposed to incorporate feedback and promote consensus among models without extensive fine-tuning. Experimental results on two long-horizon tabletop manipulation tasks indicate promising outcomes. The authors also suggest future inclusion of additional modalities, such as touch and sound.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The technical content is sound, and the proposed framework demonstrates promising experimental results.
- The methodology effectively combines language models, video diffusion models, and ego-centric robot control models into a cohesive system.
- The paper is well-structured, providing a logical flow from problem statement to solution and experimental evaluation.

Weaknesses:
- The baselines used for comparison are relatively weak; comparisons with foundation robotics models like SayCan, Gato, and palm-e are more appropriate. The authors claim generalization to new skills but do not demonstrate this adequately.
- The iterative refinement approach, while interesting, requires further scrutiny regarding its computational efficiency and robustness.
- Code for reproducibility is not provided, which is essential given the experimental nature of the work.
- Formatting issues are present in lines 9 and 45.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the baseline comparisons by including stronger foundation robotics models to better situate their work. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed analysis of the iterative refinement approach to clarify its limitations regarding computational efficiency and robustness. To enhance reproducibility, please provide the code associated with the experiments. Lastly, addressing the formatting issues in lines 9 and 45 will improve the overall presentation of the paper.
