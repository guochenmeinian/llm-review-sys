Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an information-theoretic approach to quantify redundancy, uniqueness, and synergy in multimodal distributions using Partial Information Decomposition (PID) statistics. The authors propose two scalable estimators: one exact for low-dimensional data and another approximate for high-dimensional datasets. Extensive experiments validate the usefulness of PID statistics and the proposed estimators across synthetic and real-world datasets, including applications in model selection.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a novel approach to quantify modality interactions, enhancing understanding of multimodal datasets and models.
- The definitions of redundancy, uniqueness, and synergy are intuitive, aiding in the interpretation of multimodal interactions.
- The extensive experimental validation demonstrates the practical applicability of the proposed methods.

Weaknesses:
- The results in Tables 2 and 3 do not convincingly prove the accuracy of the PID estimators, showing significant discrepancies from ground truth values.
- There is a lack of comparison with existing methods, such as Shapley Value, which could provide context for the advantages of PID.
- Some experimental details require clarification, particularly regarding the robustness tests and the handling of missing modalities.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison of their estimators with alternative methods for computing mutual information, such as those referenced in the reviews. Additionally, addressing the absence of multimodal VAEs in the literature could enhance the paper's relevance. Clarifying experimental details, particularly in Section 4.3 regarding missing modalities, is essential. Finally, a dedicated section discussing limitations and potential use cases outside multimodal models would strengthen the paper's contributions.
