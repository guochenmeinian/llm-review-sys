Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents COT-FM, a generalization of the Flow Matching model for conditional generation, focusing on the Conditional Wasserstein Space of joint probability measures on \(Y \times U\) with fixed \(Y\)-marginals \(\mu\). The authors prove that an absolutely continuous path in this space can be generated by a triangular vector field, leading to the proposal of COT-FM as a Flow Matching model utilizing this vector field. The paper also extends the Benamou-Brenier theorem to dynamical conditional optimal transport (COT) and provides numerical simulations demonstrating the model's performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Theoretical analysis of the Conditional Wasserstein Space, including the characterization of absolutely continuous paths and the conditional generalization of the Benamou-Brenier Theorem.
- The proposed methodology is elegant and circumvents issues faced by other methods.
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, fitting well within the conference format.

Weaknesses:
- The connection between Sections 4, 5, and 6 requires clarification, particularly regarding the justification of the triangular parametrization.
- The ability of COT-FM to recover dynamic optimal transport needs further exploration.
- The experiments conducted appear to address conditional generation rather than optimal transport, raising questions about their appropriateness.
- The application of the COT-FM algorithm is limited to scenarios where optimal coupling is provided, restricting its broader applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the connection between Sections 4, 5, and 6, specifically how these sections justify the triangular parametrization of the Flow Matching model. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide clarification on whether COT-FM can recover dynamic optimal transport within the Conditional Wasserstein Space, as referenced in Line 256. It would also be beneficial to include W2 and MMD results between the conditional distributions in Table 1. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to discuss the significance of minibatch optimal coupling for COT-FM and to provide results using independent coupling. Lastly, highlighting the differences between their work and existing literature on conditional optimal transport could enhance the paper's appeal.
