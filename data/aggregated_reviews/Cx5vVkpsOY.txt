### Key Points
This paper reviews the under-explored role of pragmatics in language grounding, emphasizing its significance in language understanding tasks that involve rich contextual references. The authors provide a comprehensive survey of relevant literature and propose that current NLP methods should better incorporate pragmatic considerations, particularly in the context of large language models (LLMs). 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a timely and important topic, highlighting the significance of pragmatics in language understanding (R1, R3).
- It offers a thorough overview of pragmatics and relevant task settings, providing valuable guidance for future research (R2, R3).
- The writing is clear and well-supported by references, making it accessible to researchers from outside linguistics (R1, R2).

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a new model or evaluation, which is typically expected at EMLNP, and remains vague on how pragmatic tasks can be effectively utilized to advance LLMs (R1, R3).
- There is a perceived narrow focus on linguistic interaction, with insufficient discussion on the implications of situated interaction and the dynamics of context (R2).

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding the term "context," distinguishing between textual and physical contexts. Additionally, we suggest that the authors delineate the semantics-pragmatics interface more explicitly. To enhance the flow, a smoother transition between sections 2 and 3 is needed. It would also be beneficial to address the claim that LLMs exhibit emergent behaviors, potentially including pragmatic qualities, and to explore whether pragmatics can emerge from textual learning. Finally, consider incorporating relevant recent references, such as the suggested paper on the ReferItGame and the work by Dingemanse et al. on interaction.
