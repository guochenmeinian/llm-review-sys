Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents novel methods for learning linear structural equation models from partially observed data, incorporating latent variables. The authors propose sufficient and necessary graphical conditions for parameter identifiability and describe a likelihood-based parameter estimation method validated through empirical studies on synthetic and real-world datasets. The work addresses the important problem of parameter identification in linear causal models, which has not been previously explored in this context.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The manuscript is clear, well-written, and makes a significant contribution to the causality community. It provides non-trivial graphical conditions for parameter identifiability and presents compelling empirical results. The theoretical sections on identifiability are well-reasoned, and the implementation is efficient.

Weaknesses:  
The discussion of necessary graphical conditions is somewhat confusing, particularly regarding the terms used and the lack of specific counterexamples. The sufficient conditions for parameter identifiability are restrictive, and the gap between sufficient and necessary conditions is not clearly articulated. Additionally, the computational complexity of parameter identification is not addressed, and the paper's focus on linear relationships limits its applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the discussion surrounding necessary graphical conditions by avoiding vague terms like "pretty close to...necessary" and providing specific counterexamples. Consider including a disjunctive graphical condition to cover rare structures that violate existing conditions. Additionally, we suggest discussing the computational complexity of parameter identification and exploring the implications of using non-Gaussian noise distributions. Clarifying the relationship between sufficient and necessary conditions would enhance the manuscript's rigor. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide a comparison with established methods, such as the PC algorithm, to strengthen the evaluation of their approach.
