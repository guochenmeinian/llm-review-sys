### Key Points
This paper presents TAPTAP, a method aimed at enhancing the quality of training data for tabular prediction tasks. The authors propose a framework that involves pretraining a language model on public tabular datasets using static prompts, followed by fine-tuning and data sampling. The synthetic data generated addresses four key challenges: privacy protection, low resource regime, missing value imputation, and imbalanced classification. The experimental results across 12 publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TAPTAP in improving performance for these tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed data generator model is novel and generalizable across various tabular prediction tasks.
- The comprehensive experimental evaluation provides empirical insights into the method's effectiveness in multiple scenarios.
- The work addresses crucial challenges in medical data engineering, particularly privacy protection and missing data imputation.

Weaknesses:
- The paper overclaims its contribution as "the first attempt to apply table pre-training to tabular prediction," overlooking prior attempts in the field.
- There is a lack of qualitative analysis regarding the quality of the synthesized table examples, raising concerns about the potential noise in the augmented data.
- The paper's structure makes it difficult to discern the main contributions and the linkage between tabular prediction and experiments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper's structure to better highlight the main contributions of TAPTAP. Additionally, we suggest conducting a qualitative analysis of the synthesized data to ensure its utility for downstream models. It would also be beneficial to provide the collected datasets for future research. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to delve deeper into the fidelity, utility, and privacy aspects of the synthetic data generated by their method.
