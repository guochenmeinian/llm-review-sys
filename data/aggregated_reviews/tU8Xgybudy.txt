Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel benchmark for assessing the alignment between human observers and vision models in 3D shape inference. The benchmark includes a diverse dataset of over 2000 unique image triplets, featuring common objects and abstract shapes under various conditions. The study collects 35,000 trials from over 500 participants, analyzing choice behavior, reaction time, and eye-tracking data. The authors evaluate models trained with DINOv2, MAE, and CLIP, revealing that while humans significantly outperform these models, the research provides insights into their performance and limitations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well written and easy to follow.
- It provides a comprehensive dataset and a thoughtful multi-level evaluation approach, including reaction times and eye-tracking data.
- The extensive experiments and analysis illustrate the correlation and subtle differences between human and model behaviors.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset's size and diversity could be improved, particularly regarding the realism of 3D models, which may introduce bias in human responses.
- The evaluation metrics for the models are limited, and there is a need for stronger models to better understand the attention mechanisms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset by incorporating higher fidelity stimulus sets to enhance realism. Additionally, we suggest exploring the impact of different augmentations (e.g., rotated images, high resolution) on model performance to better align with human processing. The authors should also consider discussing the potential for DINOv2 to learn contrasting features in high similarity settings, as well as the implications for 3D understanding standards. Lastly, we encourage the inclusion of a discussion on the total time for DINOv2 trials compared to human reaction times in the final version.
