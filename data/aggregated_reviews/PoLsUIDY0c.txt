### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework for text-guided image editing using Diffusion Models, addressing overfitting and computation time issues. The authors propose simultaneous optimization of text embedding and UNet, utilizing BLIP captions to enhance efficiency and reduce overfitting. The method shows significant improvements over the baseline solution, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the TEdBench benchmark.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The 14x speed-up in optimization compared to Imagic is impressive, particularly through the merging of initial stages and the use of BLIP-generated captions.
2. The authors convincingly separate UNet encoder and decoder responsibilities to mitigate overfitting.
3. The vector projection technique for controlling identity and editing strength in text embedding is insightful.
4. The paper is well-structured, easy to read, and includes interesting observations about UNet properties and usability.

Weaknesses:
1. Limited qualitative examples and evaluation on only one benchmark (TEdBench) restrict the demonstration of the method's versatility and robustness.
2. The quantitative analysis lacks comparisons with a wider range of methods beyond Imagic and does not include sufficient quantitative ablation studies to assess individual contributions.
3. The method requires some manual effort despite proposing a threshold approach.
4. Minor typographical errors detract from the overall quality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the qualitative examples by extending the dataset to showcase applications in diverse domains, such as fashion visual try-ons. Additionally, including evaluations against a broader range of methods and datasets would strengthen the validation of the approachâ€™s generalization. A thorough quantitative ablation study is necessary to clarify the contributions of new techniques like joint optimization and vector projection. Furthermore, addressing the minor typographical errors and enhancing the clarity of figures would improve the presentation quality.
