### Key Points
This paper presents a study on source task selection in transfer learning, specifically examining whether understanding pairwise task relationships enhances source task selection. The authors construct a large-scale benchmark, TaskWeb, for pairwise transfer among 22 NLP tasks and introduce a method, TaskShop, to estimate the usefulness of source tasks. The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach across various model architectures and settings, providing valuable insights into task commutativity and transitivity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The investigation into pairwise transferability is novel and well-executed.
- The paper is well-organized and easy to follow, with comprehensive experimental design.
- The observations regarding commutativity and transitivity are insightful and beneficial for the community.
- The proposed method shows effectiveness over baselines in both single-task and multi-task settings.

Weaknesses:
- There is a lack of statistical significance tests for the results.
- Scalability concerns arise, as the method requires target tasks to share "sufficiently similar traits" with those in TaskWeb.
- The absence of simple heuristic baselines limits the comparison of the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by adding simple heuristic baselines to enhance comparative analysis. Additionally, clearly defining the limitations related to scalability and the computational intensity of necessary steps for tasks not sufficiently similar to those in TaskWeb is essential. The authors should also clarify the "zero-shot" setup, as having access to labeled examples typically does not qualify as zero-shot. Finally, incorporating statistical significance tests would strengthen the empirical findings.
