Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the FIT-COACH benchmark and dataset, aimed at developing video language models for situated interactions, specifically in live fitness coaching scenarios. The authors conduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art video language models (VLMs) on this task, revealing significant challenges and opportunities for improvement. They propose a novel video language model, STREAM-VLM, which advances beyond traditional turn-based interactions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a relevant research problem, enhancing user learning and support through real-time interactions.
- The experimental analysis is thorough, testing a wide range of baseline models, which highlights the proposed method's effectiveness and limitations.
- The dataset construction is comprehensive, covering long-range videos with corrective feedback, which is beneficial for future fitness material development.

Weaknesses:
- The absence of provided data and model code hinders reproducibility and verification of results.
- The dataset is simulated in a lab environment rather than collected from real-world gym settings, potentially affecting its realism.
- The title may mislead readers regarding the dataset's focus, which could be better reflected.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the transparency of their dataset by providing access to the data and model code to facilitate reproducibility. Additionally, clarifying the data collection process and the creation of question-answer pairs would enhance understanding. The authors should consider addressing the potential biases introduced by the casual background scenes in the dataset. Lastly, revising the title to better reflect the fitness focus of the dataset would improve clarity.
