Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on estimating effective resistance in weighted, undirected expander graphs, proposing a new algorithm that achieves a time complexity of \(O(m/\epsilon)\) for constructing an effective resistance sketch. This improves upon previous algorithms, particularly for sparse graphs. The authors also establish a conditional lower bound of \(\Omega(n^2/\epsilon^{0.5})\) for computing effective resistance across all pairs of edges, utilizing a novel reduction to the triangle detection problem. The paper employs asymmetric factorization techniques and CountSketch for efficient computation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper provides significant theoretical advancements in estimating effective resistance, particularly for sparse expander graphs.
2. It introduces a clever use of asymmetric factorization and CountSketch, demonstrating substantial technical depth.
3. The writing is generally clear, with high-level intuitions well articulated, making the paper accessible despite its theoretical nature.

Weaknesses:
1. The practical application of the results is limited due to the focus on expander graphs, which may not generalize well to broader graph classes.
2. The improvements over previous work, particularly compared to Li and Sachdeva [SODAâ€™23], are somewhat marginal and primarily applicable to specific cases.
3. The paper lacks empirical evaluations to substantiate the theoretical claims, which is particularly important for a NeurIPS submission.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the accessibility of the paper by providing more detailed explanations in the preliminaries section to aid readers unfamiliar with spectral graph theory. Additionally, we suggest including empirical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. To enhance the relevance of the work, the authors should explore extending their techniques to general graphs, potentially discussing avenues for achieving this in the paper. Furthermore, clarifying notation and definitions, such as \(\tilde{O}(\cdot)\) and the edge-vertex incident matrix \(B_G\), would benefit the overall presentation.
