### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method called HarmonicFlow, which utilizes flow matching for protein-ligand docking and binding site design. The authors claim state-of-the-art performance compared to DiffDock, demonstrating improvements in ligand RMSD and extending their approach to design protein pockets through discrete residue type generation. The method incorporates innovative components such as TFN layers and harmonic priors, validated through extensive experiments on datasets like PDBBind and Binding MOAD.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The authors provide interesting results on sequence similarity splits, showing better performance compared to previous time-based splits.  
- The use of flow matching effectively leverages the advantage of choosing priors, separating ligands and target proteins.  
- The paper is well-written and presents a compelling case for the method's relevance to the AI4SCI community.

Weaknesses:  
- The selection of baselines is limited; comparisons to strong physics-based docking programs like GLIDE would enhance the evaluation.  
- Claims regarding enzyme design should be moderated, as historical attempts in the 80s/90s indicated that stabilizing the ground state can diminish function.  
- Some equations are complex, making the paper difficult to follow, and the assumption of readers' deep understanding of specific mathematical concepts hinders comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including comparisons to strong physics-based baselines such as GLIDE. Additionally, we suggest moderating the claims related to enzyme design to reflect historical challenges. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide clearer explanations of complex equations and offer background on specific mathematical concepts to enhance reader comprehension.
