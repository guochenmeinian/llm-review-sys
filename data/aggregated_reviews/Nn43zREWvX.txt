### Key Points
This paper presents SNIP, a multi-modal symbolic-numeric pre-training model aimed at understanding both symbolic and numeric aspects of mathematical functions. SNIP is trained on a synthetic dataset of paired numeric and symbolic data and employs t-SNE visualizations to illustrate that its latent space is influenced by both properties. The authors propose that SNIP excels in property prediction tasks, outperforming purely supervised models, and utilize various training configurations to evaluate SNIP's learned representations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- **Originality**: SNIP offers a novel approach to understanding symbolic and numeric aspects of mathematical functions, addressing a gap in current research.  
- **Convincing Probing Tests**: The property probing tests provide a robust, quantitative assessment of SNIP's capabilities, which is compelling.  
- **Broad Applications**: The model shows potential for various data-scientific and machine learning applications.  

Weaknesses:  
- **Ignoring Real-world Noise**: The paper does not address how SNIP would manage noise in real-world data, a significant limitation that could be remedied by adding noise to the numerical data.  
- **Incomplete End-to-End Description**: While the encoder training is detailed, the decoding process from latent embedding to symbols or numerics is insufficiently described. A capable symbolic decoder could enhance SNIP's performance in end-to-end regression tasks.  
- **T-SNE's Limitations**: The t-SNE visualizations, though visually appealing, lack the quantitative rigor necessary for stronger validation.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on how SNIP handles noise in real-world data by incorporating noise into the numerical data. Additionally, we suggest providing a more comprehensive description of the decoding process from latent embeddings to symbols or numerics, as this could significantly enhance the model's applicability in end-to-end regression tasks. Finally, we encourage the authors to address the limitations of t-SNE visualizations by including more quantitative analysis to bolster their findings.
