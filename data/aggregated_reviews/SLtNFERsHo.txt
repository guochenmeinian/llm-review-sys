Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CoLA, a library designed to automate large-scale linear algebra operations, particularly for structured matrices relevant in machine learning applications. The authors propose a "structure-aware" approach that leverages problem structure to enhance algorithm efficiency, aiming to make advanced linear algebra techniques accessible to users with limited algorithmic knowledge. The library integrates with existing frameworks like JAX and PyTorch, supports GPU acceleration, and includes features for automatic differentiation in iterative routines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, clearly articulating the problem and proposed solution.
- CoLA's modular structure is beneficial for its growth and community impact.
- The library automates the selection of algorithms based on matrix properties, which can significantly aid users in machine learning.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the work is limited; many algorithms discussed are not new, and the library consolidates existing methods rather than introducing groundbreaking innovations.
- The number of dispatch rules is relatively small, raising questions about the library's practicality for new model implementations.
- Performance comparisons with existing libraries show mixed results, with some benchmarks indicating that CoLA may not outperform established alternatives.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the number of dispatch rules available, ensuring that users understand how to leverage them effectively. Additionally, consider expanding the library's capabilities by incorporating more dispatch rules and optimizing existing algorithms, such as exploring accelerated versions of SVRG for better performance. We suggest providing clearer explanations of the numerical algorithms used in performance comparisons, particularly in figures, to enhance understanding of CoLA's advantages. Finally, addressing the potential for a Julia port could broaden the library's accessibility and impact within the community.
