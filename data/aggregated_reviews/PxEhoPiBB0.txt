### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of GPT-4's capabilities as a data analyst, focusing on data collection via SQL, data visualization, and insights generation. The authors evaluate GPT-4's performance against human data analysts across various experience levels using 1000 natural language queries from the NvBench dataset. The findings indicate that GPT-4 can outperform intern and junior data analysts in several scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a timely and relevant topic with significant audience appeal.
- It includes a detailed experimental setup and extensive evaluations, providing a solid foundation for future research.
- The writing is clear and accessible, making the content easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a contribution towards a new solution and does not explore the handling of open-ended questions, which are common in data analysis.
- Proposed evaluation metrics are subjective, particularly concerning Aesthetics, Complexity, and Fluency, with unclear measures for correctness.
- Limited evaluation is conducted with only six human evaluators, and results for other language models are not provided.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the robustness of their evaluation metrics to minimize subjectivity and clarify how correctness is determined. Additionally, conducting more experiments with a larger number of human evaluators and including results from a wider range of large language models would enhance the study's comprehensiveness. Finally, addressing the handling of open-ended questions and providing details on how Google search results are integrated into the analysis would strengthen the paper.
