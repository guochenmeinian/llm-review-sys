Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a systematic study of reasoning shortcuts (RS) in neuro-symbolic learning, defining RS as instances where neural networks fail to learn generalizable concepts. The authors identify key conditions for RS occurrence and propose four mitigation strategies: knowledge-based, data-based, objective-based, and architecture-based. The analysis includes empirical and theoretical evaluations across various datasets, revealing the impact of these strategies on performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-motivated, clearly written, and presents a formal definition of RS, which is a significant contribution to the field.
- The proposed mitigation strategies are novel in their framing and connect existing methods under the concept of RS.
- The experimental analysis is appropriate and supports the claims made.

Weaknesses:
- The focus on probabilistic logic approaches limits the scope of neuro-symbolic learning addressed.
- The introduction of numerous concepts may confuse readers unfamiliar with the subfield.
- The paper lacks a thorough comparison with other models, which diminishes the significance of the findings.
- Some experimental results and tables lack clarity and require further explanation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity in the presentation of tables and results, particularly in Table 1 and Table 2, by providing detailed explanations of the data represented. Additionally, we suggest that the authors address the limitations of their approach by comparing their methods against a broader range of baseline models, including fully neural and other neuro-symbolic methods. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the relationship between RS and the choice of concepts, particularly in cases where datasets are exhaustive. Finally, we recommend separating the discussion on Shannon entropy loss into an additional subsection to clarify its implications for mitigating RS.
