Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to infer parameters of governing equations for dynamical systems represented by point clouds, utilizing persistent homology to capture topological features. The authors propose a Latent ODE system to model the temporal evolution of these features, allowing for the identification and regression of underlying parameters. The method is benchmarked against state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating significant improvements in performance across various scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work introduces a unique method combining persistent homology with inverse problems, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of point clouds.
- The originality of modeling the dynamics of vectorized persistence diagrams via a continuous latent variable model is noteworthy.
- The paper is well-structured, with a comprehensive literature review and clear experimental results supporting the proposed methodology.

Weaknesses:
- The paper closely aligns with existing works on inverse problems for dynamical systems, lacking sufficient comparison with related methods that do not model topological features.
- There is insufficient discussion on computational limitations, including a lack of quantitative analysis on run times and complexity.
- The use of classical persistent homology via Rips filtrations is not fully explored, and the paper does not adequately track the evolution of individual topological features.
- Clarity issues arise in the description of the regression objective and the encoding of system parameters, making implementation difficult.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with existing methods in inverse problems to highlight the unique contributions of their approach. A more detailed discussion on computational limitations, including effective run times and complexity, should be included. Additionally, exploring advanced persistent homology techniques beyond Rips filtrations and providing a clearer explanation of the regression objective and parameter encoding would enhance the paper's clarity and usability. Finally, including a minimalist proof-of-concept experiment could help readers better understand the implementation of the proposed method.
