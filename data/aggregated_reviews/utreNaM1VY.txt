Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the potential for improvements in sample complexities for semi-supervised learning (SSL) compared to supervised and unsupervised learning, specifically in the context of a classification problem with symmetrical Gaussian classes. The findings indicate that while no improvement in sample complexity rates is achievable, enhancements in error rates by a constant factor are possible. The authors propose an algorithm that demonstrates lower error rates than both supervised and unsupervised learning, supported by experiments on synthetic and real-world data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The investigation into whether SSL can theoretically outperform supervised and unsupervised learning is highly relevant and impactful.
- The paper features a deep theoretical analysis with derived minimax upper and lower bounds.
- The theoretical findings are validated through experiments, enhancing the credibility of the results.
- The paper is well-organized and effectively communicates complex ideas, making it accessible to readers.

Weaknesses:
- The work overlooks a significant recent survey on the topic (Mey & Loog, 2019).
- The reliance on Gaussian mixture models (GMM) introduces strong assumptions that limit the generalizability of the findings.
- The proposed SSL switching algorithm introduces an extra hyperparameter, which may be sensitive to selection, complicating its application in scenarios with limited labeled data.
- Some methodological details require further elaboration, particularly regarding the treatment of parameters and assumptions in the algorithm.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the recent survey by Mey & Loog (2019) to contextualize their findings within the broader literature. Additionally, consider expanding the theoretical analysis to include more complex distributions beyond GMMs to enhance applicability. We suggest exploring data-dependent bounds that relate to problem difficulty rather than solely focusing on worst-case scenarios. Furthermore, clarify the role of the hyperparameter in the SSL switching algorithm and explore methods for estimating its value to mitigate sensitivity issues.
