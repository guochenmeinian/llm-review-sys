### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework called HEI (Heterophily-Guided Environment Inference) that addresses the issue of heterophilic graph structure distribution shifts (HGSS) in semi-supervised learning tasks. The authors propose a method to generate invariant node representations by leveraging heterophily information and estimated neighbor patterns, inferring latent environments without data augmentation. The framework is validated through extensive experiments, demonstrating strong performance across various benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Strong Innovation: The paper introduces a significant perspective on handling heterogeneous data distributions in graph learning.
2. Comprehensive Experimental Validation: Extensive comparisons with existing methods validate the proposed approach's effectiveness and robustness.
3. Good Writing: The writing is clear and detailed, meeting academic standards.
4. Theoretical Support: The framework is grounded in solid theoretical analysis, enhancing its credibility.

Weaknesses:
1. Formatting Issues: There are inconsistencies in figure formatting and citation styles throughout the paper.
2. Lack of Clarity in the Introduction: The description of the proposed method is vague, lacking specific contributions and methodology.
3. Insufficient Background: Core concepts such as environmental inference and node pattern estimation are not adequately explained.
4. Limited Experimental Scope: The experiments focus on a few datasets, lacking discussion on larger-scale applications.
5. Inadequate Parameter Sensitivity Analysis: There is insufficient analysis of hyperparameters beyond the number of training environments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction by integrating the problem background with the proposed solution, explicitly detailing how HEI addresses existing limitations. Additionally, we suggest providing a formal definition of the out-of-distribution (OOD) problem in heterophilic graphs and clarifying the term "environment" used in the paper. The authors should also include more quantitative descriptions in Section 4.2 and enhance the analysis of performance gaps with existing methods. Furthermore, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of hyperparameters, including the choice of similarity computation methods, should be conducted. Lastly, we encourage the authors to discuss the assumptions related to the similarity-based mechanism and provide implementation details, such as source code.
