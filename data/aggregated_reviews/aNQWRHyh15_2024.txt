Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the In-and-Out algorithm for uniform sampling from high-dimensional convex bodies, offering improved runtime complexity and guarantees, particularly regarding Rényi divergence. The algorithm employs an alternating in-and-out move strategy, enhancing traditional methods like ball walk and hit-and-run. The analysis leverages existing proximal sampling frameworks, establishing strong results related to mixing rates influenced by the isoperimetric properties of the convex body.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The introduction of the "in-and-out" algorithm provides a fresh perspective on uniform sampling, utilizing a heat flow approach.  
- The paper achieves stronger guarantees in terms of Rényi divergence, encompassing various divergence measures.  
- The analysis from a heat flow perspective offers new insights and extends known results for unconstrained domains.  
- The paper is well-written, clear, and easy to follow, with straightforward proofs.

Weaknesses:  
- The technical contributions are somewhat limited as the analysis techniques are already established in the literature.  
- There is a lack of practical application examples and a numerical comparison of the In-and-Out method against existing algorithms.  
- The practical advantages of the proposed method over previous work remain unclear, particularly regarding query complexity and the similarity of methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the relationship between Theorems 1, 2, and 3, possibly by relocating Lemma 9 for better coherence. Additionally, including a table summarizing rates under different assumptions alongside related results would enhance reader comprehension. We suggest providing more details on the initialization process and parameter selection for the algorithm. Furthermore, discussing potential applications in machine learning where the membership oracle model is beneficial would strengthen the paper's relevance. Lastly, clarifying the role of the time-reversal SDE and its application in the analysis would be beneficial for readers.
