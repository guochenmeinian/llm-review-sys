### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to modeling temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) using n-tuples associated with timestamps, resulting in N-tuple augmented temporal knowledge graphs (N-TKGs). The authors propose a reasoning model, NE-Net, which captures interactions among concurrent facts and temporal patterns. They provide two datasets for evaluation, demonstrating that NE-Net outperforms static n-tuple and temporal quadruple baselines in predicate and entity prediction tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of N-TKGs and the NE-Net model offers a new perspective on TKG reasoning, addressing limitations of traditional quadruple-based formulations.
- The paper is well-written and presents experimental results that support the effectiveness of the proposed method.
- The authors contribute two new datasets that could benefit the TKG research community.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity, particularly in section 4, where terms like "predicate instance" and "predicate type" are not well-defined.
- The experimental results are not sufficiently convincing due to the absence of recent competitive models and a lack of case studies.
- The necessity of N-TKG reasoning is inadequately justified, as static n-tuple models can represent temporal facts effectively.
- The choice of a time window of only 2 in NE-Net raises questions about the utilization of temporal information.
- The complexity and parameter count of the NE-Net model are unclear, and comparisons with existing approaches are insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of section 4 by defining key terms such as "predicate instance" and "predicate type." Additionally, the authors should include more recent competitive models in their experiments to strengthen their claims. A detailed case study demonstrating how auxiliary entities contribute to reasoning would enhance the experimental section. We also suggest providing a clearer explanation of the dataset construction process, particularly regarding predicate selection. Furthermore, the authors should justify the choice of a time window of only 2 in NE-Net and clarify the model's complexity and parameter count in comparison to existing approaches.
