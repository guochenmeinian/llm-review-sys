Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ZoDiac, a novel image watermarking method that utilizes a pre-trained stable diffusion model to embed watermarks in a trainable latent space, enhancing robustness against various image attacks. The authors claim that ZoDiac outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, demonstrating strong effectiveness across three benchmarks: MS-COCO, DiffusionDB, and WikiArt. The method is particularly noted for its efficiency in watermarking both AI-generated and real-world images without extensive retraining. Additionally, ZoDiac shows superior watermark detection rates (WDR) compared to the strongest baseline, StegaStamp, and other approaches like CIN, across different false positive rates (FPR) and attack scenarios. The authors acknowledge the need for more comprehensive evaluations, particularly under varying FPR levels and hyperparameter settings for attack methods, to better illustrate the robustness of ZoDiac.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and easy to read.
- Comprehensive experiments demonstrate ZoDiac's effectiveness and robustness against various attacks.
- The approach saves time and computational resources by leveraging pre-trained models.
- ZoDiac shows superior watermark detection rates compared to StegaStamp and CIN across multiple attack scenarios.
- The authors conducted additional experiments to address reviewer concerns, demonstrating ZoDiac's robustness under severe image quality degradation.

Weaknesses:
- The method is inefficient, requiring 45.4 - 255.9 seconds to watermark a single image.
- While empirical robustness is shown, there is a lack of theoretical justification for the method's resilience to attacks.
- The paper does not explore watermark patterns beyond the concentric ring-like design, limiting its scope.
- Insufficient details on benchmark methods and attack parameters raise concerns about the fairness of robustness comparisons.
- The comparison of methods using different message types lacks clarity and may mislead interpretations of performance.
- The current evaluations do not fully encompass the range of attack levels and thresholds necessary for a holistic understanding of robustness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and rigor of their definitions and evaluations. Specifically, they should:
1. Provide detailed information on the benchmark methods and attack parameters used, ensuring that comparisons of robustness are fair and significant.
2. Justify the definition of "significant" changes in image quality and clarify the acceptable PSNR thresholds for watermark detection.
3. Include a TPR-FPR curve for all watermarking methods to illustrate the trade-offs in detection performance.
4. Explore the potential for different watermark patterns and provide theoretical support for the robustness claims made about ZoDiac.
5. Conduct additional experiments to validate the robustness of ZoDiac under controlled conditions, ensuring that comparisons with other methods are meaningful and rigorous.
6. Improve the clarity of comparisons involving different message types by providing explicit explanations in the revised paper.
7. Conduct further experiments with a broader range of FPR levels and hyperparameter settings for attack methods to enhance the robustness evaluation.
