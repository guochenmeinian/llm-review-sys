Aggregated Review:
**Key Points:**
This paper presents a benchmark for ranking distillation, introducing the Ranking Distillation Suite (RD-Suite) which includes four popular datasets and two applications: standard distillation and distillation transfer. The authors conduct experiments on various ranking losses and aim to address critical questions regarding methodology and reproducibility in the field of learning to rank (LTR) and knowledge distillation.

**Strengths and Weaknesses:**
Strengths include the comprehensive nature of the benchmark, which covers a wide range of tasks and provides reproducible code, making it accessible for future research. The paper is well-written and easy to follow. However, weaknesses lie in the lack of consideration for the three raised questions in the benchmark design, insufficient explanation of experimental results, and the absence of a complete LTR distillation framework in the codebase. Additionally, the paper does not discuss its limitations, and the presentation of some concepts, such as "dark knowledge," is unclear.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
We recommend that the authors improve the integration of the three questions into the benchmark design and provide clearer explanations for the experimental results, particularly regarding the performance of RD and RankDistil compared to simpler loss functions like MSE. It would be beneficial to include a complete LTR distillation framework in the codebase, along with detailed documentation. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors clarify the introduction of the ranking distillation problem, explicitly state the answers to the raised questions, and polish the English throughout the paper to enhance readability. Lastly, we encourage the authors to publicize the optimal hyperparameters corresponding to each benchmark result.
