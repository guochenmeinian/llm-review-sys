Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents NerfBaselines, a benchmark for evaluating NeRF-based and 3D Gaussian Splatting methods for novel view synthesis. The authors propose a unified interface that standardizes dataset formats and evaluation protocols, ensuring reproducibility through environmental isolation using Docker and Apptainer. Additionally, a web-based viewer facilitates camera trajectory editing and performance visualization. The work emphasizes the importance of reproducibility and fair evaluation in the community, addressing inconsistencies in existing evaluation protocols.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The effort towards a shared interface enhances reproducibility without altering original implementations.
- The unification of evaluation protocols is significant, especially after analyzing inconsistencies across papers.
- The web-based platform serves as a valuable resource for researchers, enabling faster comparative experiments.
- The new viewer supports qualitative assessments, complementing traditional quantitative evaluations.

Weaknesses:
- The sustainability of the NerfBaselines platform is a concern, particularly regarding the addition of new methods and datasets.
- The comparison with prior NeRF codebases, such as NeRFStudio, requires more detailed discussion to clarify the advantages of NerfBaselines.
- The documentation lacks detail on integrating new methods and datasets, which may hinder usability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the maintenance and update plan for the NerfBaselines platform to ensure it remains current with emerging research. Additionally, providing detailed documentation and tutorials on incorporating new methods would enhance usability. The authors should clarify the unique advantages of NerfBaselines over existing frameworks like NeRFStudio, particularly in terms of the unified evaluation protocol's value. Lastly, addressing the efficiency metrics and clarifying the meaning of terms like "GPU mem. hrs" in figures would improve the clarity of the results presented.
