### Key Points
This paper presents a novel corpus comprising approximately 3,447 unique articles collected from state-backed propaganda websites, with translations across seven languages, totaling around 14,053 articles. The authors provide a quantitative overview of the dataset, including linguistic, topic, and temporal analyses, alongside an open-source toolkit for processing the information. The analysis includes n-gram frequency, language distribution, and psycho-linguistic evaluation using LIWC2015.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The dataset is timely and valuable for various disciplines, including NLP, sociology, and discourse analysis.  
- The article offers an interesting discussion on methods and their limitations, as well as ethical considerations.  
- Reviewers noted the potential for a wide range of research possibilities stemming from the corpus.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks a comprehensive background analysis of existing work in propaganda detection, which is crucial for contextualizing the new resource.  
- There are concerns regarding the reproducibility of topic detection due to the presence of outliers and the specificity of content analysis to the studied websites.  
- The analysis could benefit from more refined textual analysis techniques beyond n-gram methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the background analysis by incorporating relevant literature on propaganda detection and existing datasets. Including examples of the dataset would enhance reader understanding. Clarifying how articles are labeled with topics and addressing the language of the original articles in Table 1 is essential. We also suggest merging sections on article backdating for clarity and adding a section on future work, including potential applications of language models. Finally, addressing minor typographical issues and ensuring all figures and tables referenced are included will improve the overall presentation.
