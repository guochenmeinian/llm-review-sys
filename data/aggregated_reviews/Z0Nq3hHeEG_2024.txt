Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method to enhance GAN-based posterior samplers for solving inverse problems by introducing regularization to correct the principal components of the posterior covariance matrix. The authors propose a conditional GAN (cGAN) framework, referred to as "pcaGAN," that incorporates new regularization terms for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. The method aims to improve posterior sampling in image recovery tasks, particularly in denoising and MRI recovery, and is validated through experiments on various datasets. The authors argue that pcaGAN outperforms existing cGANs and diffusion methods in terms of speed and accuracy. The introduction has been revised to clarify the context and significance of the work, addressing concerns about terminology, particularly regarding "hallucinations" in generated images.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a clear motivation for the proposed method.
- The idea of adding regularization to fit the principal components of the posterior distribution is novel and important for visualizing uncertainty in reconstructions.
- Empirical studies demonstrate the method's applicability and competitive performance against existing methods.
- The revised introduction effectively contextualizes the work within the broader literature on image recovery and posterior sampling.

Weaknesses:
- The paper contains inaccuracies in the introduction regarding the perception-distortion tradeoff and its implications for point estimators, which require correction or clarification.
- The terminology around "hallucinations" may mislead readers, particularly those from different fields.
- The experimental comparisons are limited, lacking a comprehensive set of baseline methods and failing to adequately compare with recent diffusion models and other state-of-the-art techniques.
- The absence of an ablation study on the regularization terms and the parameter \( P_{rc} \) raises concerns about the robustness of the findings.
- The paper lacks theoretical guarantees for the proposed method, which could strengthen its contribution.
- Some results appear inconsistent with established benchmarks, necessitating further validation and transparency regarding experimental setups.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the accuracy of the introduction by revising the claims related to the perception-distortion tradeoff and providing clear definitions for all terminology used, particularly regarding "hallucinations," to avoid misleading interpretations. Additionally, please conduct an ablation study to assess the impact of the regularization terms and the choice of \( P_{rc} \). Expanding the experimental section to include comparisons with more recent posterior sampling techniques, such as DDRM and DDNM, would strengthen the contribution of the work. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to incorporate theoretical guarantees similar to those in rcGAN to enhance the impact of the contribution. Lastly, we suggest providing plots that illustrate the variation in generated statistics over training epochs to clarify the effects of the new regularization terms and ensure that all experimental results are reproducible by sharing the code and hyperparameters used in the experiments.
