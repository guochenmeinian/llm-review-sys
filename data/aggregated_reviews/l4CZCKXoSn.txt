Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents FOCAL, a self-supervised contrastive learning framework designed for extracting comprehensive features from multimodal time-series sensing signals. The authors propose a novel approach that decouples each modality into shared and private subspaces, utilizing a simple soft orthogonal loss as an objective. Additionally, a Temporal Structural Constraint is introduced to effectively address the locality of temporal information in contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on four multimodal datasets demonstrate the framework's effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with clear logic and motivation.
- Extensive experiments are conducted on four benchmarks: MOD, ACIDS, RealWorld-HAR, and PAMAP, showcasing promising results.
- The motivation for the proposed contrastive objectives is sound, particularly the consideration of modality-private features and the temporal structural constraint.
- The ablation study provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of the proposed objectives.

Weaknesses:
- The intuition behind the hyperparameter settings in Eq. 5 is unclear, and sensitivity analysis appears to be lacking.
- The simplicity of the orthogonal constraint raises concerns about its effectiveness in decoupling multimodal features, as information leakage may occur.
- The paper does not explore alternative loss functions for Eq. 4, nor does it mention the margin value.
- Visualization results for the factorized subspaces are absent, making it difficult to assess the effectiveness of the proposed factorization.
- The public datasets lack necessary references, and the paper could benefit from discussing limitations and future directions more comprehensively.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the hyperparameter settings in Eq. 5 and include a sensitivity analysis. Additionally, consider exploring more complex orthogonal constraints to enhance multimodal feature decoupling and provide visualizations of the shared and private subspaces in the experimental section. It would also be beneficial to include references for the public datasets and expand the discussion on limitations and potential future work.
