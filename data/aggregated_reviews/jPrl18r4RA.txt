### Key Points
This paper presents a meta-learning algorithm called Context-aware Meta-learned Loss Scaling (CaMeLS) aimed at improving unsupervised online language model adaptation. The authors propose a method that learns an importance weighting model to reweight the per-token loss of an online data stream. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CaMeLS in retaining knowledge while adapting to new information.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of meta-learning for unsupervised online language model adaptation is innovative and reasonable.
- CaMeLS requires training a smaller proxy model for token weight estimation, showing strong performance in knowledge retention and improvements across various datasets.
- The paper includes careful ablation studies that provide insights into the importance of context-aware weights.

Weaknesses:
- The requirement of a labeled training set raises questions about the unsupervised nature of the adaptation process.
- The paper lacks comparisons with key baselines such as retrieval-augmented and in-context learning methods.
- There is insufficient analysis of the model's generation ability post-adaptation, and writing clarity needs improvement.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the generation of the additional labeled dataset used for training the weighting model. Additionally, the authors should include comparisons of the computational overhead required for CaMeLS versus baseline methods. It would also be beneficial to provide more examples and a summarization of the algorithm, as well as to address the performance degradation observed in unrelated queries. Finally, we suggest including a simple baseline comparison using TF-IDF weighting to further validate the proposed method.
