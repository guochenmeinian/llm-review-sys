Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for semantic segmentation of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) laser scanning (ULS) data, named SOUL, which discriminates leaf from wood points. The approach is based on PointNet++ and incorporates a novel sampling scheme and a rebalanced loss function to address class imbalance. The authors introduce geodesic voxelization decomposition (GVD) as a preprocessing technique to partition ULS data while maintaining point cloud topology. They argue that their application context significantly differs from existing datasets, such as those involving mock-up objects, indoor scenes, and autopilot data, highlighting the challenges of accurately classifying wood and leaf points. Experiments conducted on a dataset from a tropical forest in French Guiana demonstrate that SOUL achieves superior results on several evaluation metrics, including those tailored for unbalanced datasets. The method shows potential for generalization across different forests and LiDAR sensors, supported by comprehensive testing across various analogous datasets, including UAV (ULS), ground-based equipment (TLS), and backpack (MLS) data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The application of semantic segmentation to LiDAR recordings of forests is crucial for understanding and mitigating climate change, with potential high impact on reforestation and carbon stock estimation.
2. SOUL is the first method tailored to the density and imbalance of ULS forest recordings, and GVD is relevant for various LiDAR sensors and forest types.
3. The authors have conducted experiments demonstrating the method's effectiveness, achieving the best results compared to competing methods.
4. The paper is well-written and presents relevant arguments.
5. Comprehensive testing across multiple datasets demonstrates the robustness of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
1. There is insufficient discussion of related works and comparisons with other point cloud architectures, which could enhance performance insights.
2. An ablation study on the proposed geometric features is lacking, leaving questions about their individual impacts.
3. The influence of atmospheric characteristics on LiDAR data is not explored, particularly regarding the use of reflectance as an additional feature.
4. The submission lacks comprehensive experiments, ablation studies, and standard deviations, raising concerns about the significance of the results.
5. The need for a more detailed ablation study using widely-known datasets, such as S3DIS, is noted, although the authors believe this analysis may not be essential for assessing the paper's novelty.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by including comparisons with other point cloud architectures to substantiate their choice of PointNet++. An ablation study should be conducted to assess the impact of each geometric feature and to clarify whether PointNet++ can internally estimate these features. Additionally, we suggest exploring the use of reflectance as a feature in their method to evaluate its effect on performance. The authors should also include more experiments with competing methods and provide standard deviations for their results to enhance the robustness of their findings. Lastly, we recommend conducting a careful ablation study using widely-known datasets, such as S3DIS, to strengthen their claims regarding the novelty and effectiveness of their approach, and it is crucial to clarify the dataset's availability for reproducibility and to ensure that the relationship between the main text and appendices is clearly established.
