### Key Points
This paper presents a thorough analysis of the limitations of LVLMs, particularly their tendency to forget image information and rely on language priors, which amplifies hallucinations. The authors propose the Summary-Guided Decoding (SGD) method, which innovatively targets image-related POS tokens to control and reduce language priors without compromising text quality. Their experiments demonstrate a significant reduction in hallucination rates while achieving Pareto optimal performance on both precision and recall.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper provides a well-researched solution to the limitations of LVLMs through the SGD method, effectively mitigating object hallucinations.  
- The approach achieves superior performance on the CHAIR metric and demonstrates a significant reduction in hallucination rates.

Weaknesses:  
- The evaluation is limited to only two LVLMs (LLAVA and InstructBLIP), which restricts insights into the broader applicability of the method.  
- There is insufficient quantitative analysis on the inference time of SGD compared to other models, particularly for longer sequences.  
- Additional object hallucination metrics, such as POPE, and qualitative results are needed to support the claims.  
- The use of a summary model for POS token generation may result in redundant outputs and omit important details.  
- Further analysis on latency and computational cost is necessary to address practical efficiency concerns.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including additional LVLMs to provide a broader understanding of the SGD method's applicability. We also suggest incorporating quantitative analysis on inference time relative to other models, especially for longer sequences. Additionally, the authors should consider integrating more object hallucination metrics, such as POPE, and providing qualitative results to strengthen their claims. Furthermore, addressing potential redundancy in outputs from the summary model and conducting a thorough analysis of latency and computational costs would enhance the practical implications of their findings.
