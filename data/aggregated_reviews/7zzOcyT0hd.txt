Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the IRL with Sub-Optimal Experts (IRL-SE) problem, which utilizes multiple experts, including sub-optimal ones, to improve reward function learning. The authors provide a theoretical analysis of the feasible reward set and establish a lower bound on the sample complexity within the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) framework. They propose a uniform sampling algorithm that achieves minimax optimality under certain conditions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The authors provide novel insights into a broader context than previous work, supported by detailed theoretical analysis.  
- The paper is technically sound, complete, and evaluates its strengths while suggesting future research avenues.  
- The writing is generally clear, and the examples effectively illustrate the role of sub-optimal experts.  

Weaknesses:  
- The submission could benefit from clearer writing, particularly by expanding results rather than stating them concisely.  
- There is a lack of empirical evidence to validate the role of sub-optimal experts in resolving reward ambiguity.  
- The paper assumes access to a generative model of experts' policies, which complicates practical implementation.  
- It does not discuss the limitations of the work or potential negative societal impacts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by expanding on results and removing phrases like "it's easy to see." Additionally, providing a case study or toy example would enhance readability and demonstrate practical applications of the theoretical concepts. The authors should also address how to determine a suitable performance gap $\zeta$ for sub-optimal experts and provide experimental validation of their claims. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to discuss the practical limitations of their results and reduce the repetitive use of the word "Indeed." Lastly, clarifying the reasoning behind the infinite norm's range in line 109 and addressing the claims in Examples 3.1-3.3 with references or proofs would strengthen the paper.
