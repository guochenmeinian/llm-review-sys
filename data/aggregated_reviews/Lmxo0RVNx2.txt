Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a robust SDE algorithm for medical forecasting, specifically a piece-wise linear neural SDE with control for biomedical applications. The key contribution lies in combining rigorous linear SDE solutions with hypernet parameterization. The authors propose a novel network approach, Neural Eigen Stochastic Differential Equations (NESDE), aimed at solving sequential prediction problems in medical dosing control. The method is validated through experiments on both synthetic and real data, demonstrating superior performance compared to reasonable alternatives.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem addressed is compelling, with evaluations across a wide range of datasets showing superior performance.
- The paper is well-written and clear, with a comprehensive theoretical analysis and detailed empirical validation.
- The method effectively models control, enhancing interpretability and applicability in medical dosing scenarios.
- The parameterization strategy allows for efficient computation and integration of prior knowledge.

Weaknesses:
- Some model components, such as hypernets, are only briefly described, making the paper harder to understand.
- The method appears somewhat incremental, combining existing techniques without significant novelty.
- The paper lacks broader impact statements and could benefit from more baseline comparisons, particularly with Neural SDE models.
- The piece-wise linear assumption on the observation sequence limits the dynamics that can be modeled.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the model by providing explicit definitions for components like hypernets. Additionally, a discussion comparing the general applicability of NODEs versus NESDEs would strengthen the contribution. We suggest including more baseline comparisons, particularly with Neural SDE models, to enhance the experimental validation. Finally, a discussion on the limitations of the piece-wise linear assumption and its implications for modeling dynamics would be beneficial.
