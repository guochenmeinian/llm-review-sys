Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents characteristic circuits (CCs), a novel family of tractable probabilistic models that utilize univariate characteristic functions as leaves in probabilistic circuits (PCs) to model heterogeneous data distributions. The authors demonstrate that CCs can efficiently compute joint and marginal probabilistic queries and can represent distributions lacking closed-form probability density functions, such as $\alpha$-stable distributions. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets indicate strong performance in density estimation tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, providing sufficient background for understanding the proposed model.
- CCs maintain efficient marginal computations similar to PCs and allow for a unified view of mixed continuous and discrete distributions.
- The use of characteristic functions introduces a novel approach to probabilistic modeling, particularly for distributions without closed-form expressions.

Weaknesses:
- The distinction between CCs and PCs is unclear, particularly regarding their comparative advantages and specific use cases.
- There is a lack of investigation into expressiveness and tractable operations, such as identifying distributions representable by CCs but not by PCs.
- The absence of a proof for the validity of marginal computations and discussions on sampling from CCs raises concerns about the model's reliability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the differences between CCs and PCs, specifically addressing when one might be preferred over the other. Additionally, we suggest including investigations on expressiveness and tractable queries to strengthen the paper's contributions. A proof for the validity of marginal computations should be provided, and discussions on the feasibility of sampling from CCs would enhance the paper's robustness. Lastly, simplifying the background section and reducing the use of acronyms could make the paper more accessible to non-expert readers.
