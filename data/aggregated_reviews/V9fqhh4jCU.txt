### Key Points
This paper presents **Helios**, a continuous in-network malicious traffic detection framework aimed at overcoming the limitations of traditional Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) in classifying known and unknown attacks. The authors propose a Supervised Mixture Prototypical Learning (SMPL) method combined with clustering initialization, demonstrating superior performance in classification accuracy, F1 score, and unknown attack detection rate across three datasets (CICIDS2018, TON-IoT, and UNSW-NB15). Helios also shows efficiency in hardware resource utilization and reconfiguration time.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces an innovative SMPL method that enhances model performance through clustering initialization.
- Experimental results indicate that Helios excels in both known class classification and unknown attack detection.
- The methodology is well-structured and clearly explained, utilizing real-world datasets for evaluation.

Weaknesses:
- Some sections require more detailed explanations, particularly regarding the SMPL method and the incremental update mechanism.
- While the combination of techniques is novel, the individual components are well-established in the literature.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the technical aspects of the SMPL method and the incremental update mechanism. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on the potential challenges and solutions for integrating Helios with existing network infrastructure and discuss how the system ensures the security and integrity of the incremental updates.
