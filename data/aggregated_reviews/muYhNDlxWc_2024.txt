Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for trajectory prediction called Mixed Gaussian Flow (MGF), which utilizes a mixture of Gaussian distributions to enhance diversity and controllability in predictions. The authors argue that traditional Gaussian priors are inadequate due to the complex, multi-modal nature of human trajectories. They introduce new metrics, Average Pairwise Distance (APD) and Future Pairwise Distance (FPD), to evaluate trajectory diversity. The authors also introduce a mixed Gaussian prior to improve generation diversity while maintaining accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that MGF outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on datasets like ETH/UCY and SDD. The authors provide detailed ablation studies that clarify the roles of various components in their method, showing that prediction clustering does not significantly contribute to diversity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for using a mixture of Gaussian distributions is compelling, enhancing the model's ability to capture diverse trajectory patterns.
- MGF demonstrates solid experimental results, indicating its effectiveness in trajectory prediction.
- The introduction of the mixed Gaussian prior is a significant contribution that improves both diversity and accuracy.
- The paper provides a clear analysis of diversity and controllability in model outputs, along with detailed ablation studies.

Weaknesses:
- The assumption that all trajectories can be modeled with a mixture Gaussian distribution is flawed, as it neglects the influence of interactions with other agents and environmental factors.
- The proposed diversity metrics (APD and FPD) do not adequately assess the reasonableness of generated trajectories, focusing solely on their differences.
- The paper does not adequately address the integration of environmental and social constraints, which are important for trajectory prediction.
- The qualitative results provided may not sufficiently illustrate the differences in performance across methods.
- The paper overlooks significant recent works in trajectory prediction, which could provide a more robust comparison to the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical foundation of their method, particularly regarding the mixture Gaussian assumption and its applicability to different scenes. Additionally, the authors should refine the diversity metrics to ensure they account for the realism of generated trajectories. It would be beneficial to include a more comprehensive comparison with recent literature using the same training/testing data. Furthermore, we suggest enhancing the discussion on how to incorporate environmental and social factors into their current method, as this remains an important future research direction. Please ensure that the APD issue is addressed in the final paper, and consider including more quantitative visualizations to assist in understanding the ablation study results. Lastly, enhancing the clarity of notations and equations, particularly regarding scene map modeling, would improve readability. Conducting qualitative analyses to illustrate the model's behavior under varying conditions, such as different speeds or environmental contexts, would also help better contextualize the diversity claims.
