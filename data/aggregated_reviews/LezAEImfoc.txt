Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to visual object tracking inspired by the Central-Peripheral Dichotomy (CPD) theory. The authors propose a tracker named CPDTrack and introduce the STDChallenge Benchmark, which focuses on spatio-temporal discontinuities. They claim that CPDTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on the STDChallenge, aligns with human behavior, and generalizes across various benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors effectively highlight the significance of aligning visual tracking in humans and machines, supported by a human study.
- They provide a comprehensive review of related works, emphasizing the distinction between LTT and GIT, and attempt a Visual Turing Test.
- The results on the STDChallenge demonstrate performance gains compared to other networks, albeit modest.

Weaknesses:
- The absence of Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval raises ethical concerns regarding research involving human subjects.
- There is a lack of strong statistical testing for human versus machine responses, and methods for handling out-of-distribution responses are unclear.
- The connection between human experiments and the STDChallenge benchmark is not well established.
- Justifications for the baseline in ablation studies and the selection criteria for challenges in the STDChallenge benchmark are insufficient.
- The tracking speed on an A5000 GPU raises questions about computational demands, and the clarity of figures and model descriptions could be improved.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the ethical considerations by obtaining IRB approval for their study involving human subjects and addressing privacy concerns related to tracking mouse movements. Additionally, please clarify the statistical significance of performance gains on the STDChallenge benchmark and provide justifications for the baseline in ablation studies. It would be beneficial to elaborate on how the proposed dataset differs from the VideoCube dataset and to include references to relevant prior works. Finally, ensure that the code and public datasets used for the experiments are made available for reproducibility.
