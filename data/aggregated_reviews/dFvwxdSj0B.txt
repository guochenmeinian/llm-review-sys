### Key Points
This paper presents a retrieval-augmented semantic parsing approach using LLM, specifically through an iterative retrieval method that incorporates uncertainty estimation via the Graph Autoregressive Process (GAP) and evaluates performance using the SMATCH metric. The authors propose the SUGAR method, which leverages structural similarity and model uncertainty to enhance retrieval-augmented parsing for complex graph problems. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated both quantitatively and qualitatively across real-world benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The research idea is interesting, combining structural similarity and model uncertainty.  
- The paper is well-structured and detailed, presenting the iterative retrieval approach's effectiveness.  
- The proposed methods are suitable for semantic parsing, which has distinct properties compared to general retrieval methods.  

Weaknesses:  
- The superiority of GAP over traditional confidence estimation is not demonstrated; an ablation study is needed.  
- The novelty of using uncertainty in retrieval decisions is questionable, as similar concepts exist in prior work like FLARE.  
- The evaluation lacks rigor across various tasks, and computational complexity needs reduction.  
- Clarity around the assumptions regarding data distribution and the implications of LLM choice on performance is lacking.  
- Some experimental choices require better explanation and motivation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including an ablation study to demonstrate whether GAP significantly outperforms traditional confidence estimation methods. Additionally, providing a detailed description of Figure 3 and clarifying the retrieval process, particularly the relationship between yc and v, would enhance understanding. The authors should also consider evaluating their approach across a broader range of tasks and addressing computational complexity concerns. Finally, clearer assumptions regarding data distribution and the implications of using different LLM architectures should be articulated.
