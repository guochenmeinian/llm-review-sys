### Key Points
This paper presents LLMCloudHunter, an end-to-end framework that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to analyze Open-Source Cyber Threat Intelligence (OSCTI) by processing both textual and visual data. The framework generates actionable detection rules in Sigma format, enhancing threat detection capabilities. The authors evaluated LLMCloudHunter using a limited dataset of 20 annotated cloud threat reports, which raises concerns regarding the robustness of the evaluation and the originality of the approach, primarily relying on prompt design and LLM invocation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The framework innovatively integrates image processing into OSCTI analysis, addressing significant limitations in scalability and automation.
2. LLMCloudHunter demonstrates high efficiency and scalability through parallel processing and few-shot learning techniques, making it suitable for large datasets.
3. The paper is well-written and clearly presents the framework's components and processes, showcasing its practical application in threat detection.

Weaknesses:
1. The evaluation is based on a very limited dataset, raising questions about the robustness and representativeness of the results.
2. There is a lack of comparison with existing systems, making it difficult to assess the improvement over prior work.
3. The framework's reliance on image processing may limit its effectiveness in scenarios where valid image information is unavailable.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors expand the evaluation dataset to include a broader and more diverse set of OSCTI samples to enhance the robustness of the findings.
2. We suggest that the authors include comparisons with existing OSCTI extraction systems to better demonstrate the advantages of LLMCloudHunter.
3. We encourage the authors to explore the adaptability of LLMCloudHunter for non-cloud environments and other signature-based systems beyond Sigma to increase its versatility and impact.
4. We recommend providing a detailed analysis of the computational costs associated with LLM usage and potential optimizations for real-time applications.
