### Key Points
This paper studies online control with adversarial perturbations, bandit feedback, and adversarial strongly-convex smooth cost functions, achieving $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret through occasional and Newton-based updates. It demonstrates that this optimal regret can be attained even with adversarial noise and bandit feedback, breaking previous assumptions that limited such results to specific conditions. The authors propose an algorithm that improves upon the known $\mathcal{O}(T^{2/3})$ regret from prior work.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper generalizes previous settings and achieves optimal regret.  
2. It is well-written, with clear explanations of the algorithm's intuition.  
3. The analysis appears rigorous and mathematically sound, particularly regarding the delayed mechanism to de-correlate recent iterates.

Weaknesses:  
1. The technical contribution is perceived as weak, with the analysis of Algorithm 1 closely following the proof sketch of prior works.  
2. The specific contribution relative to Suggala et al. [2024] is unclear, with the delay mechanism being the main algorithmic advancement.  
3. The citation for optimal rates for bandit non-stochastic control is incorrect.  
4. The meaning of "preserves an estimation of Hessian $H_t$ for free" is ambiguous and may require clarification regarding its generality in the LTI control context.  
5. Minor typographical errors were noted.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the specific contributions of their work compared to Suggala et al. [2024] and provide a more thorough discussion on the challenges of designing a single algorithm that achieves theoretical guarantees across various scenarios. Additionally, please correct the citation error and clarify the meaning of "preserves an estimation of Hessian $H_t$ for free." Addressing the typographical errors would also enhance the overall quality of the paper.
