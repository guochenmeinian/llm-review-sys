Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Meta Privacy-Preserving Action Recognition (MPPAR) framework that leverages meta-learning to enhance generalization capabilities concerning novel privacy attributes and attack models. The authors simulate train/test shifts by creating disjoint support/query sets related to privacy attributes and attack models. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed framework compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, organized, and technically sound, with sufficient experiments demonstrating the proposed model's effectiveness.
- The meta-learning approach introduces a novel perspective to privacy-preserving action recognition (PPAR) and provides a practical defense against potential attacks.
- The evaluation is comprehensive, investigating multiple settings and yielding promising results.

Weaknesses:
- The detailed mathematical descriptions in the approach section obscure the main ideas, making it challenging to grasp the module design's intent.
- A notation section for mathematical symbols is recommended to enhance clarity for readers.
- The paper lacks sufficient figures to illustrate model details and experimental results, relying heavily on text and equations.
- Excessive text explanations detract from clarity; the organization could be improved, and English expression requires refinement.
- There are minor typos and grammatical errors present.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the mathematical descriptions by focusing on the main ideas behind the module designs. Including a notation section for mathematical symbols would aid reader comprehension. Additionally, the authors should incorporate more figures to visually represent model and experimental details. Reducing the amount of auxiliary text and enhancing the overall organization will improve clarity. Lastly, addressing the minor typos and grammatical issues will strengthen the presentation of the paper.
