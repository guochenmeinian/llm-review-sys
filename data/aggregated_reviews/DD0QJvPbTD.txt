Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents PARAFUZZ, a novel framework for detecting poisoned samples in NLP models at test time. The authors argue that backdoor triggers do not fundamentally alter the semantic meaning of poisoned samples, allowing for effective paraphrasing using ChatGPT. The method relies on prompt engineering to achieve this, and experimental results indicate that PARAFUZZ outperforms existing solutions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a timely and significant issue in backdoor detection within NLP.
- The innovative use of fuzzing techniques for prompt generation is a novel contribution.
- Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to baseline methods.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on ChatGPT limits the method's applicability to users without access to this model.
- The experimental methodology lacks rigor, with insufficient exploration of adaptive attacks and limited ablation studies to validate the framework's components.
- The writing quality and overall presentation require improvement, with some unprofessional expressions noted.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental methodology by conducting more comprehensive ablation studies to evaluate the effectiveness of each component, particularly the trigger reversion process and mutation strategies. Additionally, the authors should clarify the relationship between 'sentence coverage' and 'detection score' and provide a more detailed discussion on the implications of adaptive attacks. It would also be beneficial to explore alternative language models that can be controlled by users and to report the time cost associated with the fuzzing process. Finally, enhancing the overall writing quality, especially in the abstract and introduction, and including relevant citations on backdoor learning in NLP would strengthen the paper.
