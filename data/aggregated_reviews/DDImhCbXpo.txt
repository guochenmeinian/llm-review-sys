### Key Points
This paper presents a novel deep learning framework, CycleTrans, designed to improve drug recommendation systems by predicting specific medications based on patient diagnoses. The model integrates a cycle-embedding module and employs cross-attention and transformers to utilize longitudinal patient data, achieving high clinical precision and a low drug-drug interaction (DDI) rate. The authors claim that their approach outperforms previous models significantly in terms of Precision, DDI rate, and the average number of drugs prescribed.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-organized and enjoyable to read.
2. The idea appears novel, and the methods are thoroughly explained.
3. Experimental results are promising, demonstrating impressive gains over baselines.
4. The incorporation of a cycle-embedding module and the use of advanced architectures indicate a comprehensive approach to medication recommendation.

Weaknesses:
1. The potential harm of drug-drug interactions and the expected benefits of drug recommendation systems are not discussed, lacking statistical context.
2. The paper does not clarify its novel contributions compared to prior work, particularly regarding longitudinal drug recommendation methods.
3. Results lack confidence intervals, which are essential for conveying the significance of findings.
4. The diagram contains confusing duplicate inputs and labels, which could be simplified for clarity.
5. The DDI rate is not explained concretely, and the definition of the DDI adjacent matrix is unclear.
6. The study acknowledges the need for additional data and does not address potential biases or limitations in model predictions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the potential harm of drug-drug interactions and the benefits of their system by including relevant statistics. The authors should clarify their novel contributions, particularly regarding the use of cross-attention, transformer architectures, and the new loss function. We suggest including confidence intervals in the results to enhance their significance. The authors should rework the diagram to eliminate duplicate inputs and clarify the color coding of inputs. Additionally, we recommend providing a detailed explanation of how the DDI rate is measured and defining the DDI adjacent matrix clearly. Finally, addressing the need for additional data and discussing potential biases in the model's predictions would strengthen the paper's practical significance.
