Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a large-scale game and language dataset for chess and introduces two models, ChessCLIP and ChessGPT, designed to integrate policy learning and language modeling. The dataset comprises millions of chess games and related natural language data, enabling the models to tackle various chess-related tasks. The authors evaluate the models on their ability to track game states, assess value judgments, and make decisions, demonstrating that ChessGPT significantly outperforms baseline models like LLAMA. The authors also acknowledge the importance of analyzing data quality and conducting human error analysis to enhance understanding of their findings. They recognize the sensitivity of models to instruction formats and emphasize their focus on the relationship between language insights and game data rather than purely chess performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
1. The task of teaching language models to reason about chess is notably challenging and significant for the research community.
2. The dataset's large size and diverse sources enhance its utility for exploring planning and long-term state tracking in language models.
3. ChessGPT's performance surpasses that of baseline models, indicating the effectiveness of the collected datasets.
4. The introduction of a new evaluation benchmark facilitates standardized comparisons in future research.
5. The incorporation of new figures and examples improves clarity, and the addition of human error analysis and data quality metrics in the appendices strengthens the paper.

**Weaknesses:**
1. The paper lacks sufficient visuals and examples to illustrate tasks, which may hinder understanding for readers unfamiliar with chess.
2. The models do not currently learn from their gameplay experiences, limiting their ability to adapt and improve over time.
3. There is a lack of direct comparisons with state-of-the-art chess models, making it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation by incorporating more visuals and examples to clarify the evaluation tasks for readers less familiar with chess. Additionally, including a comparison of ChessGPT and ChessCLIP to state-of-the-art chess models in the appendix would provide context for their effectiveness. We suggest exploring the most valuable information sources in their dataset for performance evaluation and revisiting some phrasings for clarity. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of data quality, including vocabulary and sentence similarity, should be conducted to identify potential negative interferences across datasets. We also encourage the authors to experiment with different instruction/prompt formats post-collection of instruction-tuning data from GPT-4, as model sensitivity to these formats can significantly impact performance. Lastly, the authors should address inconsistencies in model parameter descriptions and clarify the specific databases used for data collection.
