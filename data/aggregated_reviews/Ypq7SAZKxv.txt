### Key Points
This paper presents a novel multi-objective classification model aimed at detecting subtle forms of conflict, such as teasing and sarcasm, alongside more overt hostility. The authors propose a methodology that utilizes class-based reward functions to enhance model performance, validated through experiments on three datasets. The problem is clearly articulated, and the experimental design is robust, incorporating various baselines for comparison.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The problem is well-defined, and the methodology is clearly described.  
- The experimental evaluation is thorough, showcasing results from multiple datasets and perspectives.  
- The inclusion of a novel multi-class conflict dataset is a significant contribution.  

Weaknesses:  
- The improvements in results are marginal and statistically significant only at Î± = 0.1, raising questions about the robustness of the findings.  
- The related work section is brief and could benefit from additional discussion.  
- Several clarity issues and typos are present, which hinder readability.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section by incorporating more relevant literature, particularly related to RQ4. Additionally, please clarify the type of similarity reported in Figure 2 and ensure that all figures and tables are properly referenced in the text. It would be beneficial to provide the code and dataset via an open science platform to enhance reproducibility. We also suggest that the authors justify the normalization and scaling of cosine similarities in the reward function section more thoroughly. Finally, addressing minor clarity issues, such as defining \( e_i \) in Equation 5 and correcting typos, will improve the overall quality of the paper.
