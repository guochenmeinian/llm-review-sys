Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to mitigating backdoor attacks in heterogeneous federated learning systems through the Fisher Discrepancy Cluster and Rescale (FDCR) method. The authors leverage Fisher Information to assess parameter importance and identify malicious clients by reweighting client updates based on significant discrepancies. The empirical results demonstrate the method's robustness and effectiveness across various datasets and scenarios, addressing limitations of existing backdoor defenses that rely on homogeneous data or validation datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The FDCR method introduces an innovative methodology by utilizing Fisher Information, significantly contributing to backdoor defense in heterogeneous federated learning.
- The dual approach of client selection and parameter aggregation enhances the method's effectiveness against backdoor attacks.
- Extensive empirical validation across multiple datasets showcases the method's robustness and practical applicability.

Weaknesses:
- The long-term stability of the FDCR method over multiple communication rounds is not fully evaluated.
- The computation cost of the Fisher information matrix is unclear, and more details about data heterogeneity could be provided.
- The selected clustering method (Finch) is not thoroughly introduced, which may confuse readers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the clustering method by providing a detailed description of how to use Finch in their approach. Additionally, the authors should evaluate the long-term stability of the FDCR method over multiple communication rounds and clarify the computation cost associated with the Fisher information matrix. More analysis on the experimental results would also strengthen the conclusions drawn in the paper.
