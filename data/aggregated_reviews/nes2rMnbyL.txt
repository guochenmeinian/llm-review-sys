### Key Points
This paper presents AdaSociety, a multi-agent environment that supports dynamic physical environments and social structures, serving as a simulator for multi-agent decision-making in general-sum games. The authors propose three customizable mini-games to showcase the environment's capabilities and test various reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, including a large language model (LLM)-based approach and a custom curriculum learning method. The findings highlight the limitations of state-of-the-art RL algorithms in dynamic social contexts and suggest the potential of LLMs in these settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- AdaSociety offers a highly customizable environment with dynamic physical and social structures, facilitating research in multi-agent decision-making.
- The environment's design allows for diverse scenarios involving collaboration, competition, and negotiation.
- The paper is well-written, providing clear experimental results and insights into the performance of different algorithms.

Weaknesses:
- The ease of customization for users is unclear, lacking a high-level model or API description.
- The claim of adaptive environment design is misleading, as it does not involve unsupervised environment adaptation.
- The Broader Impacts section requires significant expansion to address potential risks associated with trained agents.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how users can customize AdaSociety, including providing a detailed API and examples of environment definitions. Additionally, the authors should clarify the distinction between community-level and group-level social structures and the rationale for the chosen complexity levels in the experiments. Expanding the complexity levels in the mini-games would better demonstrate the scalability of challenges. Furthermore, the authors should enhance the Broader Impacts section to discuss the potential for harmful agent behaviors and the implications of reward misspecification. Lastly, we suggest proofreading the manuscript for minor errors and ensuring that all technical definitions are clearly articulated.
