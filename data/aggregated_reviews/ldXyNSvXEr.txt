Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents methodologies for constructing prediction intervals under distribution shifts in unsupervised domain adaptation, focusing on both covariate shift and domain shift assumptions. The authors propose algorithms that aggregate prediction intervals, supported by theoretical guarantees including finite sample bounds for coverage and width. The methods are illustrated through experiments on multiple datasets, including the airfoil dataset, Real Estate Dataset, Energy Efficiency data, ETDataset, and the Appliances Energy Prediction Dataset, demonstrating advantages over existing methods such as weighted split conformal prediction (WVAC and WQC). The authors emphasize their methodological advancements, particularly in finite sample coverage and width guarantees.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is innovative in aggregating prediction intervals within an unsupervised domain adaptation framework.
- The paper includes sufficient theoretical discussions, demonstrating adequate coverage with small width through finite sample concentration bounds.
- The authors tackle an important problem in uncertainty quantification and show that their method outperforms weighted split conformal prediction on several datasets, including a real-world distribution shift scenario with the Appliances Energy Prediction Dataset.
- The authors provide clear methodological advancements and theoretical guarantees.

Weaknesses:
- There is a lack of intuitive understanding regarding why aggregation can achieve minimal-width prediction intervals.
- The experimental evaluation is limited to a relatively small number of datasets, raising concerns about the generalizability of the method.
- Dimensionality reduction is presented as a necessary step, which may limit the method's utility for larger datasets.
- Coverage drops below 0.95 for the Airfoil data with Algorithm 2, and clarity on the choice between algorithms is lacking.
- Some explanations and definitions are unclear, and the paper assumes familiarity with prior work, making it difficult for new readers to follow.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental evaluation by including more datasets and baseline methods, particularly those with real-world distribution shifts and non-tabular data. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the intuitive understanding of aggregation's effectiveness in achieving minimal-width prediction intervals. The authors should also provide clearer definitions and explanations for key terms and concepts, particularly for readers unfamiliar with Fan et al. (2023). Furthermore, clarifying the conditions under which to use Algorithm 1 versus Algorithm 2 would enhance understanding. Addressing the necessity of dimensionality reduction and its implications for non-image data would strengthen the paper. Finally, including comparisons with previous methods and discussing the limitations of their approach, particularly in high-dimensional settings, would further enhance the robustness of the findings.
