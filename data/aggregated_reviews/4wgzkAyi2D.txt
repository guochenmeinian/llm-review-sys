### Key Points
This paper presents a method to address the Janus Problem in Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)-based text-to-3D methods. The authors propose the LCGen method, which focuses on generating view-consistent outputs by utilizing different priors with varying certainty from multiple perspectives. The method is designed to integrate seamlessly into existing SDS frameworks, and experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in alleviating the Janus Problem.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The work tackles the root causes of the Janus Problem, contributing significantly to the field.
2. The proposed method is simple and effective, requiring no additional data or models, and integrates well with original SDS loss computations.
3. Empirical results validate the method's effectiveness in addressing the Janus Problem.

Weaknesses:
1. The examples used in the experiments are relatively homogeneous, raising questions about the method's performance on more diverse object types.
2. There is insufficient quantitative comparison with previous work, particularly regarding performance metrics and training time against models like DreamControl.
3. The limitations section lacks detailed discussion on failure cases, and the analysis of the method's performance in scenarios involving multiple objects or complex shapes is inadequate.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the diversity of examples used in the experiments to include a wider range of object types. Additionally, we suggest providing a quantitative performance comparison with previous methods addressing the Janus Problem, including metrics such as CS and Janus Rate. A detailed analysis of failure cases should be included to clarify the limitations of the proposed method. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the dataset selection process for reproducibility and validation purposes.
