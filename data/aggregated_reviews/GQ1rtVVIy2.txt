### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of Early Maladaptive Schema (EMS) identification in mental health texts from community question-answering forums. The authors propose novel approaches, including Large Language Models (LLMs) and non-LLM methods, and introduce the first expert-curated dataset for this task. The paper evaluates various techniques for predicting EMS labels and discusses their potential and limitations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant application of NLP in mental health, contributing a valuable dataset for EMS identification.
- It introduces interesting methodologies for predicting EMS labels through sentence similarity and textual entailment.

Weaknesses:
- The overall novelty is limited, as some proposed methods, like the Similarity-based Voting Predictor (SVP), already exist. The EMS prediction task bears similarities to existing depressive symptom detection tasks.
- The methodology lacks clarity, particularly in the descriptions of the SVP and Entailment-based Prediction Model (EPM), which require more detailed explanations.
- The dataset presentation is unclear, lacking specific examples and a discussion on dataset de-identification. The inter-annotator agreement is low, with insufficient discussion on adjudication strategies.
- The paper does not include sufficient experiments, such as ablation studies for non-LLM models, and lacks a thorough evaluation of model performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology section by providing detailed explanations of the SVP and EPM, including the specific similarity scores computed and how entailment is determined. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the dataset presentation with examples and discussing dataset de-identification. The authors should consider conducting further experiments, including ablation studies on non-LLM models, and addressing the low inter-annotator agreement by discussing the adjudication strategy. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore the implementation of few-shot learning and contrastive learning, and to consider making the dataset publicly available to benefit the research community.
