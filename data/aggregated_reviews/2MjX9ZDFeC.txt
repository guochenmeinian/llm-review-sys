Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a neural-network-based approach for link prediction in multilayer networks, termed ML-Link. The authors combine GNN-based node embeddings, intra-layer node similarity, and overlapping inter-layer node neighborhoods through an attention mechanism. Their method demonstrates superior performance against baseline methods, achieving high AUC and AP values around 99% on average across various datasets. The authors also analyze learned attention weights, revealing that different layers receive distinct attention. The method's robustness is indicated by its insensitivity to hyperparameter settings. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and clearly articulates the problem definition.
- ML-Link is novel, being the first to augment multilayer GNNs with node-pair features derived from both within-layer and across-layer structural information.
- Comprehensive experimental verification across diverse datasets and performance metrics.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the approach is questioned, as similar Across-Layer feature propagation methods exist in GNN literature; a deeper comparison with related methods is needed.
- The experimental evaluation may be too simplistic, as indicated by the exceptionally high accuracy values, raising concerns about the datasets' difficulty.
- The model diagram lacks clarity, and the heavy use of acronyms can hinder reader comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the model diagram and reduce the reliance on acronyms to enhance readability. Additionally, we suggest that the authors conduct a more thorough comparison with recent studies on multiplex networks to address concerns regarding novelty. To strengthen the experimental evaluation, consider creating more challenging settings, such as altering the negative sampling procedure. Finally, the authors should clarify the interpretation of their high accuracy results and discuss potential limitations and areas for future improvement in the conclusion.
