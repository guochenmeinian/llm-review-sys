Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ALOHA, a novel multimodal model designed to predict human saliency, scanpath, and subjective ratings across various visual content types, including natural images, webpages, and graphic designs. The authors propose a transformer-based architecture that integrates multiple predictors for these tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness through extensive empirical experiments. The model aims to unify human visual behavior modeling by addressing both early-stage perceptual responses and later-stage decision-making. Additionally, the authors assert that this unified model can enhance user experience by aligning visual content with human perception and preferences, support individuals with blindness or low vision through improved accessibility, and optimize visual content quality by incorporating diverse human feedback. They also acknowledge potential societal risks associated with misuse, bias, and over-reliance on the model.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The unified approach to model human visual behavior is innovative and holds significant potential.
2. The proposed model offers substantial societal benefits, including improved user experience and accessibility for individuals with visual impairments.
3. The paper is well-organized and easy to understand, with extensive experiments validating the model's effectiveness.
4. The authors demonstrate a commitment to addressing societal impacts and biases by planning to expand discussions on these topics in the paper.

Weaknesses:
1. The experimental results raise concerns regarding the selection of evaluation metrics, particularly the omission of standard metrics like sAUC and SIM in Table 3, which undermines the claims of model superiority.
2. The paper lacks a thorough discussion of the model's limitations, particularly in real-world applications and ethical considerations surrounding its use.
3. Technical details regarding the choice of predictors and the fine-tuning process are unclear, leading to questions about the model's architecture and training methodology.
4. The potential negative societal impacts, such as the risk of bias and misuse, are concerning and require careful consideration.
5. The authors need to ensure that human oversight is maintained to prevent issues like reward hacking.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their experimental results by including a complete set of evaluation metrics in Table 3, as is standard in saliency prediction. Additionally, we suggest consolidating the information in Tables 3 and 6 to avoid redundancy. The authors should also provide a more comprehensive discussion of the model's limitations, particularly regarding its adaptability to dynamic environments and potential biases in predictions. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the selection process for the three predictors and the fine-tuning strategy employed across datasets. We recommend that the authors enhance the discussion on societal impact by incorporating strategies to mitigate potential negative effects, including model bias and misuse. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a clearer framework for ensuring human oversight in the application of their model, as well as guidelines to prevent unauthorized access. Lastly, addressing ethical considerations and the implications of using ALOHA in real-world scenarios would strengthen the paper significantly.
