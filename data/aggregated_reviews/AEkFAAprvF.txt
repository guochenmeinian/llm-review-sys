### Key Points
This paper presents ViStruct, a training framework for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) aimed at learning visual structural knowledge through a curriculum learning approach. The authors propose a visual structural knowledge pyramid and introduce the ViStruct Suite, which includes multi-level structural knowledge aligned with this pyramid. The framework encodes visual information into a programming language, enhancing the model's ability to understand visual relations and potentially leveraging pre-trained code-based large language models (LLMs) for improved performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The idea of representing visual knowledge as code is novel and offers a structured approach to visual information.
- The curriculum learning framework is intuitively designed to progress from basic concepts to complex events.
- The ViStruct Suite could serve as a valuable resource for future studies in visual structure extraction.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks an in-depth ablation study, particularly regarding the curriculum order and replay buffer design.
- Only one backbone (OFA-base) is evaluated, raising concerns about the generalizability of the proposed method.
- The comparison with previous works is insufficient, with outdated methods included in the evaluation.
- There is a lack of clarity on the inference stage and implementation details, making reproducibility challenging.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the depth of the ablation study by including experiments on the diverse order of curriculum and the design of the replay buffer. Additionally, we suggest evaluating multiple pre-trained VLM backbones to demonstrate the method's generalizability. The authors should also enhance the comparison with more recent baselines in Tables 3 and 4 and provide clearer implementation details in the main text regarding the inference process. Finally, a more detailed analysis of the ViStruct Suite and the curriculum learning design would strengthen the paper's contributions.
