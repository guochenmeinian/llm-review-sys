Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for leveraging large foundational models in resource-scarce settings to enhance image classification tasks. The authors propose saving features from a frozen foundational model and using them to train a smaller classifier, incorporating tensor augmentations to improve robustness. They demonstrate significant reductions in GPU memory usage and training speed, achieving performance comparable to full fine-tuning of the foundational model with a linear layer across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work is crucial for low-resource settings, utilizing a superior foundational model to enhance classification accuracy.
- Results indicate improvements over baseline methods and simple fine-tuning.
- The architecture is simple yet effective, with strong experimental validation across multiple benchmarks.
- The paper is well-written and presents its ideas clearly.

Weaknesses:
- There are concerns regarding inference throughput, as the proposed method shows a considerable reduction compared to the original model, which may be problematic for real-time applications.
- The effectiveness of tensor augmentations is heavily dependent on the features extracted from specific layers of the foundational model, yet the paper lacks clarity on which layers were used and does not provide ablation studies on this choice.
- The adaptation of spatial augmentations may distort topological features in high-resolution medical images, raising questions about the generalizability of the approach to 3D volumes.
- The tensor augmentation methods are somewhat limited, and the authors should consider expanding these to include more diverse augmentation techniques.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding the specific layers from which features are extracted and provide ablation studies to support their choices. Additionally, addressing the concerns about inference throughput and providing insights on how the proposed method can be adapted for high-dimensional medical images would strengthen the paper. It would also be beneficial to explore and discuss a wider range of augmentation techniques beyond the current spatial augmentations to enhance the robustness of the model.
