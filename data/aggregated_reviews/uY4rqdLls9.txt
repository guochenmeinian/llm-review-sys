Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a "dual" control variate aimed at reducing gradient variance in black-box variational inference by addressing both Monte Carlo noise and data subsampling noise simultaneously. The authors propose leveraging linear or quadratic ELBO approximations alongside a running average of gradient estimates for each data point. Experiments indicate that this method significantly reduces gradient variance, particularly from data subsampling, leading to improved ELBO optimization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The submission tackles a broadly relevant issue in the NeurIPS community regarding black-box variational inference.
- It focuses on optimization, a component often overlooked in the literature.
- The experiments convincingly demonstrate the method's efficacy.
- The proposed method is technically sound and relatively simple to implement.
- The discussions in Section 5 and variance analysis in Appendix B provide valuable context.

Weaknesses:
- Some notation is confusing, particularly the choice of M for the running gradient, which could be improved for clarity.
- Limitations of the method and potential extensions to broader problem settings are insufficiently discussed.
- The experimental evaluation lacks larger models and could benefit from clearer comparisons.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of notation, particularly by replacing M with a term like G(bold $w$) to avoid confusion. Additionally, we suggest that the authors discuss the limitations regarding memory requirements, which are O(Nd), more explicitly. Expanding on the potential for local latent variables, model learning, and amortization would enhance the paper's depth. We also encourage the inclusion of ablation studies comparing first-order and second-order Taylor approximations to assess their practical importance. Finally, addressing the organization of sections and improving the clarity of figures and tables would significantly enhance the paper's presentation.
