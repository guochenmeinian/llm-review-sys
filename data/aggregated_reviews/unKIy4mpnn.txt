Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel normalization technique specifically designed for sign language processing, improving the quality of the z dimension (depth) and capturing movement through a normalized baseline. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on a small Japanese Sign Language (JSL) dataset and the WLASL dataset, reporting significant performance improvements. Additionally, the paper includes an analysis of sociolinguistic features in movement patterns of JSL.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The normalization methods are carefully adjusted and provide valuable details.
- The work addresses a critical issue in sign language processing.
- The paper reports significant performance improvements and offers a detailed analysis of JSL.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on a single "standard" body measurement raises ethical concerns and may lead to poorer accuracy for diverse body types.
- The robustness of the normalization approach for varied physical conditions is unclear due to limited dataset diversity.
- Several experimental details, particularly regarding joint normalization and scaling/rotation processes, are inadequately described.
- Figures do not effectively illustrate the normalization operations, and some results are based solely on the WLASL-100 set, lacking broader context.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the normalization process by providing detailed descriptions of scaling and rotation methods. Additionally, consider addressing the ethical implications of using a single standard body measurement for normalization, potentially moving towards a more inclusive approach. Testing the normalization technique on a larger and more diverse dataset would enhance the robustness of the findings. Furthermore, we suggest expanding the analysis beyond JSL to validate claims across multiple sign languages, thereby strengthening the generalizability of the results.
