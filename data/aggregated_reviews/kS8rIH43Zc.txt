Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for active causal discovery (ACD) utilizing multi-fidelity oracles, allowing for experiments with varying costs and accuracies. The authors propose a Bayesian framework that includes a mutual information-based acquisition function and a cascading fidelity model. This novel contribution captures oracle correlations and extends traditional theories, optimizing the selection of experiments based on a triple of (variable, value, fidelity) and extending to multi-target interventions. The authors acknowledge the limitations of simulation-based studies in representing real-world settings but justify their approach due to the scarcity of publicly available datasets. They conducted multiple experiments with different oracle settings, utilizing Gaussian noise to simulate low-fidelity oracles and comparing results from two neural networks with varying fidelity levels. Empirical validation demonstrates the potential advantages of the proposed approach over existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a significant and practical problem in ACD with multi-fidelity oracles, enhancing realism compared to single-fidelity settings.
2. The proposed Bayesian framework offers a novel solution, integrating a mutual information-based acquisition function and a cascading fidelity model.
3. The extension to multi-target interventions and the introduction of a constraint-based fidelity model further enhance the model's applicability.
4. The authors provide extensive experimental results, including additional settings that enhance the robustness of their findings.
5. The theoretical contributions are noteworthy, addressing limitations of traditional methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The manuscript is difficult to follow due to unclear language and complex sentence structures, necessitating improved clarity and coherence.
2. The empirical evaluation is limited, lacking comprehensive experiments and details on the multi-fidelity models used, which raises questions about the practical applicability of the proposed method.
3. The motivation for the multi-fidelity experiments is not well articulated, and the construction of multiple SCMs at different fidelities is unclear.
4. The reliance on simulation methods may not fully capture real-world scenarios, which could affect the applicability of the findings.
5. The practical motivation for the proposed method could be strengthened to better connect with real use cases.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the manuscript's clarity by revising complex sentences and ensuring a coherent narrative throughout. Utilizing tools like Grammarly could help identify language issues. Additionally, we suggest providing more detailed examples of multi-fidelity models and their construction to better motivate the proposed method. Expanding the empirical evaluation to include more comprehensive experiments and additional evaluation metrics beyond SHD, AUPRC, and MSE would strengthen the findings. We also recommend improving the discussion of the limitations associated with simulation-based methods in the limitations section of the paper. Enhancing the practical motivation for their method to better align it with real-world applications is essential. Incorporating the arguments and explanations from the rebuttal into the revised manuscript and appendix would be beneficial, as would integrating the additional experimental results into the main text to further clarify the merits of the proposed method. Finally, clarifying the definitions and implications of terms like "multi-target" and ensuring the accuracy of technical descriptions, such as the do-operator and identifiability, is essential for enhancing the manuscript's rigor.
