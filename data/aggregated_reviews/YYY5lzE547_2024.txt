### Key Points
This paper presents a study of the push-relabel algorithm with warm-starts for the max-flow problem, demonstrating that the running time can be bounded by \(O(n^2\eta)\) when utilizing a predicted pseudo-flow \(\hat f\), where \(\eta\) is the prediction error. The authors also show that the push-relabel algorithm with the gap-relabeling heuristic, when initialized with a cut-saturating pre-flow, achieves the same error-dependent bound. The main technical novelty lies in the update step that swaps excess and deficit nodes between the \(t\)- and \(s\)-sides. Empirical experiments on image-segmentation datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed warm-start approach compared to cold-start methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant gap between theory and practice for the push-relabel algorithm, providing interesting results.
- The analysis of the push-relabel algorithm with the gap-relabeling heuristic is a valuable contribution.
- The algorithm for swapping excess and deficit nodes is an innovative addition.

Weaknesses:
- The \(O(n^2\eta)\) bound is somewhat weak compared to the established \(O(m \| \hat f - f^* \|_1)\) time for Ford-Fulkerson.
- There is insufficient discussion on how to effectively learn \(\hat f\), especially given that the \(\ell_1\)-error is not a reliable measure of prediction quality.
- The paper's complexity and reliance on numerous pseudo-codes, primarily in the appendix, make it difficult to follow. A technical overview similar to that provided for Theorem 1 would enhance clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on learning \(\hat f\) by exploring alternative error measures that could provide better insights into prediction quality. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a clearer overview of the algorithms, particularly in relation to Figure 1, to facilitate understanding. Finally, addressing the estimation of \(\eta\) more thoroughly in the main text would enhance the paper's clarity and usability.
