Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an optimization algorithm for computing optimal Nash Equilibria (NE) in multi-player games, utilizing a correlation plan-based formulation with convex relaxation. The algorithm employs a binary-tree structure of correlation plans to incorporate bilinear constraints, thereby enhancing the computation of optimal NE. The authors provide experimental evaluations against various baselines, demonstrating the algorithm's effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The experimental evaluation yields promising results compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.  
2. The design of correlation plans to reduce the feasible solution space after relaxation is intriguing.  
3. The paper is well-written, making the contributions accessible and relevant to real-world applications in multi-agent settings.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The contribution and significance of the results are questionable; the use of correlation plans for NE computation is not surprising, and the algorithm's formulation appears straightforward.  
2. The benchmarks used for evaluation are relatively small, limiting the significance of the findings.  
3. The time complexity remains exponential, which is expected, and the notations related to correlation plans are complicated, despite the clarity of examples provided.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the significance of their results by using larger and more complex benchmark games to demonstrate the algorithm's applicability. Additionally, we suggest simplifying the notations related to correlation plans to enhance clarity. It would also be beneficial to include experiments comparing this algorithm with other techniques, such as using CRM as the meta-solver for PSRO, to explore performance across different settings.
