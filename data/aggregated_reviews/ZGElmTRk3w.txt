Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of the mean field limit of kernels and their associated Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS), providing novel theoretical tools for large-scale problems in statistical learning, particularly with Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The authors develop a rigorous construction of the mean field limit and demonstrate its application to SVMs, confirming the existence and uniqueness of solutions under certain conditions. The work also extends existing theories by introducing a new form of limit for learning problems, which has not been previously investigated in the statistical learning theory literature.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors provide a thorough investigation of the mean field limit of kernels and their RKHS, contributing valuable insights to the field.
2. The research extends the basic theory of mean field kernels, offering novel approximation results and a variant of the representer theorem.
3. The paper is well-organized, with clear proofs and a solid theoretical foundation for infinite-dimensional input functions.

Weaknesses:
1. The limitations or drawbacks of the research are not explicitly stated, leaving some aspects unaddressed.
2. The absence of concrete examples and datasets makes it difficult to assess the practical applicability of the proposed methods.
3. The title may mislead readers regarding the paper's focus, as it suggests a generalization error analysis rather than a study of mean-field neural network optimization.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the limitations of their research to provide a clearer understanding of its scope. Additionally, including concrete examples and datasets would enhance the paper's relevance and applicability in real-world scenarios. We also suggest revising the title to more accurately reflect the paper's content and focus. Furthermore, addressing the absence of convergence rates to the mean-field limit, even for specific kernel classes, would strengthen the overall presentation and rigor of the work.
