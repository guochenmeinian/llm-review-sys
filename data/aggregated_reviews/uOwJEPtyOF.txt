### Key Points
This paper presents Medusa, a dynamic analysis framework designed to detect memory exhaustion DoS vulnerabilities in protocol implementations. It introduces the protocol property graph (PPG) to capture memory consumption information and simulate DoS attacks for vulnerability verification. The authors evaluate Medusa on 21 programs, reporting that it outperforms existing techniques and identifies six zero-day vulnerabilities, including one new CVE. The methodology involves automatic filtering of vulnerabilities using CWE metrics and protocol-related keywords, resulting in a targeted dataset for further analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of the protocol property graph (PPG) is novel and automated.
2. The paper is well-structured, clearly written, and presents promising results.
3. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and performance of Medusa.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks evaluation of false positives and negatives, as well as code coverage.
2. The novelty of the approach is considered weak, with similarities to prior work.
3. Missing details in the design, particularly regarding mutation constraints and seed selection.
4. The evaluation results lack sufficient explanation, particularly concerning comparisons with existing techniques.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation of false positives and negatives by manually verifying findings and using a curated dataset. Additionally, an evaluation of code coverage should be included to assess how much of the code has been explored. The authors should clarify the baseline for memory consumption comparisons and provide more details on the user-provided restrictions for MEDUSA's operation. Furthermore, we suggest addressing the theoretical analysis of the system's performance and security, as well as discussing potential follow-up work and preventive measures.
