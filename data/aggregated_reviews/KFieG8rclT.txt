### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the interpretability of contrastive learning-based sentence encoders, specifically analyzing the SimCSE model using the Integrated Gradients method. The authors explore how encoders assign weights to input words based on information-theoretic concepts, such as self-information and information gain. Their findings indicate that contrastive learning influences word weighting in a manner akin to previous sentence embedding techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is intuitive and the experimental setup is reasonable and well-executed, with clear writing and mathematical presentation.
- The paper provides solid theoretical insights into the weighting of words in contrastive learning, supported by information gain analysis.

Weaknesses:
- The rationale for using Integrated Gradients to determine word weights is not compelling, leaving questions about the benefits of alternative methods.
- The experimental results are limited, primarily relying on the STS-B dataset, and do not include a broader range of datasets, such as STS12.
- Qualitative analysis is restricted and ambiguous, requiring further interpretation of results to clarify the implications of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for selecting the Integrated Gradients method over other potential approaches to quantify word weighting. Additionally, expanding the experimental evaluation to include a wider variety of datasets, particularly STS12, would strengthen the findings. Finally, we suggest enhancing the qualitative analysis to provide clearer interpretations of how the results contribute to understanding the inner workings of contrastive learning.
