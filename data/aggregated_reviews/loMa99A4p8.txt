Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Multivariate Learned Adaptive Noise (MULAN) model, a novel diffusion process that adapts the noise schedule to different regions of an image. The authors claim significant improvements in log-likelihood estimation and training efficiency, challenging the conventional assumption that the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) is invariant to the noise process. They demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in density estimation on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, achieving a 50% reduction in training steps. The authors propose a per-pixel noise schedule that can be conditional on context or auxiliary variables, leading to faster convergence and improved results on benchmark datasets. Additionally, the paper explores the MuLAN framework, which optimizes log-likelihood for enhanced performance in downstream tasks such as data compression and adversarial example detection, and includes visualizations of learned noise schedules across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents a theoretically sound method that is clearly motivated and explained.
- The proposed method shows state-of-the-art likelihood estimation results and includes extensive experimental results and an ablation study.
- The adaptation of the noise schedule to individual pixels provides additional flexibility in increasing the ELBO.
- The introduction of adaptive noise schedules conditioned on auxiliary latents represents a significant advancement in understanding noise dynamics in diffusion models.
- Comprehensive visualizations and experiments provide valuable insights into the learned noise schedules.

Weaknesses:
- The empirical claims regarding the optimal noise schedule are based solely on empirical evidence, lacking systematic exploration.
- The FIDs of the proposed model are significantly worse than those of existing diffusion models, and the paper does not demonstrate improved practical outcomes in downstream tasks.
- The current implementation of MuLAN does not utilize several techniques that could enhance FID scores, such as exponential moving averages and specialized learning schedules.
- Observations from experiments on CIFAR-10 indicate a lack of interpretable patterns in noise schedules related to image properties like intensity and frequency.
- Sections discussing the forward and backward processes are somewhat repetitive, and clarity on the dependency of the forward process on context is lacking.
- The paper does not adequately address the impact of randomness in experimental results, and some technical definitions are missing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the systematic exploration of the empirical findings regarding the optimal noise schedule, including an analysis of spatio-temporal details and correlations with spatially coarse-grained versions of images. Additionally, we suggest including results from downstream tasks to clarify where MULAN should be preferred over other models. The authors should also provide a clearer definition of the forward and backward processes and address the impact of randomness in their experiments. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the intuition behind the ELBO in the final version, as this would enrich the understanding of their approach. Finally, incorporating techniques such as exponential moving averages and specialized learning schedules could enhance FID scores, and visualizations of the learned noise schedule at different time steps would enhance understanding of its characteristics.
