Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ReFIR, a novel framework designed to enhance Large Restoration Models (LRMs) by incorporating external knowledge through the retrieval of high-quality, content-relevant images. The authors propose a training-free method that utilizes a nearest neighbor lookup in the semantic embedding space to mitigate the hallucination problem commonly faced by diffusion-based models. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ReFIR in producing high-fidelity restorations across various existing LRMs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The approach of integrating external data representation alongside model parameters is innovative and can complement existing model-oriented techniques.
2. The experiments yield solid results, showing significant performance improvements in fidelity and perceptual metrics across different LRMs.
3. The framework is adaptable and can be applied to multiple diffusion-based restoration models without additional training, making it a cost-effective solution.
4. The paper is well-organized and presents complex concepts clearly.

Weaknesses:
1. The proposed method's performance varies significantly across different LRMs, raising questions about the underlying reasons for these discrepancies.
2. The effectiveness of ReFIR heavily relies on the quality and relevance of the retrieved images, which could limit its applicability in scenarios with sub-optimal retrieval outcomes.
3. The complexity introduced by the cross-image injection and spatial adaptive gating mechanisms may challenge efficient implementation.
4. The paper lacks a thorough discussion on the computational costs associated with the retrieval process and modifications to self-attention layers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the differences between ReFIR and similar training-free techniques in image editing tasks. Additionally, the authors should explore mechanisms to dynamically assess and ensure the relevance and quality of retrieved images during the restoration process. A detailed analysis of the computational overhead introduced by the retrieval process and potential optimizations should be included. Furthermore, we suggest conducting additional experiments to validate ReFIR's robustness across a broader range of real-world degradation scenarios. Finally, a discussion on fallback strategies when relevant reference images are not available would enhance the framework's reliability.
