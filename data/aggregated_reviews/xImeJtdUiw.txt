Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents IsoFormer, a novel multi-modal model designed to integrate DNA, RNA, and protein sequences for predicting RNA transcript isoform expression across different tissues. The authors propose a framework that utilizes pre-trained modality-specific encoders to generate embeddings, which are combined through a sophisticated aggregation method. The model shows significant improvements in prediction accuracy compared to single-modality approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. Innovative Integration of Modalities: The paper represents the first attempt to integrate three biological sequence modalities (DNA, RNA, and proteins) in a unified model, reflecting natural biological processes.  
2. Effective Transfer Learning: IsoFormer leverages pre-trained encoders to enhance predictive power, benefiting from both intra-modal and inter-modal transfer learning.  
3. Robust Evaluation: Experiments demonstrate the model's capability, outperforming existing methods in predicting transcript isoform expression, a challenging task due to its multi-modal nature.  

Weaknesses:  
1. Complexity and Computation: The model's complexity and computational demands may limit its accessibility, particularly in resource-restricted environments.  
2. Lack of Comprehensive Evaluation: More extensive evaluation of the pre-trained models' representation learning capabilities is needed.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the training/validation/test set splits and consider conducting additional ablation studies to assess the impact of removing different modalities from the model. Specifically, it would be beneficial to evaluate the performance of the model with "DNA and RNA encoder not pre-trained" and provide results for DNA, RNA, and protein encoders on popular benchmarking tasks. Additionally, we suggest including more motivation for the proposed method, particularly regarding the influence of DNA changes on RNA sequencing. Finally, the authors should explicitly discuss the limitations of using reference genomes and known isoform sequences, as this may overlook the complexities of splicing influenced by DNA sequences.
