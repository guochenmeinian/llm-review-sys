### Key Points
This paper presents a novel learning strategy termed vision-language warm-up tasks for multimodal dialogue models (VLAW-MDM), which relies solely on target data instead of extensive pretraining or multi-task datasets. The authors propose four distinct warm-up tasks: Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Image-Swapping (ISP), Masked Region Modeling (MRM), and Generation Captioning (GCP). The approach includes automatic image caption generation to enhance visual contextualization. Experimental results indicate that VLAW-MDM achieves comparable, and sometimes superior, performance to state-of-the-art models on the ImageChat benchmark.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The underlying idea of using target data for training is innovative and addresses a significant challenge in multimodal dialogue modeling.
- The proposed method shows improvements over larger baseline models and includes a thorough ablation study.
- The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, providing detailed evaluations of the warm-up tasks.

Weaknesses:
- Performance gains are marginal, with differences between baseline and best approaches being less than 1% for most metrics.
- The paper lacks qualitative analysis, error analysis, and examples of generated outputs, which are crucial for understanding practical performance.
- The methodology section is insufficiently detailed, potentially hindering reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including qualitative evaluations and examples of generated captions and dialogue outputs to provide a clearer understanding of model performance. Additionally, conducting an error analysis would be beneficial, especially for open-ended generation tasks. To enhance reproducibility, we suggest incorporating an algorithm box that outlines the detailed workflow of the study. Furthermore, the authors should address the generalization ability of their method across different domains and provide benchmarks for computational efficiency.
