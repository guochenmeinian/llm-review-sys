Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a variational approach to offline safe reinforcement learning (RL), introducing the Variational Optimization with Conservative Estimation (VOCE) algorithm. It addresses the challenges posed by safety constraints and out-of-distribution (OOD) actions, leveraging probabilistic inference and Expectation-Maximization (EM) to enhance policy optimization. The authors utilize pessimistic estimation of Q-values to mitigate extrapolation errors and validate their approach through extensive numerical experiments, demonstrating improved performance in safety and reward metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper offers a solid theoretical foundation and a novel variational formulation that may inspire further research in offline safe RL.
2. The methodology is clearly presented, with effective derivation of Q-value bounds and promising numerical results indicating VOCE's superiority over baseline methods.
3. The introduction of a non-parametric policy enhances flexibility in optimizing safe policies.

Weaknesses:
1. The organization of the paper is lacking; several notations are not defined prior to use, making it difficult to follow. A complete summary of the VOCE algorithm would improve clarity.
2. Many claims appear to derive directly from existing methods like CVPO without adequate citation or discussion of recent offline safe RL benchmarks.
3. The sensitivity of key tuning parameters, such as \(\epsilon\) and \(\chi\), to numerical outcomes is insufficiently explored, raising concerns about robustness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization of the paper by defining all notations clearly and providing a comprehensive summary of the VOCE algorithm. Additionally, we suggest including further theoretical explanations or numerical experiments to clarify claims regarding the pessimistic estimation of Q-values and its role in avoiding extrapolation errors. An ablation study to assess the impact of tuning parameters on results would also be beneficial. Lastly, a discussion on the runtime of the algorithm and the tuning process for hyperparameters would enhance the paper's completeness.
