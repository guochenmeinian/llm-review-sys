Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of the cross-learning problem in contextual bandits, proposing an algorithm that achieves a regret of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{KT})$. The authors improve upon existing methods by separating the learning horizon into blocks and coordinating the estimation of unknown distributions with the actions taken, effectively addressing correlation issues. The algorithm is applied to first-price auctions and sleeping bandits, yielding nearly tight bounds.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The algorithm achieves optimal regret without requiring knowledge of the context distribution, demonstrating a clear improvement over previous results.  
- The theoretical bounds are nearly tight, and the paper is generally well-written, with a clear setup and novel techniques for overcoming existing challenges.  

Weaknesses:  
- The motivation for the cross-learning setting is not adequately articulated, particularly regarding its practical applications beyond the provided examples.  
- The technical presentation is difficult to follow, with numerous grammatical errors and unclear notations, leading to doubts about the soundness of the approach.  
- Limitations and computational efficiency comparisons with existing algorithms are not sufficiently addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for the cross-learning setting by providing clearer connections to practical applications, such as bidding in first-price auctions and sleeping bandits. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the clarity of the technical presentation by defining all notations clearly and addressing grammatical errors throughout the manuscript. We also encourage the authors to discuss the limitations of their approach and to compare the computational efficiency of their algorithm with that of Balseiro et al. to clarify its impact. Lastly, we recommend including numerical experiments to support the theoretical results presented.
