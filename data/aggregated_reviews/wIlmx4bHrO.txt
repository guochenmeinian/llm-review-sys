Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a single-loop extra-gradient difference acceleration algorithm for solving constrained nonconvex-nonconcave minimax problems, achieving a complexity of \(O(\epsilon^{-2})\) for finding an \(\epsilon\)-stationary point. The authors propose a novel prediction point scheme that introduces a quasi-cocoercivity property, enhancing the convergence rate without requiring monotonicity or structural assumptions. The algorithm is theoretically analyzed and empirically validated, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The theoretical contributions are significant, with a well-structured presentation that enhances readability.  
- The algorithm combines innovative ideas and achieves state-of-the-art results for various minimax optimization settings.  
- Empirical studies validate the method across synthetic and real tasks, providing compelling evidence of its effectiveness.

Weaknesses:  
- The proofs of propositions are dense, making verification challenging; improving their clarity would benefit readers.  
- Some structural assumptions may limit practical applications, and the absence of experiments on the C-NC problem needs addressing.  
- There are minor typographical errors and inconsistencies in empirical results that require clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the readability and verifiability of the proofs to facilitate understanding. Additionally, addressing the absence of experiments on the C-NC problem within the paper would strengthen the work. We suggest providing a deeper analysis of the algorithm's time complexities and clarifying any inconsistencies between empirical evidence and theoretical results. Lastly, a thorough proofreading for typographical errors is advised before final submission.
