### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework, MultiFactor, for generating questions from a given context and answer through multi-level content planning. It includes a FA-model that selects key phrases and generates full answers, followed by a Q-model that uses these full answers to produce questions. The experimental results indicate that this method outperforms strong baselines on popular datasets like HotpotQA and SQuAD.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces the innovative concept of full answers for multi-level content planning in question generation (QG).
- The approach is clearly explained, making it easy to follow, with well-organized sections and consistent title, abstract, and keywords.
- The use of Phrase-Enhanced Transformer (PET) enhances representation learning for both phrase selection and generation tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The lack of evaluation against large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT or GPT-4 raises concerns about the robustness of the experimental results.
- The significance of generating full answers is not convincingly demonstrated, as indicated by the experimental results.
- The reliance on named entity recognition (NER) may limit the method's applicability to generating complex questions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how full answers contribute to the question generation process, possibly by providing detailed intuition or explanation. Additionally, the authors should include comparisons with strong baselines, such as zero-shot LLMs like GPT-2 or GPT-3, to strengthen their claims. It would also be beneficial to explore the performance of instruction-tuned models like FlanT5-x as a baseline in question generation tasks. Finally, addressing the concerns regarding the impact of NER on the results would enhance the paper's credibility.
