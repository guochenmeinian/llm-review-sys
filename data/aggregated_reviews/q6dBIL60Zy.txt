### Key Points
This paper presents a reinforcement learning-based method, EarnMore, for portfolio management using customizable stock pools (CSPs). The authors propose a masking and reconstruction process to create a uniform stock representation, allowing for one-time training on a global stock pool (GSP) while addressing the computational inefficiencies of traditional methods. The introduction of learned masked tokens ([M]) aids in identifying less favorable stocks, and extensive experiments demonstrate the method's superior performance against 14 baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to read.
- Extensive experiments with numerous baselines validate the proposed method's effectiveness.
- The approach enables one-time training for various CSPs, enhancing efficiency in portfolio management.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments are limited to a small number of CSPs; additional datasets and scenarios could strengthen the findings.
- The methodology lacks clarity regarding test-time operations, particularly concerning masking and the treatment of stocks outside the CSP.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by adding one more dataset, such as NASDAQ 100 or HSI, to enhance the robustness of the experiments. Additionally, modeling human behavior in CSP changes and providing statistics on portfolio value fluctuations would be beneficial. It would also be valuable to compare EarnMore with competitors when CSPs change, retraining competitors with new stock sets to assess performance differences. Furthermore, clarifying the masking process during test time and addressing how to prevent the actor-critic from assigning weights to masked stocks would strengthen the methodology. Lastly, using contrasting colors in plots and correcting minor typographical errors would improve the presentation.
