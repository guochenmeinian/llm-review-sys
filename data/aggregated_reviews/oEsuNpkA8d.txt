Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method named Global and Local-aware Denoising (GOLD) for detecting noise in commonsense knowledge graphs (CSKGs). The authors propose a framework that utilizes both global and local information to identify noisy triples, achieving superior performance compared to previous baselines. The evaluation focuses on link prediction tasks using Recall and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. The authors also conduct an ablation study to analyze the contribution of each model component.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively combines local and global information for noise detection, demonstrating significant performance improvements.
- The comprehensive experimental results validate the proposed method, particularly in comparison to existing models.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of combining representation-based and rule mining-based methods is questioned, as it lacks originality.
- The evaluation metrics are limited to Recall and AUC, which do not fully capture the model's performance regarding noisy triples; precision metrics are needed.
- Key definitions and research questions are not clearly articulated, leaving readers unclear about the authors' objectives.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction to better articulate the shortcomings of existing methods and the novelty of their approach. Additionally, the authors should include precision metrics in their evaluation to provide a more comprehensive assessment of their model's performance. It would also be beneficial to explicitly state the research questions and main contributions to guide the reader's understanding. Finally, consider relocating essential definitions from the Appendixes to the main text for better accessibility.
