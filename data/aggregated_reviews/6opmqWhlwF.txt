### Key Points
This paper presents a method for co-speech gesture generation using a graph neural network, specifically employing spatio-temporal graph convolution. The authors propose a model that utilizes separate encoders for audio, text, and motion data, integrating these into a multimodal latent representation. The motion encoder is based on a spatio-temporal graph convolutional network. Quantitative metrics indicate that the proposed method outperforms StyleGesture, while subjective evaluations suggest that the generated gestures are as natural, credible, and consistent as those produced by StyleGesture.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The application of graph neural networks to co-speech gesture generation is innovative.
- Both quantitative and subjective studies validate the method's effectiveness.
- The model demonstrates high reconstruction ability and faster performance compared to normalized flow-based models.
- The paper is well-organized, with clear technical descriptions and reproducible experiments.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks comparisons with state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods.
- The effectiveness of the ST-GCN remains unclear due to missing evaluation results.
- The adaptability of the model to different skeletal structures is not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by comparing the proposed method with diffusion-based state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, a deeper ablation study should be conducted to clarify the contributions of various architectural components, such as the utility of symmetric links in the graph. It would also be beneficial to provide insights into how the model can adapt to different skeletal structures without requiring retraining from scratch. Finally, including evaluations on multiple and varied skeletons would enhance the robustness of the claims regarding flexibility.
