Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a generalization of online convex optimization (OCO) with memory, allowing the current stage cost to depend on all past decisions through a discrete-time linear dynamical system. The authors propose a follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) algorithm that achieves sublinear static regret against any fixed action and demonstrate its applicability in online control and performative prediction. The authors define "effective memory" to quantify the memory property of the operator involved.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1) The motivation for studying OCO with unbound memory is significant, as it extends existing frameworks.
2) The proposed algorithm provides a regret bound and has practical applications, potentially simplifying regret analysis for online linear control.
3) The theoretical results include upper and lower bounds, contributing to the understanding of the problem's complexity.

Weaknesses:
1) The extension from OCO with memory to OCO with unbound memory appears straightforward, limiting the novelty of the work.
2) The authors only consider history determined by fixed linear operators without justification, which raises concerns about the generality of their approach.
3) The experimental setup lacks parameter tuning according to theoretical guarantees, making it unclear if empirical improvements align with theoretical results.
4) The problem setting may be reducible to online control with adversarial disturbances, suggesting a need for a more detailed literature review and comparison with recent works.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their framework by providing more special cases that demonstrate its potential to yield new insights in algorithm design. Additionally, the authors should clarify the rationale for focusing on fixed linear operators and consider exploring more complex histories. We suggest conducting experiments with parameters tuned according to their theoretical guarantees to ensure consistency between empirical results and theoretical expectations. Finally, we encourage the authors to evaluate their results against recent literature on online control to clarify the significance of their contributions.
