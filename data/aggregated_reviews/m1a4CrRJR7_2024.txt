### Key Points
This paper presents the first generalization analysis of the learning algorithm driving two-stage recommender systems, specifically focusing on a tree-structured model comprising an efficient tree-based retriever and a more precise yet time-consuming ranker. The authors propose an error decomposition framework and apply Rademacher complexity to derive generalization upper bounds for various tree-based retrievers using beam search and different ranker models under a shifted training distribution. The findings suggest that increasing the branches in tree-based retrievers and harmonizing distributions across stages can enhance generalization performance, validated through experiments on real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a timely and relevant topic, filling a gap in the theoretical understanding of two-stage recommender systems, which are widely used in industry.
- The derived generalization upper bounds provide meaningful insights into optimizing design choices for these systems.
- The theoretical findings align well with empirical experiments, demonstrating the utility of the generalization upper bounds.
- The analysis of generalization errors enhances the understanding of the two-stage model, which has been underexplored in existing literature.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks a discussion on the potential limitations of the derived generalization upper bounds, which would complement its contributions.
- There is a need for a separate "Experiments" section and a list of notations to improve clarity.
- The analysis does not explore the generalization properties of other retriever architectures, such as deep learning-based models beyond the target attention model.
- The paper does not address the computational complexity and inference latency of the proposed systems.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the potential limitations of the derived generalization upper bounds to provide a more balanced view of their contributions. Additionally, creating a separate "Experiments" section and including a list of notations would enhance clarity. The authors should also consider expanding their analysis to include other types of retriever architectures and provide a comprehensive examination of the computational complexity and inference latency of the proposed two-stage recommender systems. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors clarify the terms "Harmonized distribution" and "Harmonized model" for better understanding.
