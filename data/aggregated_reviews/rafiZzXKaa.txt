### Key Points
This paper presents an Adaptive Multi-Interest Debiasing framework (AMID) for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) under open-world assumptions. The authors identify two main challenges: modeling non-overlapping users and addressing selection bias due to data distribution shifts. The framework includes a multi-interest information module (MIM) and a doubly robust estimator (DRE), with extensive experiments demonstrating its effectiveness on real-world financial platforms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper tackles a relevant problem in CDR that aligns with real-world scenarios.
2. The methodology is technically sound, with formal guarantees on bias and variance.
3. Extensive empirical evaluations, including online A/B tests, showcase the framework's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper assumes a high level of prior knowledge, lacking sufficient background information for readers unfamiliar with the domain.
2. Some methodological sections are not self-contained, with parameters introduced without explanation.
3. User grouping relies solely on sequence similarity, which may introduce instability and bias.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivations by explicitly distinguishing between scenarios with many, few, and no overlapping users. Additionally, providing a precise definition of open-world cross-domain recommendation would enhance understanding. The authors should clarify the objective function in Eq. 1 by incorporating user interaction sequences from the target domain. We also suggest including explicit details on how propensities are computed in the DRE and ensuring that all symbols in equations are properly defined. Finally, we encourage the authors to incorporate relevant literature on multi-interest recommendations and causal graphs to strengthen the novelty of their work.
