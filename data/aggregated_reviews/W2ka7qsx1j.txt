### Key Points
This paper presents a Diffusion Weighted Graph Framework (DWGF) aimed at discovering new intents in text data, enhancing intent recognition systems through the integration of semantic similarities and structural relationships. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of DWGF through comprehensive experimental evaluations on various datasets, showing significant performance improvements over existing methods in metrics such as Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), and Accuracy (ACC).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is novel and outperforms existing baselines, showcasing competitive results across multiple benchmark datasets.
- The paper is well-written, with extensive evaluations and convincing ablation studies.
- The source code is available for reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty is questioned as the work combines many existing techniques, including Bert, MLM, diffusion, neural KMeans, and GNN.
- The model exhibits sensitivity to hyperparameters, raising concerns about robustness.
- The complexity of the proposed algorithm is not thoroughly discussed, and some explanations, such as those related to Figure 7, lack clarity.
- The experiments do not adequately address scenarios where unknown intent classes may outnumber known ones.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the complexity of the proposed algorithm and its sensitivity to hyperparameters. Additionally, please provide significance testing results for the performance metrics, particularly for Table 2, to clarify the robustness of the findings. It would also be beneficial to include missing references in Section 4.3 for the evaluation metrics used and to clarify the domain of the BANKING dataset. Lastly, ensure that the acronym DWGF is consistently used throughout the paper and consider bolding the best-performing numbers in Table 2 to highlight the model's superiority.
