### Key Points
This paper presents the use of "hints" as a prompting technique to enhance the mathematical problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The authors draw inspiration from human pedagogical methods, comparing hinting to established techniques like one-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting using various LLMs on the MATH dataset. The study also evaluates the models' robustness against adversarial hints, providing insights into their sensitivity to misleading information.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The hinting technique is intuitively motivated by human pedagogy, offering a novel approach to guiding model reasoning.
2. The evaluation encompasses multiple LLMs, demonstrating the hinting technique's applicability across different model types.
3. The robustness testing against adversarial hints adds valuable insights into the limitations of the hinting approach.

Weaknesses:
1. The experiments are limited to a subset of the MATH dataset, suggesting a need for broader validation across additional datasets.
2. The exploration of adversarial and random hinting lacks depth, particularly regarding the failure modes and model sensitivities.
3. The hint generation process requires more clarity, including how hints were derived from the Gemini model.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset scope by testing on a wider range of datasets, such as GSM-8k, to validate the hinting technique more thoroughly. Additionally, a more detailed analysis of the hint generation process and the performance of hinting compared to CoT in specific problem categories would enhance the paper's depth. Expanding the discussion on adversarial hints and their generation could yield further insights. Lastly, a clearer statistical analysis with significance reporting and a more concise abstract would strengthen the overall presentation of the findings.
