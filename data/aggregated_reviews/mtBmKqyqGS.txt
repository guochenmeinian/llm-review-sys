Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Phased Consistency Model (PCM), which aims to enhance stability and speed in high-resolution image and video generation by addressing the limitations of Latent Consistency Models (LCMs). The authors propose a novel parameterization of the consistency function and phase trajectory, alongside a method to improve CFG utilization. They argue that PCM employs a one-to-one mapping of timesteps, distinguishing it from existing methods like TCD, which utilizes a one-to-N mapping. The authors provide detailed comparisons of the learning objectives and loss functions between PCM and TCD, highlighting the efficiency of PCM with \(O(N)\) training objectives compared to TCD's \(\mathcal{O}(N^2)\). Experimental results indicate that PCM outperforms existing methods across various generation settings, supported by extensive experiments and theoretical proofs. However, the paper raises concerns regarding the necessity of target timestep embeddings in CTM and asserts that their contributions have been undervalued.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The architecture of PCM is straightforward and clear.
2. The insights gained from observing the multi-step process are commendable.
3. Extensive experimental results demonstrate PCM's effectiveness in both image and video generation tasks.
4. The method introduces a significant advancement by segmenting the ODE trajectory, enhancing stability and controllability.
5. The authors provide a clear and detailed differentiation between their method and existing approaches, particularly in terms of training objectives and efficiency.
6. The paper includes comprehensive comparisons and examples that effectively illustrate the proposed method's advantages.

Weaknesses:
1. The authors do not provide comparisons with the official CTM, raising concerns about the validity of their claims.
2. There is a lack of clarity regarding the implementation details of the claimed models, particularly the absence of descriptions for SD15 CTM and SDXL CTM.
3. The paper does not adequately explain the differences between CTM and PCM, nor does it provide sufficient quantitative ablation analysis.
4. The reliance on FID and CLIP metrics is problematic due to their known limitations; more contemporary metrics should be considered.
5. There are allegations of plagiarism regarding the use of a reparameterization scheme without proper citation, raising concerns about academic integrity.
6. Some reviewers express skepticism about the novelty of the work, questioning the lack of citations to related literature.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their comparisons with CTM by including direct experimental results on benchmarks like ImageNet or CIFAR. Additionally, the authors should provide detailed descriptions of the implementations of SD15 CTM and SDXL CTM to substantiate their claims. It would be beneficial to clarify the training process for 1-step and multi-step PCM, including any differences beyond the range of training parameters. We also suggest incorporating more contemporary evaluation metrics, such as HPS or PICK-SCORE, and utilizing recall to demonstrate model diversity. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the citation practices in their manuscript, particularly regarding the reparameterization scheme, to address plagiarism concerns. Lastly, we suggest that the authors clarify the distinctions between their work and related studies more explicitly in the introduction to strengthen the perceived novelty of their contributions.
