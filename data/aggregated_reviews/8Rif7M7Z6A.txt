### Key Points
This paper presents a study on multi-component compound-type identification in Sanskrit, building on prior work focused on binary compounds. The authors introduce a new dataset, curated by language experts, which includes coarse (4) and fine-grained types (86), along with an out-of-domain test set from poetry literature. The proposed method reformulates the compound-type identification task as a variant of dependency parsing, demonstrating improved performance over baselines that utilize constituency parsing, span labeling, and seq2seq approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The task is well-motivated, with a detailed comparison to nested NER and MWE detection, highlighting that over 41% of compounds in literature contain more than three components.  
- The dataset is well-curated and offers potential for future research, particularly with its out-of-domain split.  
- The paper effectively compares various task formulations, including constituency parsing and seq2seq methods.  
- Significant effort has been invested in creating the annotated corpus, involving multiple institutions and Sanskrit experts.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks sufficient details on dataset collection and baseline descriptions.  
- The dependency parsing formulation is not convincingly justified, as many dependency relations and tokens do not seem to aid the task.  
- Clarity issues arise regarding the purpose of the two datasets and the definitions of "coarse" and "fine-grained" annotations.  
- The diverse pool of annotators raises concerns about data quality without inter-annotator agreement metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the dataset's purpose and the definitions of "coarse" and "fine-grained" annotations, possibly including examples. Additionally, we suggest providing further details on the dataset collection process and baseline descriptions to enhance transparency. The authors should consider revising the dependency parsing formulation to focus solely on tokens within the compounds to improve efficiency. Clarifying the span encoding method and addressing the confusion regarding the context's impact on the proposed method would also strengthen the paper. Lastly, including guidelines for annotators and measuring inter-annotator agreement would bolster confidence in data quality.
