### Key Points
This paper presents Conformalized Time Series with Semantic Features (CT-SSF), a novel conformal prediction method that constructs prediction intervals for time series data using nonconformity scores computed in the latent feature space of neural networks. The authors propose leveraging latent semantic features through deep representation learning to dynamically adjust weights for conformal prediction, aiming to improve uncertainty quantification. The paper demonstrates that CT-SSF achieves tighter prediction intervals with valid coverage guarantees, outperforming existing methods in both synthetic and real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces an interesting combination of conformal prediction and deep representation learning, focusing on the latent space rather than the output space.  
- The idea of adapting time-dependent weights for the nonconformity score computed in semantic feature space is novel.  
- The authors conducted experiments on synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating that the width of the prediction interval is shorter than those obtained from existing approaches.  
- The paper includes theoretical analysis on the validity of the proposed method and ablation studies to investigate the performance of each core component.

Weaknesses:  
- The claim of model agnosticism is questionable, as experimental results show variation in different (f, g) configurations, raising concerns about the method's wide applicability and computational efficiency.  
- Clarity issues exist, particularly regarding the model-agnostic claim and the reliance on neural networks, which could mislead readers.  
- The theoretical guarantee in Section 4.5 lacks intuitive explanation, particularly regarding the reduction of interval widths and the assumptions on the original series.  
- The experimental significance is limited by the small number of repetitions in synthetic data experiments, leading to wide confidence intervals.  
- There is insufficient discussion on the efficiency of the proposed method and the impact of high-dimensional latent space on conformal prediction.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by explicitly stating that CT-SSF is applicable to any NN-based prediction models for time series. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed discussion on the assumptions of Theorem 1, including their robustness and implications if violated. We suggest conducting more repetitive experiments to enhance the significance of the results and comparing the efficiency of CT-SSF with existing methods. Furthermore, the authors should clarify how the weights are updated in Algorithm 1 and consider adding relevant context about past work in the appendix to aid reader understanding.
