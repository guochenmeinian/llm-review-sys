Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel smoothing loss aimed at improving the regularization of the estimated Signed Distance Field (SDF) from unoriented point clouds. The authors propose aligning the SDF's gradient with its Hessian to enhance surface reconstruction quality, demonstrating that this method outperforms the commonly used Eikonal loss. Experimental results validate the proposed approach's effectiveness, showing robustness against input noise and hyper-parameter variations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed loss is novel and theoretically sound.
- It can be easily integrated with various methods as a plugin.
- Comprehensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements in performance.

Weaknesses:
- The paper suffers from poor writing quality, presenting concepts from a mathematical rather than a computer vision perspective, leading to unclear explanations.
- Important details are missing, particularly regarding figures and equations, which are crucial for understanding.
- The evaluation metrics used differ from those in recent literature, raising concerns about comparability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing to better suit a computer vision audience, ensuring that all technical terms and concepts are well-defined. Specifically, we suggest including illustrative figures in Section 3.3 to clarify the intuition behind Equation 4 and the concept of "alignment." Additionally, we advise providing consistent input points across methods in Figure 2 for valid comparisons. In Figure 3, the authors should clearly indicate problematic regions and justify the effectiveness of the alignment loss. Furthermore, the authors should define the big Q in Equation 7 and enhance Table 5's caption with detailed explanations of each row. Lastly, we encourage the authors to discuss potential limitations of their method and explore its applicability to other scenarios, such as unsigned distance fields.
