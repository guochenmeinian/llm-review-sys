### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of a scalable UQ-aware deep learning technique, Deep Evidence Regression, applied to predict Loss Given Default (LGD) using targets generated by a Weibull distribution. The authors extend the Deep Evidence Regression methodology to accommodate this distribution, providing a relevant learning framework. Empirical tests on both synthetic and real-world datasets in credit risk management demonstrate that the proposed method better captures uncertainty characteristics associated with Weibull-distributed data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper innovatively extends the Deep Evidence Regression methodology to learn target variables generated by a Weibull process, providing a coherent description and thorough derivation of relevant formulas.
2. The work addresses an important problem in uncertainty quantification for risk assessment, making it directly useful for practitioners in the field.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper offers only incremental improvements over the original Deep Evidence Regression, with limited empirical evaluation and reliance on a single dataset, which raises concerns about generalizability.
2. Several mathematical formula writing errors are present, and the presentation lacks clarity, particularly regarding experimental setups and figure references.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental section by specifying the settings of parameters k and Î» for the Weibull distribution and the target for the MSE metric. Additionally, enhancing the presentation of the initial method would make the paper more self-contained. We suggest including comparisons with other uncertainty quantification methods, such as conformal predictions or quantile regression, to provide a more robust evaluation. Furthermore, addressing the identified mathematical errors and enhancing figure legends and captions would significantly improve the paper's quality. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore the applicability of their method to other distributions beyond Weibull to broaden its relevance.
