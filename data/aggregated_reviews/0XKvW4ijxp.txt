Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new framework for learning-augmented online algorithms, integrating predictions into the algorithmic process. The authors propose that predictions can be adaptively updated based on incoming information, utilizing a hypothesis class that encompasses various plausible instances. The framework is applied to three online problems: caching, load balancing, and non-clairvoyant scheduling, analyzed in both realizable and agnostic settings. The authors provide improved bounds for these problems, demonstrating the framework's practical applicability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces an interesting generalization of the traditional learning-augmented framework, potentially impacting the field by clarifying previously entangled concepts.
- The framework is well-motivated and applicable to relevant problems, showing improved guarantees over established online problems.
- The integration of the learning process with the algorithmic procedure enhances understanding of prediction acquisition and allows for flexibility in updating predictions.

Weaknesses:
- The algorithmic novelty in concrete applications is minor, as many algorithms appear to closely follow the predictions from the predictor, which are often simple.
- The relationship to the established 'multiple prediction' setting raises concerns, as the hypothesis class can be interpreted as the set of predictions, with the goal being to ensure bounds relative to the best one.
- The lack of experimental evaluation limits the practical validation of the framework, and the writing contains awkward phrases and grammatical errors.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by providing examples of hypothesis classes to strengthen the connection to practical applications. Additionally, conducting experimental evaluations, even simple synthetic ones, could elucidate the construction of hypothesis classes and support the proposed approach. We also suggest revising the writing for grammatical accuracy and clarity. Lastly, addressing the inefficiency of iterating over the entire set of hypotheses in the algorithms would enhance the framework's practicality.
