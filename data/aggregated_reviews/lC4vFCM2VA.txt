### Key Points
This paper presents ReXMiner, a method for zero-shot relation extraction from semi-structured web pages, focusing on the relationships between text nodes. It encodes the shortest relative paths in the Document Object Model (DOM) and incorporates the popularity of text nodes by counting their occurrences across different pages. The authors claim that their approach, which utilizes contrastive learning, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SWDE dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed extension of the MarkupLM model improves performance in zero-shot relation extraction, as demonstrated by experiments and ablation studies.
- The paper is well-structured and clear, making it easy to follow.
- The technical details are solid and reasonable, showcasing the benefits of combining structural and popularity information.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution appears incremental, primarily building on existing work without sufficiently demonstrating the advantages of the new approach.
- Key technical aspects, such as the representation of model input and the grouping of tokens, are unclear or missing.
- There is a lack of comparison to existing PLM-based methods and insufficient reproducibility due to the absence of code and details on hyperparameter selection.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the nature of the input sequence elements, specifically what w_i represents in the (w_i, xpath_i) notation. Additionally, please clarify how tokens are grouped to produce pairs of text nodes from predicted token pairs. We suggest including a comparison to existing PLM-based methods and addressing the concerns regarding the development/test splits used for hyperparameter selection to ensure a fair evaluation. Finally, we encourage the authors to enrich the paper's content to fully justify its length and significance.
