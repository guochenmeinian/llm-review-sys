Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an easily computable optimal transport method, Convolutional Monge Mapping Normalisation (CMMN), for power spectral density data, particularly in EEG classification of sleep stages. The method assumes Gaussian and stationary data, allowing for a closed-form analytical expression that mitigates data shifts from varying measurement conditions. The authors compare CMMN with other normalization schemes, analyze computational loads, and explore different neural network architectures to demonstrate practical benefits and variations across datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The authors provide an excellent introduction to their low optimal transport method, which is simpler and performs better than existing methods.  
- The manuscript thoroughly studies the benefits of normalization concerning neural network architecture and various datasets, showing advances in balanced accuracy.  
- The method demonstrates significant and consistent performance gains across different neural network architectures and data collection conditions.

Weaknesses:  
- There is a lack of discussion regarding the validity of the assumptions made in deriving the CMMN method, particularly concerning non-Gaussian and non-stationary data.  
- The paper inadequately references related methods for EEG data preprocessing, such as HAPPE, and does not sufficiently articulate its contributions to machine learning.  
- The experimental results are limited to sleep staging, raising questions about the method's applicability to other EEG analysis paradigms and biosignals.  
- The discussion could benefit from a deeper exploration of the physical interpretations of spectral differences and the implications of using barycenters for normalization.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the validity of the assumptions underlying the CMMN method, particularly regarding non-Gaussian data and its implications for EEG analysis. Additionally, the authors should enhance the referencing of related EEG preprocessing methods, such as HAPPE, and articulate their contributions to machine learning more comprehensively. We suggest conducting experiments beyond sleep staging to assess the method's applicability to other EEG tasks and biosignals. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the physical interpretations of spectral differences and the rationale behind using barycenters in their normalization approach. Lastly, we advise revising Figure 1 for clarity and ensuring that the discussion on windowing functions is precise and comprehensive.
