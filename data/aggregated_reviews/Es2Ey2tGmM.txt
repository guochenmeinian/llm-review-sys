Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach termed `Dual Training` for training constrained diffusion models, particularly addressing `biased data generation`. The authors derive learning objectives within a constrained optimization framework and develop methodologies based on Lagrangian duality, proposing an innovative training procedure. The effectiveness of their approach is validated through experiments on generative tasks, including fairness in image generation and fine-tuning pre-trained models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- **Robust Derivation Procedure**: The authors provide a thorough derivation procedure, significantly strengthening the theoretical foundation of their work.
- **Relevant Application Scenario**: The focus on constrained diffusion models in underrepresented fields highlights the study's relevance and potential impact.

Weaknesses:
- The authors need to clarify whether the re-weighting-based approach can be considered a special case of their method.
- The discussion on diffusion models primarily centers on the DDPM model; exploring extensions to other diffusion processes would be beneficial.
- The transition from (U-KL) to (U-LOSS) lacks justification; a detailed explanation or derivation is needed.
- The manuscript does not include comparative results with baseline models, which is crucial for demonstrating the proposed approach's efficacy.
- A discussion on the interpretation of the approach from the perspective of partial optimal transport is warranted.
- Sensitivity analysis regarding batch size effects in the dual training procedure is necessary.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by providing a derivation or detailed explanation for the transition from (U-KL) to (U-LOSS), particularly in relation to equations (6) and (U-MIX). Additionally, including comparative results with baseline models and discussing the potential interpretation of their approach in the context of partial optimal transport would enhance the manuscript. A sensitivity analysis regarding batch size effects should also be included. Finally, addressing the lack of a dedicated section for related work and providing a more comprehensive empirical evaluation using challenging datasets would strengthen the paper's contributions.
