### Key Points
This paper presents an approach to few-shot learning through Few-Shot Task Learning Through Inverse Generative Modeling (FTL-IGM), which utilizes a conditional classifier-free guidance diffusion model pre-trained on task concepts and demonstrations. The method allows for learning new task concepts from few demonstrations without updating model weights and is evaluated across various domains, including object rearrangement and autonomous driving. The authors propose that by inverting the generative model, the method outperforms existing baselines in learning task concepts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method addresses a significant challenge in reinforcement learning by learning agent intents from limited data, with practical implications across various domains.
2. Effective visualizations enhance the clarity of results and methodology, supported by an accompanying website.
3. The approach demonstrates generalizability in learning novel concepts and generating agent plans in unseen environments.

Weaknesses:
1. The concept of "task concept learning" is not rigorously defined, leading to ambiguity regarding its distinction from "context" or "contextual."
2. Scalability to diverse and complex real-world environments is not adequately addressed, raising concerns about practical applicability.
3. Section 4.2 lacks clarity regarding the specific characteristics of the diffusion model that make it “invertible,” and the exposition could benefit from a more detailed methods section and background discussion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the definition of "task concept learning" to clarify its distinction from related terms. Additionally, addressing scalability concerns by discussing the model's applicability in varied environments would strengthen the paper. We suggest expanding the baseline comparisons beyond BC and VAE to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the method's effectiveness. Furthermore, enhancing the explanation in Section 4.2 regarding the invertibility of the diffusion model and improving the overall exposition, particularly in the methods and related work sections, would benefit reader comprehension.
