Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for generating crystal materials using language models, specifically through the Mat2Seq method, which converts 3D crystal structures into 1D sequences while ensuring SE(3) and periodic invariance. The authors utilize the Niggli reduction method to create a unique representation of crystal structures from CIF files, demonstrating improved generalization capabilities compared to existing methods like CrystalLLM. The experimental results validate the efficacy of Mat2Seq in crystal structure prediction and discovery.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written, providing clear descriptions of the problem background and proposed methods.
2. It introduces the Mat2Seq process, ensuring SE(3) invariance and completeness while avoiding data augmentation issues.
3. The experiments are comprehensive, demonstrating the robustness and versatility of the method across various tasks.

Weaknesses:
1. The evaluation of the proposed method's generalization capability to equivariant structures is insufficiently demonstrated.
2. The comparison of language models is limited, focusing only on CrystalLLM without addressing other methods.
3. The rationale for this limited comparison needs clarification, and the evaluation metrics used are restricted, lacking detailed assessments of generated structures.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on computational complexity differences between language models and specialized crystal models, as well as provide a more extensive comparison with other methods mentioned in Section 4.1. Additionally, we suggest including detailed evaluations of the generated structures, such as the proportion of valid structures and accuracy metrics like RMSE for atomic distance differences. Clarifying the methodology for the uniqueness evaluation in Table 1 and enhancing the visual representation of transformations in Figure 1 would also strengthen the paper. Lastly, addressing the concerns regarding the conditional generation of materials with specific properties, particularly the classification of band gaps, would provide clearer validation of the model's capabilities.
