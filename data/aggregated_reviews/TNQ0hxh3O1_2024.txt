Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method, DetLH, for leveraging image-level annotations to enhance object detection pretraining, particularly in zero-shot and open vocabulary settings. The authors introduce a language hierarchical self-training (LHST) framework that integrates WordNet with self-training to generate pseudo-labelled object proposals, adjusting these labels based on class hierarchies. Additionally, they propose a language hierarchical prompt generation (LHPG) method that does not require extra training. The extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well organized and clearly written, effectively communicating its key ideas.
2. The proposed method is novel and presents an improved approach to utilizing labelled object-centric images for training object detectors.
3. Extensive experiments validate the method's effectiveness, showing significant performance improvements across various datasets.

Weaknesses:
1. The absence of an ablation study on the impact of the reliability score is a notable gap; understanding its effect on performance would be valuable.
2. The paper lacks comprehensive comparisons with recent methods and omits evaluations with LVIS/COCO, which are critical for contextualizing results.
3. The necessity of scaling the vocabulary with image labels is not sufficiently justified, given the strong zero-shot capabilities of recent MLLM-based methods.
4. The experimental section does not adequately analyze the assumptions regarding taxonomy discrepancies between image and detection datasets, which may significantly impact results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including an ablation study to assess the impact of the reliability score on performance. Additionally, we suggest providing more comparisons with recent methods and conducting evaluations with LVIS/COCO to enhance the robustness of the findings. Clarifying the necessity of the investigated problem and highlighting the novelty of the proposed method would strengthen the paper. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include visual examples of label expansion and provide specific instances where the labels expanded by WordNet may not be reliable. Lastly, a more detailed analysis of the taxonomies of image versus box categories and their impact on performance should be included to support the method's assumptions.
