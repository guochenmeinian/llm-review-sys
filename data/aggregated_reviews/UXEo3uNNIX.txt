### Key Points
This paper presents the Coupled Mamba model, which aims to enhance multi-modal data fusion by coupling state chains of different modalities while preserving intra-modality independence. The authors propose a state transition scheme that facilitates information exchange and a global convolution kernel for efficient parallelization. The framework is evaluated on three multi-modal sentiment analysis datasets: CMU-MOSEI, CH-SIMS, and CH-SIMSV2, demonstrating improved performance over existing methods and reduced GPU memory usage. The authors acknowledge that Coupled Mamba consumes more memory while maintaining similar inference speed compared to Mamba Fusion and naive adaptation methods. They argue that the minimal accuracy improvement observed in the CMU-MOSEI dataset is due to its short sequences, asserting that their approach is more effective for longer sequences, as demonstrated by results from other datasets like CH-SIMS, BRCA, and MM-IMDB.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method effectively couples state chains, maintaining intra-modality independence, which is a novel approach.
2. Coupled Mamba shows significant performance improvements over naive methods, particularly for longer sequences.
3. The model exhibits good performance and efficiency compared to existing works, particularly in memory usage.
4. The authors provide detailed mathematical derivations of the coupled state transition process and comparative results across multiple datasets, demonstrating the model's efficacy.

Weaknesses:
1. The demonstration of parallelism lacks clarity, particularly regarding how it integrates with Mamba's scanning process.
2. The interaction scheme for modality fusion is overly simplistic, potentially failing to capture complex interactions.
3. The paper does not adequately compare with existing multi-modal Mamba models, limiting the context for its contributions.
4. Increased memory consumption may limit practical applications, and the initial conclusions regarding memory and speed were misleading and require clarification.
5. Some references are incomplete, and there are inconsistencies in the presentation of algorithms and equations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the parallelism demonstration, specifically how it relates to Mamba's scanning process. Additionally, consider enhancing the complexity of the interaction scheme to better model modality interactions. A comprehensive comparison with existing multi-modal Mamba models should be included to contextualize the contributions. Furthermore, ensure that all references are complete and consistently formatted, and address the inconsistencies in the presentation of algorithms and equations. Lastly, we recommend clarifying the conclusions regarding efficiency and performance, particularly correcting any misleading points about memory and speed.
