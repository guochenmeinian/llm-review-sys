### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the average-link approach for clustering in metric spaces, focusing on cohesion and separability criteria that enhance interpretability compared to Dasgupta's cost function. The authors establish previously unknown bounds on the quality of clusterings derived from average-link, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing well-separated clusters. Empirical results support the theoretical findings, indicating that average-link often outperforms single-linkage and complete-linkage methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors rigorously analyze average-link properties and provide mathematical proofs for their claims.
- The work establishes significant bounds on clustering quality concerning cohesion and separability.
- The extensive empirical analysis corroborates theoretical results, demonstrating practical effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The technical nature of the work may hinder understanding for readers not well-versed in mathematics.
- The paper lacks a discussion of alternative clustering methods beyond complete-linkage and single-linkage, limiting comparative insights.
- Empirical results are somewhat opaque due to averaging across datasets; presenting results on a per-dataset basis would enhance clarity.
- Some empirical results appear inconsistent with theoretical predictions, raising questions about average-link's performance in certain scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the accessibility of the paper by providing a less technical summary of key points for broader comprehension. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion of other clustering methods to contextualize average-link's performance. Presenting empirical results on a per-dataset basis would enhance transparency. Finally, addressing the discrepancies between empirical and theoretical results would strengthen the paper's conclusions.
