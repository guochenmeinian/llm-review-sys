Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel activation mechanism called Dual-Perspective Activation (DPA) aimed at identifying and denoising irrelevant channels in artificial neural networks (ANNs). The DPA employs criteria established from both forward and backward propagation perspectives, effectively enhancing the performance of the neural network by eliminating interference from irrelevant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DPA is parameterless, fast, and outperforms existing activation methods across various ANN architectures and tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is meticulously crafted with a well-structured presentation.
- The motivation is grounded in a thorough exploration of ANN activation mechanisms.
- The combination of forward and backward perspectives for real-time channel evaluation is novel and valid.
- The theoretical foundations and experimental validations are comprehensive.
- DPA shows versatility across various tasks and domains, including both vision and non-vision tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The justification for the intersection operation as the sole channel selection method is unclear.
- Additional evidence is needed to support claims regarding channel responses and their relevance.
- The impact of applying DPA to different layers of CNNs has not been explored in depth.
- The investigation of the momentum parameter $m$ in Figure 6 lacks thorough analysis and justification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the intersection operation as the only suitable channel selection approach. Additionally, please provide more evidence to support the claim regarding the irrelevance of other channels in Lines 105-107. We suggest exploring the effects of applying DPA to various layers of the CNN and providing a detailed explanation for the choice of the last block in Lines 198-199. Furthermore, a more thorough investigation into the momentum parameter $m$ and its impact on model performance should be included. Lastly, consider discussing the pros and cons of sparse representation in more detail, as it may not always be beneficial for all datasets.
