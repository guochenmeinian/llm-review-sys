### Key Points
This paper presents a curriculum learning approach for text graphs, hypothesizing that graph and text complexity influence the learning process. The authors propose a training scheduler that selects graph/text complexity indices to enhance learning in each epoch, demonstrating that both text and graph complexity indices are beneficial, with text indices being more frequently utilized. The study evaluates the difficulty of data samples using various complexity indices and employs a competence function to introduce training samples gradually.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed training scheduler is generalizable to other curriculum learning scenarios, showcasing novelty in utilizing various complexity indices.
2. The paper conducts sufficient experiments on node classification and link prediction datasets, analyzing the importance of different indices during training.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation for focusing on text graphs is unclear, and the research gap regarding the necessity of a new curriculum learning method is not justified.
2. Several parameters in the formulas are inadequately explained, and the connection between the proposed method and text graph tasks lacks clarity.
3. The experimental results show that some recent methods do not outperform the No-CL method, raising questions about the fairness of the experimental settings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for using text graphs and explicitly discuss the research gaps that necessitate their approach. Additionally, the authors should provide a theoretical analysis or empirical experiments to guide the choice of function \( f \) in Equations 7-11. We suggest revising Section 2.3 and Algorithm 1 for better comprehensibility and ensuring that all parameters in the formulas are thoroughly explained. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify how the proposed method enables the transferability of learned curricula and to address the discrepancies in performance compared to recent baselines in their experimental results.
