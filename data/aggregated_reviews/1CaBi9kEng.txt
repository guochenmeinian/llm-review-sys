### Key Points
This paper presents a model for generating synthetic eye movements on text using a discrete diffusion model, achieving performance that surpasses human capabilities. The authors propose a method that incorporates scan paths into the input representation learning process, demonstrating state-of-the-art results compared to baseline models. The methodological contributions are significant, and the experimental evidence supports the main claims, indicating potential applications in cognitive research areas such as readability and sentiment analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- Establishes a new state-of-the-art in generating human-like eye movements.  
- The paper is well-written, with clear motivation and interesting analyses, including a psycholinguistic examination of the generated scanpaths.  
- The experimental results are robust and support the claims made regarding the model's performance.  

Weaknesses:  
- There is a lack of qualitative comparisons with previous methods, particularly regarding how the ScanDL model differs from earlier diffusion models.  
- The diversity of readers in the training set is unclear, raising questions about the model's generalizability across different reading patterns.  
- The concept of multi-modality is not well-defined, and the handling of scanpaths during inference requires further clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including qualitative comparisons with previous methods to elucidate the strengths and differences of the ScanDL model. Additionally, providing a clearer explanation of the diversity of readers in the training set and how scanpaths are initialized during inference would enhance the paper's clarity and robustness. Further exploration of the implications of multi-modality in the context of the model would also be beneficial.
