Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Gaussian process (GP)-based method for predicting outcomes of physical simulations under varying geometries and parameters, alongside a comparison of accuracy estimators for lift and drag coefficients (CL and CD) using four models from the airfRANS dataset and the authors' proposed MMGP model. The authors propose a deterministic pre-processing technique that aligns meshes of different structures onto a common mesh, facilitating effective comparison of function values. The method utilizes PCA for dimensionality reduction and operates on reduced representations, enabling the quantification of prediction uncertainty and identification of unreliable model predictions. The authors recomputed CL and CD by integrating wall shear stress and pressure fields, achieving results coherent with those from the airfRANS dataset. Performance metrics indicate that MMGP outperforms the other models in terms of relative errors and Spearman’s correlation for both CL and CD.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed GP-based method is novel, effectively combining mesh interpolation and morphing to facilitate comparisons between differently structured meshes.
2. The deterministic nature of the operations reduces variability, requiring fewer examples to train robust models.
3. The use of GP allows for easy quantification of uncertainty in predictions, which is a significant advantage over deep learning approaches.
4. The MMGP model demonstrates superior performance metrics compared to the baseline models, indicating its effectiveness as an alternative approach.
5. The authors provide a clear methodology for recomputing CL and CD, ensuring coherence with existing results.
6. The paper is well-written, clearly explaining complex methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The predictions made by ML-based methods, including this one, are not as accurate as traditional simulations and should be presented as initialization tools.
2. The introduction lacks clarity regarding the computational expense and discretization needs of the proposed method, which also requires good discretization for effective predictions.
3. Certain technical aspects, such as handling arbitrary rigid body transformations and the meaning of specific terms, need better clarification.
4. The authors do not account for the Jacobian of coordinate transformations during morphing, which could affect the comparability of values on the common mesh.
5. The method relies on a smoothness assumption that may not hold for all problems, necessitating discussion.
6. The paper lacks a comprehensive set of metrics for the third dataset, which could enhance the evaluation of the model's performance.
7. There is a minor inconsistency in the notation for Spearman’s correlation that needs correction.
8. Figure 8 presents absolute errors instead of the recommended relative errors.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction by explicitly stating the limitations of their predictions compared to traditional methods. Additionally, the authors should clarify how they handle arbitrary rigid body transformations and define any ambiguous terms. It is crucial to address the Jacobian of coordinate transformations in their methodology to ensure the comparability of values on the common mesh. The authors should also discuss the implications of the smoothness assumption in their approach. Furthermore, we suggest improving the inclusion of additional metrics for the third dataset in future revisions to provide a more thorough evaluation. Lastly, please revise the notation for Spearman’s correlation to reflect $\rho_{D}$ and $\rho_{L}$, and consider revising Figure 8 to include relative errors as opposed to absolute errors for better representation of the results.
