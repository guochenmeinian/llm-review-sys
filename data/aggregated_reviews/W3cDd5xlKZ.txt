Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a fair Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) algorithm aimed at addressing fairness issues associated with sensitive attributes. The authors propose two algorithms, MF-CCA and SF-CCA, optimized using gradient descent on Stiefel manifolds, which theoretically guarantee convergence. The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms in reducing unfairness while maintaining accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- It is the first work addressing unfairness in CCA, potentially marking a significant milestone.
- The fairness metric, Correlation Disparity Error, is well-defined and aligns with general fairness notions.
- The algorithms are theoretically sound, with clear roles: MF-CCA minimizes CCA error and unfairness losses simultaneously, while SF-CCA controls the trade-off between these losses.
- Empirical validation on both synthetic and real datasets supports the proposed methods.

Weaknesses:
- There is no theoretical guarantee for fairness; demonstrating low $\mathcal{E}^{k} (U, V)$ for the solutions to equations 7 and 9 would enhance novelty.
- A visualization, such as Pareto-front lines, would better illustrate SF-CCA's trade-off control.
- The paper lacks detailed metrics for measuring unfairness and does not compare the proposed framework with existing methods.
- The focus is limited to two modalities in CCA, with no discussion on extending to multiple modalities.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical framework by providing guarantees for fairness in the proposed algorithms. Including a visualization like Pareto-front lines would enhance the understanding of SF-CCA's capabilities. Additionally, a more detailed discussion on the metrics used to measure unfairness and a comparison with existing fairness-aware CCA methods would improve transparency. Finally, addressing the potential for extending the methods to multiple modalities would broaden the applicability of the research.
