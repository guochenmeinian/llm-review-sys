Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for incremental object-discovery in 3D semantic instance segmentation, allowing users to label previously unknown objects in each iteration. The authors propose a framework that includes an unknown object identifier and various strategies, such as probability correction and exemplar replay, to enhance performance. The evaluation is conducted on ScanNet200, introducing three new splits/tasks and measuring multiple metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The approach has significant practical implications, enabling training on labeled data and allowing user input for refining the model.  
- The paper is the first to address the open-world 3D instance segmentation task, proposing well-motivated modules to improve performance.  
- The experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, and the splitting mechanism for the dataset is reasonable.

Weaknesses:  
- The manuscript is often unclear, making it difficult to understand the method, especially for first-time readers.  
- Key terms and concepts, such as "auto-labeler" and "class prototype," are introduced without adequate explanation, leading to confusion.  
- The paper lacks a comprehensive evaluation of existing 2D methods, which could provide valuable context and comparisons.  
- There is insufficient discussion of limitations and potential societal impacts related to the proposed methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the manuscript by addressing the numerous points of confusion highlighted in the reviews. Specifically, please clarify the distinction between the methods 3D-OWIS-PC-CT and 3D-OWIS, and ensure that all key terms are defined upon their first mention. Additionally, we suggest including a preliminary section on the baseline framework to enhance understanding. It would also be beneficial to compare the proposed methods with established 2D open-world techniques to contextualize the contributions better. Finally, we encourage the authors to discuss the limitations of their approach and any potential societal impacts more thoroughly.
