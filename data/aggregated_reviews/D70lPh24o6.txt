### Key Points
This paper presents the SpanEx dataset, which comprises over 7000 instances annotated for span interactions in natural language understanding tasks, specifically focusing on the SNLI and FEVER datasets. The annotations illustrate how text spans interact to inform classification decisions, with pairs labeled as synonyms, hypernyms, or antonyms. The authors investigate whether fine-tuned LLMs exhibit similar reasoning processes as humans by analyzing their decision-making regarding span-level interactions. The paper also proposes a novel community detection-based method for generating interaction explanations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The SpanEx dataset is a valuable resource for evaluating interaction explanations in complex LLM-based NLU systems, boasting high inter-annotator agreement.
- The paper provides insightful findings on the reasoning mechanisms of current models, highlighting discrepancies between human and model decision-making.
- The writing is clear and accessible to a technical audience.

Weaknesses:
- The criteria for segmenting spans and the implications of high-level versus low-level spans are inadequately explained, leading to potential confusion.
- Evaluation techniques, particularly the use of feature selection and removal, may not effectively compare span interaction explanations, raising concerns about the robustness of findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the dataset construction process, particularly regarding span segmentation criteria and the definitions of high-level and low-level spans. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explore alternative evaluation methods, such as removing attention from the Transformer architecture or conditionally removing tokens, to better assess the significance of span interactions. It would also be beneficial to include relevant prior works in the related literature section to provide context for the SpanEx dataset. Finally, addressing the ambiguities in the notation and definitions throughout the paper will enhance reader comprehension.
