### Key Points
This paper presents gLM, a genomic foundation model capable of capturing functional and regulatory information in the biological domain. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- gLM effectively captures essential biological information.  
- The qualitative results in Figures 2-4 are intriguing.  

Weaknesses:  
- The subfigures in Figure 2 require further improvement.  
- There is a need for a more in-depth analysis, particularly regarding the co-regulation aspect.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the subfigures in Figure 2 and conduct a more thorough analysis of the co-regulation part to enhance the depth of the findings presented.
