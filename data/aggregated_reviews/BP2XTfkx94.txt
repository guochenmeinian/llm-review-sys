### Key Points
This paper presents the $k$-clique $\tau$-cover problem, a generalization of the vertex cover problem, aimed at efficiently covering $k$-cliques in large-scale graphs. The authors prove the problem is NP-hard and propose a scalable hierarchical algorithm with $O(k \cdot m)$ complexity, which avoids explicit $k$-clique enumeration. The algorithm incorporates pruning techniques like core number and graph coloring to enhance efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in runtime and cover size compared to existing methods, indicating its potential for applications such as group-buying advertising.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The $k$-clique $\tau$-cover problem offers a novel perspective on high-order graph structures in large-scale graph mining.
2. The proposed hierarchical algorithm is highly scalable and effectively avoids $k$-clique enumeration.
3. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show significant performance improvements, underscoring the algorithm's practical relevance.

Weaknesses:
1. The hierarchical approach and pruning strategies rely on established techniques, limiting methodological innovation.
2. The paper lacks a thorough theoretical analysis of the algorithm's approximation guarantees or performance bounds.
3. The presentation quality is not optimal, making it difficult to follow, and the scalability analysis is insufficient.
4. The handling of edge cases and memory constraints in billion-scale applications is inadequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation to enhance reader comprehension. Additionally, a more detailed scalability analysis should be included in the experiments. We suggest that the authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the algorithm's approximation guarantees and performance bounds. It would also be beneficial to clarify the relationship among KCCB, KCC, and KTCC, and to include comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms in the experimental results. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore the algorithm's performance on various graph structures and to provide insights into the dynamic version of the problem, ensuring that all relevant discussions are included in the main text rather than relegated to the appendix.
