### Key Points
This paper investigates the use of search engines to obtain datasets from social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit, particularly in light of recent API access restrictions. The authors propose that while search engines can provide alternative data sources, their findings indicate that such datasets are biased and incomplete compared to API data. The paper is novel and relevant, especially for the Computational Social Science community, as it analyzes large-scale datasets across multiple platforms and examines various aspects such as popularity, topics, and sentiment.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The work addresses a timely and significant issue in data collection for social media research.
2. It utilizes large-scale datasets from both Twitter and Reddit.
3. The analysis covers multiple dimensions, including popularity, topics, and sentiment.
4. The employed methods are appropriate for the analysis.

Weaknesses:
1. The sentiment analysis method lacks validation across the two platforms.
2. It is unclear whether differences in results are due to pagination on Google or content moderation policies.
3. The Twitter dataset is limited to COVID-19-related content, raising questions about its impact on findings.
4. The analysis of Reddit lacks depth, particularly in subreddit-level coverage, which could provide valuable insights.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the validation of the sentiment analysis tool across both platforms by conducting a small-scale validation on a random sample of posts from Reddit and Twitter. Additionally, we suggest a deeper analysis to clarify whether the observed lack of coverage in SERP data is due to pagination or differing moderation policies. The authors should also discuss the limitations of focusing solely on COVID-19-related tweets and consider expanding their analysis to include a more diverse Twitter dataset. Furthermore, we encourage a more thorough subreddit-specific analysis to identify potential coverage differences across subreddits. Lastly, addressing the concerns regarding the sampling methodology for SERP queries and its implications on the study's conclusions would strengthen the paper.
