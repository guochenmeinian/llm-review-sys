### Key Points
This paper presents the ACME Authz Cache Attack, which exploits vulnerabilities in the ACME protocol, allowing attackers to obtain fake certificates by leveraging compromised account credentials and cached authorization records without domain revalidation. The authors propose ACME++, an enhanced protocol designed to mitigate this attack by binding a clientâ€™s IP address and a unique identifier to the ACME account, requiring revalidation for every certificate request. The work identifies a significant vulnerability in widely adopted protocols and offers a practical solution.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-structured, progressing logically from problem identification to solution evaluation.  
- It effectively introduces a critical attack and demonstrates its significance through real-world evaluation.  
- The writing is clear, with well-explained technical details and figures supporting the narrative.  

Weaknesses:  
- The threat model is unclear and relies on strong assumptions about the attacker's capabilities, particularly regarding the leakage of ACME account credentials.  
- The experimental evaluation of ACME++ is superficial and lacks comprehensive data to support its claims.  
- The proposed modifications to the protocol may face adoption challenges due to required changes in existing CA workflows.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the threat model, particularly how the attacker can obtain account credentials while having only a standard Internet connection. Additionally, we suggest expanding the experimental evaluation to provide more comprehensive data supporting the claims about ACME++. It would also be beneficial to demonstrate the compatibility of ACME++ with existing CA configurations more clearly. Finally, we urge the authors to address the ethical considerations regarding responsible disclosure to affected CAs.
