### Key Points
This paper presents a framework, StructPosGSSL, that integrates structural and positional information to enhance Graph Self-Supervised Learning (GSSL). The authors propose a new GNN model, GenHopNet, which employs a k-hop message-passing mechanism to improve the expressiveness of graph representations and distinguish non-isomorphic graphs. The experimental results suggest that StructPosGSSL significantly enhances GSSL's ability to differentiate graphs with similar local structures but differing global topologies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation for integrating structural and positional information is clear and well-articulated.
2. Extensive experiments are conducted, demonstrating the proposed method's effectiveness in various contexts.
3. The writing is generally clear and concise, with a logical flow throughout the paper.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the idea is limited, as it combines existing components and does not introduce significantly new concepts.
2. The experimental results are underwhelming, with the proposed method performing worse in several cases compared to existing methods.
3. The baseline methods used in experiments are outdated, lacking comparisons with recent state-of-the-art approaches.
4. The organization of the paper is suboptimal, focusing more on the GNN architecture than on the SSL framework, which appears to contribute less.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their contributions by incorporating more recent state-of-the-art methods in their comparisons. Additionally, the authors should provide a clearer organization of the paper, ensuring that the SSL framework is given adequate emphasis relative to the GNN architecture. We suggest including a comprehensive ablation study that demonstrates the necessity of each component in StructPosGSSL, as well as addressing the questions raised regarding the effectiveness of the positional and structural modules. Finally, conducting experiments on larger datasets, such as MoleculeNet, would strengthen the validation of their proposed method.
