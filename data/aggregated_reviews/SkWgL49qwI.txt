### Key Points
This paper presents a recurrent neural network model augmented with a self-attention module for human-like sentence processing, focusing on expectation- and cue-based serial processing. The authors demonstrate that both surprisal and memory interference aid in predicting semantic or grammatical agreement violations. The CBRNN model integrates forward-looking expectation and backward-looking memory constraints, showing that it can partially replicate human processing behaviors in controlled sentence experiments. The model's attention and surprisal metrics reflect human processing difficulty, particularly in subject-verb agreement contexts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of expectation- and cue-based serial processing is a significant contribution.
- The experimental design is well-controlled, providing positive results that suggest the model can replicate human sentence processing behavior.
- The theoretical motivation is clear, addressing limitations in prior work and appealing to psycholinguists and cognitive scientists.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks comparisons with baseline models, such as multi-head attention Transformers, which would contextualize the contributions of the proposed models.
- The focus on subject-verb agreement may limit the model's generalizability, and the writing contains typos and structural issues that hinder readability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper's organization to enhance clarity and focus, addressing the identified typos and grammatical errors. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with baseline models, such as multi-head attention Transformers, to better contextualize the results. Expanding the evaluation to include other dependencies associated with cue-based retrieval would also strengthen the model's generalizability. Finally, we encourage the authors to ensure that all data and methods are publicly available to facilitate reproducibility.
