Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a constant regret learning algorithm for linear MDPs, achieving an instance-dependent regret that is independent of the number of episodes. The authors propose a modified version of LSVI-UCB, incorporating a careful quantization technique and action elimination, which leads to tighter regret guarantees compared to previous works. The algorithm is robust to model mispecification and does not require prior knowledge of the level of mispecification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The method is robust to model mispecification and does not require prior knowledge of it.
2. The regret guarantee is tighter than in previous works.
3. The algorithm runs in polynomial time concerning the problem parameters.
4. The work addresses significant technical challenges, particularly in quantization and refining the regret bound analysis.

Weaknesses:
1. The improvement over logarithmic dependence on $K$ may not be substantial, and the polynomial dependence on other parameters remains unclear.
2. The algorithm's complexity increases significantly, raising questions about the necessity of certain modifications, such as the combination of bonuses, action elimination, and sample rejection.
3. The dependence on the worst-case gap weakens the results, and achieving a better dependence on the average inverse gap is questioned.
4. The writing contains inconsistencies and grammatical issues, affecting clarity.
5. The algorithm's explanation lacks clarity, particularly regarding bonuses, action elimination, and sample rejection.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the algorithm's explanation, particularly regarding the roles of bonuses, action elimination, and sample rejection. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed discussion on how the modifications contribute to eliminating the logarithmic dependence on $K$. It would also be beneficial to clarify the notation used in the algorithms and ensure consistent terminology throughout the paper. Finally, we encourage the authors to include experimental results to validate the theoretical claims and enhance the paper's impact.
