Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Water-wave Information Transmission and Recurrent Acceleration Network (WITRAN) framework, which addresses long-range time series forecasting by capturing both short- and long-term recurrent patterns through bi-granular information transmission. The authors utilize a Horizontal Vertical Gated Selective Unit (HVGSU) to model temporal information and a recurrent acceleration network (RAN) to enhance computational efficiency. Experimental results indicate that WITRAN outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in time series forecasting.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The logic and presentation of the paper are clear and easy to follow.
2. The focus on a significant and appealing problem in time series forecasting is commendable.
3. The proposed model demonstrates superior performance compared to transformer-based models and includes advanced baselines for comparison.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks comparisons with previous RNN-based models, such as ConvLSTM and PredRNN, which are necessary for a comprehensive evaluation.
2. There are minor typographical errors that should be corrected, such as "semantic information include" which should be "semantic information includes."
3. The rationale for the water-wave structure's necessity in long-range forecasting is not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors include additional experiments, such as robustness checks, to further evaluate the performance of the WITRAN framework. It is also suggested that the authors compare their model with more RNN-based methods to strengthen their claims. Additionally, we encourage the authors to clarify the decision-making process regarding the parameters R and C in the model and to provide a more detailed explanation of the advantages of WITRAN over other forecasting models. Finally, we advise careful proofreading to eliminate minor errors and enhance overall clarity.
