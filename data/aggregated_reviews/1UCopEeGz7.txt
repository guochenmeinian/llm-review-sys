### Key Points
This paper presents an approach for continual relation learning in language models, specifically utilizing a LLM to generate rationales for learning relations. The method consists of two stages: training a language model on rationale-enhanced samples and further training on contrastive examples from memory. Empirical results indicate improvements over baselines on the FewRel and TACRED datasets, particularly for similar relations. The paper also discusses the effectiveness of rationale-tuning and the value of LLMs in augmenting data for relation extraction tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper demonstrates the application of rationale-tuning for continual relation learning and provides clear explanations of the methodology.
- Empirical results show improvements over baseline models, and the paper includes ablation studies that highlight the importance of both stages of the method.

Weaknesses:
- Improvements over existing models are modest, and a stronger argument for the method's effectiveness could be made with additional analysis of specific cases and trends.
- There is a lack of analysis regarding the quality of generated rationales, and the methodology would benefit from clarity on post-processing steps.
- The ablation analysis is incomplete, and the paper does not provide sufficient details about experimental results, including statistical analysis of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the method's effectiveness by providing additional context on specific cases where the method excels and identifying trends in model performance. Clarifying the quality of generated rationales and including details about any post-processing steps would enhance the methodology's soundness. Additionally, we suggest completing the ablation analysis to include tasks based on contrastive rationales and providing more statistical details, such as standard deviations or confidence intervals, to support the experimental results. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the relationship between the performance of GPT-3.5 and its role in providing supervision for the model.
