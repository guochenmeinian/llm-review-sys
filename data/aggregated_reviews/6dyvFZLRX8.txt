### Key Points
This paper presents a multi-dataset multi-model approach for estimating the percentage of bots in Twitter communities, utilizing user metadata, derived features, written text, and network structure. The authors propose the BotPercent model, which integrates various architectures for different input types, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to the TwiBot-22 benchmark. The study investigates bot ratios across diverse Twitter communities, including those related to celebrities and content moderation polls.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work achieves state-of-the-art performance in bot detection across evaluated communities and datasets.
- A comprehensive range of features, models, and tools are employed, enhancing the reliability of the bot detector.
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with quality figures and tables.
- The investigation into various Twitter communities provides valuable insights.

Weaknesses:
- The paper is excessively long, with critical discussions relegated to the Appendix, and suffers from repetition and verbose language.
- Clarity is lacking regarding the individual performance of BotPercent in detecting bots within specific communities.
- The definition of "community" is ambiguous, and the potential for data leakage in the training dataset is not addressed.
- Certain architectural design considerations and the rationale behind feature selection are insufficiently explained.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the community definitions used in the evaluation set and address potential data leakage between training and evaluation datasets. Additionally, we suggest including a detailed analysis of BotPercent's individual bot detection performance across communities to clarify the accuracy of the overall bot percentage. An ablation study could be beneficial to explore the impact of different user features and model architectures. Finally, we encourage the authors to expand the related work section to incorporate more recent literature in the data mining field.
