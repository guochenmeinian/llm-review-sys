Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework, Garner, for learning road network representations by integrating both the Third Law of Geography and the First Law of Geography. The authors propose a graph contrastive learning approach that utilizes geographic configuration-aware graph augmentation and spectral negative sampling. The method employs both positive and negative samples to enhance model performance, specifically through the design of negative samples inspired by the sparsest cut problem and optimized via spectral graph sparsification. Experimental results on datasets from Singapore and New York City demonstrate significant performance improvements in downstream tasks, including road function prediction, traffic inference, and visual road retrieval. The use of street view images (SVIs) is emphasized for their comprehensive coverage and ability to provide meaningful information across diverse urban regions, accommodating scenarios where spatial proximity and geographic configuration yield differing similarity results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a novel application of the Third Law of Geography, providing a fresh perspective in geographic information systems.
2. The methodology is robust, with thorough theoretical grounding and comprehensive empirical evaluation.
3. The authors effectively utilize contrastive learning principles, enhancing representation learning through the design of both positive and negative samples.
4. The use of SVIs provides extensive coverage and valuable insights into geographic configurations, addressing limitations of traditional points of interest (POIs).
5. The authors demonstrate awareness of scalability issues and incorporate sampling techniques, enhancing efficacy in large-scale road networks.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the ideas is limited, as geographic configuration has been modeled in prior studies on urban computing.
2. The paper lacks detailed explanations of the Third Law's significance in road network representation learning and the spectral negative sampling method, which may be challenging for non-experts.
3. The experimental design does not include case studies demonstrating the practical implementation of the proposed method, relying solely on metrics without intuitive results.
4. The method may struggle in scenarios with limited or contaminated street view data, potentially affecting robustness.
5. Concerns were raised regarding the novelty of the approach and its scalability, particularly in relation to the effectiveness of the proposed loss function.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanations of the Third Law of Geography's significance in road network representation learning by providing more examples or case studies. Additionally, the authors should clarify the spectral negative sampling technique to enhance understanding for non-experts. We also suggest including more intuitive results and discussions in the experiments to illustrate the implications of the Third Law on representations. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors address potential challenges associated with limited street view data to improve the robustness of the proposed method. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide further experimental results to substantiate claims about scalability and the effectiveness of their loss function in capturing both shared and exclusive information.
