Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a search space transfer learning method based on Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), termed MCTS-transfer, aimed at enhancing optimization in computationally expensive black-box problems. The authors propose a hierarchical search space division that utilizes data from source tasks to evaluate node values, dynamically adjusting the similarity between source and target tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness across various scenarios, including comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of MCTS with search space transfer learning is a novel approach that addresses convergence issues in black-box optimization.
- The paper is well-structured and generally easy to understand, with a clear presentation of methodology and results.
- Extensive empirical evaluation and detailed ablation studies support the claims made by the authors.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks sufficient technical depth regarding the mechanics of MCTS-transfer, particularly in how MCTS divides and selects subspaces.
- There is minimal theoretical analysis supporting the method's efficacy, which could be strengthened with rigorous proofs or justifications.
- The experimental validation does not adequately address comparative baselines, and the choice of baselines is limited.
- Insufficient discussion on the adaptability and scalability of MCTS-transfer to different problem domains and the potential computational overhead is noted.
- Key implementation details, parameter settings, and code availability for reproducibility are lacking.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the technical depth by providing clearer explanations of how MCTS iteratively divides and selects subspaces. Additionally, a more rigorous theoretical analysis should be included to support the method's efficacy. It would be beneficial to expand the discussion on comparative baselines and include more recent advancements in the field. We suggest addressing the potential computational overhead and providing a comprehensive discussion on the limitations of MCTS-transfer. Furthermore, ensuring reproducibility by including key implementation details and making the code and dataset publicly available is essential. Lastly, we recommend analyzing the algorithm's running time and computational cost, particularly in large and complex search spaces.
