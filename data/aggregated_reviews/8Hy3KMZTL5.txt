### Key Points
This paper presents H-CLIP, a novel framework for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation utilizing the CLIP model. The framework addresses three main challenges: high computational cost, misalignment between CLIP's image and text modalities, and reduced generalization on unseen categories during pixel-level predictions. H-CLIP employs a symmetrical parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy in hyperspherical space, utilizing efficient block-diagonal learnable transformation matrices and a dual cross-relation communication module to resolve misalignment issues. An orthogonality constraint based on the hyperspherical energy principle is also applied to the text encoder to maintain the model's generalization ability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of H-CLIP represents a significant innovation in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.
- The symmetrical PEFT strategy in hyperspherical space is a unique approach to fine-tuning vision-language models.
- Extensive experimental results across benchmarks like ADE20K and PASCAL demonstrate H-CLIP's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Weaknesses:
- Formula 5 lacks clarity on how to interact with the \boldsymbol{R} matrix.
- Insufficient evidence or references are provided to support the claim that current fine-tuning strategies are asymmetrical.
- The paper does not adequately analyze how misalignment affects segmentation performance.
- There is a lack of qualitative comparisons with existing methods, making it unclear where improvements arise.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Formula 5 by specifying interactions with the \boldsymbol{R} matrix. Additionally, the authors should provide empirical evidence or references to substantiate the claim regarding asymmetrical fine-tuning strategies. A more in-depth discussion on the impact of misalignment on segmentation performance is necessary. Furthermore, the authors should include a comparison with SAM (Segment Anything) to highlight the significance of their work. Lastly, we suggest that the authors analyze the limitations of their fine-tuning strategy and explore its applicability to other tasks beyond open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.
