Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a computationally efficient algorithm for identifying sets of variables that minimize intervention costs, enabling the identification of causal effects from observational data. The authors connect the minimum-cost intervention design (MCID) problem to well-known problems like weighted maximum satisfiability (WPMAX-SAT) and integer linear programming, allowing for the use of advanced solvers to reduce computational complexity. They propose a reduction of the MCID problem to a single instance of WPMAX-SAT, contrasting with the exponential instances required by previous methods. The numerical experiments demonstrate significant improvements in efficiency, with speedup ratios reaching up to 1,000,000 for small instances and extrapolated potential speedups of at least 100,000,000 for larger instances. The authors clarify that their SAT formulation scales quadratically with respect to the number of districts, while the previous method's complexity grows super-exponentially.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The research addresses a practical and significant problem, with empirical evidence supporting the proposed method.
2. The writing is grounded in theoretical analysis, and the notations are well explained.
3. The proposed method demonstrates significant speed improvements over existing approaches, as evidenced by empirical data.
4. The authors provide a clear theoretical foundation for their claims regarding complexity and performance.
5. The experiments indicate a substantial efficiency improvement over existing studies, showing responsiveness to reviewer feedback.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper contains misleading statements and inaccuracies regarding prior work and definitions of concepts, such as the definition of "district" and "hedge hull."
2. The presentation lacks clarity, particularly in exemplifying the SAT Construction Procedure and omitting important results in the supplementary material.
3. The contribution is presented ambiguously, suggesting that the NP-hard problem has been solved when only heuristic methods are provided.
4. Some justifications for claims are dispersed throughout the manuscript, potentially obscuring the strength of the authors' arguments.
5. The distinction between maximal and non-maximal districts is not initially clear, which may confuse readers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the accuracy of statements regarding prior works and ensure proper definitions of key concepts to avoid misleading readers. Additionally, we suggest providing more detailed examples of the SAT Construction Procedure within the main text to enhance comprehension. A discussion section should be added to guide users on selecting appropriate reformulations for specific problems, along with a thorough analysis of the time complexity of the proposed heuristic algorithm. We also recommend consolidating the justifications for their claims into a dedicated section to clearly articulate the advantages of their approach over Akbari et al. (2022). Finally, we encourage the authors to evaluate their methods using real-world datasets to strengthen the validation of their approach and to ensure that the discussion of complexity is highlighted more effectively, as it represents a significant contribution of the paper.
