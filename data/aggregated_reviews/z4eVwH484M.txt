Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method called MapUnveiler, aimed at enhancing vectorized HD map construction for autonomous driving by leveraging temporal information across adjacent input frames. The authors propose a clip-based approach that includes intra-clip and inter-clip unveiler modules to effectively unveil occluded map elements using clip tokens. Experimental results on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly in challenging scenarios with heavy occlusions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The incorporation of clip-level information for online HD mapping aligns well with human driving behavior and improves occlusion handling.
2. MapUnveiler achieves state-of-the-art results across various experimental settings, especially in large and highly-occluded scenes.
3. Extensive ablation studies provide clarity on the contributions of hyper-parameters and model components.

Weaknesses:
1. The method description lacks clarity, making it difficult to fully understand the architecture. Key sections, such as the Inter-clip Unveiler and loss formulation, are not self-contained and assume familiarity with prior works like TTM and MapTRv2.
2. There is insufficient detail on pre-training and fine-tuning processes, raising concerns about the fairness of comparisons with other methods.
3. The main comparison results are incomplete, lacking long-schedule results that could demonstrate consistent performance across fully converged methods.
4. Misinterpretations regarding training epochs of previous methods may mislead readers about the significance of the results.
5. The venues listed in the main table are inaccurate, and relevant recent works are omitted from the discussion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method description by providing comprehensive details on the Inter-clip Unveiler and loss formulation, ensuring that all components are adequately explained. Additionally, the authors should clarify the pre-training and fine-tuning processes to ensure fair comparisons with other methods. We suggest including long-schedule results in the main comparison table to validate the performance claims. Furthermore, please correct any inaccuracies regarding training epochs and ensure that all relevant works are discussed in the paper. Lastly, a thorough proofreading is necessary to address typographical errors throughout the manuscript.
