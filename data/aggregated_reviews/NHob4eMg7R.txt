Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a dataset and framework for annotating dense 3D indoor scenes, introducing SCRREAM, which involves scanning individual objects, registering them to scenes, and generating realistic synthetic images. The authors benchmark their approach using eleven example scenes, demonstrating its potential utility for SLAM and NVS tasks. However, the dataset's originality is questioned, as it does not address specific challenges in the field, such as environmental diversity and practical application issues.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors demonstrate commendable diligence in data capturing and have rigorously tested the dataset against baseline metrics.
- SCRREAM offers a detailed pipeline that ensures high-quality annotations by mitigating issues with incomplete meshes.
- The framework is versatile, adaptable to various indoor perception tasks, and has benchmarked several novel view synthesis works.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset lacks diversity, with only eleven scenes that do not fully represent real-world complexity.
- The initial manual registration step may introduce human error, and the evaluation does not adequately cover diverse experimental settings.
- The dataset does not address significant challenges faced in dynamic real-world settings, such as lighting changes or degeneracy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset's diversity by including a wider range of environments and consider mixed reality approaches for larger spaces. Automating the registration process could enhance the pipeline's robustness and efficiency. Additionally, expanding the number of scenes and conducting more detailed studies on various experimental settings would strengthen the evaluation. It is crucial to provide a visual comparison with existing datasets like Replica and ReplicaCAD to clarify the advantages of the proposed dataset. Finally, the authors should include detailed sensor calibration information in the supplementary material to address technical concerns.
