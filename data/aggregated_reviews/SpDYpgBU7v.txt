### Key Points
This paper presents a well-formulated optimization strategy for Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) processes using Targeted Adaptive Design (TAD). The authors propose a Gaussian Process (GP)-based probabilistic framework that enhances the quality of predictions, particularly in noisy environments, and demonstrates improved efficiency in determining optimal control parameters compared to existing methods like Bayesian Optimization and Expert Systems Optimization. The methodology is sound, clearly articulated, and supported by effective visual aids. However, the originality of the method is somewhat limited as it applies an existing algorithm to a well-defined problem.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The application of TAD for optimizing ALD is innovative and shows promising results with fewer cycles.
- The paper is well-written and easy to read, with a solid theoretical foundation in probabilistic machine learning.

Weaknesses:
- The exploration of the method's limitations in lower-noise environments is insufficient.
- The scalability of TAD for more complex ALD systems requires further investigation.
- The paper lacks a thorough statistical analysis of the optimization performance across different noise levels and does not adequately define certain concepts, leading to potential confusion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the exploration of the method's limitations in lower-noise environments and investigate the scalability of TAD for more complex ALD systems. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include optimization performance under various noise levels in the experimental section and to conduct statistical tests to determine the significance of observed differences in results. We also suggest that the authors clarify definitions of key concepts, ensure consistent notation throughout the paper, and address minor typographical errors. Finally, modifying visual aids for better readability in grayscale would enhance the overall presentation.
