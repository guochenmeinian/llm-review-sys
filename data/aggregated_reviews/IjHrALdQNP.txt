Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method, Geometric and Affordance Maps (GAMap), for zero-shot object goal navigation, integrating geometric and affordance attributes for navigation guidance. The authors utilize a multi-scale scoring approach to handle objects of varying sizes and demonstrate the method's effectiveness through experiments on HM3D and Gibson datasets, achieving improved success rates and success weighted by path length (SPL).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study addresses the significant problem of zero-shot object goal navigation.
- The incorporation of both geometric and affordance attributes is a sensible approach.
- Extensive analysis in the experimental section provides valuable insights, and the paper includes strong ablation studies justifying design decisions.

Weaknesses:
- The key novelty of the work remains unconvincing; a comparative table with existing works would enhance clarity.
- The absence of real-world experiments raises concerns about the proposed method's effectiveness.
- The paper contains checklist instruction blocks that should be removed, and there are citation issues that require proofreading.
- The writing could be clearer, with some sentences being overly complex.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization of the paper by including a comparative table to highlight the differences between their work and existing methods. Additionally, we urge the authors to conduct and present more real-world experiments to validate the effectiveness of their method across diverse scenarios. It would also be beneficial to clarify the path planning and robot model used, as well as to address the limitations of relying on specific LLMs and VLMs. Lastly, we suggest simplifying complex sentences to enhance clarity throughout the manuscript.
