Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of the adversarial robustness of the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure, introducing two adversarial test-perturbation algorithms, INCREASE-c and MOVE-1. The authors provide analytical bounds on the effectiveness of these attacks and conduct experiments demonstrating their impact on synthetic z-scores. The analysis employs a combinatorial perspective, reframing the BH procedure as a "balls into bins" problem, and derives non-asymptotic lower bounds using generalized ballot problems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a novel aspect of the BH procedure, focusing on its adversarial robustness, which is relatively unexplored and provides insights into vulnerabilities in widely used statistical methods.
- The authors offer a detailed theoretical analysis and utilize advanced probabilistic tools, such as KL divergence and Pinsker's inequality, providing a solid mathematical foundation.
- The organization of the paper is clear and logical, with a comprehensive analysis presented in each section.

Weaknesses:
- Sections 5.1 and 5.2 lack substantial analysis or discussion of the experimental results, which diminishes their value to the reader.
- MOVE-1 is inadequately discussed in the main text, with essential details relegated to the appendix, limiting reader comprehension.
- The empirical results rely on synthetic datasets rather than real-world data, which could better demonstrate the practical relevance of the findings.
- There is insufficient insight into how perturbations to z-scores translate back to original data samples, which is critical for understanding the practical implications of the attacks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis and discussion of the experimental results in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 to provide clearer insights into their significance. Additionally, we suggest including a basic overview of MOVE-1 in the main text to enhance reader understanding. To strengthen the paper's practical relevance, we encourage the authors to conduct experiments using real-world datasets, such as MNIST or FashionMNIST, and to clarify how perturbations to z-scores relate to original data samples. Finally, we advise incorporating potential mitigation strategies to enhance the robustness of the BH procedure against adversarial attacks.
