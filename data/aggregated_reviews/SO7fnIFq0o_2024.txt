Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents theoretical results for an exploration algorithm utilizing ensemble sampling in the stochastic linear bandit setting. The proposed algorithm constructs \(2m = O(d \log T)\) ensemble models, selects one model uniformly at random, and chooses the greedy action based on that model's parameters. It achieves a regret bound of \(\tilde{O}(d^{5/2} \sqrt{T})\), independent of the action set size. The analysis marks a theoretical advancement by demonstrating that an ensemble size scaling logarithmically with time and linearly with the number of features suffices, avoiding the need for ensemble size to scale linearly with \(\sqrt{T}\).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a frequentist regret analysis with a reasonable ensemble size, distinguishing itself from previous algorithms like Thompson sampling and perturbed history exploration.
- The introduction of Rademacher variables for symmetrizing the ensemble is a notable improvement, and the master theorem for analyzing the regret bound is intriguing.

Weaknesses:
- The regret bound of \(O(d^{5/2} \sqrt{T})\) is relatively loose compared to existing algorithms like LinTS, which achieve \(O(d^{3/2} \sqrt{T})\) regret, raising concerns about the proposed algorithm's efficiency.
- The algorithm's computational and statistical efficiency is questioned, particularly in comparison to randomized algorithms, and there is a lack of empirical results to demonstrate its superiority.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the differences between their algorithm and LinUCB, emphasizing how these differences impact performance. Additionally, including experimental results to compare the proposed ensemble sampling algorithm with existing randomized algorithms would strengthen the paper. We also suggest explicitly stating the linear \(d\)-dependence on the ensemble size \(m\) in Theorem 1 for clarity. Finally, addressing the significance of the regularization parameter \(\lambda\) in the context of the theorems would enhance the theoretical foundation of the work.
