### Key Points
This paper presents a novel relation extraction task termed "novel relation extraction" (NRE), which addresses the challenge of identifying unknown relation types while maintaining classification capabilities for known types. The authors frame this as an out-of-scope (OOS) detection problem and propose a multi-strategy self-supervised learning approach to generate pseudo-OOS training instances by manipulating feature representations of known relations. The empirical results demonstrate improved performance on two datasets, FewRel and TACRED, while also highlighting the limitations of existing probability-based and feature-based methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is the first to frame novel relation extraction as an OOS detection problem, establishing a connection between OOS detection and novel relation extraction.
- The proposed strategies for constructing pseudo-OOS instances are efficient and reduce reliance on real training data for novel relations.
- Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, including ablation studies and comparisons with various baselines.

Weaknesses:
- The assumption that pseudo-OOS instances can be generated from arbitrary combinations of known relations may not hold for all novel relations.
- The lack of innovation in the pseudo-OOS sample generation methods, which are variations of the SMOTE technique, raises concerns about the contribution's novelty.
- The task setting of treating all OOS relations as a single class is confusing, and the absence of significance tests leaves the statistical validity of improvements unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the task setting by considering a more practical approach to automatically detect the number of OOS relations through unsupervised clustering. Additionally, conducting significance tests and reporting p-values for the improvements over baselines would strengthen the findings. It would also be beneficial to provide a more thorough discussion of the limitations of the work, particularly regarding the assumptions made about pseudo-OOS instances and the implications of shallow semantic similarity. Lastly, we suggest exploring more innovative methods for pseudo-OOS sample generation to enhance the novelty of the contribution.
