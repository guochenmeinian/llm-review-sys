Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a reference-based method named CacheKV for blind face image restoration, adapting latent diffusion models (LDM) to restore low-quality images using multiple high-quality references. The authors construct the FFHQ-Ref dataset, comprising 20,406 high-quality face images and their corresponding references, to support this task. A timestep-scaled identity loss is introduced to enhance the model's ability to learn discriminating features of human identities. The methodology's effectiveness is demonstrated through various experiments on datasets with differing degradation levels.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed framework effectively utilizes multiple reference images without information loss, providing a robust approach for latent diffusion models.
- The construction of the FFHQ-Ref dataset facilitates further research in reference-based image restoration.
- Experimental results validate the proposed methods, showing superior performance in face identity similarity compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a clear explanation of how CacheKV operates and its handling of varying numbers of reference images during calculations.
- The reliance on a pre-trained diffusion model during both training and inference leads to slower speeds and higher computational costs, which may hinder practical applications like video face restoration.
- The novelty of the proposed dataset is questioned, as it primarily involves re-labeling and cleaning existing data rather than introducing new content.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the CacheKV mechanism and explicitly detail how it utilizes varying numbers of reference images. Additionally, the authors should compare their method against existing GAN-based blind face image restoration techniques to strengthen their contributions. To address concerns regarding the novelty of the FFHQ-Ref dataset, we suggest discussing its advantages over previous datasets and considering the integration of face embeddings as an alternative conditioning strategy. Finally, we encourage the authors to conduct further experiments on the timestep-scaled identity loss, particularly in multi-step predictions, to explore potential improvements while addressing computational resource limitations.
