### Key Points
This paper presents the HarmLevelBench dataset, which includes 7 harmful topics and 8 severity levels, aimed at benchmarking the harmfulness of model outputs. The authors investigate the impact of quantization techniques, such as AWQ and GPTQ, on model robustness and adversarial defense using the Vicuna 13B v1.5 model. The authors argue that existing datasets lack sufficient query formulation structure and nuanced assessments of harmfulness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The focus on harm levels enables fine-grained analysis.  
- The investigation into the impact of quantization techniques is intriguing.  
- The methodology is well explained, and the paper is well-structured and written.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper's focus appears disjointed; it is unclear whether it is primarily a dataset paper or an empirical investigation.  
- If it is a dataset paper, the authors should clarify data acquisition and annotation processes, including statistics for HarmLevelBench.  
- The significance of query formulation structure is not adequately justified, raising questions about its influence on evaluation.  
- The empirical evaluation is limited to Vicuna 13B v1.5, which weakens the findings.  
- The relationship between harmfulness levels and jailbreaking complexity lacks clarity, and the annotation process for harm levels may introduce noise without a specific rubric.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding the primary focus of the paper, whether it is a dataset or an empirical investigation. If it is a dataset paper, please provide detailed instructions on data acquisition and annotation, along with relevant statistics. Additionally, clarify the importance of query formulation structure and its impact on evaluation outcomes. For the empirical investigation, we suggest expanding the evaluation to include more models and providing a more detailed analysis of the relationship between harmfulness levels and jailbreaking complexity, including how complexity metrics are derived.
