### Key Points
This paper presents a method using mathematical morphology to binarize convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) without performance loss under specific conditions. The authors propose two new approximation methods and a theoretical framework for ConvNets binarization, along with regularization losses to enhance optimization. The work aims to improve upon existing methods by addressing limitations related to binary inputs and filter learning in modern architectures.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method enhances the BiMoNN framework by generalizing to gray-scale images and introducing new techniques for cases where exact binarization is unachievable.
- The evaluation demonstrates the ability of the binarized BiMoNN to learn complex morphological pipelines without performance degradation.

Weaknesses:
- The absence of proofs for theorems and propositions hinders the assessment of the work.
- Results in Section 2.2 do not convincingly demonstrate how non-binary or complex images can be effectively handled.
- The experimental evaluation is limited to simple datasets and architectures, and the results are inferior to typical network binarization approaches.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by adding proofs for the theorems and propositions to enhance clarity and rigor. Additionally, provide context for Equations 31 and 32, and define the function \(\xi\) on line 414. Clarify the properties of \(d\) in Equation 27, and ensure consistency in terminology, such as "Figure X" versus "figure X." Address minor grammatical errors, such as correcting "wel" to "well" and "annexe" to "Appendix." Lastly, consider expanding the experimental section to include more complex datasets and architectures to validate the proposed methods effectively.
