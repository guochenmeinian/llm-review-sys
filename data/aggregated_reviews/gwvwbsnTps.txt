Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into composable coresets for the determinant maximization problem, focusing on selecting $k$ vectors to maximize the volume of the corresponding Gram matrix. The authors prove that the greedy algorithm provides composable coresets with an approximation factor of $O(k)^{3k}$ and demonstrate a local optimality property for the greedy approach. Empirical results indicate that the local optimality of the greedy algorithm is significantly better than theoretical bounds.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The topic of Determinant Maximization Problem (DPP) is relevant and significant.
- The technical result improves upon existing analyses of the greedy algorithm, providing a tighter approximation.
- The observation of local optimality for the greedy algorithm is of independent interest and has practical implications.

Weaknesses:
- The paper is a follow-up to previous work and does not present the first result for composable coresets.
- The analysis may be viewed as incremental, lacking substantial novelty.
- The paper is not well self-contained; several details are omitted, affecting clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by explicitly discussing the relationship between the greedy algorithm description in Section 1.1.1 and the pseudocode in Algorithm 1. Additionally, they should state the assumption of linear independence for the vectors in V in the proof of Theorem 5. Providing more details for the expression of $\mathrm{vol}(V)$ and references for Lemma 6 would enhance understanding. Furthermore, including a discussion on the potential social impact of the greedy algorithm in terms of fairness issues would be beneficial. Lastly, addressing the question of why the local optimality property might have been overlooked in prior work would provide valuable insight.
