Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a prompt optimization approach to address the missing modality issues in multimodal learning. The authors propose additional prompts, including correlated, dynamic, and modal-common prompts, to enhance performance across various datasets. The method demonstrates effectiveness in handling missing modalities during training and inference, surpassing several state-of-the-art models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper tackles a significant challenge in multimodal learning, particularly the generalized missing modality problem.
- The proposed method is well-motivated, with extensive experiments showing substantial performance improvements over baselines.
- The design of multiple types of prompts is logically sound, and comprehensive ablation studies validate the proposed components.

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty of the proposed method is limited, as it closely resembles the existing missing-aware prompt (MMP) approach, primarily adding more parameters.
- Clarity issues persist regarding the specific contributions of each prompt type and their relevance to the missing modality problem.
- The empirical comparison with MMP may not be entirely fair due to the increased number of parameters in the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing detailed explanations of the different prompt types and their specific roles in addressing missing modalities. Additionally, we suggest including a baseline comparison that integrates the modal-common and dynamic prompts into MMP to better highlight the contribution of the correlated prompting technique. Further, conducting ablation studies with different multimodal backbones and visualizing each learnable prompt could enhance the understanding of their effectiveness. Lastly, addressing the concerns regarding the novelty of the method and providing a clearer definition of the baseline setup would strengthen the manuscript.
