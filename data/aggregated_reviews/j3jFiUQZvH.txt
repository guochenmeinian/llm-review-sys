### Key Points
This paper presents the Dynamic Graph Information Bottleneck (DGIB) framework, which aims to learn robust and discriminative representations from dynamic graphs. It introduces the Minimal-Sufficient-Consensual (MSC) condition to guide representation learning, decomposing objectives into two channels: DGIB$_{MS}$ for minimal and sufficient representations, and DGIB$_C$ for predictive consensus. The framework's effectiveness is empirically validated through experiments on real-world datasets, demonstrating superior performance against adversarial attacks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The introduction of the MSC condition provides a theoretically sound basis for dynamic graph representation learning.  
2. The framework shows robust performance against adversarial attacks, particularly in link prediction tasks.  
3. The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with extensive experiments validating the proposed method.

Weaknesses:  
1. The MSC condition is not well explained, lacking intuition and motivation for its formulation.  
2. The complexity of decomposing IB objectives into two channels may hinder interpretability.  
3. There is insufficient discussion on the applicability of the proposed assumptions, particularly regarding the necessity of the consensual condition.  
4. Some parameters are not clearly defined, leading to potential confusion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the MSC condition, providing clearer intuition and motivation for its formulation. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the necessity of the consensual condition and its relationship to the objectives. It would also be beneficial to define all parameters explicitly and discuss their influence on results. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to enhance the readability of mathematical formulations and provide a more thorough analysis of the applicability of their assumptions in practical scenarios.
