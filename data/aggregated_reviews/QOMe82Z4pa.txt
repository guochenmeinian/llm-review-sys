### Key Points
This paper presents JOENA, a unified framework that integrates embedding-based methods and optimal transport (OT) for network alignment, enhancing robustness and alignment quality. JOENA improves performance through adaptive sampling in embedding learning and embedding-based training for OT cost, achieving notable gains in alignment accuracy and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements in effectiveness and scalability over state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- JOENA effectively combines OT and embedding-based approaches, providing a novel solution for network alignment.
- The adaptive sampling strategy and learnable OT cost function enhance robustness and generalization.
- The paper includes clear theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments, showcasing superior performance and strong robustness to noise.
- Scalability results indicate efficiency, making JOENA practical for large-scale networks.

Weaknesses:
- The datasets do not include highly dynamic or temporal networks, limiting generalization analysis.
- Memory efficiency is not discussed, which is critical for scaling to extremely large graphs.
- The paper lacks detailed ablation studies to isolate contributions of individual components and does not deeply explore hyperparameter sensitivity.
- While scalability is demonstrated, a breakdown of runtime contributions from embedding and OT optimization is missing.
- Insufficient detail on computational resources and implementation specifics hinders reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors evaluate JOENA on dynamic or temporal networks to better demonstrate its generalization capabilities. Additionally, expand ablation studies and provide a more detailed sensitivity analysis of hyperparameters. Including a breakdown of runtime contributions and memory usage would validate scalability claims. Improving figure clarity and providing more intuitive visualizations of JOENA's workflow would also enhance the paper's presentation.
