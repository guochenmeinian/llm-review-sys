Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DiffuseBot, a physics-augmented diffusion model designed for generating and optimizing soft robot morphologies and control strategies. The authors propose a framework that integrates physical dynamical simulation with diffusion-based synthesis to enhance the physical utility of generated robots. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of DiffuseBot across various tasks, including balancing and manipulation, and demonstrate its capability to incorporate human feedback and produce a physical robot prototype.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and clear, making it accessible even to those unfamiliar with soft robot design.
2. The proposed method is novel, combining diffusion models with physics-based simulation and co-design optimization.
3. The evaluation is comprehensive, featuring extensive experimental comparisons and ablation studies that validate the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty is somewhat limited, resembling an incremental application of diffusion models to 3D soft body generation, with insufficient differentiation from existing works like Softzoo.
2. The baseline for comparison includes outdated models, necessitating stronger and more recent alternatives.
3. The evaluation methodology is questionable, particularly regarding the selection of the best results from multiple initializations, which may not adequately represent baseline performance.
4. The physics-augmented component lacks sufficient exploration in ablation studies, undermining the paper's conclusions.
5. The limitations of the proposed method and the challenges of manufacturing the resulting designs are not adequately discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the exposition, particularly in sections discussing the co-design process and the role of hyper-parameters. Additionally, please provide a more detailed discussion of the limitations and failure scenarios of the proposed method, as well as the feasibility of manufacturing the resulting soft robots. We suggest including stronger and more recent baseline comparisons, and reporting mean and variance for the evaluation metrics instead of only the best results. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the rationale behind using diffusion models over other generative models, such as VAE or transformers, and to include relevant ablation studies to strengthen the paper's contributions.
