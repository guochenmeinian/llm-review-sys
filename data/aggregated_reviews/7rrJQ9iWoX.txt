Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel and generic representation of 3D planes called AlphaTablets, which represent 3D planes as rectangles with alpha and RGB channels, allowing for accurate and flexible modeling. The authors propose a differentiable rasterization method and a bottom-up planar reconstruction pipeline for optimizing target 3D planes. An effective merging scheme is introduced to enhance the growth and refinement of AlphaTablets. Extensive experiments on the ScanNet dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in 3D planar reconstruction.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The concept of optimizing 3D planar primitives through differentiable rendering is innovative, offering greater flexibility compared to previous methods that rely on 3D plane labels.  
2. The results on the ScanNet dataset showcase state-of-the-art performance in both 3D geometry and segmentation metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline.  
3. The coherent scene editing application is a valuable addition.  

Weaknesses:  
1. Concerns regarding the speed of the method arise, as it takes approximately 2 hours to reconstruct a single scene. A detailed efficiency analysis, including the time taken for each part of the system during optimization and identification of primary bottlenecks, is needed.  
2. Some plane parameter details are unclear, such as the pixel range values (ru, rv) and the calculation of distance ratios $\lambda_u$ and $\lambda_v$. Clarification on the alpha channel as a learnable single-channel map is also needed.  
3. The initialization process lacks clarity; initializing each superpixel as a tablet may introduce too many initial tablets, potentially impacting optimization speed. Merging similar superpixels to create larger initial planes could be beneficial.  
4. The reasons for the lower reconstruction accuracy compared to PlanarRecon need to be addressed.  
5. Clarification is needed on the model used for predicting monocular depth and normals, as well as the potential misalignment of monocular depth scale with ground-truth depth.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the plane parameter details, including the pixel range values and the calculation of distance ratios. Additionally, a detailed breakdown of the optimization time budget should be provided, highlighting the contributions of differentiable rendering and merging stages. The authors should also consider merging similar superpixels during initialization to enhance optimization speed. Furthermore, a discussion on the reasons for lower reconstruction accuracy compared to PlanarRecon would strengthen the paper. Lastly, clarifying the model used for depth and normals prediction, along with addressing the potential scale misalignment, is essential.
