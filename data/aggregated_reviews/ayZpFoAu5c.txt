Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel analysis of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) focusing on their ability to model interactions across vertex partitions, quantified through *separation rank*. The authors prove that for GNNs with product aggregation, this rank scales with *walk index*, which is defined as the number of random walks originating from the partition boundary. Empirical results demonstrate that GNNs with higher walk indices outperform those with lower indices in various tasks. Additionally, the authors propose Walk Index Sparsification (WIS) as an edge deletion method that significantly enhances prediction accuracy compared to existing baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The theoretical framework provides a fresh perspective on GNN expressivity, linking it to tensor networks and separation rank.
- The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making complex concepts accessible.
- Empirical results validate the effectiveness of the WIS method for graph sparsification.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical analysis is limited to GNNs with product aggregation, while empirical evaluations utilize standard GNNs with mean aggregation, lacking explicit connections between the two.
- The dependence of results on the aggregation function raises questions about the generalizability of findings, particularly regarding partitions with low walk indices.
- WIS's scalability is a concern due to its high computational complexity, and empirical comparisons with stronger baselines are insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of connections between the theoretical results for product aggregation and the empirical evaluations using standard GNNs. Specifically, they should outline how the analysis applies to standard GNNs and explore the implications of using different aggregation functions. Additionally, the authors should consider providing more comprehensive comparisons with stronger baselines, such as DropEdge and curvature-based methods, to bolster the case for WIS. Finally, a thorough discussion of limitations and potential future directions would enhance the manuscript's depth.
