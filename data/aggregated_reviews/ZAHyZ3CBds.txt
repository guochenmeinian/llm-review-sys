Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach called JointMatch for semi-supervised text classification (SSTC), addressing the issues of pseudo-label bias and error accumulation prevalent in existing methods. The authors propose a unified strategy that employs adaptive per-class thresholding, cross-labeling with two independently initialized networks, and a weighted disagreement/agreement update mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate JointMatch's superior performance across various datasets, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles significant challenges in SSTC, specifically pseudo-label bias and error accumulation.
- JointMatch is an innovative combination of recent techniques from semi-supervised learning and noise handling.
- Experimental evidence supports the effectiveness of JointMatch, showing robust performance even with minimal labeled data.
- The approach is well-documented and the code is made available for further research.

Weaknesses:
- The complexity of the JointMatch method may limit its applicability in certain contexts.
- The evaluation lacks a broader comparison with other semi-supervised learning methods beyond baseline models.
- The datasets used in experiments have a relatively small number of classes, raising questions about the method's scalability.
- High standard deviation in results, particularly for the IMDB dataset, diminishes the perceived performance improvements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the breadth of their experimental evaluation by including a wider variety of datasets and problem domains to better assess the scalability of JointMatch. Additionally, addressing the high standard deviation in results and providing more details on data augmentation would strengthen the paper. Clarifying the theoretical underpinnings of the cross-labeling technique and its effectiveness in filtering noise would also enhance the manuscript's rigor.
