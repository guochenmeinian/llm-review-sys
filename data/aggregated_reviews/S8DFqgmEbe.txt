Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on recovering causal relationships in a measurement model with latent variables and no direct causal edges between observed covariates. The authors introduce two graphical concepts—imaginary subsets and isolated edges—and discuss their relevance to sufficient conditions for recovery, supported by a two-phase recovery algorithm. The paper emphasizes the identification of the causal graph from interventional data without assumptions on the functional form of the causal model, focusing on the graphical requirements and the implications of various assumptions. Additionally, the authors provide a detailed examination of maximal cliques and their implications in the context of latent variables within measurement models, proposing clarifications regarding Assumption 2 and differentiating their work from previous studies by highlighting three main differences: the focus on nonparametric identification, graphical constraints, and the allowance of noisy transformations. They argue for a careful approach to edge removal in graphical models, stressing that such actions should be justified solely based on observed data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and generally easy to follow, with a thorough discussion of the assumptions.
- It provides a significant contribution by proving identifiability from observational, unlabelled data without functional assumptions, enhancing practical applicability.
- The extensive discussion, precise statements, and thorough appendices add depth to the theoretical analysis.
- The authors provide a clear distinction between their work and related studies, enhancing the understanding of their contributions.
- The discussion on maximality and its implications for latent variables is well-articulated and insightful.

Weaknesses:
- Assumption 1(d) appears redundant and could be rephrased as a lemma derived from assumption 1(c), thereby reducing the number of assumptions.
- The significance of Definition 5.2 on isolated equivalence classes (IEC) is questioned, as it lacks the complexity of established concepts like Chickering's "covered edge reversal."
- The experimental section is limited and lacks detail, making it difficult to assess the empirical contribution, suggesting a need for more robust experiments and comparisons with existing methods.
- The focus on identifiability of the causal structure without addressing the identification of latent variables may limit the paper's practical relevance.
- Some key assumptions and discussions are currently relegated to appendices, which may hinder accessibility for readers.
- The treatment of latent variables could benefit from a more explicit discussion within the main text.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Assumption 1(d) by rewriting it in terms of a lemma or consequence of Assumption 1(c). Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed discussion on the significance of IEC compared to established concepts in causal inference. To enhance the empirical contribution, we encourage the authors to design experiments that test the scalability and robustness of their approach, including comparisons with other methods. Furthermore, we advise the authors to elaborate on the implications of their assumptions, particularly regarding their applicability to realistic scenarios, and to include a running example to guide readers through the definitions and concepts presented in the paper. We also recommend improving the accessibility of their work by including the assumptions detailed in appendices C and D in the main body of the paper, adding a small discussion that elaborates on how the model addresses latent variables, and incorporating a description of the main technical challenge into the problem description. These changes will enhance clarity and strengthen the overall presentation of the paper.
