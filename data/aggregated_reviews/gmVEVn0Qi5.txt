### Key Points
This paper presents InterroLang, an extension of the TalkToModel method for ML model explainability via a text-based dialogue interface. The authors implement InterroLang for three NLP tasks—dialogue act classification, question answering, and hate speech detection—allowing users to ask specific questions about model behavior. A user study evaluates human perception and simulatability, yielding positive results. The primary contributions include the open-source software and accompanying dataset, with a thorough literature review and clear presentation of the model and hyperparameters.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of motivation, methodology, and model settings.
- Comprehensive user studies provide subjective and objective assessments of the framework.
- The tool demonstrates generalizability across multiple NLP tasks and is open-sourced for further research.

Weaknesses:
- The user study's small sample size raises concerns about bias, as four of the six evaluators were authors.
- The paper lacks a detailed discussion on the necessity of a dialogue system versus simpler alternatives like drop-down menus.
- There is insufficient comparison with other systems, limiting the justification for the dialogue-based approach.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the user study by increasing the sample size and ensuring a more diverse participant pool to mitigate bias. Additionally, we suggest providing a clearer rationale for the dialogue system's necessity and comparing it with alternative interfaces, such as a drop-down menu. Clarifying the intended use case for InterroLang and conducting A/B testing against other systems would strengthen the paper's claims. Furthermore, we advise including more details in the appendix that could enhance the experimental section and addressing the questions raised regarding the Helpfulness Ratio and the evaluation process.
