Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an autoencoder framework called Neural Isometries (NIso), which encodes input symmetries into isometries in the latent space. The authors propose that the equivariance in the latent space is captured by a functional map $\tau$, which is regularized to be an isometry. The method is evaluated on tasks such as homography-perturbed MNIST, conformal shape classification, and camera pose estimation, demonstrating performance comparable to handcrafted equivariant baselines and superior results in certain tasks. The authors acknowledge that NIso can only exactly model unitary transformations and that further theoretical investigation is required to support claims of generalization to non-unitary transformations. Compelling experimental results, including patterns resembling spherical harmonics in the SO(3) case, enhance the paper's impact.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- It introduces a novel framework that models latent space equivariance as functional maps.
- The framework can handle various input transformations, unlike handcrafted equivariant networks.
- The proposed method shows competitive performance in multiple tasks.
- The rebuttal effectively addresses many concerns, strengthening the overall presentation.

Weaknesses:
- The constraint of $\tau$ being an isometry appears heuristic, lacking theoretical justification for its effectiveness.
- The multiplicity loss appears heuristic and lacks theoretical justification, impacting performance.
- Uncertainty exists regarding whether all transformations can be modeled as isometric functional maps and how this restriction affects the network's capabilities.
- Claims regarding NIso's robustness to occlusion and partiality require more rigorous proof and should be moderated.
- Questions remain about data efficiency and the handling of multiple non-unitary transformations.
- The experimental setup is limited, with only a few small-scale datasets and comparisons primarily against one baseline (NFT).

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical investigation into why constraining $\tau$ to isometries enhances performance. Additionally, clarify whether all transformations can be modeled as isometric functional maps and discuss the implications of this restriction. It is essential to report measures of equivariance in the latent space and compare them with handcrafted methods. We suggest improving the theoretical justification for the multiplicity loss to clarify its impact on performance. Furthermore, we recommend refraining from overclaiming NIso's capabilities regarding occlusion and partiality until further evidence is provided. It would also be beneficial to address the questions surrounding data requirements and the effectiveness of NIso in the presence of multiple non-unitary transformations. Finally, we encourage the inclusion of the spherical image experiment in the main draft and clarification of the encoder architecture used.
