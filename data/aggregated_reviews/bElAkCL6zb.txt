### Key Points
This paper presents UniGO, a unified framework for modeling opinion evolution on graphs, addressing challenges such as social interaction complexity and opinion fusion rule diversity. The authors propose a coarsen-refine mechanism to balance equilibrium phenomena while avoiding over-smoothing. The methodology is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating strong originality and practical potential.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The unified framework effectively integrates various opinion fusion rules, surpassing traditional single-rule models.
- The coarsen-refine mechanism innovatively addresses over-smoothing in GNNs.
- The pretrain-finetune paradigm shows good generalization from synthetic to real-world datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of contributions is unclear, particularly in distinguishing UniGO from existing models like DiskNet.
- The motivation for unifying multiple assumptions lacks depth, with insufficient theoretical analysis and empirical validation.
- Experimental evaluations are inadequate, lacking detailed ablation studies and clarity on model variants.
- Claims of scalability are overstated, as the largest dataset tested is limited to 10,695 nodes.
- The clarity of the multi-head attention mechanism and the real-world dataset details is insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions by explicitly distinguishing UniGO from existing models, particularly DiskNet. The authors should provide a thorough theoretical analysis of how various fusion rules interact and their implications for model performance. Additionally, we suggest including detailed ablation studies to evaluate the individual contributions of model components, especially regarding synthetic graph construction. The authors should also test the model on larger datasets to substantiate claims of scalability. Clear labeling and captions for all figures, particularly Figure 2, should be ensured to enhance readability. Finally, the authors should clarify the multi-head attention mechanism and provide more details on the real-world datasets used, including data collection methods and the process for transforming text data into opinion data.
