### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) guided formal proof search by introducing a probabilistic proof state compression technique that integrates LLMs with conformal prediction. The authors propose a method that addresses scalability challenges in automated theorem proving, demonstrating a 23% reduction in average proof time on benchmarks such as Lean 4 miniF2F and ProofNet. The theoretical framework includes a proof of coverage guarantee for the conformal prediction method, contributing to the method's credibility.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The integration of conformal prediction with LLM-guided proof search is innovative and effectively manages formal verification complexity.
2. The paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation and detailed methodology, allowing for potential replication.
3. Experimental results show significant efficiency gains over state-of-the-art models.

Weaknesses:
1. The experimental results are described as "preliminary" and limited to a subset of tests, necessitating more comprehensive evaluation.
2. There is insufficient detail on computational resources, which is crucial for reproducibility.
3. The paper lacks comparisons with other proof state compression techniques and does not adequately discuss limitations or potential failure cases.
4. The generalizability of the method to other theorem-proving domains is unclear, and the discussion of broader societal impacts is insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the breadth of experimental results by including a wider range of theorem proving benchmarks beyond miniF2F and ProofNet. Additionally, providing detailed information about the computational resources used in experiments would enhance reproducibility. The authors should also include comparisons with other proof state compression techniques and expand the discussion on limitations, particularly regarding the impact of small or biased calibration sets on conformal prediction accuracy. Finally, incorporating more examples or diagrams in the methodology section could improve clarity and accessibility for readers less familiar with the techniques used.
