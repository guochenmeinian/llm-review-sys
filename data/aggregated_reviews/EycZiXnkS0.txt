### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to predicting Myocardial Injury after Non-cardiac Surgery (MINS) using a Retrieval Based Disease (RBD) prediction framework. The authors propose transforming multifaceted pre-operative and intra-operative tabular data into coherent text descriptions, enabling the use of Language Models (LM) for improved data interpretation. The authors claim that their LM-based model outperforms traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods, although further validation in larger datasets is suggested.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces an innovative RBD framework that effectively leverages LM-based models for disease prediction, addressing challenges in analyzing complex clinical data.
- Multiple experiments were conducted, with results clearly presented, indicating promising performance improvements over traditional ML approaches.

Weaknesses:
- The contributions of the paper are misleading; the method relies on medical experts for text description development rather than a model generating these descriptions autonomously. Additionally, class imbalance is not adequately addressed in the introduction, raising questions about the method's design for this issue.
- More explanation of the RBF framework is needed, including how the proposed method differs or expands upon it.
- The explanation of baseline LM training is vague, and the selection of the relevance threshold lacks clarity, as it should be tuned based on a validation set rather than manually chosen.
- The paper does not provide a comprehensive strategy for addressing data imbalance, which is crucial for validating the model's effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions by explicitly stating the role of medical experts in generating text descriptions and addressing class imbalance more thoroughly in the introduction. Additionally, the authors should provide a detailed explanation of the RBF framework and how their method expands upon it. Clarifying the baseline LM training process and the rationale behind the relevance threshold selection would enhance the paper's rigor. Finally, incorporating resampling strategies to mitigate data imbalance and including ROC-AUC comparisons among models could provide deeper insights into performance, particularly regarding false positives and negatives.
