### Key Points
This paper presents TimeChain, a blockchain-based off-chain storage system for IoT time series data. TimeChain minimizes storage costs and enhances performance by storing only the hash of data batches on-chain while retaining full data off-chain. Key features include an adaptive batching mechanism, graph partitioning for optimized co-querying, and a Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) integrity verification approach to reduce latency. The authors articulate the challenges of current blockchain storage systems and provide a comprehensive evaluation using real-world datasets, demonstrating improvements in storage and query latency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of adaptive data batching, node selection mechanisms, and LSH-based verification effectively addresses latency and data management issues in blockchain storage.
- The paper includes a rigorous evaluation with real-world datasets, showcasing significant improvements over existing solutions like SEBDB and FileDES.
- The implementation using open-source frameworks highlights the practicality of the solution.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of storing a hash on-chain is limited, and the paper feels more like an incremental step rather than a major advancement.
- The consensus-based node selection mechanism is permissioned and may not adapt well to real IoT scenarios with dynamic node activity.
- The paper lacks a deep theoretical analysis of LSH trees and does not adequately address potential challenges in broader deployment scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing, particularly by defining technical terms and correcting typographical errors. Additionally, a more thorough discussion on the scalability challenges of TimeChain is necessary, especially regarding the consensus-based node selection mechanism. We suggest including a detailed theoretical analysis of LSH trees and a comparison of alternative tree structures. Furthermore, the authors should elaborate on the security analysis, particularly regarding potential vulnerabilities and how TimeChain mitigates these risks. Lastly, providing user feedback and addressing consistency issues in real-world applications would enhance the paper's relevance and applicability.
