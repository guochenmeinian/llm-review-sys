### Key Points
This paper presents a hypothesis that tracking tail dependence between estimators in the ratio of the SNIS estimator can capture lost information in their covariance. The authors propose using tail dependence coefficients (TDC) to enhance SNIS diagnostics for estimating posterior expectations, revealing insights not available through k-hat statistics. The paper is generally well-structured, particularly the well-written first section that provides detailed mathematical background.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of tail dependence coefficients offers valuable insights for posterior diagnostics.
- The writing is solid, and the paper is well-formatted, contributing to its overall clarity.

Weaknesses:
- The demonstration results are perceived as underwhelming and overly simplistic.
- There is a lack of comprehensive tests for assessing tail dependence control, and mathematical proofs for upper and lower bounds are missing.
- Certain sections lack clarity, particularly the explanation for not estimating $Cov[\hat{I_{num}}, \hat{I_{den}}]$ and the experimental details.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the explanation regarding the non-estimation of $Cov[\hat{I_{num}}, \hat{I_{den}}]$ and elaborate on the experimental section, potentially including details on the student-t copula and sampling from an extended space in the appendix. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed discussion of tail dependence in Definition 1 and Equation 7, and offering more reasoning for the assumptions made in lines 112-114, particularly regarding their applicability beyond mathematical finance. It would also be beneficial to clearly label the y-axis in Figure 1 b), c), and d), and consider including additional case studies to better demonstrate the advantages of TDC metrics. Finally, we encourage the authors to expand the demonstration to provide more comprehensive insights.
