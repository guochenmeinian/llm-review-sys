### Key Points
This paper presents two methods to enhance local modeling in singing voice synthesis (SVS) aimed at addressing local incongruity: a nearest neighbor local attention mechanism that focuses on adjacent phoneme tokens and a phoneme-level local adaptive weights loss function that optimizes the harder-to-synthesize parts of the mel-spectrogram. The authors conduct experiments on Chinese pop song and Hokkien Gezi Opera datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of their methods through ablation studies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper summarizes prior work on SVS effectively and presents clear descriptions of the proposed methods.
- Experimental results show that the proposed methods outperform alternatives in both objective and subjective evaluations.
- The authors provide a detailed rebuttal addressing reviewers' concerns, clarifying their approach and results.

Weaknesses:
- The innovations are perceived as relatively small and simplistic, primarily involving the integration of local attention with global attention and adaptive loss weights.
- There is a lack of detailed analysis of local incongruity and comparisons with existing methods, such as N-Singer and adversarial training methods.
- The effectiveness of the methods is primarily validated on specific datasets, raising questions about their generalizability to other languages and styles of singing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparative analysis by including a detailed examination of local incongruity and comparisons with existing methods like Conformer and PostNet. Additionally, we suggest expanding the dataset to include more diverse languages and genres to better assess the generalizability of the proposed methods. Furthermore, providing a demonstration webpage with more audio samples would enhance the paper's persuasive power regarding the methods' effectiveness.
