### Key Points
This paper presents a method called aTLAS, which leverages task vectors and anisotropic scaling to enhance transfer learning in neural networks. The authors investigate the characteristics of task vectors, particularly parameter blocks, and how these can improve knowledge composition and transfer. The method is evaluated across various tasks, including task arithmetic, few-shot recognition, and test-time adaptation, demonstrating significant performance improvements and parameter efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of anisotropic scaling at the task vector level is novel, offering higher controllability in model behavior, particularly for task addition and negation.
- The method is thoroughly validated across multiple tasks and datasets, showing significant improvements in performance.
- aTLAS demonstrates strong parameter efficiency, making it suitable for scenarios with limited data.
- The method complements existing few-shot adaptation techniques, leading to additional performance improvements.

Weaknesses:
- The method is primarily tested on the CLIP model, which may limit its applicability across diverse architectures without significant modifications.
- While parameter-efficient, the computation of task vector compositions can be resource-intensive, raising questions about scalability with larger task vector sets.
- The selection of task vectors for composition is crucial but lacks a definitive approach, necessitating further research into more sophisticated selection mechanisms.
- Essential methodological details, such as loss, optimizer, learning rate, and hyperparameters for learning scaling coefficients, are missing. Additionally, the paper does not adequately address the computational costs compared to standard task arithmetic.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of aTLAS by testing it on a broader range of model architectures beyond CLIP. Strategies to optimize the computational complexity of task vector compositions should be explored to enhance scalability. The authors should provide a clear and definitive approach for selecting task vectors to improve robustness. Furthermore, including essential methodological details and a comparison of computational costs with standard task arithmetic would strengthen the paper. Finally, a discussion of the similarities and differences between aTLAS and related works, such as Adaptive Model Merging, should be included to clarify originality.
