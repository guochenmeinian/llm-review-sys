Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents TIES-MERGING, a method to merge fine-tuned models by addressing performance degradation caused by redundant parameters and sign conflicts. The authors propose a two-step solution involving parameter trimming and sign conflict resolution, demonstrating improved performance across various tasks in NLP and vision domains. The method is computationally inexpensive and easy to reproduce, although it lacks theoretical support.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for merging fine-tuned models is compelling, addressing a significant gap in multitask learning literature.
- The method's simplicity and clarity enhance its reproducibility.
- Robust experimental results across diverse tasks and architectures highlight the method's adaptability.

Weaknesses:
- The lack of theoretical analysis for the proposed method, particularly regarding the impact of sign conflicts, is a significant shortcoming.
- The contributions appear incremental, with observed performance gains being marginal.
- The experiments do not explore merging models trained on single tasks, which may limit the method's applicability.
- The paper lacks a dedicated limitations section, failing to address theoretical understanding and potential future work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis of TIES-MERGING, particularly regarding sign conflicts and their impact on performance. Additionally, a dedicated limitations section should be included to discuss the theoretical understanding of model merging and the method's applicability to single-task models. We suggest enriching the experimental analysis to clarify the effects on individual tasks and incorporating a sensitivity analysis of hyperparameters. Finally, consider discussing real-world applications to demonstrate the practical value of the proposed method.
