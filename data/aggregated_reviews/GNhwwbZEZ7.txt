### Key Points
This paper presents a method to create benchmarks from observational data for evaluating causal estimation methods, focusing on the sequential construction of causal graphs. The simulator generates data for later time points based on observational data at the initial time, utilizing hand-designed transition mechanisms. The authors apply this approach to the Adult dataset to compare different causal estimators, addressing the limitations of existing benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles a significant issue in causal inference, providing a generalizable method for creating benchmarks.
- It offers a comprehensive discussion of current benchmark limitations, both simulator-based and real-world.
- The simulator's use of a Markov process is intuitive, facilitating the combination of data and human design for semi-synthetic datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The assumption that transition mechanisms are simpler than observational variable mechanisms requires justification, with a need for theoretical or empirical examples.
- The paper lacks details on the hand-crafted models and their motivations, which could hinder generalization to other datasets.
- There is ambiguity regarding whether the generated dataset remains IID or becomes a time series, which needs clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the assumption regarding transition mechanisms, potentially including real-world counterexamples. Additionally, the authors should provide more details on the hand-crafted models and consider discussing the implications of using these models versus generating them automatically. Clarifying whether the resulting dataset is IID or a time series is essential. Furthermore, enhancing the empirical comparison with other datasets and addressing the overlap between the introduction and related work sections would strengthen the paper. Lastly, we suggest including a time series plot to illustrate the dynamic development of the data.
