Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Feature Factorization Activation Map (FFAM) to enhance the interpretability of 3D object detectors using LiDAR data. It employs non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to create global concept activation maps, which are refined through object-specific gradients. A voxel upsampling strategy is introduced to align the activation map's granularity with the input point cloud. The method is validated through extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating saliency maps.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The use of NMF for generating concept activation maps is novel and well-justified.
- The method shows superiority over existing techniques in producing high-quality visual explanations across multiple datasets.
- The methodology is clearly described, including feature factorization, gradient weighting, and voxel upsampling.
- The practical implications for improving interpretability in autonomous driving and robotics are significant.

Weaknesses:
- The application value of the proposed method remains unclear, particularly in enhancing the performance of 3D detectors in safety-critical scenarios.
- The method's computational intensity may hinder real-time applicability.
- The focus on LiDAR-based detectors limits the discussion on adaptation to other 3D data types.
- The rationale for choosing NMF over alternatives like PCA is not adequately explained.
- The paper lacks ablation studies and further validation of claims regarding the superiority of the saliency maps generated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the rationale for using NMF and consider discussing its comparison with PCA. Additionally, we suggest including ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the gradient weighting method and the voxel upsampling strategy. It would be beneficial to explore the method's applicability to other 3D detection systems and datasets beyond KITTI and Waymo Open. Lastly, addressing the computational overhead of FFAM in real-time applications would strengthen the paper's practical relevance.
