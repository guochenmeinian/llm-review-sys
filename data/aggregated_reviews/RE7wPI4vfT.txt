### Key Points
This paper presents a method to enhance parallel sampling of diffusion models by refining the denoising network for out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluation. The authors propose to fine-tune a trained model using the log-likelihood ratio of samples at two different noise scales, integrating the denoising error across all noise levels. The proposed method shows improved performance in parallel sampling and comparable results in sequential sampling on CIFAR-10, AFHQ, and FFHQ datasets. Additionally, the paper establishes a connection between the diffusion model denoiser and noise classifier through log-likelihood ratio estimation, introducing a novel loss function termed Contrastive Diffusion Loss (CDL).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and organized, making it easy to follow.  
- The introduction of CDL is novel and solid, potentially inspiring further research in contrastive loss and noise-level data augmentation methods.  
- Empirical results indicate improvements in parallel sampling performance and robustness to hyperparameter variations.

Weaknesses:  
- The integration of denoising error in the CDL is computationally expensive, and the empirical performance gains do not appear significant given the costs. Details on the integration approximation are lacking.  
- Clarity issues exist, particularly regarding the notation for noise levels, which could confuse readers.  
- The empirical section is weaker than the analytical section, with results not reaching state-of-the-art performance, especially in unconditional generation. The chosen baseline for comparison is not optimal, and the rationale for CDL's effectiveness in certain contexts is not well-explained.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by consistently using notation for noise levels and providing more intuitive explanations to connect the analytical and empirical sections. Additionally, we suggest including discussions on related works, particularly those that improve parallel sampling, and addressing the limitations of the chosen baseline for comparison. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to experimentally quantify the improvement of the denoiser for OOD evaluation when trained using CDL and to clarify the integration method used in their experiments.
