Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to address label distribution mismatch in zero-shot models using optimal transport (OT). The authors propose adjusting predictions of pretrained models based on an estimated downstream label distribution, theoretically demonstrating that the induced predictions are Bayes optimal under certain assumptions. Extensive empirical validation across various image and text classification tasks supports the effectiveness of the proposed method, OTTER.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The use of optimal transport to manage label distribution mismatch is a novel and elegant solution.
2. The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation, including characterizations of improvement under mild conditions and error bounds for misspecification.
3. Extensive empirical validation demonstrates the effectiveness of OTTER across a wide range of tasks.

Weaknesses:
1. The method's reliance on an accurate estimate of the downstream label distribution may pose practical challenges, as errors in this estimate could affect performance.
2. A more detailed analysis of performance across diverse datasets with varying sizes, complexities, and imbalance levels is needed for a deeper understanding of the method's strengths and limitations.
3. The paper could benefit from a more comprehensive comparison with recent state-of-the-art methods in label distribution adaptation and zero-shot learning.
4. Scalability for very large-scale datasets is not thoroughly discussed, despite being described as lightweight.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the estimated label distribution's accuracy and its impact on performance. A detailed evaluation across diverse datasets should be included to better understand the method's limitations. Additionally, a more comprehensive comparison with the latest state-of-the-art methods in label distribution adaptation and zero-shot learning is necessary. Finally, a thorough discussion on the scalability of OTTER for large-scale datasets would enhance the paper's contribution.
