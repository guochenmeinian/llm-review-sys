Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Dynamic Early-Exit for Robotic MLLM (DeeR) framework, which aims to enhance computational efficiency and inference speed of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in robotic applications. The authors propose a dynamic neural network that selectively activates portions of the model based on task complexity, employing a multi-exit architecture to allow early termination of processing. The framework incorporates a straightforward early exiting criterion and utilizes all hidden states in the loss functions to address training challenges. Experimental results indicate improvements in computational and memory efficiency while maintaining performance comparable to the original model.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The DeeR framework significantly reduces computational and memory requirements, making it suitable for resource-limited robotic platforms.
2. Comprehensive evaluations in simulation environments demonstrate that DeeR achieves competitive performance with reduced computation and exhibits scalability by adjusting the activated model size dynamically.

Weaknesses:
1. The experiments are conducted solely in simulated environments, raising concerns about the framework's effectiveness in real-world applications.
2. The reliance on threshold determination for early exits necessitates careful tuning, which may complicate implementation in diverse real-world scenarios.
3. The training data is limited, potentially failing to capture the full diversity of real-world situations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of DeeR by conducting additional experiments across a wider range of robotic tasks beyond the CALVIN benchmark. Furthermore, we suggest providing a more detailed comparison with other efficient LLM approaches, particularly those focused on model compression and structural design. Additionally, we encourage the authors to clarify the implementation of the multi-exit architecture and the early-termination criteria, as well as to report the model's operational efficiency in terms of frames per second (FPS) rather than just GFlops. Lastly, we advise including more real-world experiments to validate the framework's effectiveness and addressing the potential impact of the early-exit mechanism on the model's ability to understand and follow language instructions.
