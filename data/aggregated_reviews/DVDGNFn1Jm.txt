### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to conversational promotion, focusing on promoting specified items through engaging dialogues. The authors propose the Reinforced Target-driven Conversational Promotion (RTCP) framework, which integrates long short-term strategic planning to predict dialogue actions and employs prefix-tuning for response generation. Experimental results indicate that RTCP outperforms state-of-the-art models, demonstrating its effectiveness in both automatic metrics and human evaluations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-motivated, addressing a challenging and under-explored area in conversational promotion.
- The RTCP framework balances short-term and long-term planning effectively.
- Solid experimental results with representative baselines and additional analyses showing adaptability to unseen scenarios.

Weaknesses:
- The term "dialogue actions" is misused; it should not define a dialogue action as a pair of goal and topic.
- Some methodological details are unclear, particularly regarding the computation of rewards and the formulation of loss functions.
- The evaluation metrics lack clarity, and the performance results show only marginal differences from baselines.
- A relevant baseline (UNICORN) is cited but not compared in the experiments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the terminology used for "dialogue actions" to more accurately reflect the distinction between actions and topics. Additionally, clarify how $h_{s_{t+1}}$ is obtained for reward computation and correct the loss function formulations to reflect ground-truth distributions accurately. We also suggest providing a clearer explanation of the evaluation metrics and including comparisons with UNICORN and advanced generative models like ChatGPT to strengthen the experimental validation.
