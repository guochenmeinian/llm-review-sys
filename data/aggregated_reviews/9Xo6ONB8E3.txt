### Key Points
This paper presents TR-BEACON, an extension of the previously proposed BEACON for high-dimensional scenarios. The authors leverage a trust region to limit the search space for building the surrogate model, introducing a novel trust region management system and providing a detailed algorithm description. The implementation of local probabilistic models over trust regions effectively addresses the curse of dimensionality, facilitating efficient behavior discovery in complex systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The authors propose a novel trust region-based novelty search algorithm adaptable to high-dimensional scenarios.  
- A detailed description of the proposed algorithm is provided, highlighting differences from earlier works.  
- The experimental results are extensive and convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of TR-BEACON in identifying potential functional deficiencies.  

Weaknesses:  
- The computation complexity analysis of the mentioned algorithms is lacking.  
- The numerical experiments primarily focus on two specific tasks, limiting the argument for TR-BEACON's generalizability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the computation complexity analysis of their algorithms to provide a clearer understanding of their efficiency. Additionally, expanding the range of numerical experiments to include a broader array of applications would strengthen the argument for TR-BEACON's generalizability.
