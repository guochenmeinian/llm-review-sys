### Key Points
This paper presents the Object-Centric Relational Abstraction (OCRA) model, which combines an object-centric representation model (Slot Attention) with a relational reasoning module to enhance systematic generalization in visual reasoning tasks. The model employs a pre-trained Slot Attention to extract object representations, followed by a relational reasoning module that includes a "relational bottleneck" and a transformer for processing these representations. Experiments conducted on three datasets demonstrate that OCRA generalizes better to unseen objects compared to existing baselines. Additionally, the paper analyzes relational embeddings in the context of a same/different task, showing that these embeddings can effectively capture abstract relations even with novel shapes. An ablation study comparing the dot product and outer product in their relational operator reveals that the dot product outperforms the outer product, suggesting a reliance on both multiplicative interaction and compression. The authors clarify that while equation 4 discards individual object appearance information, it preserves relational information associated with spatial positions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and clearly presents its ideas, making it easy to follow.
- The introduction effectively motivates the research direction, and the proposed approach shows novelty with strong generalization performance.
- The experiments are detailed and reproducible, with a new dataset (CLEVR-ART) introduced for visual reasoning.
- The analysis of relational embeddings shows distinct clustering for same and different shapes, indicating effective abstraction.
- The authors provide thorough responses to reviewer queries and incorporate additional experiments, enhancing the paper's credibility.
- The clarification regarding equation 4 elucidates the design choice to prioritize relational over individual object appearance information.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution of the paper relative to existing work is unclear, particularly regarding the lack of comparisons with many existing approaches.
- The distinction between novel and existing components of the proposed approach is not well-defined.
- The related work section omits several relevant papers, and the experimental results could be strengthened by including all baselines across datasets.
- The simplicity of the benchmarks raises questions about their effectiveness in evaluating the proposed method.
- There remains some ambiguity regarding the inherent reasons for the effectiveness of multiplicative interactions, which could benefit from further exploration.
- The lack of a comparison with the CoRelNet baseline initially raised concerns about the completeness of related work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contribution by providing comparisons with a broader range of existing approaches to substantiate their claims. Additionally, the authors should clarify which aspects of their model are novel versus those that build on existing work. It would be beneficial to enhance the related work section by citing more relevant literature and to apply all baselines across all datasets for a more comprehensive evaluation. We also suggest considering more challenging benchmarks to validate the model's effectiveness further. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the explanation of why multiplicative interactions are effective, potentially exploring the implications of using the outer product further. Lastly, we encourage the authors to ensure clarity regarding the relationship between object appearance and spatial position in equation 4, to alleviate any remaining uncertainties, and to provide a more comprehensive discussion of related work to enhance the paper's context and depth.
