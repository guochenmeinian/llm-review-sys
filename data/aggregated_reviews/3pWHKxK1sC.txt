Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a conformal inference method, Adaptively Fair Conformal Prediction (AFCP), designed to assess uncertainty in classification by generating prediction sets with valid coverage based on adaptively chosen features. The method aims to balance efficiency and algorithmic fairness by ensuring equalized coverage for sensitive groups. The authors validate AFCP on both simulated and real datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing algorithmic biases.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized, with a clear problem statement and method description.
- The proposed fairness notion is novel and crucial for real-world applications, effectively mitigating the trade-off between fairness and efficiency, even with small sample sizes.
- The empirical results are robust, showing AFCP's superiority over traditional methods in terms of fairness and prediction informativeness.

Weaknesses:
- The adaptive equalized coverage requires each group to exceed a specified coverage rate, which may not guarantee exact demographic parity.
- The method's reliance on sensitive attribute selection may lead to challenges, particularly with limited sample sizes, and lacks formal guarantees.
- The clarity of the paper could be improved, particularly regarding the computational complexity and the stability of the attribute selection process.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the sensitive attribute selection process, ensuring it provides formal guarantees and is easier to follow. Additionally, a deeper exploration of the computational complexity and scalability of AFCP, especially for large datasets, would strengthen the paper. We also suggest including performance evaluations under distribution shifts and on more diverse, recent benchmark datasets to validate the method's generalizability. Finally, addressing the potential confusion arising from the union of sub-intervals in real-world applications would enhance the paper's applicability.
