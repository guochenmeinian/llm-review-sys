Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates multi-output regression under combinatorial covariate shift, where the input domains in the testing set differ significantly from the training set. The authors propose a tensor completion approach to make test set predictions by viewing the functional mapping as a tensor with missing tubes. They extend low tubal-rank tensor decomposition to a continuous case through a functional t-SVD method, which decomposes the functional mapping into embedding functions with associated singular values. An empirical risk minimization (ERM) algorithm is introduced and evaluated with a toy example, supported by a solid theoretical analysis of the functional t-SVD's approximability and the excess risk of the ERM algorithm.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper presents a novel approach by bridging low-rank tensor decomposition in the discrete domain to functional approximation in the continuous domain, addressing missing data issues effectively.
- It provides rigorous theoretical analyses regarding the approximability of vector-valued functions and the excess risk bound of the empirical risk minimizer.

Weaknesses:
- The empirical analysis lacks comparisons with benchmark approaches, making it difficult to assess the proposed methodology's effectiveness. Including comparisons with other tensor decomposition methods (CP, Tucker, Tensor-Train, Tubal) would be beneficial.
- There is a lack of real-data experiments, which hinders understanding the proposed method's applicability in real-world scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical analyses by including comparisons with established benchmark methods to better evaluate the proposed methodology's effectiveness. Additionally, conducting real-data experiments would enhance the understanding of the method's practical utility. We also suggest providing a systematic approach for selecting the rank \( r \) when implementing the functional t-SVD, potentially by minimizing the excess risk bound with respect to \( r \). Furthermore, addressing the relationship between the proposed method and existing functional tensor decomposition methods, as well as clarifying the significance of Combinatorial Distribution Shift (CDS) in multi-output regression, would strengthen the paper's context and contributions.
