### Key Points
This paper presents a study on cross-lingual math information retrieval (CLMIR), addressing the limitations of English-centric math search engines. The authors introduce the ARQMath dataset, translated into four languages, and propose an end-to-end translation and retrieval pipeline. The results indicate that the cross-lingual approach can achieve performance comparable to the original English queries, demonstrating the method's effectiveness. The paper emphasizes the need for multilingual support in math search and highlights the potential impact on global math search users.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of the problem, methodology, and results.  
- The introduction of the ARQMath dataset is a valuable contribution, providing a foundation for future research.  
- The masking-revealing approach improves translation quality for queries with mathematical formulas.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks sufficient baseline comparisons and detailed experimental analysis.  
- The evaluation does not adequately address how mathematical formulas are represented and utilized in retrieval models.  
- There is a need for more intrinsic metrics to measure translation accuracy and additional baselines to enhance the comprehensiveness of the experiments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including more baseline comparisons, such as using cross-encoders fine-tuned on relevance judgment and existing multilingual dense retrievers. Additionally, conducting an ablation study to assess the effectiveness of the model's modules would strengthen the evaluation. We suggest incorporating comparisons with simpler baseline systems, such as direct translations performed by the Google Translate API, to provide clearer performance insights. Finally, addressing how mathematical formulas should be effectively represented in retrieval models is crucial for enhancing query-document matching.
