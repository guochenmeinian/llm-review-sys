### Key Points
This paper presents BoxCD, a novel cognitive diagnosis model that utilizes contrastive probabilistic box embeddings to represent learners and exercises as high-dimensional axis-aligned hyper-rectangles (boxes). By optimizing these embeddings through contrastive learning and a rank-based prediction method, BoxCD effectively captures cognitive diversity and enhances response prediction efficiency. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that BoxCD outperforms traditional cognitive diagnosis models in both effectiveness and efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The use of box embeddings offers an intuitive geometric interpretation of learner and exercise relationships, aligning with psychological principles like monotonicity.
- The rank-based response prediction mechanism improves computational efficiency compared to traditional vector-based models, which is beneficial for large-scale online learning platforms.
- The paper is well-structured and presents clear mathematical formulations, making it accessible to readers.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the approach is somewhat incremental, as embedding-based cognitive diagnosis has been previously explored using vectors and probabilistic methods.
- The experimental analysis is limited to two datasets, which may not fully demonstrate the model's generalizability.
- The integration of contrastive learning and Gumbel-based volume objectives appears to be adaptations of existing techniques rather than significant innovations.
- The performance improvements over baseline models like RCD and NCDM are marginal in some cases, raising questions about the robustness of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental analysis by evaluating BoxCD on additional datasets with varied characteristics to strengthen the generalizability of the results. Providing a detailed workflow diagram for the model training process would enhance understanding of the interactions between different components of BoxCD. Additionally, a more thorough explanation of baseline models and their comparative performance would aid in contextualizing the results. We also suggest expanding the ablation study section to provide more detailed experimental evidence demonstrating the impact of the contrastive learning objective on model performance. Finally, addressing the limitations of traditional cognitive diagnosis methods with relevant citations or examples would strengthen the paper's claims regarding the advantages of BoxCD.
