Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel down-sampling operator in the Fourier domain, termed FouriDown, which introduces a new parameter, ‘w’, representing the weight of frequency aliasing during down-sampling. The authors address the significant issue of frequency aliasing in signal processing and propose a frequency-context adaptive superposing strategy that integrates seamlessly into existing image restoration networks. By revisiting down-sampling from a spectral perspective, they aim to improve performance across various computer vision tasks and network architectures. The manuscript emphasizes the importance of dynamic neighborhood computation and adaptive methods to enhance generalizability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors tackle the significant issue of frequency aliasing in image down-sampling, offering a well-founded solution through a meticulously crafted design.
- Comprehensive theoretical proofs support the proposed approach, enhancing its credibility.
- The FouriDown operator functions as a plug-and-play solution, consistently improving performance across diverse tasks.
- The proposed FouriDown(s,w) paradigm offers a fresh perspective on down-sampling, potentially leading to notable performance improvements.
- The authors effectively address the importance of dynamic methods in down-sampling, which is relevant given the increasing complexity of models and tasks.
- The writing is clear, with thorough explanations that facilitate understanding of the concepts.

Weaknesses:
- While quantitative results are satisfactory, additional efficiency analysis, including a table of parameters for the FouriDown operator, would be beneficial.
- The current limitation of the FouriDown operator to stride 2 down-sampling necessitates exploration of variants for broader applicability.
- More visual results should be presented, and the length of theorem proofs could be condensed for clarity.
- Figure 5, while intriguing, requires more detailed explanations to enhance reader comprehension.
- The contributions of the paper may be overclaimed, particularly regarding the novelty of addressing aliasing in deep learning, as previous works have explored this issue.
- The performance improvements across different tasks are not sufficiently analyzed, particularly the significant gap in performance between image/UHD enhancement and other tasks like deblurring and denoising.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including additional efficiency analyses, such as a table showcasing relevant metrics for the FouriDown operator. Exploring variants of the FouriDown operator that can handle more general scenarios would also be valuable. We suggest presenting more visual results and condensing the theorem proofs to improve clarity. Additionally, providing detailed explanations accompanying Figure 5 would greatly enhance understanding for readers. Furthermore, we recommend providing a more comprehensive analysis of the performance gap across tasks, particularly addressing the relationship between image enhancement and the aliasing problem. It would also be beneficial to clarify the distinction between their work and previous studies on aliasing to avoid misunderstandings about their contributions.
