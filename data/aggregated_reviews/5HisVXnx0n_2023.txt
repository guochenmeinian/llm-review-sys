Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents GLEMOS, the first benchmark for instantaneous graph learning (GL) model selection, featuring 360 models and 460 graphs for node classification and link prediction tasks. GLEMOS offers multiple benchmark testbeds, existing algorithms, and over one thousand meta-graph features to measure graph similarities effectively. The authors clarify that GLEMOS differs from existing benchmarks like GraphGym, GNN-Bank-101, and NAS-Bench-Graph by focusing on instantaneous model selection without requiring extensive model evaluations. The framework is designed to be flexible, allowing users to choose subsets or supersets of meta-graph features. The paper also reviews existing GL model selection methods, highlighting their limitations, and presents empirical results demonstrating GLEMOS's effectiveness in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, the authors discuss the potential for extending GLEMOS to include additional tasks such as graph classification and link prediction.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- GLEMOS is the first benchmark environment for instantaneous graph learning model selection, offering extensive benchmark data and a practical, automated framework.
- The paper provides a well-structured review of existing GL model selection methods, enhancing understanding of the current state-of-the-art.
- GLEMOS provides a comprehensive and diverse set of performance records (204,320), surpassing existing benchmarks in terms of the number of graph datasets and types of GL models, making it a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners.
- The framework is designed for easy extensibility with new models, graphs, and performance records, ensuring reproducibility and accessibility.
- The authors have addressed concerns regarding time complexity and the efficiency of model selection algorithms.

Weaknesses:
- The comparison of GLEMOS with existing methods is limited; a broader evaluation would enhance its effectiveness assessment.
- The rationale behind the selection of constructed graph meta-features is not fully articulated, and the ad-hoc nature of these features raises questions about their effectiveness.
- The absence of theoretical analysis leaves a gap in understanding the proposed method's limitations.
- The paper lacks a detailed evaluation of GLEMOS's extensibility and does not thoroughly discuss its own limitations, particularly regarding its effectiveness with graph datasets that differ significantly from those in the benchmark.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison of GLEMOS by including a wider range of existing GL model selection methods. Additionally, we suggest incorporating a theoretical analysis to deepen the understanding of the proposed method and its limitations. A more thorough evaluation of GLEMOS's extensibility should be provided to clarify its practical value. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to discuss the limitations of GLEMOS in detail to present a balanced evaluation. Lastly, we suggest expanding the discussion on the motivations behind the chosen meta-graph features and considering the inclusion of more tasks, such as link classification and graph classification, to further enrich GLEMOS.
