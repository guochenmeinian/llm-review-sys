### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of the correlations between geographic socioeconomic factors and sentiment toward interracial relationships through the analysis of posts on Chinese social media platforms. The authors utilize IP geolocation data, mandated in April 2022, to provide a novel contribution in sentiment analysis. The study examines discussions of four interracial relationship types on Douyin, highlighting regional differences in user attitudes and their correlates, such as GDP and openness to Western cultures.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study addresses an understudied area of immigration and xenophobia in Asia.
- The use of geolocation data mitigates sample selection issues.
- The writing is clear and the analysis is straightforward, with a commendable acknowledgment of limitations and ethical considerations.

Weaknesses:
- The reliability of geolocation data is questionable, with concerns about IP spoofing and VPN use.
- The selection process for topic categories appears subjective and arbitrary.
- There is insufficient detail regarding the hyperparameter choices and random initialization in topic modeling and sentiment analysis.
- The annotation process lacks clarity, particularly in terms of annotator training and model validation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the substantiation of the reliability of the geolocation data, addressing concerns about IP spoofing and VPN use. Additionally, the authors should provide justification for hyperparameter choices in topic modeling and sentiment analysis, and explore the sensitivity of results to random initialization. More information on the annotation process, including annotator training and model validation, is necessary. We also suggest expanding the discussion on Douyin for non-Chinese audiences and employing a keyword expansion tool to enhance search queries. Lastly, improving the readability of tables and normalizing title casing in subsection headers would enhance the paper's presentation.
