### Key Points
This paper presents a method called predictive treeplex Blackwell for applying Blackwell approachability directly to treeplexes, aimed at minimizing regret in extensive-form strategy sets. The authors demonstrate that their algorithm achieves $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret and that a smoothed version converges to Nash equilibrium at a rate of $O(1/T)$ in zero-sum games. The study emphasizes the significance of stepsize invariance across information sets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The method is conceptually intriguing and expands the application of Blackwell-based stepsize-invariant regret minimizers beyond the simplex. The experiments are thorough and effectively convey the importance of infoset-level stepsize invariance.

Weaknesses:  
Despite its conceptual merit, the method's advantages over CFR remain unclear, particularly regarding convergence rates and empirical performance. The algorithm appears to be consistently outperformed by PCFR+ in various games, and its per-iteration complexity is inferior by a logarithmic factor. Additionally, the experiments are somewhat challenging to interpret.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the advantages of their method over CFR, particularly in terms of convergence rates and empirical performance. It would be beneficial to provide a more detailed analysis of the regret bounds in Proposition 3.1 and to address the relationship between Smooth PTB+ and the Clairvoyant CFR+ algorithm. Furthermore, we suggest improving the clarity of the experimental results to enhance their readability. Lastly, exploring the extension of their approach beyond treeplexes to other convex sets could yield additional insights into stepsize-invariant regret minimizers.
