### Key Points
This paper presents a method to account for annotators' uncertainty by grouping data based on demographic features, particularly for subjective tasks like irony and hate speech detection. The authors propose perspective-aware models that aggregate predictions and confidence scores from classifiers trained on different demographic subsets. They also introduce a clustering method for cases lacking demographic data, contributing to the literature on annotator disagreement.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The approach addresses the important issue of capturing subjective viewpoints of annotators, which is crucial for improving model accuracy in subjective tasks.  
- The paper is well-written and encourages researchers to consider diverse perspectives in annotation efforts.  
- The experimental results support the claims made, demonstrating the potential utility of the proposed methods.  

Weaknesses:  
- The reliance on demographic splits to represent perspectives may not accurately reflect the complexity of perspectives, as acknowledged by the authors.  
- The method may overlook the nuances of multiple perspectives by selecting labels from only one demographic group, potentially leading to flawed conclusions.  
- The novelty of the work may be questioned, as some aspects resemble previously proposed methods, such as soft label aggregation.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how demographic groups relate to perspectives, addressing the concerns raised about the validity of these assumptions. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more robust justification for their choice of models and explore the implications of low confidence scores in their predictions. It would also be beneficial to report statistical significance for performance differences and clarify the rationale behind the selection of demographic dimensions for perspective grouping.
