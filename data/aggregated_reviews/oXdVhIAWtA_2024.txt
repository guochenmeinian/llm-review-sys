### Key Points
This paper presents a method for extracting discrete categories from continuous representations in neural networks through binary matrix factorization (BMF). The authors propose two algorithms: one for low-rank data based on a rejection sampler inspired by Hopfield networks, and another for full-rank data using iterative refinement. The work aims to interpret neural word embeddings, particularly word2vec, and demonstrates the algorithms' effectiveness on simulated data, addressing a significant gap in neural interpretability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well written and clearly structured.
- The problem formulation is original and innovative, particularly in enhancing the interpretability of distributed representations.
- The advantages and drawbacks of each algorithm are thoroughly discussed.
- The use of Hopfield-like networks for low-rank data is creative and well-motivated.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation of several quadruplets would have been relevant.
- The application is limited to neural embeddings or Word2Vec; exploring embeddings from advanced LLMs would be beneficial.
- The connection to cognitive science reasoning capabilities could be further developed.
- Some sections lack clarity, with incomplete definitions and unclear model predictions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the problem formulation, particularly in Section 2.1, by providing a rigorous definition of terms such as "analagram" and clarifying the model's prediction $\hat{X}$. Additionally, please ensure that all variables are defined, and clarify the conditions and parameters used in Algorithms 1 and 2. It may also be helpful to consider using Hasse diagrams of finite Boolean algebras instead of hypercube graphs for better accessibility. Finally, please elaborate on why you are confident that you “can do better than CKA 0.8.”
