### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework that integrates Variational Inference (VI) within a similarity space (S-space) to enhance Personalized Federated Learning (PFL). The authors propose a method that leverages Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) to address client heterogeneity and data scarcity, claiming improvements in generalization and reductions in overfitting. The contribution is evaluated through comprehensive experiments across five datasets, demonstrating strong theoretical foundations and a clear understanding of federated learning challenges.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The originality of combining VI with S-space for federated learning.  
- Strong theoretical analysis, including tighter KL divergence bounds, enhancing existing distributed Bayesian methods.  
- Robust experimental methodology with evaluations across multiple well-known datasets, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art PFL approaches.  
- Clear writing and detailed explanations of the methodology.

Weaknesses:  
- Some passages lack clarity and focus on the literature.  
- The introductory and benchmark sections could be more fleshed out, particularly with descriptions of other methods.  
- A summary flowchart of the method would enhance understanding.  
- Uncertainty regarding the evaluation of privacy in learning using metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of certain passages and enhance the introductory section by providing a brief overview of existing methods. Additionally, we suggest including a summary flowchart of the proposed method to facilitate understanding. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore the possibility of evaluating the privacy of learning using appropriate metrics.
