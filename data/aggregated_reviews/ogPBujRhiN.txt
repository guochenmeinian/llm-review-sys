Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the dissociation-based cognitive diagnosis (DisenCD) model, which addresses the cognitive diagnosis challenge of limited practice labels by utilizing students' historical practice records to model proficiency, practice difficulty, and practice label distribution. The authors propose two novel modules: group-based disentanglement and limited-labeled alignment, which disentangle relevant knowledge concepts and align them with the limited labels available. Experiments on three real datasets demonstrate the model's effectiveness, particularly in enhancing interpretability in scenarios with scarce labels.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Practical Approach: DisenCD effectively addresses cognitive diagnosis under limited exercise labels, representing a significant advancement in the field.
- Novel Modules: The introduction of group-based disentanglement and limited-labeled alignment modules improves accuracy and aligns knowledge concepts with available labels.
- Interpretability: The model achieves superior interpretability, especially in label-scarce scenarios, outperforming interpretable baselines in Degree-of-Alignment (DOA).

Weaknesses:
- Limited Generalizability: The model's effectiveness is demonstrated on only three datasets, raising concerns about its applicability to more diverse datasets.
- Lack of Explicit Discussion on Limitations: The paper does not adequately discuss the model's limitations, which may hinder readers' understanding of its implications.
- Complexity: The model's complexity may pose challenges for practitioners, particularly regarding implementation and tuning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the descriptions for the group-based disentanglement and limited-labeled alignment modules to enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest including a detailed discussion of the model's limitations to provide a more comprehensive perspective. The authors should also consider conducting ablation studies to verify the effectiveness of each component of the model. Furthermore, providing more details on the pre-filling algorithm for the Q-matrix and hyperparameter settings would strengthen the experimental section. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the interpretability aspect of their model, including illustrative examples that demonstrate how disentangled factors relate to knowledge concepts in the Q matrix.
