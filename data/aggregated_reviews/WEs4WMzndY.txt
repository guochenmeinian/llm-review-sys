### Key Points
This paper presents Annealed Multiple Choice Learning (aMCL), which integrates simulated annealing with Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) to address ambiguities in output labels. The authors demonstrate that the winner-takes-all (WTA) method in MCL can lead to issues such as sensitivity to initialization. They propose a soft-weighting approach that utilizes a temperature parameter to improve the optimization process. The paper includes extensive theoretical analysis and validation across various datasets, although it notes that epsilon-MCL often outperforms aMCL.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of simulated annealing with MCL is novel and effective, leading to a fully differentiable objective in equation (6).
- The theoretical analysis is extensive and well-articulated.
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear mathematical development.

Weaknesses:
- The introduction of a temperature schedule complicates the method, making it less straightforward than epsilon-MCL, which has a fixed hyperparameter.
- Empirical results are underwhelming, with aMCL performing similarly to epsilon-MCL on UCI datasets and showing minimal improvement on speech separation datasets.
- The paper lacks a detailed discussion on the limitations and robustness of aMCL compared to vanilla MCL across different initializations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the trade-off between distortion and RMSE in the main paper, rather than relying solely on Table 1. Additionally, we suggest including a more in-depth discussion on why aMCL does not consistently outperform epsilon-MCL, possibly addressing the tuning challenges of the temperature schedule. Expanding on the robustness results in Figure 8 and providing more random seeds could enhance the analysis. Finally, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the relationship between aMCL and rMCL, as well as consider the potential of stochastic simulated annealing.
