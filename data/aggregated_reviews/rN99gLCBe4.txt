Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a continuous-time analysis of an acceleration method called "anchoring," extending the continuous time analysis anchor ODE to a more general choice of the coefficient $\beta(t)$. The authors demonstrate the correspondence with discrete anchoring schemes, convergence to a minimal $\ell_2$-distance from initialization, tightness of continuous time rates, and convergence of APPM with a more general stepsize. They also introduce an adaptive method for anchor acceleration that achieves faster convergence rates and is robust to noise and non-convex problems, supported by numerical experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the convergence rate of anchor acceleration, including both constant and adaptive cases.  
- The theoretical proofs, particularly Theorem 3.1 and Theorem 6.2, are solid and well-presented.  
- The adaptive method shows promising results, achieving faster convergence rates and robustness in various optimization scenarios.  

Weaknesses:  
- The motivation for considering $\beta(t)$ beyond $1/t$ is unclear, as $1/t$ is already optimal, and this complicates the proof.  
- The paper lacks upfront contextualization with existing work, which could enhance understanding and motivation.  
- There is insufficient discussion on the limitations of the adaptive method and comparisons with other state-of-the-art optimization methods.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for using $\beta(t)$ other than $1/t$ and explicitly state the benefits of this choice. Additionally, contextualizing results with existing work earlier in the paper would enhance reader comprehension. We suggest including a comparison of the adaptive method with other optimization techniques and a more detailed discussion of its limitations and areas for future research. Finally, addressing the technical challenges encountered when applying continuous analysis to anchor acceleration would strengthen the paper's contributions.
