Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Wave-GD, a score-based generative model aimed at generating graphs with high fidelity. The authors propose that by capturing the dependency between nodes and edges at multiple resolutions in the spectral space, the model overcomes the over-smoothing problem and achieves realistic frequency characteristics of nodes and edges. The approach extends the GDSS method by introducing an additional loss term that encourages the learning of spectrally modified matrices alongside standard adjacency matrices. The model is evaluated on various datasets, showing promising results in graph generation tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a clear motivation and acknowledgment of limitations in previous models.
2. The adaptation of diffusion models to graph generation is timely and intriguing, with empirical results demonstrating effectiveness in generating realistic graphs.
3. The model shows increased stability during training compared to GDSS, and the experimental setup is clearly presented.

Weaknesses:
1. The experiments lack sufficient baselines, particularly those utilizing spectral information or graph characteristics.
2. The datasets used are too simplistic, limiting the exploration of over-smoothing; more complex graphs should be tested.
3. The presentation of key concepts, such as SDE learning, is unclear and requires improvement for better understanding.
4. The core claims regarding coherence and multi-resolution are not adequately verified, and the model's limitations to small graphs need addressing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including additional baselines that utilize spectral information and testing on more complex graph datasets, such as Planar graphs, SBM graphs, and larger networks. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the presentation of SDE learning by highlighting differences from GDSS and improving the descriptions of figures and equations for better comprehension. It would also be beneficial to provide experimental analysis demonstrating whether the main contributions arise from coherence or multi-resolution. Lastly, addressing the parameter selection for *J* and its relationship with different datasets could enhance practical applicability.
