Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents scCello, a Transcriptome Foundation Model (TFM) that integrates cell ontology information to enhance cell representation learning from single-cell RNA sequencing data. The authors propose a pretraining framework that includes masked gene expression prediction, cell-type coherence loss, and ontology alignment loss, allowing the model to learn gene coexpression patterns and structural relationships between cell types. scCello is pretrained on 22 million cells from the CellxGene repository and demonstrates superior performance in downstream tasks such as cell type clustering, identification, marker gene prediction, and batch integration.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of cell ontology information significantly enhances the model's ability to learn biologically meaningful cell representations.
- The methodology is well-structured and clearly articulated, with comprehensive experiments validating the model's effectiveness across various tasks.
- The use of a multi-component loss function allows for nuanced representation learning, improving generalization and transferability.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on labeled data for pretraining may limit the scalability of scCello compared to methods that do not require annotated data.
- The paper lacks a rigorous theoretical analysis of the proposed objectives, which could strengthen the understanding of their impact on learning.
- Limited comparative analysis against specialized methods for downstream tasks reduces the clarity of scCello's advantages.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical justification for the integration of cell ontology into the TFM pretraining, detailing how the proposed objective functions contribute to more informative cell representations. Additionally, the authors should provide a more comprehensive comparison of scCello's performance against specialized methods designed for tasks like cell type identification and marker gene prediction. Finally, addressing the limitations related to the need for labeled data and the model's adaptability to evolving cell ontology would enhance the paper's robustness.
