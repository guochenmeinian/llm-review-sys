Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into whether estimating the difference between the values of individual policies can expedite the identification of the best policy in reinforcement learning (RL), specifically in contextual bandits and tabular RL. The authors propose an algorithm, PERP, which improves sample complexity compared to existing literature while providing a nuanced analysis of the challenges in tabular RL. The work contributes a new lower bound for the problem and clarifies the limitations of previous approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- **Relevant Problem**: The theoretical question of achieving optimal sample complexity in identifying the best policy is significant and has practical implications.
- **Novel, Important Results**: The analysis of $(\epsilon, \delta)$-PAC policy identification in tabular RL provides valuable insights and introduces an algorithm that enhances sample complexity.
- **Well-Written**: The paper is clearly structured, with an engaging introduction that effectively positions the contribution within the existing literature.

Weaknesses:
- **Complex Implementation**: The algorithm's complexity, particularly the need to enumerate all policies from $\Pi$, limits its practical applicability to simpler problems.
- **Lack of Intuition**: Certain values, such as $U(\pi, \bar{\pi})$ and $\hat{\delta}^\pi_h$, could benefit from additional intuitive explanations to aid interpretation of the resulting bounds.
- **Computational Complexity Omitted**: The paper does not address the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm, which is essential for understanding its feasibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of certain technical terms, such as $U(\pi, \bar{\pi})$ and $\hat{\delta}^\pi_h$, to enhance reader comprehension. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion on the computational complexity of the PERP algorithm to provide a complete understanding of its practicality. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore ways to simplify the algorithm to make it more applicable to a broader range of problems, even if it means sacrificing some guarantees.
