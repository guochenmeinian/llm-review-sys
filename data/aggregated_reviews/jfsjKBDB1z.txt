### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for semi-supervised video object segmentation (VOS) that integrates pre-trained deep features from still images with streaming-data clustering techniques. The authors propose modeling objects and backgrounds as dynamic ensembles of von Mises-Fisher mixtures, eliminating the need for additional training on videos and maintaining a low memory footprint by storing only cluster-level information. The method incorporates spatial coherence, outlier rejection, and convolutional conditional random fields, achieving state-of-the-art results on the DAVIS-2017 and YouTube-VOS 2018 benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The method effectively eliminates the need for costly supervised training on videos by utilizing pre-trained features from still images.  
- The approach demonstrates a low memory footprint, allowing for potential processing of long videos.  
- The paper provides a comprehensive study of the algorithm's components, with visually and numerically impressive results.

Weaknesses:  
- Most compared methods target correspondence learning, which can handle both VOS and tracking, making the state-of-the-art performance of this work somewhat expected.  
- The backbone requires pre-training on millions of static images, which may not be representative of the datasets used.  
- Performance improvements on YouTube-VOS 2018 are less significant compared to DAVIS-2017 and inferior to existing methods with stronger backbones.  
- The inference speed and computational burden of multiple vMF mixture models are not adequately addressed.  
- The notation and optimization objectives are complex and could be clearer, particularly for readers unfamiliar with the subject.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the notation and optimization objectives, possibly by starting with a simpler two-class case before extending to multiple classes. Additionally, the authors should investigate the impact of using higher-quality pre-trained models on the algorithm's performance and provide comparisons in terms of parameters, GFLOPs, or FPS to substantiate claims of a low memory footprint. It would also be beneficial to explore the method's performance on unseen examples and clarify how it compares to baseline methods regarding speed and memory utilization.
