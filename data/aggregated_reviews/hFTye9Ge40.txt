Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the best arm identification (BAI) problem in a fixed confidence Bayesian setting, where the mean rewards of each arm are drawn from a known prior distribution. The authors formulate the problem, provide a lower bound for the expected sample complexity, and demonstrate that popular frequentist algorithms, such as the top-two and tack-and-stop algorithms, are suboptimal in the Bayesian context. They propose a new successive elimination algorithm that achieves optimal sample complexity up to a logarithmic factor and validate their findings through simulations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The problem is clearly defined, and the paper is well-presented.
2. It effectively demonstrates the suboptimality of frequentist algorithms in the Bayesian setting.
3. The use of a simpler 2-arm version aids in understanding the theorems and proofs.

Weaknesses:
1. The assumption that all arms follow a Gaussian distribution may be too stringent, as the literature includes broader distributions like sub-Gaussian and non-parametric cases.
2. The confidence interval is not optimized to the tightest bounds suggested in the lil-UCB paper.
3. The proofs for the lower and upper bounds rely on standard techniques, lacking discussion on their challenges.
4. The upper bound is not optimal compared to the lower bound, presenting an extra logarithmic factor.
5. Simulations are limited to two sets of experiments with few compared algorithms and should include varying $\delta$ values.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generality of their model by considering a wider range of arm distributions beyond Gaussian. Additionally, we suggest optimizing the confidence interval to align with the tightest bounds from the lil-UCB paper. The authors should clarify the challenges in their proofs and explore methods to reduce the gap between the upper and lower bounds, possibly by modifying the top-two or tack-and-stop algorithms. Expanding the simulation experiments to include more diverse algorithms and varying $\delta$ values would enhance the robustness of their findings.
