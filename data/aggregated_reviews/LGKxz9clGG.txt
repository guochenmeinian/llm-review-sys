Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extensive empirical evaluation of the influence of neural architecture design on federated learning (FL) performance in visual recognition tasks, particularly under non-iid data conditions. The authors conduct experiments with 19 models from five architectural families across four federated datasets, comparing results against centralized training and various optimization methods. The findings highlight the significant impact of architectural choices, particularly the effectiveness of layer normalization over batch normalization in non-iid FL settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-motivated, addressing the gap between outdated architectures in FL research and state-of-the-art (SOTA) architectures in visual recognition.
2. It provides a thorough experimental study, analyzing multiple datasets, optimizers, and architectures, which offers valuable insights into the roles of architecture and optimizer in FL.
3. The writing is clear and easy to follow, making complex concepts accessible.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks technical novelty, primarily applying existing SOTA models to non-iid FL without developing new methods or insights. More fine-grained studies on architecture effects, such as feature skew and label skew settings, would enhance the contribution.
2. There is insufficient discussion on the relationship between architectural choices and other factors, such as communication costs in FL. Additionally, the paper does not clearly define or measure data heterogeneity, complicating comparisons across datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the technical novelty by designing an architecture with a customized optimizer that achieves better performance. Additionally, conducting more detailed studies on the effects of architecture on feature skew and label skew settings would be beneficial. We also suggest providing a clearer definition of data heterogeneity and discussing how findings relate to communication costs in FL. Finally, addressing the limitations of the study explicitly would strengthen the paper.
