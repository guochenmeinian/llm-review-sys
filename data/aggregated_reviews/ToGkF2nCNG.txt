### Key Points
This paper presents a system for automating the Child Mindreading Test, leveraging machine reading comprehension techniques to enhance automatic psychological evaluation for children's mindreading. The authors propose a multi-modal learning framework that incorporates stories and video clips alongside traditional question-and-answer inputs. The experiments demonstrate a 1-2% improvement over baseline models, with human evaluations indicating alignment with expert assessments. The system employs different encoders for text and video, introducing a DUMA layer to manage multiple test types.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a novel NLP task, Mindreading tests, and the proposed system is reasonably motivated and structured.
- Experimental results, including ablation and case studies, support the effectiveness of the system.
- The paper is well-written, and the experimental setup is reproducible.

Weaknesses:
- The task and dataset appear trivial, with high baseline accuracy suggesting potential bias or simplicity.
- The paper lacks novelty, applying existing techniques without significant technical contributions, which may diminish interest in the NLP community.
- Insufficient details regarding the human study, such as the number of experts and evaluation score distributions, weaken the reliability of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their contributions by exploring more complex tasks or datasets to better demonstrate the system's capabilities. Additionally, providing comprehensive details about the human study, including the number of experts involved and the distribution of evaluation scores, would enhance the credibility of the proposed method. Clarifying the real-world impact of the 1-2% improvement in evaluation scores would also strengthen the paper's relevance to the NLP community.
