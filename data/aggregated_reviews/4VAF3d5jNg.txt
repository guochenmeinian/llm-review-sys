Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an adaptive label-efficient forecasting technique for online binary prediction with expert advice. The proposed method utilizes a label querying probability that adapts to the observed scenario, allowing for lower label complexity in benign environments while maintaining robustness against adversarial conditions. The authors provide sharp analyses of regret and label complexity, along with empirical evaluations demonstrating the method's effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
* The paper is well-written and organized.
* The introduced algorithm is novel and intuitive, with sound regret and label complexity analyses.
* The method addresses the adaptivity shortcoming of prior approaches, enabling fewer label queries in benign scenarios while remaining robust in adversarial ones.
* Empirical evaluations support the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
* The method is limited to binary prediction tasks with zero-one loss.
* Additional context on prior work in label-efficient prediction would enhance understanding of the proposed approach's benefits.
* The assumption that there exists a unique optimal expert with a specific margin $\Delta$ may be too strong, raising questions about its applicability in real-world scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the contextualization of their work by providing additional details on prior research in label-efficient prediction. Furthermore, we suggest clarifying the implications of the assumption regarding the unique optimal expert and exploring its relevance to real-world applications. Additionally, addressing the relationship between the PEA setting and bandit scenarios could enhance the paper's contribution. Lastly, we encourage the authors to refine the writing by defining undefined symbols and clarifying terms such as "pessimistic" in the context of the regret bound.
