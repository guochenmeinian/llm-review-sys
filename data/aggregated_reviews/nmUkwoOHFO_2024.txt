### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of the internal dynamics of large language models (LLMs) under in-context learning (ICL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using the Advanced Density Peaks (ADP) algorithm. The authors investigate how these strategies affect the representation landscapes within the model, revealing that ICL promotes a hierarchical organization based on semantic content in early layers, while SFT results in sharper, more defined representations in later layers. The findings are derived from experiments conducted on the MMLU question answering benchmark using Llama-3, Llama-2, and Mistral-7B models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper employs a novel approach by analyzing the geometric properties of hidden representations, providing new insights into ICL and SFT dynamics.  
- Extensive experiments yield interesting findings, particularly regarding the two-phased nature of representation landscapes and the distinct fingerprints of ICL and SFT across layers.  
- The methodological framework, including the use of ADP and linkage clustering, is insightful and demonstrates the organization of information in internal model layers.

Weaknesses:  
- Clarity issues hinder the understanding of the ADA algorithm and the organization of discussions in the results section, making it difficult to extract insights.  
- The originality and significance of the contributions are questioned, as the adaptation of ADA algorithms lacks substantial novelty.  
- The experimental analysis is limited to the MMLU benchmark, restricting the generalizability of the findings.  
- Typos and formatting issues throughout the paper need correction.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the ADA algorithm description and organize the results section to facilitate better insight extraction. Additionally, consider extending the experimental analysis to other benchmarks to enhance the work's impact. We encourage the authors to provide more details on the average linkage experiments and improve the writing and readability of the subsection "Hierarchical organization of density peaks." Finally, please address the identified typos and formatting inconsistencies in the manuscript.
