Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method named LoD-Loc for visual localization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) using Level-of-Detail (LoD) 3D maps. The authors propose a hierarchical cost volume approach to refine pose estimation based on wireframe probabilities derived from images, ultimately utilizing a differentiable Gaussian-Newton method for pose refinement. The paper claims to outperform existing methods that rely on textured 3D models, emphasizing advantages in memory efficiency and privacy preservation. Additionally, the authors contribute two datasets for further research in aerial localization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The methodology is interesting, as it reduces reliance on complex 3D representations, making it more accessible for practical applications.
2. LoD maps are easier to acquire and maintain, enhancing the feasibility of the method in large-scale environments.
3. The contribution of two large-scale datasets is valuable for the research community.

Weaknesses:
1. The innovation of the Level-of-Detail concept is not clearly articulated, as it has been widely explored in prior research.
2. The computational efficiency and resource requirements for real-time UAV applications are not addressed.
3. The method's robustness is questionable, particularly when relying on a coarse initial pose from the UAV sensor.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the innovation behind the Level-of-Detail concept and explicitly discuss its computational efficiency and resource requirements. Additionally, the authors should explore how the method could be adapted for larger-scale pose search scenarios, especially in environments with poor GPS signals. It would be beneficial to compare the proposed method against traditional line segment extraction techniques to provide insights into the necessity of the wireframe probability extraction. Finally, we suggest enhancing the presentation of results, particularly in Tables, and providing more detailed explanations for experimental outcomes to support the proposed method's claims.
