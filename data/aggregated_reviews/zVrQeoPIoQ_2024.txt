Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel paradigm for Image Exposure Assessment (IEA), transitioning from image-level to pixel-level evaluation through the Pixel-level IEA Network (P-IEANet). The model utilizes discrete wavelet transform (Haar DWT) to analyze images, separating them into low and high-frequency components for brightness and structure assessment, respectively. The authors have developed a new dataset, IEA40K, comprising 40,000 images with diverse exposures and pixel-level annotations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a pixel-level assessment paradigm significantly enhances precision in IEA.
- The use of discrete wavelet transform is an intriguing choice, supported by ablation studies.
- The large-scale dataset IEA40K, annotated by experts, provides valuable resources for the community.
- The P-IEANet shows potential for improving low-light image enhancement methods.
- The paper is well-structured, with clear language and logical flow.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a clear definition of pixel-level image exposure assessment, leading to confusion.
- Terminology, such as "exposure" and "exposure residual," is inadequately defined, complicating understanding.
- The motivation for the proposed method is ambiguous, lacking clear articulation of its necessity.
- The rationale behind the definition of "exposure residual" requires further justification.
- Evaluation metrics are limited to SSIM; including PSNR would strengthen the argument.
- Important architectural details of the proposed model are missing, affecting reproducibility.
- The availability of the dataset to the public is not clearly addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of terminology, particularly regarding "pixel-level exposure" and "exposure residual," to enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed motivation for the proposed method, including visual results from existing holistic evaluation methods to illustrate the identified issues. Justifying the definition of "exposure residual" and exploring its relationship with pixel-wise scores would strengthen the methodology. Incorporating PSNR alongside SSIM in evaluation metrics is advisable for a more comprehensive analysis. We also encourage the authors to include architectural details of the Long Range Encoder and Short Range Encoder to facilitate reproducibility. Finally, ensuring the public availability of the IEA40K dataset is crucial for assessing the contribution of this work.
