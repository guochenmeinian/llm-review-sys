Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents TSB-AD, a benchmark for time-series anomaly detection that addresses issues such as dataset deficiencies, biased evaluation metrics, and inconsistent benchmarking practices. It provides high-quality datasets, reliable evaluation metrics, and a variety of detection algorithms, while also open-sourcing these resources to promote further research. The findings indicate that simpler statistical methods often outperform advanced neural networks, emphasizing the importance of careful data handling.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and clearly presents its contributions, including a comprehensive analysis of existing datasets and metrics.
- It offers a curated dataset from 33 domains and evaluates 35 detection algorithms, providing valuable insights into their performance.
- The open-sourcing of datasets and implementations enhances transparency and encourages further research.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a comparison with baseline results from previous studies, which is crucial for contextualizing its findings.
- The manual effort involved in dataset curation and algorithm evaluation is insufficiently detailed, making it difficult to assess quality.
- Some experimental setups and parameters are not adequately described, and there are language issues that need addressing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with baseline results reported in other papers to contextualize their findings better. Additionally, please provide more details on the manual effort involved in curating the datasets and evaluating the algorithms to enhance transparency. We suggest clarifying the definition of anomalies in Section 4.1.1 and addressing the potential oversimplification of detection difficulty when selecting the top 40% of ranked time-series. Furthermore, a better description of the figures, especially the critical difference plots in Fig. 7, would be beneficial for readers unfamiliar with this type of analysis. Lastly, consider using a repository like Zenodo for dataset hosting to ensure versioning and persistent access.
