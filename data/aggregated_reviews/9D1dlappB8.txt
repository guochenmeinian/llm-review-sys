### Key Points
This paper presents Air-CAD, an edge-assisted multi-drone network designed for crowd anomaly detection (CAD). It investigates the effects of flight conditions on CAD performance and introduces a system comprising three main modules: 1) a Zoom Detector for dynamic depth and focus adjustments, 2) a Feature Scheduler for efficient data offloading to edge devices, and 3) a Feature Analyser that implements a multi-feature anomaly detection algorithm. The system is evaluated through simulations and real-world experiments using the ArmyStampede dataset, demonstrating superior performance in terms of speed and accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized and presents a logical flow of ideas.
- The system design and methodology are robust.
- The authors provide insights into performance parameters that could inspire future architectural improvements.
- The combination of drone networks with edge computing is a novel approach.
- The evaluation is thorough, utilizing appropriate metrics and visual aids.

Weaknesses:
- The relevance of the work to the WebConf conference is questionable.
- AUROC is limited for imbalanced datasets; additional metrics like precision-recall curves or F1 scores are necessary for a comprehensive performance evaluation.
- The dataset appears imbalanced, as indicated by the F1 score comparisons.
- There are writing issues, including missing figures and typos that could lead to confusion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by addressing the following points:
- Provide a clearer justification for the relevance of Air-CAD to the WebConf track, particularly regarding its integration with the Web of Things (WoT).
- Clarify the differences in metrics used for evaluating shooting parameters, specifically the use of AUROC in Figure 2a and accuracy in Figure 3a.
- Include detailed information on the ArmyStampede dataset, such as the percentage of normal versus abnormal instances and labeling methods.
- Correct the references to missing figures and typos, specifically regarding Figure 13 and the term "Shooting Parameters."
- Discuss security and privacy measures in data handling, as well as the feasibility and sustainability of Air-CAD in practical applications, including drone battery life and control challenges.
- Explore the applicability of Air-CAD in various scenarios, including different scales and environments.
- Address the limitations of existing work in the related work section to provide context for the proposed solution.
