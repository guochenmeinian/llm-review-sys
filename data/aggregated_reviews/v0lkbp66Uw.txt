Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a hybrid approach that combines symbolic planning and object-oriented POMDPs for egocentric planning in embodied environments, achieving strong performance on the ALFRED benchmark and winning the 2022 CVPR challenge. The authors propose a method that integrates a visual module for semantic segmentation, an egocentric planner, and a semantic spatial graph for scene memorization. Additionally, the authors introduce a method for learning PDDL symbolic models within a planning context that assumes full observability and deterministic actions. They discuss the challenges of managing an information graph or mental state in agents, particularly regarding updates due to changes in the environment. The approach includes an initial exploration phase of 500 steps to gather information, which is crucial for effective planning. The results indicate significant improvements over previous methods like FILM, particularly in generalization to new tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method enables out-of-the-box generalization to new task types within the same set of objects and relationships.
- The spatial semantic graph is a scalable alternative to explicit maps for solving ALFRED tasks.
- The authors provide a clear framework for learning PDDL models and reference significant prior work to support their claims.
- The discussion on adapting to environmental changes and the potential for egocentric planning algorithms is insightful and relevant.
- The writing is clear, and the method has been thoroughly tested, demonstrating robust performance.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on deterministic action effects limits real-world applicability, and the discussion of alternatives as baselines could be perceived as unfair.
- The need for an exploration phase appears ad hoc, lacking a clear rationale for why the main algorithm cannot determine exploration timing.
- The clarity of exposition is poor in several areas, including the construction of the spatial graph and the definition of the Cost POMDP, hindering reproducibility.
- The reliance on initial exploration phases may limit the effectiveness of the proposed method in dynamic environments.
- There is a lack of clarity regarding the distinctions between LGS-RPA and other tasks, which could hinder understanding of the contributions.
- Concerns remain about the planning time for real-world applications and the completeness of technical descriptions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the exposition, particularly regarding the construction and use of the spatial graph, as well as the definition of the Cost POMDP. Additionally, we encourage the authors to rephrase the discussion on alternatives to avoid potential misinterpretations. It would be beneficial to provide a more detailed analysis of how the exploration actions are defined and to clarify the role of the 500 exploration steps in the overall planning process. We also suggest that the authors improve the clarity of distinctions between LGS-RPA and other tasks in the main paper, as well as explain why comparisons with other baselines are not feasible. Furthermore, we recommend including planning time metrics for real-world applications in their discussions or limitations section. Lastly, we encourage the authors to ensure that the clarity on PDDL assumptions and prior work on learning PDDL is consistently reflected throughout the main paper.
