### Key Points
This paper presents SymAgent, a novel neural-symbolic self-learning agent framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs (KGs) for reasoning tasks on complex knowledge graphs. The authors propose a self-learning mechanism that allows the model to dynamically extract symbolic rules and perform complex reasoning, addressing issues of KG incompleteness and LLM hallucinations. Experimental results demonstrate that SymAgent outperforms or matches existing baselines across various datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in reasoning tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of LLMs and KGs through a self-learning framework is a notable innovation, enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities.
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with strong experimental validation of the proposed method's performance.
- SymAgent effectively addresses the incompleteness of KGs and the hallucination issues associated with LLMs.

Weaknesses:
- Some figures, particularly Figure 2, are cluttered and hinder reader comprehension.
- The discussion on the model's limitations is insufficient, lacking exploration of challenges in specific scenarios and scalability concerns for larger KGs.
- The self-learning framework's reliance on LLMs raises concerns about performance fluctuations due to the hallucination problem.
- The appendix appears incomplete, and the paper does not adequately address the time and resource costs associated with the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of figures, particularly by addressing the clutter in diagrams like Figure 2. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed discussion of the model's limitations in specific scenarios and explore potential future research directions. It would be beneficial to include a comprehensive analysis of the time and resource consumption of SymAgent compared to baseline methods. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors clarify how the Agent-Planner extracts symbolic rules and how these rules influence the reasoning process. Finally, the authors should ensure that the appendix is complete and includes all necessary details.
