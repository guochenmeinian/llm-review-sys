Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for calibrating simulation models through an active learning framework that maximizes expected information gain (EIG) about calibration parameters. The authors propose a Gaussian process model that jointly optimizes design and calibration parameters, addressing the challenge of aligning simulations with real observations. The algorithm is validated on both synthetic and real datasets, aiming for data efficiency in Bayesian adaptive experimental design.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, providing comprehensive background information and a thorough literature review.
- The method is technically sound, with experiments supporting the claims and a clear articulation of the problem and proposed solution.
- The approach of using a single Gaussian process to model calibration and design parameters jointly is novel and relevant to engineering and physical sciences.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the method is questioned, as the use of a variational lower bound to replace EIG has been explored in existing literature.
- The comparison of the proposed method is limited to "Random" and "IMSPE," lacking a broader evaluation against other Bayesian optimal design methods.
- The paper primarily presents results on small datasets, raising concerns about the scalability and applicability of the method to larger, more complex problems.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by specifying the contributions and novelty more distinctly, particularly in relation to existing Bayesian optimal design methods. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with a wider range of state-of-the-art alternatives to strengthen the validation of the proposed method. An ablation study to assess the benefits of jointly optimizing design and calibration parameters would also be valuable. Furthermore, a discussion on the sensitivity of BACON's performance to hyperparameters and the implications of using variational inference in scenarios where it may struggle would enhance the paper's robustness. Lastly, addressing minor issues such as typos, figure clarity, and referencing of tables would improve the overall presentation.
