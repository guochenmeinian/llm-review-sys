Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on online convex optimization (OCO) focusing on feasible sets with curvature conditions, introducing the sphere-enclosed property to achieve logarithmic regret bounds in stochastic environments. The authors demonstrate that their approach generalizes previous work by allowing non-linear losses and extending results to stochastic corrupted environments. They show that algorithms can achieve regret bounds interpolating between $\log T$ and $\sqrt{T}$ for uniformly convex sets, addressing gaps left by prior research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of sphere-enclosure provides a novel characterization of feasible sets, enabling $\log T$ regret improvements over previous methods, clearly explained with helpful figures.
- The theoretical contributions include strong upper and matching lower bounds, with proofs that are generally straightforward due to the framework of universal online learning.
- The interpolation of regret rates for uniformly convex sets effectively closes a gap in existing literature.

Weaknesses:
- The improvement over FTL is primarily in stochastic environments; in fully adversarial settings, the regret remains $\sqrt{T}$, raising questions about the analysis.
- Many results are limited to the $\ell_2$-norm, with unclear applicability to arbitrary norms; discussions on the relationship between uniformly convex and sphere-enclosed sets are needed.
- Some assumptions, such as $x^\star$ being on the boundary of $K$, require further justification, particularly beyond linear losses.
- Certain sections lack clarity, with potential typos and inconsistencies in notation that hinder readability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the analysis in Theorem 9, explicitly stating the relationship between the inequalities and addressing any potential typos. Additionally, a discussion on the implications of the assumption regarding $x^\star$ and its necessity would enhance the paper. It would also be beneficial to explore the extension of results to arbitrary norms and clarify the connection between uniformly convex sets and sphere-enclosed sets. Finally, we suggest revising the organization to reduce inline proofs for better readability.
