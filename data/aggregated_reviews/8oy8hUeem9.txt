### Key Points
This paper presents InstOptima, a multi-objective framework for optimizing instruction generation using large language models (LLMs) like chatGPT. It employs a genetic algorithm to enhance instruction quality across dimensions such as performance, length, and perplexity. The authors report superior performance on various datasets through iterative optimization. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The method provides a clear framework for improving instructions with LLMs.  
2. The multi-objective optimization approach is a promising strategy for instruction generation.  
3. The paper is easy to read and demonstrates effective experimental results.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The paper lacks sufficient detail to be self-contained, particularly in experimental settings and related work.  
2. The experimental validation of robustness against adversarial attacks is insufficient.  
3. The comparison of algorithms is limited, and the performance gap is influenced by the backbone model used.  
4. The organization of the paper requires improvement, with crucial sections relegated to the appendix.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and detail of the paper to ensure it is self-contained, particularly regarding experimental settings and the rationale behind using a genetic algorithm. Additionally, we suggest including a broader range of algorithms for comparison and providing quantified results to substantiate claims about robustness against adversarial attacks. The authors should also consider using more powerful backbone models and reorganizing the content to enhance readability and coherence. Finally, addressing the questions posed by reviewers regarding specific methodologies and performance metrics would strengthen the paper.
