Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a systematic approach to learning optimal parameters for data-driven algorithm design, focusing on the efficiency of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). The authors propose a cell enumeration algorithm that operates in output-polynomial time, leveraging a breadth-first search on a cell adjacency graph with an output-sensitive enumeration of neighbors based on Clarkson's algorithm. The paper applies this method to linkage-based clustering and dynamic programming-based sequence alignment, demonstrating improved time complexity in various algorithm design problems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper addresses the significant issue of optimizing algorithm parameters in data-driven algorithm design.  
2. The theoretical results in Table 1 appear robust compared to previous findings.  
3. The output-sensitive cell enumeration may hold independent interest in computational geometry.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The absence of implementations and experimental results diminishes the paper's appeal.  
2. The paper's density makes it challenging to follow the technical details.  
3. The framework is limited to linear boundary functions and a constant number of parameters, lacking significant improvements in worst-case running times.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation to enhance accessibility for a broader audience. Additionally, providing implementations and experimental results would strengthen the paper's contributions. We also suggest exploring the generalizability of the approach to other data-driven algorithm design problems, potentially identifying a generic principle or characterization for its applicability.
