Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a dataset designed to measure visual alignment between AI and humans in object recognition tasks, categorizing images into Must-Act, Must-Abstain, and Uncertain groups. The authors propose a scoring system for reliability that differentiates between abstention and misclassification, emphasizing the need for distinct scores to reflect model performance accurately. They evaluate 12 models and methods on this dataset, aiming to provide insights into model reliability across these categories. The authors argue that existing datasets do not meet their rigorous requirements, including clear class definitions, familiarity to average individuals, coverage of diverse scenarios, and ground truth labels for each sample. They claim to be the first to comprehensively explore this alignment, although they acknowledge that the Uncertain category has not been widely considered in prior work and is limited to corrupted images.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to understand.
- It addresses an important issue in visual perception alignment.
- The dataset design is structured and considers multiple scenarios, including various types of image corruption.
- The use of Hellinger distance instead of KL divergence is a novel and well-motivated choice.
- The dataset is designed with clear objectives and rigorous criteria, ensuring high-quality samples.
- The authors provide a detailed explanation of their scoring system, enhancing the interpretability of model performance.
- The inclusion of control samples and the calculation of intra-annotator consistency demonstrate a commitment to data quality.

Weaknesses:
- The claim of being the first to explore visual perception alignment is exaggerated; previous works have addressed similar topics.
- The Uncertain category is limited to corrupted images and does not encompass subjective interpretations or realistic uncertainties.
- The reliability score's interpretation is unclear, lacking a fixed reference point, complicating understanding.
- The dataset's novelty compared to existing works is not adequately justified, and some details, such as IRB approval and MTurk experiment controls, are missing.
- The dataset is limited to only 10 classes, which may restrict its applicability in broader contexts.
- Some images may still introduce uncertainty, indicating potential oversight in the filtering process.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of prior work, particularly addressing the contributions of Peterson et al. and Schmarje et al., and clarifying how their dataset differs from existing datasets. Additionally, we suggest expanding the Uncertain category to include subjective interpretations and exploring unique human visual phenomena. It would also be beneficial to simplify the reliability score reporting to percentages for better clarity. We urge the authors to provide more details on the MTurk experiment design and any controls implemented to ensure data quality. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors enhance the dataset by incorporating a broader range of realistic uncertainties beyond synthetic corruptions and refining the definitions and boundaries between the Uncertain and other categories to alleviate concerns about classification ambiguity. Lastly, we encourage the authors to include a more detailed discussion of limitations, particularly regarding the potential for corner cases and the need for diverse uncertainties in their dataset.
