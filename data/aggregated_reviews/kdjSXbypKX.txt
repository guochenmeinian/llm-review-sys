### Key Points
This paper presents a tag-aware conversational FAQ retrieval framework called TRAVEL, which employs reinforcement learning to mitigate the negative effects of irrelevant information from noisy user behaviors. The authors propose two key components: Tag-Level State Representation, which estimates irrelevant tags and converts them into a state representation, and Conversational Retrieval Strategy Optimization, which utilizes Q-Learning for optimal retrieval strategy. The authors also create a new FAQ dataset with conversation histories and question tags to evaluate the framework, demonstrating that TRAVEL outperforms baselines in accuracy and maintains performance across varying noisy behaviors.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Addresses a significant real-world issue in conversational FAQ retrieval, applicable in various domains such as customer service.
- Introduces a novel tag-aware reinforcement learning framework, effectively leveraging fine-grained tag information to handle noisy behaviors.
- Provides valuable insights into reducing irrelevant information's impact through implicit modeling of tag relevance.
- Achieves notable improvements over baselines in success rate and turns, indicating the framework's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset is limited to a single commercial domain, raising concerns about the generalizability of the results.
- The connection between the problem addressed and the solution provided through tagging lacks clarity, with insufficient motivation for the tag's role in aligning queries and answers.
- More analysis is needed on the learned strategy and how tag relevance estimates evolve over time.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for using tags in their framework, explicitly detailing how they enhance alignment between user queries and retrieved answers. Additionally, we suggest testing the framework on more diverse FAQ datasets to validate its generalizability. Providing a more comprehensive analysis of how tag relevance estimates change throughout conversational episodes would also enhance understanding. Finally, consider deploying the framework in a real interactive setting for rigorous evaluation, addressing potential challenges in that context.
