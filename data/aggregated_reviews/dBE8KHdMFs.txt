Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ControlSynth Neural ODEs (CSODEs), an extension of Neural ODEs that incorporates a control signal \( u(t) \) to enhance the dynamics function. The authors propose that this architectural change leads to rich non-linear dynamics with theoretical convergence guarantees. They also introduce a theoretical framework aimed at enhancing the understanding and convergence properties of continuous-time neural networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that structuring the dynamics in this manner results in faster training, improved performance, and reliable scaling across various synthetic and real systems. The authors acknowledge the importance of precise language in conveying their contributions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper identifies a significant issue with Neural ODEs and proposes a theoretically grounded solution, with sound theoretical analysis and proofs for convergence.  
- Extensive evaluation shows that adaptive CSODEs outperform other models in benchmark experiments, validating the proposed approach.  
- The appendix contains rich details and additional results, enhancing the overall contribution.  
- The authors demonstrate a strong commitment to improving the quality and clarity of their manuscript, showing appreciation for reviewer feedback.  
- Their theoretical framework is well-founded and contributes meaningfully to the understanding of neural networks.

Weaknesses:  
- The writing requires restructuring for clarity; the related work section would be better positioned after the introduction.  
- Section 2 lacks sufficient explanation of \( u(t) \) and the subnetworks, jumping too quickly into mathematical details.  
- Section 3 could be improved by reducing its length and providing a more intuitive explanation of the main results, while moving complex details to the appendix.  
- There is a lack of comparison with Neural CDE, Latent ODE, and ODE-RNN, which could strengthen the evaluation.  
- The scaling section should include comparisons to other models, particularly regarding the claims of guarantees for larger models.  
- The use of the Euler method for ODE integration is questioned, as Dopri5 is the standard solver in Neural ODEs.  
- There was initial confusion regarding the term "Guaranteed Convergence," which impacted the reviewers' understanding of the paper's contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing by restructuring the paper, particularly by moving the related work section after the introduction. In Section 2, provide a more detailed explanation of \( u(t) \) and the subnetworks before delving into mathematical details. We suggest reducing the length of Section 3 and offering a more intuitive explanation of the main results, while relocating complex derivations to the appendix. Additionally, include comparisons with Neural CDE, Latent ODE, and ODE-RNN to enhance the evaluation. In the scaling section, we recommend incorporating comparisons to other models, especially NODE and its variants, to substantiate claims regarding guarantees for larger models. Lastly, consider using Dopri5 instead of the Euler method for ODE integration, as it is the standard in Neural ODE applications. We also recommend improving the clarity of terminology, particularly regarding "Guaranteed Convergence," to prevent confusion in future reviews, and encourage the authors to continue refining their language to enhance the accessibility of their work for the broader scientific community.
