### Key Points
This paper presents a study on learning a single-index model using online stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with non-Gaussian data distributions. The authors introduce the Local Polynomial Growth (LPG) condition, which characterizes the population loss landscape and extends the results of Ben Arous et al. (2021). The main contributions include establishing the convergence rate of online SGD under LPG for spherically symmetric distributions and providing examples of distributions that satisfy the LPG condition. Theorems 3 and 4 demonstrate that SGD can recover the hidden direction with sample complexity influenced by the LPG condition. Additionally, the paper analyzes stationary points in the context of SGD, arguing that undesirable stationary points are confined to a band of scale \(1/\sqrt{d}\) and showing that initializing outside this band allows SGD to avoid these points. The authors provide a detailed proof sketch addressing the scaling of the drift term \(\delta^2 \mathbb{E}[\xi_1(x, \theta)]\) and its implications for convergence.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents complex ideas clearly.
- It initiates the exploration of learning single-index models with arbitrary data distributions, a novel and significant direction.
- The definition of the LPG condition is innovative and effectively abstracts key proof ideas from prior work.
- The application of the LPG framework to spherically symmetric distributions is a noteworthy result.
- The authors effectively clarify the main contribution regarding the localization of undesirable stationary points and the conditions for SGD to avoid them.
- The proof sketch provided addresses previous concerns and demonstrates a solid understanding of the underlying mathematical principles.

Weaknesses:
- A major concern is the dependency of Theorem 3 on the constant $C$, which may not be dimension-independent, potentially affecting the exponent of $d$ in the theorem.
- The examples in Section 4.2 are overly restrictive, particularly the requirement for all 2D marginals of $\nu$ to be close to Gaussian in Wasserstein distance.
- The analysis of the LPG condition may not be straightforward, and its practical applicability beyond specific distributions is questionable.
- There remains some confusion regarding the scaling of the drift term, particularly when summed over \(T\) timesteps, which could lead to misunderstandings about the overall bounds.
- The paper could benefit from a more extensive literature review, particularly in relation to recent works in non-identifiable settings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the dimension dependence of the constant $C$ in Theorem 3, as this is crucial for understanding the results. Additionally, we suggest providing a broader range of examples in Section 4.2, particularly for non-spherically symmetric cases. It would also be beneficial to discuss the connection between the LPG condition and the results of Ben Arous et al. (2021) more explicitly, especially regarding the necessity of LPG for establishing SGD convergence. Furthermore, we recommend improving the clarity of the scaling argument for the drift term \(\delta^2 \mathbb{E}[\xi_1(x, \theta)]\) when summed over \(T\) timesteps to avoid potential misunderstandings. We encourage the authors to emphasize the necessity of the LPG condition and the implications of local minima in non-Gaussian distributions within the main text. Finally, we urge the authors to include references to recent relevant literature to provide a more comprehensive context for their work.
