### Key Points
This paper presents an approach for anomaly detection in mobile web systems, specifically through the introduction of a false negative augmentation mechanism and a Two-Stage Active Learning (TSAL) mechanism. These innovations aim to enhance feedback data generation and mitigate data contamination issues. The authors claim that their experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements, supported by the simplicity and clarity of the model structure.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors effectively design a false negative augmentation mechanism to generate additional feedback data, addressing the scarcity of such data.
- The TSAL mechanism is well-conceived to reduce discrepancies between feedback and training data distributions, thereby avoiding data contamination.
- The experimental results indicate a notable performance enhancement of the proposed method compared to existing semi-supervised techniques.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed mechanisms are not sufficiently generalizable to other anomaly detection methods, limiting their broader applicability.
- There is a lack of analysis regarding the severity of data bias effects, particularly concerning the limited two-week dataset used in experiments.
- The paper includes insufficient experimentation on publicly available datasets, raising questions about the generalizability of the findings.
- Some statements are unclear or confusing, and there are typographical errors present in the manuscript.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the base model's details, potentially by including a diagram of its structure. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify ambiguous statements, such as the abbreviation "STL," and provide full names or references where necessary. The design philosophy behind the bias-eliminating sampling should be elaborated upon, particularly regarding the rationale for the chosen sampling ratio. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to address the impact of significant network configuration changes on model performance, especially in the context of fine-tuning.
