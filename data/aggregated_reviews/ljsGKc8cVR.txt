### Key Points
This paper presents Longtriever, a model designed to efficiently handle long text through intra-block and inter-block encoders. The authors propose a novel pre-training task, the Local Masked Autoencoder (LMAE), which enhances the model's ability to capture both local and global semantics in long texts. Longtriever demonstrates superior performance on the MS MARCO and TREC datasets, indicating its effectiveness in dense retrieval tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The Longtriever architecture is intuitive, and the paper is well-written, making it easy to follow.
- The introduction of LMAE is a significant contribution, enhancing the model's ability to understand long texts.
- The paper provides a comprehensive experimental setup, showing competitiveness with state-of-the-art methods.

Weaknesses:
- The main contribution appears to stem from LMAE rather than the Longtriever architecture itself, as evidenced by comparisons in the experiments.
- The evaluation is limited to the MS MARCO dataset, lacking assessments on other relevant datasets.
- The paper does not sufficiently differentiate LMAE from similar methods like LexMAE, nor does it provide a comparative analysis.
- The organization of the paper, particularly Section 5, is difficult to follow, and key experimental details are unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental setup and provide a comparative analysis of LMAE with similar methods like LexMAE. Additionally, we suggest evaluating Longtriever on other NLP tasks and datasets beyond MS MARCO to demonstrate its versatility. The authors should also consider providing their code to facilitate reproducibility and enhance the organization of Section 5 for better readability. Finally, a deeper analysis of the method's mechanisms in the ablation studies would benefit readers' understanding.
