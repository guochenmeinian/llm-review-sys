Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Star-Shaped DDPM (SS-DDPM), a novel non-Markovian diffusion model that generates a sequence of noised images from the original image. The authors derive the reverse process based on a sufficient statistic, allowing for efficient reverse sampling across various noising distributions. The model is evaluated on diverse data modalities, demonstrating its effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a solid and novel framework for diffusion models, potentially benefiting the generative modeling community.
2. It is well presented, with clear theoretical foundations and a comprehensive suite of experiments on practical datasets.
3. The application of PKD theory and the establishment of duality between star-shaped and Markovian diffusion processes provide significant theoretical support.

Weaknesses:
1. The presentation requires improvement, particularly in explaining technical details and the role of certain variables.
2. The experiments are considered too simplistic and lack persuasive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.
3. The advantages of SS-DDPM over existing models, particularly in practical scenarios, are not clearly articulated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by providing interpretations for T, â„¦t, and ht in Eq.13. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include more intuitions and visualizations regarding the role of G, potentially moving relevant figures to the main text for better visibility. To strengthen the paper, we suggest conducting more comprehensive experiments that compare SS-DDPM with state-of-the-art methods on diverse benchmarks, showcasing unique applications where SS-DDPM outperforms traditional models. Lastly, addressing the limitations of SS-DDPM in comparison to other diffusion models would enhance the paper's contribution.
