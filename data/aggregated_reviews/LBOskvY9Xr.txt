### Key Points
This paper investigates the KBQA task in the political domain using a multi-view political knowledge graph (MVPKG) and proposes a Political Experts through Knowledge Graph Integration (PEG) framework. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method through experiments on three datasets with various LLMs, highlighting the benefits of a domain-specific knowledge graph for enhancing LLM performance in political tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study is comprehensive, covering knowledge graph construction to evaluation.
- The proposed method effectively addresses knowledge gaps in LLMs and demonstrates good performance across diverse datasets.
- The writing is clear, and the method is straightforward, facilitating understanding and potential replication.

Weaknesses:
- There is a lack of quality control or error analysis regarding the MVPKG, raising concerns about its quality.
- The absence of a vanilla GPT-3-turbo comparison limits the completeness of the results.
- The experiments lack sufficient variance and comparable baselines, casting doubt on the confidence of the results.
- Certain areas, such as the explanation of Table 1 and the figure depicting the prompting system, require refinement for clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the quality control and error analysis of the MVPKG to ensure its reliability. Additionally, conducting an ablation study on general KB sources would clarify the contributions of the MVPKG versus the methods used. We suggest including a vanilla GPT-3-turbo comparison for completeness, even if the results may be low. Furthermore, enhancing the clarity of Table 1 and the prompting system figure with explicit explanations and captions is essential. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore the potential for enriching local KGs with further relationships to improve overall response quality.
