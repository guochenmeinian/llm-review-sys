Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on identifiability under unknown multi-node interventions (UMNI) in causal representation learning (CRL), focusing on both parametric and nonparametric models with linear mixing functions. The authors propose the UMNI-CRL algorithm, which guarantees identifiability of latent variables and their causal graphs under hard and soft interventions. The work includes detailed proofs and a step-by-step algorithm, marking a significant advancement in CRL towards more realistic settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and clearly structured, effectively communicating motivations, technical details, and theoretical implications.  
- It extends CRL to the complex multi-node intervention setting, providing significant theoretical contributions and proofs.  
- The use of score functions to estimate the unmixing function is a novel approach, and the paper discusses computational complexity and limitations clearly.  

Weaknesses:  
- The UMNI-CRL algorithm is primarily validated on linear structural equation models, limiting its applicability to nonparametric causal models. Further experimental results on nonparametric models would strengthen the claims.  
- The reliance on linear transformations and the noiseless assumption in the latent-to-observed transformation are restrictive.  
- The empirical evaluation is limited to synthetic datasets, lacking real-world applications and baseline comparisons with existing methods.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical evaluation by including experiments on nonparametric causal models and real-world datasets to enhance the practical significance of their findings. Additionally, addressing the scalability of the algorithm in more complex scenarios and providing a deeper discussion on the assumptions made in real-world applications would be beneficial. Clarifying the computational complexity and elaborating on the intervention regularity condition would also strengthen the paper.
