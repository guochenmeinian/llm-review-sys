Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for measuring data heterogeneity in federated learning (FL) using a locally sensitive hashing-based sketch, which allows for efficient computation while ensuring differential privacy through the Laplace mechanism. The authors propose two applications: optimizing client selection based on local dataset similarities and providing better initial models for new clients in personalized federated learning. The approach aims to mitigate the challenges posed by data heterogeneity, thereby enhancing convergence and personalization in FL. Additionally, the authors introduce a novel client selection strategy that emphasizes efficient and private measurement of distribution divergence through a sketching algorithm, demonstrating that their method converges faster than existing approaches, achieving a test accuracy of 45.6 compared to 44.5 from the baseline. They address concerns regarding clustering approaches, noting their method's linear efficiency compared to the $O(n^2)$ operations of traditional methods, and discuss the implications of client selection on communication costs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The concept of a privacy-preserving dataset similarity measure is clear and valuable, particularly in federated and collaborative learning contexts.
- The theoretical foundation for the sketch and its application to estimate total variation distance is sound.
- The proposed method shows improved convergence speed and accuracy in client selection.
- The sketching algorithm offers an efficient and private means of measuring distribution divergence.
- The authors provide a clear analysis of clustering approaches and their limitations.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for distribution-aware client sampling is insufficiently justified, as it may be beneficial in some scenarios but detrimental in others. The analysis of empirical results is too shallow.
- Some relevant literature on client selection and personalized FL is missing, which could provide a broader context for the proposed methods.
- The necessity for labeled data for new clients remains unaddressed, limiting the practical applicability of the cold-start strategy.
- The method's effectiveness in realistic cross-device scenarios, where local datasets may not resemble the global distribution, is questionable.
- The paper does not prioritize fairness in client selection, which may limit its applicability in certain contexts.
- Concerns about increased communication complexity due to potential two-round communications in cold start scenarios remain unaddressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for distribution-aware client sampling by providing a more thorough analysis of its implications in various scenarios. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion of related works on client selection and personalized FL to enhance the paper's context. The authors should also address the limitations of requiring labeled data for new clients and clarify how their method performs in realistic cross-device settings. Furthermore, we encourage the inclusion of synthetic experiments to better assess the accuracy of total variation distance estimation. We recommend that the authors improve the clarity around the implications of client selection on fairness, particularly regarding atypical clients and their role in the training process. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide more detailed explanations of the communication costs associated with their cold start approach, specifically addressing the potential for increased complexity in scenarios with large client grids. Finally, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the specific parameters used in their experiments, such as the values of $B$ and $R$, to enhance reproducibility and understanding of their results.
