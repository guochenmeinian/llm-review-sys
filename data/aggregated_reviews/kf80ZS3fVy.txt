Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents UniKE, a novel multimodal editing method that establishes a unified framework for intrinsic knowledge editing and external knowledge resorting. The authors propose to disentangle knowledge representations into semantic and truthfulness spaces, enhancing collaboration between different types of knowledge. Extensive experiments validate UniKE's effectiveness, demonstrating that it maintains excellent reliability, generality, and locality across various settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. UniKE introduces a unified framework for intrinsic knowledge editing and external knowledge resorting, effectively managing complex multimodal information.
2. The method's design allows for robust collaboration between knowledge types, significantly improving reliability, generality, and locality, as evidenced by comprehensive experiments.
3. The paper is well-structured, clearly articulating the motivation and benefits of the proposed approach.

Weaknesses:
1. The presentation is confusing, particularly regarding the editing process of intrinsic knowledge in FFN and the complexity introduced by the unified framework.
2. There is a lack of detailed discussion on computational speed and resource utilization, as well as the potential for overfitting due to reliance on fine-tuning.
3. The paper does not adequately address the evaluation metrics or the parameter "n" in the contrastive learning formula, leaving unclear its impact on model performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation, particularly in explaining the editing process of intrinsic knowledge in FFN and the complexities of the unified framework. Additionally, we encourage the authors to include experiments that assess resilience to overediting and to construct multimodal counterfactual editing datasets for further validation of UniKE's performance. Finally, we suggest providing detailed explanations for the evaluation metrics and the parameter "n" to enhance understanding of their influence on the results.
