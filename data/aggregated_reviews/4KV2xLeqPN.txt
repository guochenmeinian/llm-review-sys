### Key Points
This paper presents a thorough investigation of the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) problem with squared loss, demonstrating that the suboptimality of ERM arises from bias rather than variance. The authors propose that the variance term aligns with the minimax rate of estimation in both fixed and random design settings. Key contributions include: 1) establishing the optimality of the variance term, 2) proving a stability result for ERM, 3) providing a simpler proof for the admissibility theorem, and 4) revealing a counterintuitive result regarding the ERM estimator $\widehat{f}_n$ when $f'$ is close to $\widehat{f}_n$.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a significant problem in statistics, enhancing understanding of ERM, a crucial estimator in modern machine learning.  
- It presents interesting results and proofs, particularly in fixed design settings, and offers insights into the stability of ERM.  
- The proof techniques employed are noted as elegant and interesting.

Weaknesses:  
- The organization of the paper is crowded, making it difficult for readers to follow.  
- Some definitions and results lack sufficient detail, such as the minimax rate of ERM and local optimality.  
- There are minor typographical errors and unclear independence relations in the preliminaries.  
- The paper may be better suited for a conference like COLT rather than NIPS, as it may not appeal to a broader audience.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization of the paper to create a clearer narrative that connects the results more cohesively. Consider summarizing the theorems in a table to aid reader comprehension. Additionally, we suggest providing more detailed explanations of key concepts, such as the minimax rate and local optimality, to enhance accessibility for a wider audience. Clarifying the independence relations in the preliminaries and addressing typographical errors will also improve the paper's clarity. Finally, including more examples and applications could strengthen the practical relevance of the findings.
