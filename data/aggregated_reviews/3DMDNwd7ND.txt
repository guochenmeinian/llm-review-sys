Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for protecting data privacy in collaborative inference settings by utilizing adversarial representation learning and a metric-based differential privacy notion. The authors propose a way to estimate the Lipschitz constant to address the computational challenges associated with the metric. The framework aims to evaluate privacy guarantees against reconstruction attacks during inference.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The studied problem is significant and relevant.
- The paper is well-structured and easy to follow.
- It provides formal privacy guarantees and introduces original concepts.

Weaknesses:
- The threat model is unrealistic, as it requires knowledge of the classifier by the defender, limiting practical applicability.
- There is a lack of evaluation against advanced attacks, particularly membership inference attacks.
- The experimental results are not convincing, and more clarifications are needed regarding comparisons with existing works.
- The applicability of the framework to tabular datasets and its robustness against white-box adversaries are not adequately discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the applicability of their framework to tabular datasets and the guarantees provided when the adversary has white-box access to the obfuscator. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with secure multi-party computation and homomorphic encryption to contextualize their approach. It would also strengthen the paper to provide concrete applications where users would be satisfied with the type of privacy afforded by this method. Finally, we advise the authors to conduct additional experiments to measure the success of membership inference attacks and clarify the definition of the Lipschitz constant in the main body of the paper.
