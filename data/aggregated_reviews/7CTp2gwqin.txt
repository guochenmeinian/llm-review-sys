### Key Points
This paper presents a novel regularization technique called "Token-Level Masking (TLM)," which masks tokens in the attention layer of Transformer models to enhance representation by utilizing partial neighbor information. The authors conduct extensive evaluations across various NLP tasks, including GLUE and Chinese benchmarks, demonstrating consistent performance improvements over conventional attention dropout and advanced methods like Drophead. The paper includes thorough ablation studies to analyze TLM's effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The idea of TLM is simple and intuitive, making it easy to implement in Transformer architectures.
- Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets and models show consistent improvements.
- The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the regularization process and its effects.

Weaknesses:
- The lack of hyperparameter search details raises questions about the robustness of the experimental results.
- The choice of models, particularly using BERT-small for GLUE tasks, is confusing and not standard practice.
- The motivation and novelty of TLM are not clearly articulated, and the applicability to larger models remains uncertain.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of TLM's motivation and its comparative advantages over input-level masking. Additionally, it would be beneficial to conduct a hyperparameter search and provide details on the number of trials for each experiment, including mean and standard deviation. The authors should also clarify the rationale behind the specific model choices and the 50-50 chance for sibling and self-masking. Finally, addressing the applicability of TLM to larger models would strengthen the paper's contributions.
