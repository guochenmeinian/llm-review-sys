Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel fair recommendation framework, FAIR, aimed at balancing the interests of multiple stakeholders in online recommendation systems, including platforms, sellers, and users. The authors propose FORM, a low-regret algorithm that learns user preferences while enforcing fairness in real-time recommendations. The framework is formulated as a constrained optimization problem, allowing for flexibility in defining fair solutions and adjusting trade-offs between platform goals and stakeholder fairness. Theoretical analyses and empirical results demonstrate that FORM can maintain platform revenue while achieving fairness for both items and users.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses the complex challenge of balancing platform revenue, user fairness, and item fairness.  
- It proposes an online algorithm that learns parameters while ensuring fairness constraints, rather than assuming fixed parameters.  
- The sound and thorough regret analysis of the proposed algorithm is commendable.  
- Empirical results on real-world data show effective control of user-item fairness while maximizing platform revenue.  
- The motivation is clear, and the theoretical proof appears solid, with practical applications demonstrated through case studies.

Weaknesses:  
- The choice of fairness notions and values of $\delta$ is non-trivial and not thoroughly discussed.  
- The paper lacks online production A/B testing, raising concerns about the optimism of empirical results without real-world verification.  
- Missing related works on multi-sided fairness in recommendations should be acknowledged.  
- The computational complexity and scalability of the algorithm are not adequately addressed.  
- The assumption of fixed user types may not hold in practice, and the focus on short-term fairness neglects long-term implications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on how to choose the right fairness notion and the values of $\delta$ in practice. Additionally, we encourage the authors to conduct online production A/B tests to validate their empirical results in real-world settings. It would be beneficial to include a comparison of the algorithm's running time and to acknowledge missing related works on multi-sided fairness. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors address the computational complexity and scalability of the proposed solution, as well as consider the implications of user type variability and long-term fairness in their framework.
