Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on manipulating AI explanations to influence human decision-making, exploring both adversarial and benign applications. The authors propose a computational model that predicts human responses to AI predictions and explanations, aiming to understand how these manipulations can either guide decisions towards correct outcomes or introduce bias. The results indicate that manipulated explanations can significantly affect human decisions across various tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The focus on quantitatively modeling human behavior to manipulate AI explanations is novel and impactful, enhancing the understanding of AI-human interactions.
- Extensive experiments validate the proposed models, providing a balanced view through the inclusion of both adversarial and benign manipulations.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments are limited to specific tasks like census and recidivism prediction, which may not capture the complexities of high-stakes decision-making in fields such as healthcare or finance.
- The behavior model oversimplifies human decision-making by not accounting for inherent variability and noise.
- Data and code availability for replication is lacking, hindering verification and further research.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors expand the range of decision-making tasks to include high-stakes environments to improve the generalizability of the results. Additionally, the authors should incorporate variability and noise in human decision-making into their behavior model. To enhance transparency and facilitate replication, we suggest making the data and code readily available. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide more detail on significant covariates in regression analyses and clarify the rationale for using $\sum_i e_i$ in Eq. 2 for evaluating consistency. Lastly, including diverse datasets and exploring the use of Large Language Models for more comprehensive explanations could strengthen the study's findings.
