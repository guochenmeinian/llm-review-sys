Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method to enhance pseudo-label quality for semi-supervised semantic segmentation through a confidence refinement scheme called S4MC. The authors propose leveraging spatial correlations in segmentation maps by grouping neighboring pixels to collectively analyze their pseudo-labels. This approach allows for the effective use of unlabeled data during training while maintaining pseudo-label quality, as demonstrated by experiments that show S4MC surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed confidence refinement scheme is novel and effective.
- The evaluation is comprehensive, achieving new state-of-the-art results.
- The paper is well-written and clearly structured, making it easy to follow.
- Experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the method across various benchmarks.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution is somewhat limited, as leveraging contextual information from neighboring pixels has been extensively explored in the literature.
- The improvement from considering neighbors when generating pseudo-labels is unclear; additional comparisons, such as including a 1x1 neighbor size in Table 4 (a), would strengthen the argument.
- The experimental setup lacks clarity regarding labeled and unlabeled images, and an upper bounding experiment with all annotated images is missing.
- The time complexity of the confidence margin refinement (CMR) module needs analysis, as it may incur significant computational costs.
- The relationships between S4MC, CutMix-Seg, and FixMatch require further explanation, particularly regarding performance differences.
- The paper should compare the proposed method with more recent approaches published in 2022 and 2023.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental setup by explicitly stating which images are labeled and unlabeled. Additionally, including a comparison with a 1x1 neighbor size in Table 4 (a) would clarify the benefits of neighbor consideration. An upper bounding experiment with all annotated images should be conducted to provide context for the SSL model's performance. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the time complexity of the CMR module is necessary. The authors should also clarify the relationships between S4MC, CutMix-Seg, and FixMatch, and provide more recent comparative analyses to strengthen the contribution of the work. Lastly, we suggest discussing the potential negative societal impacts and limitations of the proposed method more thoroughly.
