### Key Points
This paper presents SatGuard, an in-network link layer retransmission scheme aimed at improving performance in low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks like Starlink. The authors measure network performance and identify frequent handovers as a significant cause of packet loss and latency. SatGuard employs mechanisms such as advance sender buffer migration, early loss detection, and in-network ordered packet delivery to enhance performance. Evaluations indicate that SatGuard minimizes end-to-end delay and improves web page load times and WebRTC stream stability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides valuable insights from a measurement study on Starlink, highlighting the impact of handovers on network performance.
- The authors agree to open-source SatGuard, contributing to community knowledge.
- The topic is timely and the writing is generally clear.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation does not address the overhead introduced by SatGuard.
- Key design aspects, such as the connectivity cache, are insufficiently detailed.
- Claims regarding Starlink's performance may be exaggerated, lacking a thorough analysis of existing LEO link layer protocols.
- The complexity of implementing a handover-aware buffer migration scheme is not adequately discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation section by addressing the overhead introduced by SatGuard and providing a detailed analysis of the connectivity cache. Additionally, we suggest that the authors reconsider their claims about Starlink's unreliability and base their design on current LEO link layer protocols. A more technical discussion on the complexity of the proposed mechanisms and their impact on WebRTC communication would strengthen the paper. Finally, we encourage the authors to articulate the novelty of their proposal more clearly and compare it with related works, such as Fast Mobile IPv6 and information-centric networking approaches.
