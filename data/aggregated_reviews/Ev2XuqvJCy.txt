Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Spiking PointNet, a novel approach for processing point cloud data through a "train-less, learn-more" strategy that utilizes the Surrogate Gradient (SG) method for training SNNs over a single time step while employing multiple time steps during inference. The authors provide theoretical analysis and empirical evidence indicating that their method outperforms traditional SNN training over multiple time steps. Additionally, they introduce a membrane potential perturbation (MPP) method to further enhance performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The "train-less, learn-more" strategy is innovative.
2. The results demonstrate significant performance improvements across various datasets, occasionally surpassing ANN counterparts, a notable achievement for SNNs.
3. The paper is well-written, with clear illustrations that enhance comprehension.

Weaknesses:
1. Section 3.4 lacks clarity regarding the effectiveness of the membrane potential perturbation method if gradient distributions do not align as expected, as shown in Figure 4.
2. The applicability of this method to point segmentation tasks is uncertain.
3. There is a typographical error in Table 6 where "10^8" is misspelled.
4. The proposed solutions for training SNNs with large time steps and reducing memory and computation costs are inadequately addressed, as evidenced by the results in Tables 1, 2, and 6.
5. The power consumption simulation in Section 4.2 lacks convincing evidence since the Spiking PointNet has not been deployed on neuromorphic chips.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 3.4 by explicitly addressing the effectiveness of the membrane potential perturbation method under varying gradient distributions. Additionally, please clarify whether the proposed method can be applied to point segmentation tasks. We also suggest correcting the typographical error in Table 6. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide more robust evidence regarding the power consumption of Spiking PointNet, ideally through deployment on neuromorphic chips. Lastly, we recommend validating the performance of Spiking PointNet on additional datasets beyond ModelNet to strengthen the contribution of the work.
