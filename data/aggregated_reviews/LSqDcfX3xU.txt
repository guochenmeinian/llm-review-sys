Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the effectiveness of the similarity-based edge reconstruction attack (SERA) on both sparse and dense networks, utilizing various configurations of graph neural networks (GNNs). The authors demonstrate that SERA performs well on sparse networks but poorly on dense ones, and they analyze the impact of the noisy aggregation (NAG) technique on SERA's resilience. The main contributions are encapsulated in Theorems 4.1, 5.1, and 6.1, which address the performance of SERA and the implications of noise aggregation for privacy preservation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper represents an initial effort toward a theoretical understanding of SERA's effectiveness across different GNN configurations. The theoretical results are presented clearly, with rigorous proofs and helpful explanations accompanying each theorem. The motivation is clear, and the empirical evaluation complements the theoretical findings.

Weaknesses:  
1. Writing Quality: The paper suffers from complex language and numerous grammatical errors, hindering readability.
2. Theoretical Analysis Limitation: The focus on linear GNNs raises questions about the applicability of results to non-linear GNNs, as the guarantee of linear results serving as proxies for non-linear ones is unclear.
3. Rationale for Studying SERA: The authors mention more powerful attacks than SERA, which raises questions about the choice to focus on SERA.
4. Accuracy of Statistics: The statistic $\mathcal{H}$ used in Table 1 only evaluates similarity between nodes with an edge, neglecting those without edges, which questions the accuracy of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the writing quality by simplifying language and correcting grammatical errors to enhance readability. Additionally, the authors should expand the theoretical analysis to include non-linear GNNs and clarify the rationale for focusing on SERA despite the existence of more powerful attacks. The accuracy of the statistic $\mathcal{H}$ should be addressed by considering dissimilarity between nodes without edges. Furthermore, we suggest improving the empirical evaluation's readability by enhancing the size and clarity of plots and defining all terms used in the tables. Lastly, the discussion of limitations and future work should be integrated into the main body of the paper for better accessibility.
