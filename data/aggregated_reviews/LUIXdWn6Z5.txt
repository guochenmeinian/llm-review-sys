### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of the control-as-inference (CaI) framework by substituting Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with Renyi divergence, leading to a risk-sensitive control problem termed risk-sensitive CaI (RCaI). The authors demonstrate that the Renyi order parameter $\alpha$ influences the risk-sensitivity of the learned policy and propose a policy gradient method for optimizing the resulting objective through variational inference. An experiment is conducted in the Pendulum-v1 environment from OpenAI Gymnasium to illustrate the proposed method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The formulation of RCaI introduces a novel perspective on risk-sensitive control using Renyi divergence, which is theoretically significant.
- The authors derive two reinforcement learning algorithms from this framework, enhancing the applicability of their approach.
- The paper is well-organized, with a thorough related work section and clear explanations of the theoretical contributions.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a strong motivation for considering Renyi divergence over KL divergence, failing to address what limitations exist in the KL-based formulation.
- Experimental validation is insufficient, with only one environment tested and no empirical comparisons to established baselines, such as SAC, MBPO, or MPO.
- The notion of "risk" in the chosen environment is unclear, and the experimental results do not convincingly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for using Renyi divergence by clearly articulating the shortcomings of KL divergence in this context. Additionally, we urge the authors to conduct more extensive empirical evaluations across multiple environments, particularly those with a clear notion of "risk," and to compare their proposed methods against established baselines. This would strengthen the paper's contributions and provide a more compelling case for the effectiveness of RCaI. Furthermore, addressing the numerical stability of the proposed method in detail, beyond a brief mention in the conclusion, would enhance the robustness of the findings.
