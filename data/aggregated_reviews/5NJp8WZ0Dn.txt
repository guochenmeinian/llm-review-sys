### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method to enhance fairness in machine learning models for electronic health records without demographic data. The authors propose a weighted loss function based on a gradient graph to identify underrepresented groups through model gradient similarity. Theoretical results elucidate the correlation between gradients and unfairness, while empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in fairness metrics such as equalized odds and disparate impact compared to existing algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Theoretical derivation effectively illustrates the method's functionality.
- The innovative graph of gradients method identifies underrepresented populations for bias mitigation.
- Empirical results show significant enhancements in fairness metrics over state-of-the-art algorithms.

Weaknesses:
- Assumptions should be presented before the theorem rather than in the appendix.
- The strong assumption that model accuracy and input features correlate with demographic groups lacks empirical support.
- The soft grouping method's rationale is insufficiently analyzed, leaving questions about its superiority over prior methods.
- Clarity issues exist, with dense descriptions and sudden introductions of notation without explanation.
- Experiments are limited to small Neural Networks, which may not align with the symposium's focus on Foundational Models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by simplifying dense descriptions and providing explanations for introduced notations. Additionally, we suggest that the authors list assumptions prior to the theorem and provide empirical evidence to support the correlation between model accuracy, input features, and demographic groups. Finally, we encourage the authors to expand on the intuition behind the soft grouping method to clarify its advantages over previous approaches.
