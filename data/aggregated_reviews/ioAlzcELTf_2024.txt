Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents WeatherGFT, a physics-AI hybrid model aimed at enhancing weather forecasts to finer temporal scales beyond the training dataset. The authors propose the integration of PDE kernels for physical simulation alongside neural networks for adaptive bias correction, targeting accurate 30-minute forecasts from hourly datasets. The lead time-aware training framework is designed to improve generalization across multiple lead times, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both medium-range and nowcasting tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The fusion of AI and PDE is innovative, enhancing the model's generalizability.
2. The model demonstrates the ability to generalize across time scales, achieving finer temporal resolutions from coarser data.
3. Extensive experiments validate the model's state-of-the-art performance across various forecasting tasks and lead times.

Weaknesses:
1. The experimental details are insufficient, lacking information on hyperparameters, dataset statistics, and validation/test set divisions. The absence of error bars raises questions about the statistical significance of results.
2. The novelty of the paper is weaker than claimed, as other hybrid models exist that combine machine learning with physics-based approaches.
3. The physics model relies on a limited set of PDEs, which may not fully capture real-world atmospheric dynamics, and the baseline comparisons are limited.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental details by providing comprehensive information on hyperparameters, dataset statistics, and the division of validation and test sets. Additionally, clarifying how the results were obtained and ensuring statistical significance through error bars would strengthen the findings. We suggest addressing the novelty of the work by citing existing hybrid models and discussing how WeatherGFT differentiates itself. Furthermore, enhancing the explanations of the novel modules and their contributions, as well as expanding baseline comparisons to include more AI models, would improve the manuscript. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the formulation of key equations and the operational mechanics of the model, particularly regarding the PDE kernel's impact on various metrics.
