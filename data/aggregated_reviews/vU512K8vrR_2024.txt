### Key Points
This paper presents SalientLoRA, an innovative algorithm for adaptively optimizing the intrinsic ranks of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) matrices using a novel saliency metric. The saliency measure is derived from analyzing singular value magnitudes, orthogonality constraints, and inter-dependencies over a training time window. This method allows for efficient rank allocation while addressing issues of instability and randomness, ultimately achieving state-of-the-art performance across various natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG) tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The authors propose a novel salience measurement technique that effectively addresses challenges in rank optimization.
- The adaptive adjustment of the time-series window enhances efficiency and stability in rank allocation.
- The experimental evaluation demonstrates substantial performance gains over state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks.

Weaknesses:  
- Clarity of exposition is lacking in several areas, particularly regarding the decycling operation and the calculation of weights assigned to singular values.
- The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of critical hyperparameters, which is essential for understanding their roles and optimal settings.
- Limitations of the proposed method are not discussed, and key performance measures such as memory consumption are overlooked.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the exposition by providing detailed explanations of the decycling process and the calculation of weights for singular values. Including an equation for the normalization of weights would enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest that the authors conduct a thorough analysis of the hyperparameters, including sensitivity analyses, to elucidate their impact on model performance. Finally, we encourage the authors to discuss the limitations of their method and include a comparison of memory consumption with other approaches like AdaLoRA and DoRA.
