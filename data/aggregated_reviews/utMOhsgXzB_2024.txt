Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach named BEND-VLM (Bias Elimination with Nonlinear Debiasing of Vision Language Models), which aims to debias vision-language model embeddings at test time through a fine-tuning-free, nonlinear method tailored to each unique input. The authors define two metrics, CCF and CCFD, to quantify bias in CLIP embeddings and propose a two-step debiasing process that includes orthogonal projection and optimization with a reference dataset. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms two baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper explores a unique perspective on CLIP embedding debiasing, focusing on zero-shot debiasing without fine-tuning.
- The defined metrics CCF and CCFD are interesting and practical for quantifying bias.
- The two-step debiasing process effectively mitigates bias without degrading model performance.
- The authors provide detailed proof for their second method component.

Weaknesses:
- The original model's performance in image classification and image-text retrieval is unclear, particularly regarding potential degradation post-debiasing.
- There is a lack of evidence for the time efficiency of the proposed method, especially since it utilizes another LLM.
- The usefulness of the second approach, which uses reference images to equalize text embeddings, is questionable, and no ablation studies are provided.
- The reliance on a reference dataset with protected attribute annotations may limit applicability, and the paper does not adequately address contextual biases arising from multiple attributes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding the original model's performance metrics and potential degradation after debiasing. Additionally, providing time efficiency evidence for the proposed method would strengthen the paper. The authors should consider including ablation studies to demonstrate the contributions of each step in the debiasing process. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of using a reference dataset and discussing how the method can handle contextual biases would enhance the robustness of the approach.
