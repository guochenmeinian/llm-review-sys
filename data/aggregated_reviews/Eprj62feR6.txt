### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to multimodal relation extraction by integrating hierarchical visual features into textual semantic representations through a two-stage hierarchical visual context fusion transformer and a mixture of multimodal experts framework. The authors introduce hierarchical tracking maps to enhance the understanding of image information processing within multimodal models and claim state-of-the-art performance on the MNRE dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The concept of integrating hierarchical visual context is intriguing.
2. Experimental results show consistent performance improvements across various baselines on the MNRE dataset.
3. The paper is well-structured and clearly written.

Weaknesses:
1. The generalization of the methods requires further testing, as they are only evaluated on the Multimodal Relation Extraction task (MRE), unlike other top-conference papers that test on both MRE and Multimodal NER.
2. The paper lacks clarity regarding other expenses associated with the proposed methods.
3. More information on the nature and diversity of the auxiliary visual information used is needed.
4. A discussion on the model's limitations and potential areas for improvement is absent.
5. The methodology is described in an overly complex manner, complicating reader comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their methods by testing on multiple multimodal relationship extraction datasets. Additionally, providing more clarity on the expenses linked to the proposed methods and elaborating on the auxiliary visual information would enhance the paper. We also suggest simplifying the description of the methodology and including a detailed case study with error analysis to improve comprehensibility. Furthermore, incorporating more ablation studies and discussing the model's efficiency compared to baselines would strengthen the paper's contributions.
