Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on learning causal links in a mixture-of-DAGs model using interventions. The authors characterize the minimum number of interventions required to identify "true edges," which are edges that exist in at least one mixture component. They propose an algorithm that approaches optimality in terms of the number of interventions needed. The paper also discusses the implications of using interventional data in causal discovery, particularly in the context of mixtures of DAGs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. This is the first study addressing the use of interventions to learn from a mixture of causal DAGs, filling a significant gap in the literature.
2. Theorems regarding the necessary and sufficient number of interventions and the proposed algorithm are correct and well-articulated.
3. The paper is well-written and presents a clear flow of ideas, making it accessible to readers.

Weaknesses:
1. The reliance on several definitions may confuse readers; a simple running example illustrating these definitions would enhance clarity.
2. The experimental results are limited to synthetic data, which undermines the paper's applicability to real-world scenarios. An analysis of at least one real-world system would strengthen the findings.
3. The motivation for recovering "true edges" without mapping them to specific underlying DAGs is unclear, which diminishes the perceived usefulness of the work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by including a simple running example that illustrates all definitions related to their theorems and algorithm. Additionally, we suggest that the authors present and analyze at least one real-world dataset in the experiments section to enhance the applicability of their findings. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the motivation behind recovering "true edges" without context to the underlying DAGs, as this will strengthen the paper's contribution to the field.
