### Key Points
This paper presents "PoemSum," a novel dataset and benchmark for poem summarization in English, comprising 3011 samples of poems paired with human-written summaries. The authors evaluate standard summarization models like BART, T5, and Pegasus, revealing their inadequacy in capturing the nuances of poetic language, thus indicating the need for new approaches. The paper emphasizes the unique challenges of summarizing creative language, which differs significantly from summarizing non-literary texts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a new task and dataset for poem summarization is innovative and expands NLP research into creative language.
- The dataset serves as a valuable resource for evaluating language models' understanding of figurative language, potentially advancing the field of creative language summarization.
- The paper is well-written and presents a compelling argument for the significance of the proposed task.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset is limited to English poems, which may restrict the exploration of multilingual challenges.
- The curation process for the dataset is not adequately explained, lacking details on search methodology and data cleaning.
- The analysis of model performance is superficial, with deeper insights into model capabilities and errors deferred to future work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Table 1 by specifying the unit of Max poem size and Max summary size. Additionally, we suggest including further dataset metrics, such as the average number of words/tokens per poem and summary, and the time distribution of poems/authors per century. It would also be beneficial to provide a detailed explanation of the curation process and analyze figurative language patterns that LLMs fail to capture.
