### Key Points
This paper presents a knowledge graph entity typing approach that utilizes entity-type, entity-cluster, and cluster-type structured information. The authors propose a cross-view contrastive learning module to capture interactions between different views and introduce a multi-head attention mechanism with a Mixture-of-Experts to differentiate contributions from various entity neighbors. The paper discusses type knowledge clustering, entity type graphs, and the rationale for using LightGCN over RGCN as a multi-view encoder. It also introduces a contrastive learning loss that integrates intra-view and inter-view negative samples, alongside a false-negative aware loss function.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The incorporation of multi-view information is intuitive and effectively separates aspects of knowledge graphs for improved entity type prediction.
- The paper demonstrates solid performance compared to previous models and conducts extensive experiments, including various ablation studies.
- The clarity of presentation and organization is commendable, with well-structured tables for results.

Weaknesses:
- The model's complexity raises concerns about its applicability to large knowledge graphs and whether the benefits justify this complexity.
- There is ambiguity regarding the clustering of types and the handling of entity-entity relationships, which may affect the overall effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the computational complexity of different approaches for entity typing. Additionally, a more detailed introduction and explanation of LightGCN is necessary. The authors should clarify the rationale behind adding multiple graph convolutional layers and provide a clearer description of how to identify positive and negative samples, potentially with illustrative figures. Furthermore, addressing how the proposed method compares in efficiency to previous GNN-based and embedding-based methods would strengthen the paper.
