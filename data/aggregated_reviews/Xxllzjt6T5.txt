Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical study on robust rotation synchronization using a least-unsquared minimization formulation over the rotation group. The authors propose a two-step algorithm called ReSync, which employs spectral initialization for generating an initial guess, followed by Riemannian subgradient descent. The paper establishes that, under suitable conditions of the random corruption model, this algorithm converges linearly to the ground truth rotations. It includes a thorough convergence analysis and experimental validation, demonstrating competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and clearly presented, making complex theoretical concepts accessible.
- The proposed method addresses an important problem in rotation synchronization.
- The theoretical contributions advance the state of the art, particularly with strong guarantees for the noiseless case.
- The convergence analysis is thorough, and numerical experiments validate the theoretical results.

Weaknesses:
- The construction of a gradient descent algorithm alone is not a significant contribution; however, the geometric setting and theoretical connections enhance its importance.
- Concerns exist regarding the treatment of missing observations as a zero matrix, which does not lie on the SO(d) manifold.
- The paper lacks a discussion on the stability of the algorithm in the presence of noise and does not provide insights into the computational cost of the proposed algorithm.
- Empirical results are limited to synthetic datasets, and comparisons with relevant literature are insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the stability of the algorithm to noise, potentially demonstrating approximate recovery under such conditions. Additionally, we suggest addressing the theoretical justification for treating missing observations as a zero matrix, possibly considering the identity matrix instead. The authors should also include a more detailed comparison with previous works, particularly [27] and [40], and provide insights into the computational cost of the algorithm. Finally, expanding empirical evaluations to include real-world datasets would enhance the practical relevance of the findings.
