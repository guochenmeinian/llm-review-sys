### Key Points
This paper presents a method for training a noise-robust Named Entity Recognition (NER) model that effectively learns from noisy annotations. The authors frame NER as a constituency parsing problem, introducing uncertain nodes in the constituency tree and employing tree-structured Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) alongside MC-Dropout for uncertainty evaluation. The method is evaluated on four NER datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to various baselines that address different types of annotation noise.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach addresses a significant issue in NER by focusing on training with noisy annotations.
- Empirical results indicate that the proposed method outperforms several competitive models, including BERT.
- The manuscript is well-structured and presents a thorough analysis across multiple datasets, including both real-world and synthetic scenarios.

Weaknesses:
- Clarity regarding the source of improvements in performance is lacking, particularly in the results presented in Tables 4 and 5.
- The experimental design section could provide more details about the datasets, including noise estimation and the quality of test sets.
- There is insufficient error analysis to interpret the method's performance beyond F1 scores.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity on the relationship between uncertainty measurement and annotated label reliability, particularly in Section 3.2. Additionally, consider addressing entity boundary errors in the discussion of incorrect annotations. We suggest discussing the impact of the number of epochs for MC-Dropout and clarifying whether a similar grid search was applied to other methods in Table 4. It would be beneficial to provide a summary table of the datasets used, highlighting the characteristics of the noise present. Furthermore, we recommend including an efficiency analysis to assess the training and inference costs of the proposed method and its alternatives. Lastly, enhancing the descriptions of the ablation experiments and the experimental design would strengthen the paper's overall clarity and rigor.
