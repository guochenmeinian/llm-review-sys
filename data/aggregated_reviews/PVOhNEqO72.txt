### Key Points
This paper presents a novel molecular interaction dataset, MolInteractDB, derived from molecular crystal structures, which enhances the study of molecular interactions beyond traditional protein-ligand and protein-protein interactions. The authors propose InteractNN, a self-supervised SE(3)-equivariant 3D message passing network trained on this dataset, which shows promise when fine-tuned for predicting protein-ligand binding affinities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The manuscript introduces a comprehensive dataset, MolInteractDB, containing 344,858 molecular crystal structure entries, significantly broadening the scope of molecular interaction studies.  
- The model, pre-trained on the MolInteractDB dataset, demonstrates competitive performance in predicting protein-ligand binding affinities, aligning with existing state-of-the-art models.  

Weaknesses:  
- The clarity in some sections of the manuscript could be improved for better comprehension.  
- There is a need to explore and demonstrate the model's efficacy on a broader range of downstream tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing in certain sections to enhance comprehension. Additionally, the authors should explore and demonstrate the model's efficacy on a wider array of downstream applications to strengthen the paper's contributions.
