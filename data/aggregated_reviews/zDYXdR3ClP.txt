Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a universal image restoration framework, UIR-LoRA, which utilizes multiple low-rank adapters and a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, SD-turbo, as a shared component. The authors propose a LoRA composing strategy based on degradation similarity predicted by a CLIP encoder to integrate various LoRA modules. They evaluate their method using multiple metrics, including PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and FID, to provide a comprehensive assessment of image quality while acknowledging the limitations of relying solely on average metrics. Experimental results demonstrate the method's effectiveness across multiple degradation types, although the authors emphasize the importance of visual comparisons.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The LoRA-based Universal IR method is clear and easy to understand.
- The motivation for the research is well-articulated.
- The authors provide clarifications that alleviate previous concerns regarding their incorporation-of-priors strategy.
- The inclusion of qualitative examples enhances reader understanding of method sensitivity to hyperparameters.
- The experimental results are compelling, with meaningful ablation studies and a detailed comparison against existing models across various degradation types and metrics.

Weaknesses:
- The use of SD-turbo as a backbone leads to detail distortion due to its high compression rate, a significant issue not adequately addressed in the Method Section.
- The degradation-aware router's reliability is questionable, as the original CLIP Text Encoder may not effectively distinguish between different degradations.
- The paper lacks complete technical details, such as the conditioning of LQ images for SD-turbo.
- Reporting only trainable parameters in Tab. 1 is insufficient; overall model parameters should also be included.
- The experimental results are perceived as limited in supporting the contributions of the proposed method.
- There is a misunderstanding regarding the motivation for restoration tasks, which needs clearer articulation.
- The method reportedly underperforms in significant degradation types, raising concerns about its overall effectiveness.
- Visual results in Fig. 3 exhibit artifacts, raising questions about the testing methodology for Restormer.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on skip-connections for VAE in the Method Section, providing more technical details on how LQ images are utilized. Additionally, authors should present degradation prediction accuracy for a wider range of degradation types and include more experimental results, particularly on mixed weather-conditioned images like MID6. Clarifying the training process for networks in Tables 1 and 2 is also necessary. Furthermore, enhancing the experimental results section with more comprehensive data could better support the contributions of the proposed method. Finally, addressing the performance discrepancies between the Top-1 and All strategies, as well as improving the clarity of their motivation for the restoration tasks, would enhance the paper's clarity and impact.
