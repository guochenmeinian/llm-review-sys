### Key Points
This paper presents an interesting approach, Implicit HSS, aimed at realizing scalable neural potentials. The authors evaluate this method on Coulomb-like, L-J, and Morse potentials, demonstrating good performance across datasets with varying particle numbers. The theoretical derivation of the framework is well-executed, and the relationship between linear and non-linear attention mechanisms is effectively discussed.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The theoretical framework is well-derived and clearly articulated.  
- The paper is accessible, even to those not specialized in computational physics.  
- The approach shows promise in reducing computational complexity associated with pair-wise interactions.

Weaknesses:  
- The experimentation results are lacking in detail, particularly regarding the Hyena attention mechanism and its comparative accuracy.  
- There is a contradiction in the scalability claims, as the proposed IHSS method does not show improved accuracy for larger particle systems.  
- The paper lacks benchmarking against other methods with similar compression ratios, such as GNN.  
- There is insufficient discussion on the physical assumptions underpinning the HSS approximation and its validity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimentation section by providing more technical details about the Hyena mechanism and its comparison with other attention methods. Additionally, the authors should address the lack of improved accuracy for the 8k-sized particle systems to clarify the scalability claims. We suggest including a benchmarking analysis against methods like GNN to contextualize the proposed approach. Finally, we encourage the authors to discuss the physical assumptions that validate the HSS approximation and explore its applicability to more complex particle systems in the conclusion.
