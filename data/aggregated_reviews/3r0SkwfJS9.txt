### Key Points
This paper presents IllusionCAPTCHA, a novel CAPTCHA system designed to be easily solvable by humans but challenging for AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors evaluate LLM performance on various CAPTCHA types and find that while LLMs struggle with complex reasoning CAPTCHAs, they improve with Chain-of-Thought prompting. IllusionCAPTCHA utilizes visual illusions that are intuitive for humans but confounding for AI, employing structured questioning to mislead bots. The study reports an 86.95% success rate for human users on the first attempt, outperforming traditional CAPTCHAs. However, concerns arise regarding the robustness of findings and their applicability across diverse scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a novel approach by applying visual illusions specifically to CAPTCHA design, shifting from traditional methods to exploiting cognitive illusions that differentiate human and AI capabilities.
2. The empirical studies conducted provide valuable insights into LLM performance against existing CAPTCHAs and human interaction, enhancing the academic rigor of the research.
3. The structure of the manuscript is clear, facilitating comprehension and accessibility.

Weaknesses:
1. The concept of using visual illusions is not entirely new, reducing the perceived innovation of the approach. 
2. The organization of the paper is suboptimal, with insufficient integration of the Threat Model section and a disruptive separation between the Empirical Study and Evaluation sections.
3. The user study lacks rigor, with a small sample size of 23 participants and insufficient detail on the dataset and experimental trials.
4. Ethical considerations regarding human subjects are inadequately addressed, and potential copyright issues with character images are not resolved.
5. The methodology for illusionary image generation lacks clarity, and the user interface for the CAPTCHA is not visually represented, hindering understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization of the paper by better integrating the Threat Model section and ensuring a logical flow between the Empirical Study and Evaluation sections. Additionally, the authors should provide detailed information about the dataset, including the quantity and types of images, as well as the number of experimental trials conducted. Expanding the user study to include a larger sample size and providing comprehensive ethical review details are crucial. We also suggest enhancing the theoretical framework for the illusionary image generation process and including visual representations of the user interface to clarify the implementation of IllusionCAPTCHA. Finally, consolidating the data in Tables 4, 5, and 6 into a single table could improve clarity and contrast the differences in success rates more effectively.
