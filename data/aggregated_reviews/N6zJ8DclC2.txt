Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for generating causally valid and *natural* counterfactuals, which are close to the observed data manifold. The authors propose a flexible version of Judea Pearlâ€™s $do$-calculus, introducing a $change$-operator that represents a *least-backtracking feasible intervention* (LBF). This method incorporates *feasible intervention optimization* to compute LBF interventions while adhering to naturalness constraints, ensuring that counterfactuals remain anchored in the observed data. The authors distinguish their method from existing approaches, particularly those by Wachter et al., by emphasizing that their framework does not rely on causal assumptions and aims to generate feasible interventions that minimize backtracking while remaining within the support of the observed distribution. They clarify the meanings of "backtracking" and "non-backtracking" counterfactuals, acknowledging that their approach may not fully address specific counterfactual queries. Empirical results from both synthetic and real-world datasets indicate improved performance with LBF interventions, although the connection to counterfactual explanations (CE) is mentioned but not deeply explored, suggesting a potential avenue for future research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach extends non-backtracking counterfactual generation in an interesting and natural way.
- The authors provide a clear distinction between their method and existing counterfactual explanations, enhancing conceptual clarity.
- Empirical results indicate improved performance with LBF interventions, grounded in the actual distribution, potentially improving practical applicability.
- The authors demonstrate a willingness to refine their terminology and clarify concepts, particularly regarding "Natural Counterfactuals."

Weaknesses:
- The absence of standard errors in tables complicates the assessment of performance differences amidst noise.
- The link to CE is insufficiently detailed, particularly regarding how the authors' definition of *naturalness* compares to existing definitions in CE.
- Figures and annotations are too small, making them difficult to read and contributing to a cramped appearance in the paper.
- The paper lacks a clear use case or problem statement that demonstrates the practical utility of the proposed optimization framework.
- Some reviewers express concerns about the semantics of counterfactuals, indicating a need for further clarification and conceptual grounding.
- The definitions of "backtracking" and "non-backtracking" may still lead to misunderstandings, as they do not align with established meanings in relevant fields.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their presentation by addressing the following points:
- Include standard errors in the tables to better assess the significance of performance differences.
- Expand the discussion on the connection to counterfactual explanations, particularly by comparing their definition of *naturalness* with existing definitions in the literature.
- Enhance the readability of figures and annotations, possibly by increasing their size and spacing to avoid a cramped layout.
- Clarify the motivation behind focusing on "natural counterfactuals" and explicitly state the contexts in which different types of counterfactuals (backtracking, non-backtracking) are appropriate.
- Address implicit assumptions regarding the uniqueness and existence of interventions early in the paper to avoid confusion.
- Report the number of counterfactuals excluded from the analysis to provide a clearer understanding of the method's practical utility.
- Improve clarity by focusing exclusively on the term "Natural Counterfactuals" to avoid confusion with established definitions of backtracking.
- Explicitly define the specific problems or use cases their approach addresses, ensuring that examples provided align closely with the observational distribution relevant to their claims.
- Refine their explanations regarding the semantics of counterfactuals to ensure consistency and avoid ambiguity, particularly in distinguishing between interventions and changes in initial conditions.
- Remain neutral regarding the correct semantics for counterfactuals in the final version, as the primary contribution of the paper lies in the proposed methodology rather than in resolving philosophical debates.
