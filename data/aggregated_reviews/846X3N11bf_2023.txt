Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ProBio, a multimodal dataset aimed at enhancing reproducibility in biological laboratories through several key contributions. It emphasizes video understanding of lab protocols and comprises 180 hours of multi-view video with fine-grained annotations aligned with experimental protocols. The authors propose two benchmarking tasks: transparent solution tracking and multimodal action recognition, addressing performance gaps in current models and opportunities for future improvements in video understanding for biology experiments. Additionally, the paper introduces a protocol-guided monitoring system designed to reduce errors in experimental execution by providing real-time notifications of anomalies, thereby safeguarding against significant resource loss. The dataset also includes video-understanding models that tackle ambiguous actions in biological settings and a regularized biological protocol design to improve the temporal processing capabilities of video comprehension models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with a clear motivation to address reproducibility issues in biology experiments.
- The dataset is comprehensive, featuring detailed hierarchical annotations and a rigorous data collection process.
- The proposed monitoring system and benchmarks are innovative and relevant to current challenges in biological experimentation.
- Detailed explanations of ambiguity and its measurement enhance the theoretical framework of the study.

Weaknesses:
- The rationale for incorporating written protocols into protocol-guided tracking is inadequately explained, raising questions about the necessity of action recognition models.
- The overlap between transparent solution tracking and action recognition tasks may cause confusion regarding their distinct purposes.
- The complexity of the monitoring system may raise concerns about its implementation and potential control over experimenters.
- The dataset's limited scope, with only 13 recorded experiments, may restrict its attractiveness for broader community engagement.
- The reliance on expert annotations and the associated costs may limit the scalability of the dataset.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the relationship between their dataset and reproducibility in biology labs, specifically detailing how the dataset can enhance monitoring systems. Additionally, we suggest providing a more thorough explanation of the ambiguity score and its implications for similar tasks. To alleviate concerns about control over experimenters, clarity regarding the implications of the monitoring system should be improved. We also recommend expanding the number of benchmarking tasks to attract more community interest and providing more detailed information on the scalability of the annotation process to enhance the dataset's accessibility. Finally, addressing potential quality concerns regarding segmentation performed by minimally trained annotators would strengthen the dataset's credibility.
