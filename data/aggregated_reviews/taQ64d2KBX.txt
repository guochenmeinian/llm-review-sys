Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel integration method, the mean inverse integrator (MII), aimed at learning dynamics from noisy data, particularly in Hamiltonian systems. The authors investigate mono-implicit Runge-Kutta (MIRK) methods and demonstrate the effectiveness of MII through various numerical experiments. The paper provides theoretical insights into the sensitivity of the proposed method to data noise and compares it with several baseline integrators.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem of learning physical dynamics from noisy data is compelling and relevant.
- The paper is well-written, with clear presentation and thorough theoretical analysis.
- Empirical results indicate significant advantages of the proposed method over baseline approaches.

Weaknesses:
- The usefulness and significance of the proposed method remain unclear, particularly in comparison to naive noise handling methods.
- The experimental results show that MII is not always more accurate than alternatives and is consistently slower, necessitating clearer use case definitions.
- The presentation of the explicit Runge-Kutta baseline is confusing and lacks sufficient detail.
- Scalability to high-dimensional systems is not adequately explored, with experiments limited to low-dimensional cases.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the advantages of the mean inverse integrator over naive methods, particularly regarding its ability to handle varying noise levels. A thorough comparison with the latest methods and a detailed discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method would enhance the paper's significance. Additionally, we suggest revising the structure to focus more on the application of the integrator in learning Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs) and addressing how the integrator can be incorporated into existing training pipelines. Finally, conducting experiments on complex, high-dimensional data would provide valuable insights into the method's scalability and robustness.
