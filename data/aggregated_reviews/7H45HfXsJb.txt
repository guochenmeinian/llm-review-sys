### Key Points
This paper presents a Knowledge-Constrained Tree Search (KCTS) decoding method that reduces hallucinations in text generation by guiding a frozen language model (LM) with a knowledge classifier score and a Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. The authors introduce the Reward Inflection Point Approximation (RIPA), a token-level classifier that predicts when generated content is no longer grounded in knowledge. The method is evaluated on knowledge-grounded dialogue and summarization tasks, demonstrating effectiveness through various metrics, including automatic evaluations and human assessments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and clearly articulates its contributions, including a novel token-level hallucination detection method and extensive experimental validation.
- KCTS is a plug-and-play, model-agnostic approach that effectively reduces hallucinations without high training costs or catastrophic forgetting.

Weaknesses:  
- The Knowledge-Weighted Decoded (KWD) variant of RIPA is not adequately explained, raising concerns about its implementation and performance.
- The synthetic data generation methods for training RIPA may lack guarantees regarding the factuality of generated tokens, and the paper does not sufficiently address potential issues with the grounding of later tokens in a sequence.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the Knowledge-Weighted Decoded (KWD) variant by providing a more detailed explanation of its methodology and performance. Additionally, we suggest addressing the concerns regarding the synthetic data generation for RIPA, ensuring that the examples used for training are reliably grounded in knowledge. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the criteria for stopping partial sequence generation in the Rollout section and to provide more specific explanations for the transition from string to probability in Equation (5).
