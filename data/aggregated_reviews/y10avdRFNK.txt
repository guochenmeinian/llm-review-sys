### Key Points
This paper presents JKOnet*, a novel method for learning diffusion dynamics from observational data, focusing on the energy functional in Equation 3. It addresses the inverse problem of diffusion processes through a more efficient quadratic loss minimization, avoiding complex bilevel optimization. JKOnet* can handle potential, internal, and interaction energies, demonstrating superior performance in simulations compared to existing methods. The authors provide theoretical insights and empirical evidence supporting JKOnet*'s advantages in computational efficiency and scalability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper makes a solid contribution to the challenging problem of inferring diffusion dynamics, significantly improving upon JKOnet in performance, optimization simplicity, scalability, and generality.
- The methodology is well-motivated and original, with clear intuition provided throughout.
- Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements in accuracy and efficiency.

Weaknesses:
- Some language is imprecise, such as "runs at lightspeed," which could be replaced with "runs very efficiently."
- The introduction could be clearer, as it introduces excessive terminology and references that may confuse readers.
- The computational complexity analysis does not account for the construction of optimal transport plans, which adds expense over JKOnet.
- The experimental evaluation is limited to synthetic datasets, lacking insights from real-world applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the precision of their language to enhance clarity. Additionally, we suggest revising the introduction for better coherence and reducing the terminology overload. It would be beneficial to include the construction of optimal transport plans in the computational complexity comparisons. Expanding the experimental evaluation to include real-world datasets would strengthen the practical relevance of JKOnet*. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide a more thorough comparison with prior literature, particularly regarding the loss function's novelty.
