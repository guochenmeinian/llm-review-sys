### Key Points
This paper presents FairMedFM, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the fairness of foundation models (FMs) in medical imaging. It encompasses 17 medical imaging datasets, 20 FMs, various tasks including classification and segmentation, and multiple fairness evaluation metrics. The study reveals prevalent bias in FMs, with fairness-utility trade-offs influenced by FM choice and usage. The authors provide an open-source codebase to facilitate further research and raise awareness of fairness issues in medical imaging.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark that addresses critical gaps in understanding bias and fairness in AI applications in healthcare.  
- Extensive experimental analysis across multiple datasets, models, and tasks provides a robust foundation for findings.  
- The framework's thorough evaluation and open-source nature promote reproducibility and community engagement.  

Weaknesses:  
- The study focuses on binarized sensitive attributes, which may not capture the full complexity of real-world demographics.  
- Some important medical imaging tasks, such as detection or reconstruction, are not covered.  
- The findings may be influenced by the specific datasets chosen, which might not represent all medical imaging scenarios.  
- Minor typos and errors, such as in the heading of Section 3.4 ("Taxnonmy"), need correction.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the trade-off metrics by linking the equations of equity-scaled AUC and equity-scaled DSC to the supplementary materials. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide all results in tables to enhance interpretability and transparency. Addressing the identified typos and ensuring the datasets represent diverse patient populations would further strengthen the paper. Finally, guidelines for the responsible use of the benchmark could mitigate potential misuse and enhance its applicability.
