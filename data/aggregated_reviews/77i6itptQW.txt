Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Invariance-acquired Domain Adaptive Hashing (IDEA) model, which utilizes invariant learning based on causality inference for domain adaptive retrieval. The authors propose a feature disentanglement module to extract causal and non-causal features, employing a generative model to reconstruct images using non-causal features. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The deployment of a causality perspective in domain adaptive hashing retrieval is innovative.
- The methodology is straightforward, utilizing an encoder-decoder framework with intervention.
- Extensive experiments demonstrate the model's superiority over related methods.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental settings need clarification, particularly in comparison to related models like PWCF [22], as performance improvements are significant.
- The contribution of the causal perspective lacks clarity, and its application in image retrieval is not well justified.
- There is insufficient discussion of related work that also addresses non-causal feature removal.
- The interpretability of the hash codes is not adequately analyzed, with no visualizations of causal and non-causal features provided.
- The paper does not explore the convergence of mutual information, which is sensitive to noise and outliers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental settings and explicitly compare them with related models such as PWCF [22]. Additionally, the authors should clarify the contribution of the causal perspective in the context of image retrieval and discuss related works that address similar issues. We also suggest including visualizations of causal and non-causal features to enhance interpretability analysis. Furthermore, a convergence analysis of mutual information should be conducted to address its sensitivity to noise. Lastly, testing with a variety of architectures, such as ResNet or Vision Transformer, would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.
