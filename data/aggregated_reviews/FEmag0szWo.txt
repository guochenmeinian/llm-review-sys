Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of the capacity of message-passing graph neural networks (MP-GNNs) in learning strong branching (SB) scores for mixed integer linear programming (MILP). The authors identify a class of MILPs, termed MP-tractable, for which MP-GNNs can accurately approximate SB scores. They also extend their findings to general MILPs using 2-FGNNs, demonstrating that while MP-GNNs struggle with certain MP-intractable MILPs, 2-FGNNs can universally approximate SB scores across all MILPs. The theoretical results are supported by small-scale experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper makes significant theoretical contributions, establishing that MP-GNNs are universal approximators for SB scores of MP-tractable MILPs and that 2-FGNNs can approximate SB scores for all MILPs.
- The theoretical framework is solid, with reasonable proofs and a clear presentation of results.
- The work addresses a critical gap in understanding the compatibility of machine learning techniques with combinatorial optimization problems.

Weaknesses:
- The MILP graph representation is overly simplistic, failing to capture the full relationships between variables, which may limit the effectiveness of the proposed models.
- The experiments lack diversity, focusing on small random instances rather than established MILP benchmarks, raising questions about the generalizability of the results.
- The numerical results do not convincingly demonstrate the practical benefits of 2-FGNN over MP-GNN, particularly regarding training efficiency and solver performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the MILP graph representation to better express variable relationships, potentially by adding features that account for the number of constraints associated with each variable. Additionally, conducting experiments on established MILP benchmarks would strengthen the empirical validation of their claims. Providing detailed training times and solver performance metrics for both MP-GNN and 2-FGNN would enhance the credibility of their findings. Finally, clarifying the mathematical precision in theorems and improving the presentation of proofs would aid in comprehension and verification of the results.
