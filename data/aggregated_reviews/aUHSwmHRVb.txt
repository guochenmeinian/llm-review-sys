Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel deep learning-based framework for recovering high-quality 3D MR images from undersampled and motion-corrupted k-data. The authors propose a motion correction algorithm that estimates rigid motion parameters, allowing for k-space correction prior to final reconstruction. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real MR datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for addressing motion correction in MR imaging is significant, with the proposed method enhancing robustness by removing reliance on motion simulation.
- The integration of MRI acquisition knowledge into the framework improves reconstruction reliability.
- The paper is well-written, organized, and includes experimental evaluations on real-world datasets, which enhances its credibility.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a comprehensive comparison with advanced supervised models and motion correction methods based on diffusion models.
- The overall structure is confusing, making it difficult to follow, and an ablation study is necessary to assess the value of each step.
- The reliance on a 2D reconstruction pipeline raises concerns about potential biases in motion parameter estimation.
- The theoretical foundations of the method require more robust validation, particularly regarding the impact of k-space undersampling patterns on performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison of their method by including advanced supervised models and motion correction techniques based on diffusion models. Additionally, conducting experiments with various types of rigid motion patterns would provide a more comprehensive evaluation. We suggest that the authors clarify the structure of the paper to enhance readability and include a proper ablation study to assess the contributions of each component. Furthermore, a more thorough theoretical investigation into the optimization process and its dependency on k-space undersampling patterns is essential. Lastly, addressing the potential risks of hallucinations and biases in the proposed technique would strengthen the discussion of limitations.
