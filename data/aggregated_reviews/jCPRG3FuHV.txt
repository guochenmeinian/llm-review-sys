Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the ICC regularizer, a novel addition to contrastive loss aimed at enhancing the repeatability of embeddings by minimizing intra-class variance. The authors derive this regularizer from measurement theory and demonstrate its effectiveness through simulations and experiments across three tasks: speaker verification, voice style conversion, and dysphonic voice detection. The results indicate that the ICC regularizer significantly improves the performance of learned embeddings in downstream applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with a clear explanation of the ICC regularizer and its focus on intra-class variance, distinguishing it from traditional contrastive loss.
- The method is straightforward and effectively illustrated through simulations and comparisons, leading to convincing results.
- The link between repeatability and performance in downstream tasks is novel and well-articulated.

Weaknesses:
- There is a lack of comparison with other relevant techniques, such as data augmentation and VICReg, raising questions about the competitiveness of the proposed approach.
- The results section primarily lists outcomes without sufficient analysis, particularly regarding the effect of the regularization weight.
- The experimental setup lacks detail, including training strategies and baseline comparisons, which may undermine the robustness of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with other techniques mentioned in the related work to clarify the competitiveness of the ICC regularizer. Additionally, we suggest reformulating the results section to include more analytical insights, particularly on the impact of the regularization weight. Providing more detailed descriptions of the experimental setup, including training strategies and baseline models, would enhance the replicability and credibility of the results. Finally, exploring the application of the ICC regularizer in self-supervised contexts and larger datasets could further validate its effectiveness.
