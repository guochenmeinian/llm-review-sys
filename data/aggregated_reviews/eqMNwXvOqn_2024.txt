Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method that integrates LLMs with knowledge graphs (KGs) through a specialized KG Language (KGL) for knowledge base completion. The authors introduce a KGL context retriever and a score retriever based on LoRA, which efficiently encodes textual and relational information into KGL token embeddings. The proposed method outperforms existing KG completion techniques, including LLM-based and conventional approaches, on both standard and inductive tasks. The paper also demonstrates MKGL's computational efficiency compared to in-context learning methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
* The proposed approach shows strong performance, outperforming prior methods on knowledge base completion tasks.  
* The method is well-supported empirically, with effective illustrations and formatting that enhance understanding.  
* It may help mitigate issues like hallucination and distribution drift in LLMs.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The model's complexity makes it difficult to follow, and the rationale behind its design lacks clarity.  
2. Limited details on the methodology, particularly regarding the implementation of the multi-layered PNA for KG information retrieval.  
3. The claim of novelty in the "three-word language" parsing appears to overlap with established semantic-role labeling (SRL) tasks, necessitating a comparison with past SRL methods.  
4. The results should include computational costs and parameter counts for a clearer comparison with other methods.  
5. A dedicated discussion section is needed to address limitations comprehensively, as current comments are insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the model explanation by simplifying the presentation and providing clearer visualizations. A more detailed discussion of the methodology, especially regarding the PNA implementation, would enhance understanding. We suggest including a comparison with previous SRL methods to substantiate the novelty of the "three-word language" approach. Additionally, the authors should provide computational cost and full parameter counts in the results to facilitate better comparisons. Finally, a dedicated section addressing limitations in detail would strengthen the paper.
