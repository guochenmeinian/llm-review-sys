### Key Points
This paper presents a study on source attribution in news articles, introducing a dataset of 1,304 annotated articles categorized by 16 different source types. The authors propose a two-step approach for identifying attributable sentences and retrieving their sources, culminating in a novel task of predicting missing sources. The paper provides insights into the compositionality of sources and evaluates several models for source detection and retrieval.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a first-of-its-kind corpus for news article source attributions is a significant contribution.
- The research motivation is strong, aiming to develop tools that assist journalists in source-based writing.
- The paper offers interesting insights into the structure and sourcing of news articles, supported by thorough analyses and ablation studies.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks direct comparisons to existing benchmarks in related tasks, making it unclear how the proposed methods rank against prior work.
- Some descriptions of models are unclear, potentially hindering replicability.
- The paper requires additional editing for clarity and coherence, as several grammatical errors and typos were noted.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of model descriptions to enhance replicability, particularly regarding terms like "source entity candidate" and "speaking verbs." Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide direct comparisons to existing benchmarks in similar tasks to contextualize their contributions. It would also be beneficial to separate the Limitations section from the Ethics Statement and ensure consistent terminology throughout the paper. Lastly, we encourage the authors to address the noted typos and grammatical errors to improve readability.
