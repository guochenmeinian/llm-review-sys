### Key Points
This paper presents a unified framework for multi-stage information retrieval systems, termed Full Stage Learning to Rank (FS-LTR), which challenges the traditional Probability Ranking Principle (PRP) by introducing the Generalized Probability Ranking Principle (GPRP). The authors address selection bias across stages and enhance performance in retrieval and ranking, supported by extensive evaluations, including simulations and live A/B tests on a short-video recommendation platform.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles a significant issue in multi-stage recommendation systems regarding selection bias and the applicability of traditional ranking principles.
- It proposes the GPRP, which accounts for user interests and selection biases.
- The theoretical framework is well-supported, and experiments demonstrate clear performance improvements.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks adequate coverage of existing research on selection bias in learning to rank (LTR), omitting relevant works that could provide context and comparison.
- The experimental section does not include results for the ranking stage, despite claiming to cover it, and the baselines used are overly simplistic, lacking comparisons with other methods addressing selection bias and multi-stage optimization.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by including discussions on prior works related to selection bias in LTR, such as those by Oosterhuis et al. and Ovaisi et al. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide experimental results for the ranking stage and compare their method against established baselines like RankFlow and ICC. Further, we encourage the authors to conduct additional ablation studies and explore the robustness of their assumptions, particularly regarding pointwise exposure probabilities and real-world verification of their claims. Lastly, we advise including statistical measures to substantiate the significance of online evaluation results.
