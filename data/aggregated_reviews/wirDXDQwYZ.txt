### Key Points
This paper presents QuRe, a dataset for converting generalized quantifiers into percentages through crowdsourcing, and proposes the PRESQUE framework, which integrates a Rational Speech Acts (RSA) model with Natural Language Inference (NLI) to enhance percentage scope predictions. The results indicate that PRESQUE improves predictions by approximately 20% compared to traditional NLI methods. The paper also introduces a test suite for evaluating the ability of language models to interpret generalized quantifiers semantically.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation and problem statement are clearly articulated, with a solid theoretical foundation and experimental design.
- The QuRe dataset is versatile and contributes significantly to the field of NLI, particularly in quantifier-related reasoning.
- The paper provides detailed annotation procedures and statistical analyses, enhancing the robustness of the findings.

Weaknesses:
- The QuRe dataset's reliance on Wikipedia sentences may limit its applicability, as LLMs may have encountered these interpretations during pre-training.
- The distribution of quantifier expressions in QuRe is skewed, which may affect the dataset's representativeness.
- Some quantifiers included in the study, such as frequency adverbs and bare adjectives, require further justification for their classification as quantifiers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the balance of quantifier expressions in the QuRe dataset to enhance its representativeness. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the rationale for including certain quantifiers, particularly those that are not traditionally viewed as quantifiers. The authors should also provide absolute frequencies of quantifiers in the dataset and ensure that all tables and figures consistently indicate which dataset is being referenced. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore the potential for adapting the framework to a value regression setting to better align with human interpretations. Lastly, we suggest addressing the statistical significance of human evaluations and clarifying the influence of dialogue context on quantifier semantics within the RSA framework.
