Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for interpolating between two seeds in the seed space of diffusion models, addressing the bias towards inputs with a narrow range of norm values. The authors propose a new non-Euclidean metric that incorporates a norm-based prior on seeds and describe an efficient algorithm for approximating this metric. The method is validated through experiments demonstrating its effectiveness in generating rare concept images and enhancing performance in few-shot and long-tail learning scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a compelling theoretical foundation for the proposed non-Euclidean metric by discussing the relationship between the seed's norm and image quality.
- Experimental results indicate that the proposed metric and centroid method effectively address challenges in rare concept generation and long-tail training.
- The method shows promise in generating effective images in limited data scenarios, particularly when combined with existing techniques like SeedSelect.

Weaknesses:
- The elaboration on core path optimization and the centroid method is insufficient compared to the extensive discussion on the norm problem of the seed.
- The experimental results do not demonstrate a significant advantage, particularly after incorporating the seed-selection method.
- The comparison of interpolation methods is limited to basic techniques, lacking exploration of more advanced non-linear methods, and the results appear inconsistent with expectations.
- Key aspects of the experimental design, such as the seed selection method and the number of piece-wise linear paths, are not adequately detailed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the elaboration on core path optimization and the centroid method to provide a more balanced discussion. Additionally, consider exploring and comparing more advanced non-linear interpolation methods to strengthen the experimental results. Clarifying the experimental design, particularly regarding the seed selection method and the number of piece-wise linear paths, would enhance the paper's clarity. Finally, addressing the formatting errors and providing clearer explanations for figures and constraints would improve overall presentation.
