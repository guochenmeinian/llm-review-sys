### Key Points
This paper presents a multi-step approach for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) specifically tailored for Sentiment Analysis (SA), although the methodology is task-agnostic. The authors propose identifying important words using an attention mechanism, followed by synonym identification through WordNet, and ranking these synonyms with a "lexical substitution model." The highest-ranked synonym replaces the original word, and the modified sentence is then processed by a sentiment classifier. The framework aims to enhance interpretability and accuracy in sentiment classification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach allows for the interpretation of word importance concerning polarity and their replacement candidates.
- The disambiguation of polysemous words in sentiment analysis is a valuable and under-explored area.
- The framework enhances explainability through lexical substitution.

Weaknesses:
- The methodology is complex, requiring two models and a lexical resource, which may hinder practical application.
- The experimental results are not compelling, with weak baselines and reliance on a static resource like WordNet, which may limit the approach's effectiveness.
- Notation inconsistencies and a lack of clarity in the algorithm hinder understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 4 and the algorithm, possibly by including a table of symbols to address notation inconsistencies. Additionally, we suggest providing a more thorough analysis of the time efficiency of the proposed framework. The authors should consider using a standard WSD system as a baseline instead of the current substitution model. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to include a discussion on how the model accounts for context in WSD and to tone down claims regarding state-of-the-art performance, particularly in light of existing benchmarks. Lastly, simplifying Figure 1 and adding a section on neuro-symbolic methods in the related work could enhance the paper's readability and context.
