### Key Points
This paper presents a formal experimental design to optimize the placement of sea drifters for measuring and inferring ocean currents. The authors propose a lightweight Bayesian Active Learning-based drifter experimental design strategy, claiming to be the first to provide a formal statistical design of drifter allocation strategies. The numerical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of their methods, particularly showing advantages over baselines in terms of MSE.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors claim to be the first to provide a formal statistical design of drifter allocation strategies.
- The use of Bayesian experimental design for drifter placement appears to be novel.
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The related works are lacking in the Introduction; the authors should provide evidence to support the exclusiveness of their work, particularly regarding "space-filling" designs and expert opinions without citations.
- The impact of the first drifter deployment on final utility is not addressed, and optimal determination of the first drifter placement is not discussed.
- The experiments should be expanded to explore additional factors, such as area size, on different methods.
- The authors do not convincingly justify their choice of a myopic policy over a fully non-myopic one, despite literature indicating the superiority of non-myopic policies.
- A comparison between BALLASTn and BALLASTs is missing, and the motivation for introducing BALLASTs is unclear.
- The claim regarding substantial benefits from incorporating BALLAST into sequential placement strategies is not sufficiently supported by simulation results, which show marginal improvements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the Introduction by including relevant citations to support their claims about existing drifter placement campaigns. Additionally, the authors should address how the first drifter placement affects final utility and provide a discussion on the optimal determination of this placement. Expanding the experiments to include more factors, such as area size, would enhance the robustness of the findings. We also suggest clarifying the rationale behind choosing a myopic policy and providing a detailed comparison between BALLASTn and BALLASTs. Finally, we recommend that the authors strengthen the numerical validation to convincingly support the benefits of using BALLAST, potentially through additional simulations.
