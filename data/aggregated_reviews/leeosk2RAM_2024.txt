Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents UDKAG, a novel framework aimed at enhancing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by integrating up-to-date knowledge retrieved from the internet during inference. The authors propose a hierarchical filtering model to identify relevant content from search engine results and introduce the UDK-VQA dataset to evaluate the model's performance on Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. The method demonstrates significant performance improvements and can be integrated into existing LVLMs without extensive trial and error.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a novel internet-augmented generation framework that updates knowledge effectively.
2. The creation of the UDK-VQA dataset is a valuable contribution.
3. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the UDK-VQA dataset.
4. Extensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the framework.

Weaknesses:
1. The cost of leveraging search engines and models like ChatGPT needs further elaboration to assess cost-efficiency.
2. The claim of being the first open-source framework for integrating up-to-date knowledge may be misleading, as other frameworks exist.
3. Limited novelty in the construction pipeline of UDK-VQA raises concerns about its uniqueness.
4. The definition of "up-to-date knowledge" and the timestamp threshold require clarification.
5. The framework's performance is heavily reliant on the quality of the hierarchical filtering model.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the cost implications of using search engines and LLMs like ChatGPT to demonstrate cost-efficiency.
2. The authors should clarify how their framework differs from existing methods that utilize external knowledge.
3. We suggest that the authors conduct experiments comparing their method against existing state-of-the-art methods that utilize external knowledge for clearer validation.
4. The authors should provide a more detailed definition of "up-to-date knowledge" and the criteria for the timestamp threshold.
5. We recommend that the authors extend their evaluation to include a broader range of benchmarks requiring external knowledge to verify the generalizability of their framework.
