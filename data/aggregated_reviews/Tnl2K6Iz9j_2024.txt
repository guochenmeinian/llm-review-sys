Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on dynamic pricing of service fees in third-party platforms, focusing on maximizing total revenue while considering strategic customer behavior and incomplete demand information. The authors propose using Instrumental Variables in an online setting to theoretically bound the model's regret. The work addresses challenges such as equilibrium observation limitations and incorporates active randomness injection and non-i.i.d. actions as instrumental variables.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem is interesting, and the modeling is more realistic than hypothetical.
- The paper is technically strong, with a clear mathematical framework and innovative algorithmic solutions.
- The study of "noise helps learning" and phase transition is intriguing, and the algorithms demonstrate optimal regret bounds.

Weaknesses:
- Some proofs could have been included in the main paper, as theoretical contributions are a key strength.
- The motivation for the dynamic pricing problem is questionable, given that service fees do not change frequently in practice.
- The assumptions made, such as linear supply and demand curves, may not hold in real-world scenarios, limiting practical application.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity around the equilibrium equation (1) and its relevance to buyer strategies by providing additional intuition. The authors should also consider relaxing the assumption of a 100% civilian-run seller to enhance the paper's impact. Furthermore, we suggest including more real-world examples or case studies to illustrate the practical application of the proposed algorithms. Additionally, the authors should address the inconsistencies in the motivation regarding the frequency of service fee changes and reconcile this with the numerical experiments involving a large number of time periods. Lastly, we encourage the authors to enrich the exposition on conditional independence related to non-i.i.d. actions and provide more detail on the implementation of the hypothesis test in Algorithm 3.
