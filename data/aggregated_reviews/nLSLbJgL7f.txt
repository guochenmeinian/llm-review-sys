Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel evaluation method for visual emotion recognition based on Mikel's Wheel distance, focusing on misclassification severity. The authors propose new metrics, Emotion Confusion Confidence (ECC) and Emotional Mistakes Confidence (EMC), to enhance model selection and threshold adjustment in semi-supervised learning tasks. The effectiveness of these metrics is supported by experimental results and user studies, which suggest they align better with human emotional cognition than traditional accuracy metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The introduction of a novel emotional recognition evaluation framework that considers emotional similarity and misclassification severity.  
- Validation through user studies confirms that the proposed metrics are consistent with human emotional cognition, providing a robust framework for future research.  
- Good performance compared to baselines in tables 1 and 2, with reported standard deviations indicating significant improvement.  

Weaknesses:  
- The related work section inadequately combines subsections 2.2 and 2.3, which should be unified due to their interconnected content.  
- Adjustments to the Emotion Wheel's distances have led to illogical proximity between unrelated emotions, raising concerns about the model's configuration.  
- The paper lacks comprehensive comparisons with existing methods, limiting its credibility and depth.  
- The reliance on Mikel's Wheel, a less-studied emotion model, diminishes the study's impact, especially given the extensive work based on Ekman's model.  
- The evaluation mechanism overlooks the multi-class nature of emotions, which complicates the application of accuracy metrics.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section by combining subsections 2.2 and 2.3 for clarity. Additionally, the authors should reconsider the adjustments made to the Emotion Wheel to ensure that correlated emotions are appropriately represented. To enhance the study's credibility, we suggest including a broader range of comparative methods and addressing the multi-class classification task more effectively by applying accuracy metrics to individual emotion classes. Furthermore, integrating experiments with fully supervised learning would provide a more comprehensive demonstration of the proposed metrics' utility. Lastly, we encourage the authors to discuss the implications of their work in the context of supervised learning and to explore the application of their metrics across various emotion models beyond Mikel's Wheel.
