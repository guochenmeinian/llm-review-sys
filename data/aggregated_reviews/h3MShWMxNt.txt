Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Scattering Vision Transformer (SVT), which adapts transformers for computer vision tasks by utilizing a spectrally scattering network. The SVT employs Dual-time Complex Wavelet Transforms (DTCWT) to decompose images into low-frequency and high-frequency components, addressing attention complexity and information loss. The authors propose a novel feature mixing technique using Einstein multiplication for high-frequency components and tensor multiplication for low-frequency components. The SVT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet dataset, demonstrating significant reductions in parameters and computational complexity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The use of DTCWT is a robust approach that effectively addresses information loss in previous transformer models.
2. The combination of tensor multiplication and Einstein multiplication is an innovative technique that enhances performance.
3. The experimental results indicate strong promise for the proposed method, achieving superior performance compared to existing vision transformers.

Weaknesses:
1. The clarity of the technical contributions is obscured by convoluted explanations; the authors should simplify and clarify their presentation.
2. The paper lacks sufficient support for some claims, particularly regarding the robustness of SVT compared to other transformers.
3. There are numerous grammatical errors and inconsistencies in references that need to be addressed for improved readability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their technical contributions by explicitly stating the key innovations in the rebuttal and method sections. Additionally, the authors should condense convoluted explanations into a succinct introduction of the method. To strengthen their claims, we suggest providing mathematical proofs or references supporting the use of tensor and Einstein multiplication. Furthermore, a thorough review of the manuscript for grammatical errors and consistency in references is essential. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore comparisons with popular CNN-based methods to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of SVT's performance.
