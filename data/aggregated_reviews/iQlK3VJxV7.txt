Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an Uncertainty-aware Alignment Network (UAN) aimed at addressing the unsupervised domain adaptation challenge in text-video retrieval. The authors propose a method that leverages multi-granularity relationships to adapt to one-to-many correspondences between videos and texts in the target domain. Evaluations on datasets such as MSR-VTT, MSVD, and TGIF demonstrate that UAN outperforms existing unsupervised domain adaptation methods for video retrieval. The method incorporates a multi-modal mutual information module and an Uncertainty-aware Alignment Mechanism (UAM) to enhance performance. The authors provide experimental results that support the effectiveness of UAM, particularly in comparison to existing methods like DAC, and clarify how UAM integrates with other retrieval methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The experiments conducted are thorough and convincing, including evaluations for image-text domain adaptation, indicating a robust foundational approach.
- The motivation for addressing the one-to-many relationships is clearly articulated and validated through comprehensive ablation studies.
- The effectiveness of UAM is well-supported by experimental results, and the integration of UAM with existing methods is clearly articulated.

Weaknesses:
- The values of parameters \(a\) and \(b\) in equations 7 and 8 are not specified, raising questions about their selection.
- Equations 10 and 11 lack adequate introduction and explanation, particularly regarding the definitions of \(T\) and \(K\).
- The discussion on failure cases is insufficient, with only a brief mention of one case in Figure 6 that lacks clarity.
- The assumption of one-to-one relationships during evaluation contrasts with the many-to-one and one-to-many relationships utilized during training, which warrants further discussion.
- There is a lack of explicit justification regarding the importance of matching uncertainty in limiting the performance of existing UDAVR methods. The motivation behind UAM, while intuitive, could benefit from further elaboration.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of equations 7 and 8 by specifying the values of \(a\) and \(b\) and their selection criteria. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the introduction and explanation of equations 10 and 11 to clarify the roles of \(T\) and \(K\). Expanding the discussion on failure cases, particularly in Figure 6, would provide deeper insights into the model's limitations. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore the implications of relaxing the one-to-one assumption during evaluation and to discuss the potential for many-to-many relationships in future work. Lastly, we recommend improving the justification of the motivation behind UAM, particularly regarding how matching uncertainty affects the performance of existing models under the one-to-one assumption, and incorporating a more detailed discussion of scenarios where one-to-many matching relationships do not exist.
