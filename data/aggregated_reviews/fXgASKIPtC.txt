### Key Points
This paper presents a framework, CL-KCRec, aimed at enhancing knowledge concept recommendation in MOOCs by balancing explicit and implicit relations. The authors argue that existing models often overlook implicit relations, which can lead to suboptimal recommendations. To address this, they construct a heterogeneous information network (HIN) and employ a relation-updated graph convolutional network (GCN) alongside a stacked multi-channel graph neural network (GNN) for modeling these relations. The framework also incorporates contrastive learning with a prototypical graph and a dual-head attention mechanism for balanced relation fusion, demonstrating effectiveness through extensive experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The approach of modeling both explicit and implicit relations is rational and promising, providing a holistic view of user behavior in MOOCs.
2. The use of GCN and GNN for different types of relations is innovative and effectively captures complex dynamics.
3. The incorporation of contrastive learning significantly enhances representation accuracy, leading to improved recommendations.
4. Extensive experiments validate the proposed method's effectiveness against state-of-the-art models.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation lacks clarity, with insufficient explanation of crucial concepts like explicit and implicit relations.
2. The rationale for choosing different GNNs for explicit and implicit relations and the application of contrastive learning is weak.
3. The main claim regarding the definition of explicit and implicit relations is confusing and reduces the novelty of the work.
4. Missing experimental details, such as the definition of 'interactive data of a user' and 'auxiliary information' in node representation.
5. The model design is complex, as it aggregates explicit relations to derive implicit relations, raising questions about the necessity of this approach.
6. Lack of support for claims regarding the quantity of explicit versus implicit relations.
7. The experiments rely on a single dataset, limiting the demonstration of the proposed method's effectiveness.
8. Formatting issues in the manuscript need correction.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation by providing detailed explanations of explicit and implicit relations. Additionally, the rationale for the choice of different GNNs and the use of contrastive learning should be strengthened with supporting evidence. The authors should clarify their definitions of explicit and implicit relations to avoid confusion. We suggest including more experimental details, particularly regarding user interactive data and auxiliary information. Furthermore, simplifying the model design could enhance understanding, and the authors should justify the complexity of their approach. To strengthen the findings, we recommend evaluating the model on multiple datasets and addressing computational efficiency in the experiments. Lastly, we advise correcting the formatting issues throughout the manuscript.
