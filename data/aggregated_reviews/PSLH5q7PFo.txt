Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an active learning algorithm aimed at selecting pairs of items for comparison to derive a ranking of those items. The ranking error is quantified using Kendallâ€™s Tau distance, with the algorithm selecting pairs based on an upper bound of this error. The authors propose the GURO algorithm, supported by theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations across synthetic and real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Active learning for pairwise comparisons is an intriguing area of study.
- The approach is underpinned by solid theoretical analysis.
- The empirical evaluation demonstrates promising results.

Weaknesses:
- The paper relies on strong assumptions regarding pairwise comparisons, specifically the response model $P(C_{ij}=1) = \sigma(\theta_*\cdot(x_i-x_j))$, which are common in the literature but may limit generalizability.
- The optimization problem for pair selection appears challenging, with a quadratic cost in the number of items; a linear approximation would enhance practicality.
- The empirical results show that the proposed method does not consistently outperform baselines, particularly on real data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by explicitly defining $\Delta_*$ and discussing its dependence on the index difference $|i-j|$. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion on the number of available annotations for each dataset and addressing the lack of annotation noise in the experiments. It would also be beneficial to add state-of-the-art baselines for performance comparison and to clarify the computational complexity of GURO and its variants. Lastly, we advise emphasizing the prediction ordering quality in the results and addressing the limitations related to the assumptions made in the paper.
