Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents TREACLE, a reinforcement learning policy aimed at optimizing the selection of large language models (LLMs) and prompting schemes while adhering to user-defined budget constraints related to cost and latency. The authors propose a method that leverages question context, embeddings, and response history to enhance prompting strategies, achieving significant cost savings and maintaining accuracy. The system dynamically evaluates whether to re-query models based on response consistency and budget availability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. TREACLE offers substantial cost savings by intelligently selecting LLMs and prompts based on monetary cost, latency, and accuracy.
2. The approach customizes prompting strategies using advanced techniques like Chain-of-Thought, improving answer quality while controlling costs.
3. The paper is well-written, presents solid experimental results, and introduces an interesting algorithm design.

Weaknesses:
1. The dynamic selection of models may incur increased computational costs and delays, particularly in high-performance scenarios.
2. The reward mechanism relies on user feedback, which may be inconsistent, leading to instability in learning and inaccuracies in reward distribution.
3. The method fails to differentiate between simple and complex questions in model selection, potentially leading to inefficiencies in cost management.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the model selection mechanism to differentiate between simple and complex questions, enabling the use of low-cost models for straightforward queries while reserving more powerful models for challenging ones. Additionally, the authors should consider optimizing for minimal actual cost rather than merely adhering to a maximum budget. To address concerns regarding the reward mechanism, we suggest enhancing the feedback collection process to ensure clearer and more consistent user input. Finally, we encourage the authors to expand the experimental scope to include a broader range of tasks, as the current task selection appears limited.
