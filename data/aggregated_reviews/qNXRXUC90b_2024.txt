Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Segmentation with Uncertainty Model (SUM), which enhances the Segment Anything Model (SAM) by integrating high-quality annotated data with a large unlabeled dataset. The authors propose an uncertainty-aware fine-tuning process that quantifies uncertainty in SAM's pseudo labels, alongside task prompts to clarify segmentation tasks. The method is evaluated across 14 public benchmarks, demonstrating improved performance in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and mean boundary IoU (mBIoU).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation to improve SAM's accuracy while maintaining generalization is compelling.
- The experimental validation is extensive, showcasing the method's effectiveness across various datasets.
- The paper is well-structured, with a clear explanation of the proposed method and comprehensive supplementary materials.

Weaknesses:
- The uncertainty-aware fine-tuning method lacks innovation, as similar strategies have been widely utilized in prior works.
- The method section lacks a theoretical introduction, relying too heavily on text without sufficient visual aids or formulas.
- The presentation is unclear, with confusing figures and a lack of clarity in the organization of the method section.
- The SUM framework introduces significant complexity and computational overhead, which may hinder practical implementation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical introduction in the method section by incorporating more visual aids, such as formulas or figures, to enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest reorganizing the method section for clarity, possibly by moving certain modules to the Preliminary section. To improve readability, consider using subheadings in the Related Work section and emphasizing the advantages of the proposed method. Lastly, addressing the clarity of figures and ensuring they effectively convey the intended information would enhance the overall presentation.
