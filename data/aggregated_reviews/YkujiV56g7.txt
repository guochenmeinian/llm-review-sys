### Key Points
This paper presents ADA-NNS, a novel search algorithm designed for graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) systems, which aims to efficiently identify vectors similar to a query vector within large datasets. The authors argue that existing ANNS methods are suboptimal, particularly in their search algorithms, and propose an innovative approach utilizing approximate angular distance as a filter to narrow the search space. The paper includes a comprehensive experimental evaluation across six diverse datasets, benchmarking ADA-NNS against four state-of-the-art algorithms and demonstrating significant throughput improvements. The algorithm is shown to outperform the baseline greedy search by 34%–107% at 95% recall@10 on the HNSW graph structure while maintaining minimal memory overhead.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces an angular distance-based filtering approach that efficiently excludes irrelevant neighbors, significantly reducing the number of exact similarity computations without compromising accuracy.
- The algorithm optimizes the search process independently of the underlying graph structure, ensuring compatibility with various existing graph construction techniques.
- The authors provide a thorough experimental analysis of ADA-NNS across six distinct datasets, offering a holistic view of the algorithm’s strengths and limitations.

Weaknesses:
- The algorithm requires careful tuning of several hyperparameters for optimal performance; while initial guidance is provided, further research into automated tuning strategies would enhance usability.
- The evaluation is limited to a specific hardware platform, leaving performance across different configurations unclear.
- The benchmarking focuses on HNSW, and the evaluation could be expanded to include alternative graph structures like NSG, Vamana, and NSSG for a broader perspective.
- The algorithm is optimized for in-memory vector databases, and examining its potential in disk-based or distributed environments would be valuable.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the methodological description by including more details on the preprocessing steps involved, particularly regarding the construction of hash matrices and cosine lookup tables. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explore the algorithm's performance in environments where data cannot fit entirely in memory and consider the impact of different graph construction methods on ADA-NNS’s performance. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide a GitHub repository with code and documentation to enhance the paper’s usability and reproducibility.
