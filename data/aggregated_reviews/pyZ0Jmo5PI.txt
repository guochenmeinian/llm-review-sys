### Key Points
This paper presents FedMobile, a Federated Learning approach for multimodal learning that effectively addresses the issue of missing modalities. The authors propose a feature generator to create missing modality data and incorporate several components: a knowledge-distillation-based method for imputing missing modalities, a contribution evaluation module using the Shapley Value, and a node-level contribution-aware aggregation rule. The system is evaluated across five datasets and six baselines, demonstrating superior performance in various settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles a timely and significant issue in multimodal model training, presenting a comprehensive evaluation that shows FedMobile outperforms existing methods.
- The methodology is innovative, combining knowledge distillation and Shapley value-based aggregation, which enhances performance.
- The framework is scalable and practical, suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Weaknesses:
- The paper is dense, making it challenging to understand some equations and their interdependencies; intuitive explanations are often lacking.
- The connection between proposed components is unclear, leading to a perception of disjointed optimizations.
- The experimental results require more detailed discussions on the performance improvements and the rationale behind certain design choices.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by adding step numbers to Figure 2 and referencing the corresponding sections for each step. Additionally, it would be beneficial to clarify the definition of a "missing modality," specifying whether it pertains to node-level or sample-level issues. 

We suggest providing more insights into the functioning of the baselines and why they perform worse than FedMobile, as well as including a clearer presentation of the challenges and solutions in the introduction. Enhancing Figures 1 and 2 with clearer annotations and ensuring that all tables and figures appear before their first reference in the text would improve readability. 

Moreover, we encourage the authors to address the unclear presentation of key equations, particularly Equation 6, and to validate the claims regarding the shared feature space with empirical evidence. Finally, discussing the implications of the contribution-aware mechanism in relation to missing modalities would strengthen the paper's cohesiveness.
