### Key Points
This paper presents a Gradient Guided Diffusion Model (GGDM) aimed at reconstructing private images from shared gradients in federated learning (FL). The authors adapt Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) to achieve high-fidelity image reconstruction, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. The paper includes a variety of experiments that validate the efficacy of GGDM and provides guidance for optimal implementation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed approach is novel and effectively utilizes DDPM to generate high-quality images.
- The use of a pre-trained model minimizes setup overhead for the attack.
- The paper is well-written, clearly presenting the problem, methodology, and findings.

Weaknesses:
- The threat model is not clearly defined.
- The impact of batch size and number of local epochs on gradient leakage attacks is inadequately discussed.
- The paper neglects to evaluate the effectiveness of existing defensive measures against the proposed attack.
- The novelty is somewhat limited, relying on existing methods with incremental improvements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the definition of the threat model to clarify the attack scenario. Additionally, it is crucial to discuss the implications of using a batch size greater than one and how GGDM can handle averaged gradients to reconstruct independent images. We suggest including evaluations of standard defenses in FL to strengthen the paper's claims. Furthermore, a more detailed discussion on the quality of images generated by GGDM compared to other methods would enhance reader understanding. Lastly, addressing the limitations and potential failure cases of the approach would provide a more comprehensive view of its applicability.
