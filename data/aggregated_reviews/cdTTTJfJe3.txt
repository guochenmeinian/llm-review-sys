Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DeTeCtive, a novel algorithm for detecting AI-generated text by framing the problem as a multi-class "author style" classification rather than a binary classification. The authors develop a contrastive learning algorithm to learn style vectors for various LLMs, stored in a style vector database for KNN classification. The method shows promise in adapting to out-of-distribution (OOD) LLMs and is empirically evaluated across three datasets with outputs from 8 to 27 different LLMs, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces an innovative approach to AI-generated text detection by treating it as a multi-label "LLM style" classification problem, supported by an intuitive contrastive learning algorithm.
2. The algorithm's adaptability to OOD LLM-generated text is a significant advantage, confirmed through analysis experiments.
3. The authors conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation across multiple datasets, enhancing the credibility of their findings.

Weaknesses:
1. The baselines used for comparison are outdated or inadequate, lacking newer methods like Binoculars and watermarking algorithms.
2. There is insufficient experimentation on newer GPT-4 class LLMs, which are crucial for evaluating the algorithm's robustness.
3. The paper lacks a thorough examination of attack robustness, with minimal experiments on paraphrasing and other forms of text manipulation.
4. The contribution of the DeTeCtive method's complexity to performance gains remains unclear, necessitating further ablation studies.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the baseline comparisons by including more recent methods such as Binoculars and watermarking algorithms in the supplementary material. Additionally, we encourage the authors to conduct extensive experiments on GPT-4 class models to assess the algorithm's robustness in challenging scenarios. It is also crucial to enhance the analysis of attack robustness by including experiments on paraphrasing and other text manipulation techniques. Finally, we suggest conducting further ablation studies to clarify the contributions of the DeTeCtive method's complexity to the observed performance improvements.
