Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a robust optimization method for decision problems, specifically through conformal inverse optimization (CIO), which generates uncertainty sets for parameter estimates in inverse optimization (IO). The methodology is evaluated on decision-making tasks like the shortest path and knapsack problems, demonstrating its advantages over classical inverse optimization methods. The authors provide theoretical guarantees on the validity of the uncertainty sets and bounds on the optimality of the decision policy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a significant problem in inverse optimization, leveraging the conformal prediction framework effectively.  
- The proposed methodology is clear, original, and well-structured, with helpful examples and figures that enhance understanding.  
- The authors provide a reproducible code implementation and detailed experimental descriptions.  

Weaknesses:  
- Concerns exist regarding the practical applicability of the methodology, particularly the minor gains relative to the need for large datasets for calibration.  
- Some sections, such as the setup in Section 3.1, lack sufficient intuition, and certain terms (e.g., $\alpha$ and $\Delta_\alpha$) require clearer explanations.  
- The presentation is convoluted at times, with examples that may not generalize well, leading to confusion about the applicability of theoretical results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the setup in Section 3.1 by incorporating a running example, such as rider-driver matching, to provide practical meaning to the variables involved. Additionally, the authors should clarify the significance of the $\Delta_\alpha$ term and how $\alpha$ controls the size of the uncertainty set. It would also be beneficial to discuss the potential issues of applying the methodology to real datasets, particularly regarding the assumptions made in the analysis. Furthermore, we suggest revisiting the presentation of theoretical results to ensure they are clearly connected to practical examples, avoiding convoluted structures that may confuse readers.
