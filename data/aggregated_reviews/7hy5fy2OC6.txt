Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the resilience of invisible watermarks against removal attacks, introducing a new class of attacks termed regeneration attacks. These attacks involve adding random noise to the latent representation of watermarked images and reconstructing them using generative models, demonstrating effective removal of invisible watermarks while maintaining image quality. The study includes theoretical guarantees and empirical results supporting the effectiveness of these attacks, particularly with diffusion models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Introduces a novel attack leveraging generative models, offering a fresh perspective on watermark removal.
- Provides formal proofs demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed attacks.
- Presents extensive empirical results validating the success of the attacks across various watermarking methods.
- The writing is clear and well-organized.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation of the proposed attacks lacks rigor, particularly in experiment settings and reporting metrics.
- Conclusions drawn regarding the effectiveness against semantic-preserving watermarks are insufficiently supported by evidence.
- Some statements in the paper are inaccurate, particularly regarding the nature of the proposed attacks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the rigor of their experimental settings by reporting the maximal PSNR for each attack method when the same detection ability is achieved, rather than using fixed attack points. Additionally, we suggest providing more evidence to support claims regarding the effectiveness of the proposed attacks against semantic-preserving watermarks, including visualizations of the results. It would also be beneficial to clarify the trade-off between the "removability" of watermarks and the associated costs in terms of image quality degradation. Finally, including DiffPure as a baseline attack in the experiments and discussing its performance would enhance the comprehensiveness of the evaluation.
