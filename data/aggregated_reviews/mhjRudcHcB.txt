### Key Points
This paper presents a benchmark suite named NN4SysBench, designed to assess the verification of neural networks used in computer systems. The authors propose a set of neural network verification benchmarks that highlight unique challenges specific to computer systems, which are often overlooked by existing verification tools. The suite includes a variety of applications and provides both vanilla and compatible versions of the benchmarks to facilitate accessibility for current researchers.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The benchmark examples are carefully selected and well-motivated.
- The compatible version enhances accessibility for researchers without specific knowledge of computer systems.
- The vanilla version introduces new challenges that can drive advancements in neural network verification.
- The ability to tune the difficulty of the verification problem is a valuable feature.
- The work addresses an important verification problem beyond classic applications.

Weaknesses:
- The specifications provided are limited, particularly in the probability category, which contains only a single instance.
- The paper lacks detailed explanations and contains grammatical errors in some areas.
- The quality of specifications is insufficient for formal verification tasks, which is a significant weakness.
- Limitations of the benchmark suite are not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the grammatical clarity of the paper, particularly in the Reachability specification paragraph and other identified lines. Additionally, we suggest providing more meaningful and representative specifications to enhance the quality of the benchmark. It would be beneficial to explore more applications of computer systems for future research inclusion in NN4SysBench. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to detail the limitations of their work and clarify how to replicate and utilize the proposed benchmark suite for other applications. Lastly, we recommend including an explanation for NaNs in Figure 4 and addressing the questions raised regarding the learned indexing example and the dual-model for monotonicity.
