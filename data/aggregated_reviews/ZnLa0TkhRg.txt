### Key Points
This paper investigates the influence of temporal changes in test collections on retrieval results, presenting a general scheme that distinguishes between documents, topics, and qrels, with operations to create, update, and delete each. The authors propose various reproducibility measures and conduct experiments on three testbeds, revealing significant temporal changes, particularly concerning the retrieval methods compared. The results are discussed in detail, and follow-up research is suggested. The paper also provides an overview of initiatives addressing evolving collections, reporting metrics for comparing systems across dataset versions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses an important and underexplored topic in information retrieval (IR).  
- The new scheme for characterizing temporal development is valuable for current and future research.  
- The framework for evaluating search systems over changing corpora is well-formulated and insightful.  

Weaknesses:  
- The result analysis in Section 6 lacks depth and merely describes tables without highlighting key findings.  
- The discussion in Section 7, while more engaging, could be further elaborated to clarify important issues.  
- Several notations and terms, such as CRUD, are not adequately defined, leading to confusion.  
- The paper fails to effectively expose and interpret the results, leaving the main messages unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the result analysis in Section 6 by highlighting key insights rather than merely describing data. Additionally, we suggest that the authors elaborate on the discussion points in Section 7, particularly regarding how well the $\Delta$RI isolates system effects. It would also be beneficial to define all technical terms and notations, such as CRUD, early in the paper to avoid confusion. Furthermore, consider revising Table 3 for better organization and clarity. Lastly, addressing the absence of relevant past works on streaming corpora and exploring the adaptation of measures like InfAP could enhance the paper's depth.
