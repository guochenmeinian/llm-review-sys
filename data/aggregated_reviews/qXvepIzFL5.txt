Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Multi-modal, Multi-GSD, Multi-scene Remote Sensing (MMM-RS) dataset aimed at enhancing remote sensing image generation tasks. The dataset comprises approximately 2.1 million text-image pairs, incorporating various modalities such as RGB, NIR, and SAR, and includes critical features like GSD, weather conditions, and satellite information. The authors utilize existing datasets and algorithms to enrich their dataset and demonstrate improved model performance through comprehensive experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The dataset includes diverse image modalities, facilitating cross-modal generation.
2. It addresses significant gaps in existing remote sensing datasets by focusing on essential features, enhancing the accuracy of generated images.
3. The experimental design is thorough, encompassing both qualitative and quantitative analyses.
4. The paper is well-structured and clearly written.

Weaknesses:
1. There is an imbalance in image modalities, particularly with RGB images being predominant.
2. Some datasets already contain text prompts that could improve the accuracy of generated prompts.
3. The structured prompts raise concerns about generalization; additional experiments with more generic prompts are recommended.
4. Comparisons with models fine-tuned on other multimodal datasets are lacking, which would strengthen the paper's claims.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the balance of image modalities by employing image translation and manual selection methods to enhance the representation of less prevalent modalities. Additionally, consider utilizing existing text prompts from datasets to refine the accuracy of BLIP-generated prompts. To address generalization concerns, we suggest adding experiments that utilize more generic prompts. Furthermore, including comparisons with models fine-tuned on other multimodal remote sensing datasets would better highlight the advantages of the proposed dataset. Lastly, we advise providing detailed descriptions of the dataset and its components on the linked website, as well as ensuring that all dataset licenses are compliant with the proposed release.
