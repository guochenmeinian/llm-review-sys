Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates whether the Leela Chess Zero network encodes look-ahead capabilities in its activations, utilizing activation patching, attention head analysis, and probing experiments. The authors demonstrate that the network exhibits a form of look-ahead, particularly in complex chess states, and introduce a method for automatically generating a high-quality dataset of challenging chess puzzles to aid in their analysis. The findings suggest that the network performs at least a one-step look-ahead, with evidence gathered from multiple experimental angles. The authors also address concerns regarding the falsifiability of their work, clarifying their focus on specific distributions and interventions to test their claims while acknowledging the limitations of their dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with a clear introduction and detailed methodology, supported by effective figures.
- It presents a high-quality case study of interpretability in a complex domain, contributing valuable insights into the mechanisms of the Leela Chess Zero network.
- The experimental design is rigorous, providing convincing evidence and important controls to support the claims.
- The authors provide a thorough analysis of the value-network and engage constructively with reviewer feedback, making the paper a significant interpretability case study with interesting results.

Weaknesses:
- The findings are limited to the specific network and domain, raising concerns about the generalizability of the methods to other models or tasks.
- The analysis does not sufficiently explore alternative hypotheses or the prevalence of look-ahead, relying heavily on a filtered dataset that may bias results.
- The lack of negative results or broader distribution testing raises questions about the robustness of the findings.
- The paper lacks comprehensive experiments to validate the findings, such as testing the network's performance in scenarios where it makes incorrect predictions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by conducting experiments outside the filtered dataset, including scenarios where the network fails. Additionally, exploring the behavior of other chess networks, such as Maia or CrazyAra, could provide further insights. We suggest clarifying the definition of "look-ahead in neural networks" and addressing how this work substantiates that claim. The authors should explicitly present a hypothesis that could be tested against their findings, clarifying how their tests would disprove it. Furthermore, checking for negative results on inputs where look-ahead is absent could strengthen the validity of their detectors. Testing more complex, human-curated puzzles and including more illustrative examples to aid understanding, along with a clearer explanation of the activation patching methodology, would enhance the paper's robustness and clarity. Finally, we encourage the authors to include more details about the training process of Leela in the main text and discuss the implications of their findings on the value network.
