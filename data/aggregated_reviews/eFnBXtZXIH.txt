### Key Points
This paper presents an approach to automatically detect contradictions in reviews for scientific papers, introducing the novel task of identifying contradictions between reviewers' comments. The authors created a dataset, ContraSciView, containing 50,303 pairs of review comments extracted from approximately 8.5k papers, and established a baseline method for this task. The methodology includes training an Aspect Sentiment Model using the Multi-Instance Multi-Label Learning Network (MIMLLN) and a Reviewer Disagreement Classifier based on NLI techniques, with evaluation showing that RoBERTa large performs best.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset and evaluation are significant contributions, providing a valuable resource for future research.
- The approach may enhance the peer review process by automating the detection of contradictions, potentially improving reviewer agreement.

Weaknesses:
- The methodology lacks crucial details, raising concerns about soundness and validity.
- Ethical issues arise from the dataset being crawled from OpenReview without explicit consent, which could have long-term implications.
- The definition of contradictions is not clear, and the severity of contradictions is not addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the problem definition and the task's implications, as the subjective nature of contradictions could lead to confusion. Additionally, we urge the authors to address ethical concerns regarding dataset consent and to provide more detailed statistical information about the dataset. Clarifying the distinctions between review pairs and comments, as well as the classification of aspects and sentiments, will enhance the paper's rigor. Finally, we suggest incorporating a discussion on the severity of contradictions and comparing results with earlier systems for detecting contradictions.
