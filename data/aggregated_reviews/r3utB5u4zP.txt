### Key Points
This paper presents an educational test item generation method utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for K-12 students, focusing on silent reading efficiency. The authors propose a framework that includes developing prompts for generating test items and evaluating their difficulty. The study demonstrates a strong correlation between test results from LLM-generated items and manually produced tests, indicating the reliability and validity of the proposed method. Additionally, the research employs LoRA and LLaMa for reading comprehension test generation, utilizing crowdsourced evaluations to compare K-12 students' scores.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively demonstrates the benefits of LLMs in producing reliable test items and evaluating their difficulty.
- It provides comprehensive evaluations and is well-organized and well-written.
- High soundness scores indicate sufficient support for claims and arguments.

Weaknesses:
- The work lacks technical novelty and has weak relevance to EMNLP.
- The focus on True/False questions limits the range of question types, which could hinder comprehensive evaluation.
- There is insufficient discussion regarding the validity of the training data used for calculating correspondence probabilities between lab items and AI-generated items.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the range of question types and options in an adaptive test format to align with standard educational assessment practices. Additionally, please provide a more detailed explanation of the training data's validity, particularly addressing potential biases that could affect results. Furthermore, consider discussing the relevance of previous studies on estimating Item Response Theory difficulty parameters from texts to enhance the paper's context and depth.
