Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel deep learning-based pipeline for extracting full article texts from American newspaper images, addressing tasks such as layout detection, legibility classification, and OCRing. The authors introduce the American Stories dataset, which contains structured historical newspaper article texts and layouts, comprising approximately 20 million scans, 400 million bounding boxes, and 120 million articles. This dataset distinguishes itself from "The Newspaper Navigator Dataset" by enabling legibility classification, custom OCR application, and article association, supporting various machine learning applications, including layout analysis and multi-modal understanding. The authors provide an evaluation of their OCR pipeline, comparing its performance against various open-source and proprietary engines, with EfficientOCR performing best within budget constraints. The paper also discusses the societal impact of the dataset, particularly regarding the public domain status of the newspaper scans used.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
- The proposed pipeline offers a comprehensive approach to document image analysis, integrating multiple tasks effectively.
- The American Stories dataset is extensive, well-annotated, and capable of detecting bounding boxes, enhancing its utility for downstream applications.
- The authors provide detailed validation of OCR accuracy and inter-annotator agreement, promoting reproducibility.
- The inclusion of supplementary materials improves clarity and supports multimodal research.

**Weaknesses:**
- The paper lacks clarity in distinguishing its contributions from prior work, particularly in relation to the 2020 publication "The Newspaper Navigator Dataset."
- The evaluation is based on a limited dataset of only ten manually annotated scans, which may not accurately represent the pipeline's performance.
- Key details regarding the dataset's characteristics, instance counts, and ground-truth information are insufficiently addressed.
- The exposition in the main text and supplementary materials lacks clarity in some areas, and the discussion of related work was not clearly articulated before revisions.
- The focus on historical newspapers may limit the applicability of findings to modern texts, and the paper does not adequately discuss the potential societal impacts or limitations of the dataset.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions by explicitly comparing their work to the 2020 publication mentioned. Additionally, including the NeurIPS conference checklist and providing clearer answers in the datasheet would enhance the paper's conciseness. The authors should elaborate on the advantages of legibility classification and explicitly list potential machine learning tasks for which the dataset can be utilized. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to provide more comprehensive evaluations, including inter-annotator agreement studies and comparisons with existing methods. We also suggest improving the clarity of exposition in the main text and supplementary materials, particularly regarding the methods and applications. Expanding the diversity of evaluation samples and exploring more creative evaluation methodologies could enhance the robustness of the findings. Lastly, addressing the ethical implications of using historical newspaper data and discussing the societal impact of using historical documents for contemporary research should be more prominently featured to alleviate concerns about individual information.
