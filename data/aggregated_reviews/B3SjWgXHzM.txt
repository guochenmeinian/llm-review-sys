### Key Points
This paper presents a method for identifying texts generated by large language models (LLMs) using a T5-based approach that focuses on next-token prediction. The authors propose the T5-Sentinel method, which significantly outperforms baseline classifiers, including OpenAI and ZeroGPT, as well as a straightforward T5 classification layer, in terms of F1, Accuracy, and AUC. The authors also introduce the OpenLLMText dataset, comprising approximately 340,000 text samples from humans and various LLMs, which is expected to facilitate further research in this area.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The T5-Sentinel method demonstrates superior performance in distinguishing human-generated from machine-generated text.
- The construction of the OpenLLMText dataset is a valuable contribution that may benefit future research.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks reporting of statistical significance in key results, particularly in Table 1.
- Important results are placed in the Appendix, which affects the paper's self-containment and accessibility.
- The authors do not clarify whether the dataset and model predictions will be publicly available, raising concerns about reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the self-containment of the paper by moving key results from the Appendix to the main body, ensuring that essential figures and tables are accessible to readers. Additionally, we suggest that the authors report statistical significance for the results presented in Table 1 and discuss how different random initializations of the additional classifier head in T5-Hidden may affect performance. Clarifying the plans for the public release of the OpenLLMText dataset and model weights would also enhance the paper's reproducibility and overall impact.
