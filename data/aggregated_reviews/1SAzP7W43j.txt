Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents VQLoC, an end-to-end trainable framework for Visual Query Localization (VQL) on long-form egocentric videos. The authors propose a single-stage process that efficiently localizes visually specified objects, establishing both query-to-frame and frame-to-frame relationships for spatial-temporal localization. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the public leaderboard and demonstrates significant improvements in inference speed.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- VQLoC streamlines the VQ2D localization process and is end-to-end trainable, resulting in faster inference speed.  
- The results are validated on a public server, with improvements attributed to model design rather than mere parameter tuning.  
- The related work is well-covered, and comparisons to previous baselines are thorough in terms of size, speed, and performance.  
- The proposed architecture effectively models query-video relationships and achieves notable computational efficiency, simplifying previous multi-stage frameworks.

Weaknesses:  
- The completeness of the ablation study is a major concern; additional ablations would strengthen the paper.  
- The choice of window size in the spatio-temporal transformer lacks convincing justification, and the sensitivity of results to hyperparameter selection is unclear.  
- The paper primarily uses the Ego4D dataset, limiting its applicability; exploring other tasks or datasets would enhance its relevance.  
- Some technical contributions appear to lack novelty, relying heavily on existing methods without adequately addressing unique challenges in VQL.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the completeness of the ablation study by conducting more experiments. Specifically, exploring window sizes smaller than 5 could provide valuable insights. Additionally, clarifying the sensitivity of results to hyperparameter choices, such as the thresholds used in the methodology, would strengthen the paper. It would also be beneficial to evaluate the proposed method on the VQ3D setup to broaden its applicability. Furthermore, providing more detailed metrics, such as FPS/GPU memory, would enhance the understanding of the model's performance characteristics.
