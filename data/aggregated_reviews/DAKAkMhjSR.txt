Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a variant of the binary mechanism for continual counting with differential privacy, addressing the challenge of varying noise levels in the classic binary tree mechanism. The authors propose a method that balances noise across observations, achieving a variance of $(0.125 + o(1)) \cdot \log_2^2 T$, which is nearly four times better than the standard binary mechanism. However, it does not surpass the best-known variance achieved by Henzinger et al. (2023) and Denisov et al. (2022), which is $0.04865 \cdot \log_2^2 T$. The proposed mechanism maintains similar time and space complexity to the binary tree mechanism while providing a significant improvement in variance, making it a practical alternative.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a significant improvement in variance with minimal additional complexity, potentially enhancing practical applications.
- The approach is elegant and maintains efficiency comparable to the classic binary mechanism.

Weaknesses:
- The improvement, while clever, may be perceived as too simplistic for a NeurIPS submission.
- The algorithm's presentation lacks clarity, with the main algorithm relegated to supplementary material, making it less accessible.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the main algorithm by moving it from the supplementary material to the main body of the paper and providing a detailed explanation, including examples. Additionally, we suggest that the authors address the analysis of the proposed mechanism's error more thoroughly, ensuring formal definitions and verifiable statements are included. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the implications of their noise distribution claims and the trade-offs between efficiency and privacy-utility in their results.
