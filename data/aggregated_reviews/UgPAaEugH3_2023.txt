### Key Points
This paper presents Gigastep, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environment designed to facilitate research without requiring extensive computational resources. Gigastep features a limited action space for agent motion in three dimensions and offers various observation formats, including state vectors and 2D top-down views. The environment supports configurable rewards for tasks such as tagging and hide-and-seek, and it is optimized for GPU simulation, allowing for rapid execution in parallel. The authors evaluate Gigastep using existing MARL algorithms against hand-coded agents and in self-play scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The need for a more accessible many-agent MARL environment is well-justified, addressing the limitations of existing environments like SMAC.
- The comprehensive literature survey and related work table enhance the paper's clarity and context.
- The implementation in JAX with XLA significantly improves computational efficiency.
- Gigastep's flexibility allows it to accommodate various RL algorithms and applications.

Weaknesses:
- The dynamics of the environment are overly simplistic, lacking complexity found in other benchmarks like SMAC.
- The reliance on self-play for benchmarking may hinder comparability with other environments.
- The paper does not provide a clear metric for evaluating progress, which could limit its utility for future research.
- The clarity of the paper is marred by minor writing mistakes, and the documentation lacks detail.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the complexity of the dynamics by incorporating features such as shooting, health, and diverse agent types to enhance the environment's utility. Additionally, establishing a benchmark metric beyond self-play is crucial; consider developing stronger hand-coded AIs or creating imbalanced scenarios to ensure the benchmark is both challenging and solvable. It is also advisable to focus less on achieving extremely high speeds and instead aim for a reasonable performance threshold, such as 10k steps/sec across parallel environments. Furthermore, we suggest providing video demonstrations of the environment and trained strategies to better convey its dynamics. Finally, enhancing the documentation and including comprehensive unit tests will improve the reliability and usability of the codebase.
