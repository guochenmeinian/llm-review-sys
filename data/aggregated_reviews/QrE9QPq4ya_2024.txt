### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for scene surface reconstruction using a neural implicit function that emphasizes physical plausibility. The authors propose the PhyRecon framework, which integrates physical constraints into model training, enhancing object interactions and stability. A differentiable transformation between the signed distance function (SDF) field and explicit surface points is introduced to identify interaction points. The framework employs a joint uncertainty modeling design for depth, normal, and physical constraints, which improves reconstruction stability. Experimental results on datasets like ScanNet and Replica demonstrate significant improvements over prior methods. Additionally, the authors address the challenges of recovering 3D geometry from image inputs while incorporating uncertainties into rendering losses to improve accuracy. They acknowledge the complexity of integrating "heuristic region growing" with rendering losses, noting that this comparison is outside the current paper's scope but may be included in future revisions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The framework is innovative, extending neural implicit representation to include physical constraints, making it applicable to real-world scenarios such as robotics and virtual reality.  
2. The introduction of physical constraints enhances object reconstruction fidelity within a compositional design, supported by components like SP-MC and physical-guided pixel sampling.  
3. Extensive experimental results show marked improvements in reconstruction quality and stability compared to previous baselines.  
4. The physical pixel-guided sampling is a noteworthy enhancement to the effectiveness of the physical constraint.  
5. The authors effectively address the challenges of 3D geometry reconstruction by incorporating uncertainties into rendering losses, showcasing a critical understanding of the field.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The reliance on ObjectSDF++ and RICO results in long training times, and the addition of constraints in PhyRecon further exacerbates this issue, indicating a need for improved efficiency.  
2. The multi-stage training process complicates the optimization, making the system intricate and potentially challenging to implement.  
3. The method is limited to static scenes with rigid objects, and the physical loss does not accommodate complex interactions or soft materials.  
4. The integration of "heuristic region growing" with rendering losses remains unexplored, which could limit the paper's comprehensiveness.  
5. The authors do not provide a detailed comparison with heuristic region growing, which may leave a gap in the analysis.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the efficiency of the training process to reduce the overall optimization time. Additionally, simplifying the multi-stage optimization could enhance usability. It would be beneficial to explore the method's robustness against noise in ground-truth instance labels, particularly regarding how the physical solution can manage label noise. We suggest providing more clarity on the performance of the particle simulator with sparse and non-uniformly distributed points. Furthermore, we recommend improving the discussion on "heuristic region growing" and its potential integration with rendering losses in the revision. Finally, providing a more detailed comparison with existing methods could enhance the paper's depth and relevance. Moving appendix C to the main text could also help clarify the role of the physical simulator in the overall framework.
