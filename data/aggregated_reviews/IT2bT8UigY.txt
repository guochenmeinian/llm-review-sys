### Key Points
This paper presents a study on automatic translation between European Portuguese (EP) and Portuguese Sign Language (LGP). The authors developed a fully automatic rule-based system that extracts syntactic and morphosyntactic rules from a parallel EP-LGP corpus to translate syntactically annotated EP into LGP sentences. They created a parallel EP-LGP corpus with 35k sentences to train two neural machine translation (NMT) systems, mBART and M2M, and evaluated these systems on a manually validated gold corpus of 200 sentences. The paper introduces a new dataset and addresses a significant challenge in translating between these languages.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Addresses an important and challenging problem of translating between EP and LGP.
- Introduces a new dataset and presents several new systems with their evaluations.
- Provides a substantial corpus and expert-annotated gold-standard test set, beneficial for future research.

Weaknesses:
- Insufficient detail on the workings of the fully automatic rule-based system, which is crucial for understanding the methodology.
- Evaluation methodology on the newly created gold set lacks reliability due to pre-annotation and absence of inter-annotator agreement.
- Metrics used may not adequately capture translation quality, particularly for sign language, and common errors are not thoroughly analyzed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of how the rules are automatically extracted, including details on the word alignment procedure and the construction of syntactic rules. Clarifying the general applicability of the rule extraction mechanism to other languages would enhance the paper's appeal. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed discussion of the evaluation metrics, including which type of BLEU is used, and incorporating additional metrics such as fluency and adequacy. Addressing the limitations of the rule-based system when using automatic parsing instead of gold parses would also strengthen the paper. Finally, we encourage the authors to improve the formatting of tables and figures for better readability and to ensure consistency in terminology and notation throughout the paper.
