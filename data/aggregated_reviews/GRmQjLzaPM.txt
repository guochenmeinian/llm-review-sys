Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents BehaviorGPT, a decoder-only model architecture for multi-agent simulation of dynamic traffic actors, addressing the critical need for improved simulation capabilities in the development of autonomous vehicles. The authors propose a next-patch prediction framework, where the model predicts the next set of states for each actor based on a history of trajectory patches. BehaviorGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Sim Agents Benchmark with only 3M parameters, significantly fewer than competing models. The architecture employs relative encodings and a "decoder-only" structure, allowing for parallel training of continuous subsets of patches. Additionally, the authors claim improved sample efficiency compared to existing techniques, demonstrating effective performance with reduced training data. They provide insights into inference latency, noting an average of 10ms across 65 agents with a variance of 3ms. The scaling experiments reveal that increasing model depth yields linear improvements in performance, although the impact of model size on runtime is limited due to GPU cache constraints. The authors also address the assumption of unimodal distributions within paths and clarify the context of "long-range" interactions in autonomous driving.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- BehaviorGPT achieves state-of-the-art results on a challenging benchmark with a notably small model size, demonstrating significant empirical strength.
- The paper effectively contextualizes its contributions within the existing literature on motion forecasting and simulation.
- The architectural choices, such as the use of an RNN in the prediction head, are well-motivated and enhance the model's performance.
- The paper effectively addresses reviewer concerns and provides detailed responses, enhancing the manuscript's clarity.
- The scaling experiments and data efficiency results are compelling, showcasing the method's advantages.
- The authors' commitment to improving the manuscript based on feedback is commendable.

Weaknesses:
- The manuscript lacks sufficient detail for reproducibility, particularly regarding map tokenization, the structure of the prediction head, and embedding sizes.
- Claims regarding sample efficiency and the novelty of the decoder-only model are overstated without adequate evidence.
- The claim of sample efficiency lacks direct comparative evidence against other methods, as many are not open-source.
- The discussion of limitations is currently superficial and does not adequately inform the reader about the method's efficacy.
- The presentation quality is inconsistent, with figures and captions needing improvement for clarity and explanatory value.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the reproducibility of their model by providing more detailed descriptions of map tokenization, the prediction head's architecture, and embedding sizes. Additionally, we suggest that the authors scope down claims about sample efficiency and the uniqueness of their architecture, focusing instead on the ability to parallelize training. To enhance the discussion on sample efficiency, we recommend providing more direct evidence or comparisons with other methods, potentially including additional data in the appendix. Clarifying the context of inference latency by specifying the number of agents involved and the statistical variance would also enhance understanding. Expanding the section on limitations to provide a more in-depth analysis of the paper's constraints and implications for future work is advisable. Finally, enhancing the clarity of figures and captions will benefit readers, and including more ablation studies to clarify which architectural elements contribute most significantly to the model's performance, as well as providing visual analyses of model outputs to illustrate strengths and weaknesses in specific scenarios, would be beneficial.
