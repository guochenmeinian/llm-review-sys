Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into how data-constrained recurrent neural network (RNN) models can misidentify the dynamical structure of neural population computations due to partial observation. The authors demonstrate that when only a subset of neurons is observed, the resulting student networks may exhibit dynamics that differ significantly from those of the teacher networks, particularly favoring line attractor dynamics over feedforward chain dynamics. The study highlights the intrinsic biases of data-constrained models and the implications of partial observability in both linear and non-linear systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivating question is original and significant, addressing a pertinent issue in computational neuroscience.
- The mathematical analysis is elegant, and the case studies are well-chosen and illustrative.
- The writing is clear and didactic, making the findings accessible to the computational neuroscience community.

Weaknesses:
- The writing lacks clarity in certain sections, leading to confusion about specific details and interpretations of findings.
- The settings considered are overly constrained, limiting the practical applicability of the results. The authors should explore scenarios with multiple plausible mechanistic explanations.
- There is a lack of discussion on existing biological datasets that could expose potential misinterpretations of circuit mechanisms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their writing, particularly in sections where interpretations of findings are presented. Additionally, we suggest that the authors systematically investigate the results in section 2 by varying the number of neurons in the teacher circuit and the latent dimensionality of the model. This could involve experiments where the number of observed neurons is a small fraction of the total, as well as scenarios where the full circuit is observed but with a low-dimensional model. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include a discussion on how to detect potential mismatches in the absence of known mechanisms, as this would enhance the relevance of the study. Lastly, referencing related work on interpretable data-constrained models would strengthen the manuscript's context.
