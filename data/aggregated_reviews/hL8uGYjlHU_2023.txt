Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the M^2 SODAI dataset, a novel RGB-hyperspectral multi-modal dataset for maritime object detection, comprising 1,257 synchronized image pairs and 11,892 instances across 23 object categories. The dataset aims to enhance detection capabilities by leveraging hyperspectral images to mitigate false alarms caused by sea surface effects in RGB images. The authors propose a new multi-modal extension of the feature pyramid network (FPN) called DoubleFPN, which demonstrates improved performance in object detection tasks. Additionally, the manuscript includes experimental results on inference time and discusses the limitations of costly data collection methods. The authors acknowledge the need for recent advancements in detection techniques and have attempted to incorporate newer detectors like VfNet and TOOD, although these performed worse than Faster R-CNN when trained from scratch. The authors also simulated additional fusion methods for comparison, noting that their proposed DoubleFPN outperforms existing early and late fusion methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
1. The dataset's dual modality (RGB and HSI) significantly aids in distinguishing objects from the sea surface, addressing a critical challenge in maritime detection.
2. The paper showcases a commendable level of detail in the dataset creation process, including data collection, annotation, and evaluation.
3. The proposed DoubleFPN architecture is theoretically substantiated and effectively tested against existing methods, demonstrating superior performance.
4. The documentation adheres to FAIR principles, enhancing reproducibility and usability for the research community.
5. The detailed experimental section includes inference time metrics and a clear discussion of the dataset's contributions to maritime surveillance.
6. The authors effectively respond to reviewer comments, enhancing clarity and depth, particularly regarding the justification for using HSI imagery and the dataset's relevance to broader research.

**Weaknesses:**
1. The contributions of the dataset and methods are not sufficiently emphasized, particularly regarding the novelty of data collection and preprocessing.
2. The benchmark methods used for evaluation are outdated, lacking recent advancements in object detection.
3. The experimental design does not adequately compare the proposed method against single modality baselines, making it difficult to isolate the benefits of the multi-modal approach.
4. The paper lacks explicit discussions on potential societal impacts, biases in data annotation, and privacy concerns related to maritime surveillance applications.
5. The contribution section lacks clarity regarding the paper's unique innovations, particularly in data collection.
6. There is insufficient detail on the labeling process and potential biases in data collection.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors enhance the significance of their contributions by providing additional details on the dataset's adoption and its utility in real-world challenges.
2. We suggest that the authors include recent state-of-the-art methods in their benchmark to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of their approach.
3. We recommend that the authors clarify the rationale for combining RGB and HSI data, particularly how the selected spectral range improves detection performance.
4. We encourage the authors to address potential biases in data collection and annotation, as well as discuss privacy concerns related to the dataset's applications in surveillance.
5. We advise that the authors provide a more detailed account of the labeling process, including the classes of objects labeled and the tools used for annotation.
6. We suggest that the authors include a discussion on inference speed and memory efficiency of the DoubleFPN compared to previous models, as this is critical for real-time applications.
7. We recommend that the authors clarify the image coregistration strategy and specify the spatial resolution of the imagery in the abstract or introduction.
8. We recommend that the authors improve the benchmark by incorporating a wider array of advanced methods and conducting more comprehensive experiments to enhance its utility for future research.
9. We suggest that the authors refine the contribution section to clearly articulate their unique innovations, avoiding unnecessary details about data collection efforts.
