Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a pre-training strategy named Bridge3D for 3D models, utilizing features, semantic masks, and captions from various foundation models, including vision and language models. The proposed method incorporates a masking strategy guided by segmentation labels, scene-level and object-level distillation, and masked point cloud reconstruction. The evaluation includes downstream tasks such as ScanNetV2 and S3DIS semantic segmentation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The integration of multiple foundation models for 3D point cloud modeling is innovative and promising.  
2. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear experimental results showing improvements over baselines.  
3. The ablation studies effectively demonstrate the contributions of different components to the overall performance.

Weaknesses:  
1. The novelty of the methods is questionable, as similar approaches have been previously explored without adequate comparisons to existing literature.  
2. The evaluation is limited, primarily focusing on S3DIS, which is a small dataset prone to overfitting, and lacks qualitative examples.  
3. The complexity of the proposed framework may hinder scalability and requires significant tuning, making it difficult to assess the effectiveness of individual components.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty discussion by providing more comparisons with existing methods, particularly those that utilize similar foundation models. Additionally, the authors should expand the evaluation to include larger datasets like ScanNet and provide qualitative examples to illustrate the effectiveness of their approach. It would also be beneficial to simplify the framework to enhance scalability and clarify the contributions of each component. Finally, the authors should ensure accurate reporting of results in tables and address any discrepancies in the performance metrics presented.
