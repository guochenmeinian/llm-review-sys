Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for generating 3D room layouts from 2D segmentation masks annotated for individual RGB frames, without requiring 3D data. The authors propose an algorithm that derives 3D plane equations for structural elements such as walls, ceilings, floors, doors, and windows, based on 2D instance and binary masks. The method is validated on the ScanNet benchmark and applied to generate 2,266 3D room layouts for the RealEstate10K dataset, which features arbitrary room geometry and realistic camera poses. This dataset surpasses existing datasets like Zillow and MatterportLayout in both quantity and quality and is publicly available on GitHub, accompanied by comprehensive documentation. The authors also address limitations and failure cases in the supplementary material, emphasizing the dataset's complexity and its potential to advance the field of room layout estimation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The contribution is significant, as it is the first approach to create a 3D room layout dataset solely from RGB videos.
- The method demonstrates high-quality annotation and validation through human assessment and comparison with ScanNet.
- The paper is well-written and presents a thoughtful and solid methodology.
- The method is well explained and scalable, supported by solid ablation studies.
- The dataset offers a significant quantity of annotated video frames and supports furnished rooms.
- The authors have released the dataset publicly, enhancing accessibility for further research.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation behind certain design choices is not sufficiently explained.
- The paper lacks a clear baseline for 3D layout estimation using the proposed dataset.
- There are unanswered questions regarding the minimal ratio of annotated frames needed for quality layouts and the handling of camera parameters.
- Some reviewers noted that the dataset size may not be large enough compared to others.
- There were concerns about the complexity of the dataset and potential limitations not being adequately discussed in the initial submission.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation section to clarify the advantages of their approach over existing datasets. Establishing a baseline for 3D layout estimation using their data is essential; thus, preparing a training/validation/test split and providing data loaders (e.g., in PyTorch) would be beneficial. Additionally, conducting a study to determine the minimal ratio of annotated frames required for quality layouts and exploring the impact of camera parameters on the algorithm's performance would enhance the paper's robustness. We also encourage the authors to improve the visibility of the novel aspects of their dataset compared to existing datasets in the paper. Furthermore, we recommend running more baseline methods on their data to establish a more solid initial baseline for the task. Finally, while the limitations section has been extended, further elaboration on specific challenges faced during annotation could enhance the comprehensiveness of the discussion.
