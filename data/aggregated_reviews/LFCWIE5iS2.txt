### Key Points
This paper presents a dataset of surface electromyography (sEMG) signals collected from 108 individuals typing in US English on a QWERTY keyboard. The dataset includes sEMG recordings, ground truth key logger sequences, and timestamps. The authors propose that the dataset is suitable for benchmarking machine learning models aimed at predicting keystrokes from sEMG signals. The manuscript discusses the dataset's size and application of machine learning models, but the utility and specific applications of the dataset remain unclear.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is large, comprising recordings from 108 participants, which is beneficial for training and validation.
- Data are minimally processed and provided in HDF5 format, enhancing reusability.
- The paper is well written, with sufficient clarity for a general audience.

Weaknesses:
- The manuscript lacks detailed information on the experimental design and data collection, limiting the dataset's utility due to potential biases.
- The rationale for using sEMG signals for typing on a physical keyboard is unclear, raising questions about the dataset's relevance to brain-computer interfaces.
- Ethical concerns arise from the employer-employee relationship in participant compensation, which could create conflicts of interest.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the dataset's intended applications, particularly regarding its relevance to brain-computer interfaces. Additionally, the authors should expand on the experimental design and data collection processes to address potential biases and enhance reproducibility. We suggest including a visual representation of the sEMG electrode systems in Figure 1 and providing more comprehensive statistical analyses of the results. Furthermore, we advise the authors to clarify the ethical implications of participant compensation and consider sharing the dataset in BIDS format for accessibility.
