Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on online classification with stochastic label noise, where the learner aims to predict a hypothesis \( h^* \) based on noisy labels generated from an adversarially chosen feature set. The authors propose a new framework, Noisy Kernel, which generalizes previous models of bounded noise. Key contributions include establishing minimax risk bounds characterized by the Hellinger gap of the noisy kernel, introducing a reduction to pairwise hypothesis testing, and deriving upper and lower bounds on the minimax risk. The paper also discusses a learner with a mistake bound dependent on the Hellinger gap and presents results for binary classification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The theoretical analysis is rigorous, providing clear bounds and demonstrating their tightness through detailed proofs.
- The paper is well-structured, with logical sequencing of definitions, theorems, and proofs.
- The introduction of a novel framework for modeling label noise is a significant advancement in the field.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks discussion on practical implementations and real-world applications of the proposed methods.
- Some assumptions regarding the noise model and hypothesis class may be overly restrictive, necessitating a deeper examination of their impact on the generality of results.
- There is a lack of experimental validation to support the theoretical findings, which would enhance credibility and applicability.
- Clarification is needed regarding the adversarial choice of noisy labels and the implications of the noise model's generality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on practical implementations and real-world applications of their theoretical framework, providing specific examples and addressing potential challenges. Additionally, a more detailed examination of the assumptions regarding the noise model and hypothesis class would strengthen the paper's generality. Including empirical evidence, even from simulations, would significantly enhance the paper's impact. Furthermore, clarifying the adversarial selection process of noisy labels and its implications would provide a clearer understanding of the problem setup. Lastly, addressing the limitations more thoroughly in the discussion section would offer a balanced view of the work's applicability.
