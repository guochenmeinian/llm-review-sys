Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents D-AdaST, a distributed adaptive minimax method aimed at resolving non-convergence issues in nonconvex-strongly-concave (NC-SC) minimax problems due to inconsistent locally computed adaptive stepsizes. The method features a stepsize tracking mechanism that ensures consistency across local stepsizes and maintains time-scale separation, achieving near-optimal convergence rates similar to centralized methods. The authors provide a theoretical analysis and extensive experimental validation across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant challenge in distributed minimax optimization, achieving near-optimal convergence rates.
- The theoretical contributions are robust, and the experimental validation is comprehensive, demonstrating the method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental section lacks diversity, only including a GAN experiment on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- The definition of optimality in the context of the convergence rate is unclear, particularly regarding the assumptions made.
- The analysis does not adequately address communication delays and asynchrony in distributed settings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including results from additional datasets or other minimax optimization problems to provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Additionally, clarify the definition of optimality and how it relates to the assumptions, particularly regarding second-order Lipschitz continuity. Address the impact of communication delays and asynchrony in the theoretical analysis, and consider increasing the batch size of stochastic gradients to reduce total communication rounds.
