### Key Points
This paper presents a fine-grained stressor estimation task utilizing social media data, constructs a new dataset, and introduces a novel meta-learning framework enhanced by a meta-knowledge inheritance mechanism to address catastrophic forgetting. The authors aim to improve stressor detection through a practical few-shot learning approach, demonstrating promising results against state-of-the-art baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper proposes a novel social media-based stressor estimation task.
- The dataset construction follows a rigorous validation process with multi-round annotation.
- The meta-knowledge inheritance mechanism effectively addresses catastrophic forgetting.
- Comprehensive experimental settings yield promising results.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental analysis lacks comprehensiveness, particularly in justifying the half-year time period.
- Some experimental details, such as the training process in Section 5.6, require clarification regarding whether it follows meta-learning or supervised learning.
- The paper lacks statistical analysis of stressor distribution in the dataset, which may not fully support the challenge of having many classes with few examples.
- The dataset is limited to the Weibo platform, raising concerns about platform bias.
- The model's advantage in traditional supervised scenarios appears limited, with only a 1.5% improvement in F1-score requiring further investigation.
- The introduction and related work sections need streamlining, and the discussion of limitations is inadequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comprehensiveness of the experimental analysis by providing justification for the chosen time period. Additionally, clarify the training process in Section 5.6 to specify whether it employs meta-learning or supervised learning. It is crucial to include a statistical analysis of stressor distribution in the dataset to support the claims made. The authors should also discuss the implications of platform bias due to the dataset being limited to Weibo. Further investigation into the model's performance in traditional supervised scenarios is necessary. Lastly, we suggest including a section on future research directions and addressing the integration of emotional states in stress detection to enhance the model's applicability in real-world scenarios.
