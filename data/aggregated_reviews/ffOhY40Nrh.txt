Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the neural mechanisms underlying mental simulation by comparing various deep learning models' abilities to predict future states in ethologically relevant tasks. The authors evaluate models against human behavior in an object contact prediction task and neurophysiological data from macaques in a mental-pong task. They find that dynamics modules predicting future states in the latent space of video foundation models align well with both human and macaque responses. Additionally, the authors analyze dynamically-equipped video foundation models and their performance in predicting human behavior and neural responses across various tasks. They propose that while object-centric models can be beneficial, they must maintain reusability to generalize effectively to novel dynamic scenes. The paper emphasizes the importance of dense neurophysiological data and high-throughput behavioral readouts, highlighting the need for clarity in these definitions. The authors also discuss the varying performance of models across different scenarios, particularly noting the challenges in soft to rigid interactions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The study addresses a significant issue in neuroscience and AI regarding the neural basis of mental simulation.  
- The approach of constructing multiple artificial networks and evaluating them on predictive tasks is robust and insightful.  
- The clarity of presentation enhances the understanding of complex concepts.  
- The authors provide a thorough analysis of model performance, particularly in relation to human consistency scores.  
- The paper effectively identifies future directions for improving model performance, such as developing self-supervised loss functions to enhance material property learning.  
- The authors acknowledge and plan to incorporate relevant literature on object-centric representations, enhancing the paper's depth.  

Weaknesses:  
- Additional details on the best-fitting model layers would be beneficial, particularly a comparative analysis of latent layers across models.  
- The paper lacks a clear motivation for the chosen tasks and does not sufficiently explore the implications of the findings.  
- There is a concern regarding the models' performance being far from human accuracy and consistency, suggesting potential fundamental design issues rather than systematic differences.  
- There is some confusion regarding the definitions of "dense" neurophysiological data and "high-throughput" behavioral readouts, which need clarification.  
- The model comparisons may lack sufficient context, particularly regarding the performance of video models versus image models.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the abstract and introduction by specifying the data considered in their modeling work and articulating their hypotheses more directly. Additionally, we suggest including a detailed analysis of the best-fitting latent representations across models and exploring the reasons behind the performance discrepancies observed in different tasks. It would also be beneficial to provide more information on the training procedures and computational resources used, as well as a deeper discussion on the implications of the observed gaps between model and human performance. We recommend improving clarity in the definitions of "dense" and "high-throughput" in the revised Introduction. Furthermore, please specify which parts of the data were held-out to clarify generalization testing. It would also be beneficial to emphasize that the models which perform best can track the ball during occlusion effectively. Lastly, we suggest highlighting the comparison to previous breakthroughs in the inferotemporal cortex to strengthen the paper's argument.
