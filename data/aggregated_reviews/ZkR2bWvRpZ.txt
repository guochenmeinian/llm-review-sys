### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to dialogue policy planning using Open-Loop MCTS without requiring model training. The authors propose the GDP-ZERO model, which is evaluated on the PersuasionForGood dataset and shows superior performance compared to ChatGPT in both static and interactive evaluations. The appendix provides extensive details supporting reproducibility.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The idea of using Open-Loop MCTS for dialogue policy planning is innovative and practical.  
- Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GDP-ZERO outperforms ChatGPT.  
- The appendix contains sufficient details for reproducibility.

Weaknesses:  
- Experiments are conducted on a single dataset, limiting generalizability.  
- There is a lack of comparison with other baseline models and relevant methods, which diminishes the robustness of the findings.  
- Some explanations in the paper are difficult to parse, and certain notations are unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including comparisons with traditional non-LLM state-of-the-art methods and additional datasets to enhance the validity of their claims. Clarifying the rationale behind using Open-Loop MCTS over closed-loop methods would strengthen the paper. Additionally, addressing the unclear notations and ensuring that all results, particularly those in Table 3, are statistically significant would enhance clarity and rigor.
