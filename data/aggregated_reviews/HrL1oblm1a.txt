Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel blind omnidirectional image quality assessment framework called Assessor360, which models the observer's browsing process. The authors propose a recursive probability sampling (RPS) method to generate viewpoint sequences based on content and detail guidance. Additionally, a multi-scale feature aggregation (MFA) module is utilized to fuse features from the Swin Transformer, enhanced by distortion-aware blocks (DAB). The framework demonstrates promising performance across multiple datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach to simulate the observer's browsing behavior is innovative and relevant, addressing a significant gap in existing methods.
- The combination of MFA and DAB is theoretically sound and practically effective.
- Extensive experiments validate the proposed method's performance on various datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The TMM module could benefit from exploring alternative design choices, such as LSTM or Transformer decoders.
- Claims regarding the sensitivity of the first two stages to distortion patterns lack verification.
- The recursive probability sampling method appears somewhat ad hoc and lacks optimization for mimicking the browsing process.
- Missing details regarding the input sequence processing by the Swin Transformer and the selection of starting points for sequences weaken the manuscript's clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how the Swin Transformer processes multiple images in a sequence. Additionally, the authors should provide more details on the selection process for starting points in the recursive probability sampling and consider using weighted averages for fusing predicted scores. It would also be beneficial to include comparisons with the latest language-guided IQA models, such as CLIPIQA and LIQE, and to explore other time series modeling modules in TMM. Lastly, we suggest addressing the missing validation set for hyperparameter tuning and ensuring that cross-dataset results are included to support the model's rationality.
