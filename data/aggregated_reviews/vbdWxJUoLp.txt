### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to traffic flow forecasting through the Spatial-Temporal Delay Differential Equation model (STDDE), which addresses critical challenges such as the immediate nature of message passing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and the need for retraining models for different prediction frequencies. The authors propose an innovative model that incorporates temporal delay and a continuous output module, enhancing flexibility and adaptability. The theoretical proofs and extensive experiments validate the model's superiority in accuracy and computational efficiency, marking a significant advancement in the field.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a unique focus on variable time delays in traffic forecasting, improving prediction accuracy in complex scenarios.
- Comprehensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate the model's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, confirming the effectiveness of the delay-aware and continuous output modules.
- Clear explanations of the motivations behind technical designs enhance understanding of the proposed solutions.

Weaknesses:
- The source code is currently unavailable, limiting reproducibility.
- The evaluation does not adequately verify the handling of peak and non-peak hours.
- Time and space complexity are briefly mentioned but lack detailed discussion in the evaluation or theoretical framework.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the availability of the source code to enhance reproducibility. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more thorough evaluation of the model's performance during peak and non-peak hours. A detailed discussion of time and space complexity in both the evaluation and theoretical sections would also strengthen the paper. Furthermore, considering the application of the model to other domains, such as flight delay prediction, could broaden its scope and audience.
