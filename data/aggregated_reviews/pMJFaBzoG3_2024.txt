Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new method for relaxing permutation matrices onto the group of orthogonal matrices using a temperature-controlled differentiable transform. This approach facilitates continuous optimization for challenging problems, including permutation synchronization. The authors propose a parameterization of \( n \times n \) permutation matrices by \( n(n-1)/2 \) unconstrained numbers, which simplifies neural network training. Experimental results indicate advantages over existing methods, particularly in terms of efficiency and scalability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a clear presentation of the main ideas and contributions.
- The proposed method demonstrates flexibility and scalability in numerical experiments, showing consistent advantages in optimization tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The rationale behind certain design choices, such as the temperature parameter \( \tau \) and the use of orthogonal groups, is insufficiently motivated.
- The experiments primarily utilize synthetic data, raising questions about the practical applicability of the method.
- The running time and scalability claims are questionable, particularly regarding the efficiency of eigenvalue decomposition and the linear assignment problem.
- The paper lacks comparisons with relevant prior work, particularly regarding permutation synchronization and the proposed simple regularization baseline.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the role of the temperature parameter \( \tau \) and justify its necessity in the context of odd permutations. Additionally, we suggest including results for the "Known 0%" case in Table 2 to better illustrate the importance of prior information. The authors should clarify the running time of their method and provide comparisons with prior works to substantiate scalability claims. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to expand their experimental evaluations beyond synthetic datasets, particularly in challenging multi-object matching scenarios. Lastly, addressing the confusion surrounding the definitions and optimization variables in theorems and equations would enhance the paper's clarity.
