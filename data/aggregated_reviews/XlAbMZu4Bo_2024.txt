Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Megalodon, an enhancement of the Mega architecture, which incorporates complex exponential moving average (CEMA), improved normalization techniques, and a pre-norm with two-hop residuals. The authors claim that Megalodon efficiently handles unlimited context lengths and outperforms Transformers across various tasks and benchmarks, particularly in long-document comprehension and multi-turn conversations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The technique is validated against modern models across a wide range of benchmarks.
- The diagonalizable complex moving average is a promising approach for efficient computation.
- The performance of the proposed architecture is strong, as shown in extensive experiments.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation lacks comprehensive comparisons against the original Mega model, which is crucial for establishing technical novelty.
- There are no ablation studies for moderate-scale language modeling, limiting insights into the impact of design choices.
- The claim of unlimited context length is overstated; effective context length needs clarification, especially in relation to long-context tasks.
- Comparisons against models with shorter context lengths are insufficient, and the training sequence lengths in evaluations may lead to unfair perplexity comparisons.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including more comparisons against Mega and Mega chunk to clarify the technical advancements. Conducting ablation studies on moderate-scale models would provide valuable insights into the impact of the proposed changes. Additionally, we suggest revising the claim of "unlimited context length" to reflect a more accurate assessment of the model's capabilities. Including discussions on how Megalodon performs on tasks like Phonebook lookup and complex reasoning problems would enhance the paper's depth. Lastly, addressing the limitations more directly in the paper is essential for transparency.
