### Key Points
This paper presents a method for conditioning nonlinear diffusion processes in infinite dimensions using an infinite version of Doob’s $h$-transform. The authors propose a framework that incorporates Itô’s lemma and Girsanov’s theorem, allowing for the conditioning of processes without prior discretization. They detail two models for conditioning: exact matching and inexact matching, and illustrate their approach through modeling changes in the morphometry of organisms, specifically butterflies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The theoretical contribution of conditioning infinite-dimensional non-linear processes is significant, expanding on previous work limited to finite dimensions.
- The introduction of the infinite version of Doob’s $h$-transform is of independent interest and facilitates conditioning without prior discretization.
- The application to evolutionary biology provides a relevant and practical illustration of the method.

Weaknesses:
- The paper contains stylistic oddities that hinder readability, particularly in the initial sections where technical assertions lack necessary references to equations.
- Assumption 3.3 regarding the regularity of the transition function is strong and may limit the applicability of the method.
- The empirical evaluation is narrowly focused on butterfly morphometry, raising questions about the method's generalizability to other diffusion processes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the initial sections by ensuring that all technical assertions are cross-referenced with the relevant equations. Additionally, consider providing an example that illustrates Assumption 3.3 with conditions on the solution process itself rather than solely on the set $\Gamma$. A theoretical analysis quantifying the error between the conditioning and the true solution would enhance the relevance of the approach. Finally, harmonizing the notation throughout the paper and including a summary table of notations would facilitate easier reading and comprehension.
