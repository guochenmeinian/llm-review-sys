Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel grid point selection scheme and stopping criterion for general path-following algorithms, specifically addressing the 2-regularized M-estimation problem. The authors propose an algorithm that optimizes the trade-off between model fit and complexity, providing theoretical results that include an upper bound on approximation error. The paper also includes a comparison of the proposed scheme to standard path-following methods through simulations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper proposes a new path-following algorithm with an approximation guarantee, contributing to the field of M-estimation.
- It provides rigorous statistical analysis and theoretical results that are generally sound.
- The writing is clear, and mathematical derivations are easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation of the paper is poor, with unclear contributions and inadequate organization.
- Experimental results are placed in the Appendix, which raises questions about their visibility and relevance.
- The numerical simulations lack depth and do not include evaluations on real-world datasets.
- The paper does not sufficiently discuss existing literature on solution path algorithms, which could enhance its novelty and context.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions in the Introduction and enhance readability by discussing the definition of "regularized M-minimization problems" early on. The authors should consider moving experimental results from the Appendix to the main text to utilize available space effectively. Additionally, including evaluations on public datasets and comparing against other baselines would strengthen the experimental section. We suggest adding a "Related Work" section to contextualize the study within existing literature and discussing the proof strategy and assumptions in more detail to clarify the theoretical claims. Finally, the authors should ensure that the appendix format complies with NeurIPS guidelines.
