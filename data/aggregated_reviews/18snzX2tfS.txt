### Key Points
This paper presents a rigorous integration of Gaussian Processes (GPs) and Equivalent Circuit Models (ECMs) to model long-term battery health and determine fault detection probabilities. The authors propose a methodology that effectively utilizes a dataset of 131 million data rows from 232 cells, ensuring robust predictions grounded in real-world data. The study acknowledges challenges related to temperature variations affecting results and provides a comprehensive mathematical framework, particularly in the derivation of fault probabilities based on resistance estimation. The originality of the work lies in its hybrid approach, separating time-dependent and operational-point-dependent resistance components, and its application to field data, which enhances its significance for battery health monitoring systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Innovative Methodology: The combination of GPs with ECMs offers detailed fault analysis.
- Scalability: The recursive spatiotemporal GP effectively processes large-scale data.
- Real-World Data: Utilization of extensive field data increases practical relevance.
- Transparency: Open-source dataset and code enhance reproducibility.
- Comprehensive Fault Detection: Focus on resistance components ensures thorough health monitoring.

Weaknesses:
- Temperature Sensitivity: The model's performance is impacted by seasonal temperature variations.
- Technical Complexity: The mathematical intricacies of the recursive GP and Kalman filter may pose implementation challenges for practitioners.
- Limited Focus on Forecasting: The exploration of predicting future failures based on early-stage resistance anomalies is insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the probability of pack resistance fault defined in equation 20 by addressing the implicit independence assumption between cells, potentially leveraging the joint probability information available from the GP. Additionally, we suggest that the authors emphasize the Bayesian aspects of their methodology more prominently throughout the paper, as the term "Bayesian" currently appears only in the appendix. A reinterpretation of the model in a Bayesian context could enhance its appeal for relevant workshops and audiences.
