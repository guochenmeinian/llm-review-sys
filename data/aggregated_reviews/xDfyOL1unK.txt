### Key Points
This paper presents NovaCOMET, an innovative open commonsense foundation model that integrates knowledge models and general task models. The authors develop NovATOMIC, an open commonsense knowledge base, by extracting knowledge from large language models (LLMs) and implementing quality controls. NovaCOMET is trained using a masked commonsense modeling objective, demonstrating superior performance in commonsense question-answering and generation tasks. The paper's key contributions are the creation of NovATOMIC and NovaCOMET, alongside a novel prompting pipeline that includes the context, query, and inference (CQI) paradigm and commonsense field masking technique.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces valuable resources, NovATOMIC and NovaCOMET, which are expected to benefit future research.
- The empirical results confirm NovaCOMET's high performance, validating the quality of NovATOMIC.
- The innovative prompting pipeline design enhances the robustness of the generative model.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks novelty, as it appears to replicate existing methodologies with minor adaptations.
- The open relation set in NovATOMIC complicates its application due to the absence of systematic relations.
- The evaluation lacks comparisons with advanced models like GPT-3.5, ChatGPT, and GPT-4, and some results in Table 3 are incomplete.
- The structure and clarity of the paper could be improved, particularly by separating sections for NovATOMIC and NovaCOMET.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their contributions by providing a more thorough analysis of the open-format prompting and its implications. It would be beneficial to include comparisons with GPT-3.5, ChatGPT, and GPT-4 to enhance the paper's impact. Additionally, we suggest filling in the missing results in Table 3 and restructuring the paper for clarity, such as separating the sections for NovATOMIC and NovaCOMET and refining section titles. Finally, a discussion on the limitations of the context, query, inference format in representing commonsense knowledge should be included.
