Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to dynamic non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging using a Mamba-based architecture that processes three transient frames through ST-Mamba and Cross ST-Mamba modules to produce a high-resolution transient frame. The authors evaluate their method on a custom synthetic dataset and a self-captured dynamic transient dataset, demonstrating improved performance over existing methods. The paper introduces the first Mamba-based method for dynamic NLOS imaging, integrating deep learning to enhance reconstruction capabilities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method effectively leverages adjacent frame information to enhance single-frame reconstruction, crucial for recovering lost signals in dynamic scenes.
2. The introduction of deep learning into dynamic NLOS imaging is innovative, advancing the field towards real-time applications.
3. The custom real-world dataset will serve as a valuable resource for future research.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation for using Mamba is inadequately explained, and the method's naming as "Dynamic NLOS" may be misleading since it does not automatically reconstruct scenes in time.
2. The proposed ST-Mamba and Cross ST-Mamba modules lack innovation, primarily stacking existing components without sufficient justification.
3. Sections 4.2 and 4.3 lack detailed formulas and formal descriptions, with overly colloquial language that detracts from clarity.
4. The absence of ablation experiments limits validation of the effectiveness of Spatial-Temporal Mamba and Cross ST-Mamba, as the paper does not adequately test these modules against alternative feature extraction or fusion methods.
5. The paper does not provide sufficient detail on the settings for ablation experiments, particularly regarding the cascade structure of Temporal SSM and Spatial SSM.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the motivation for using Mamba and clarify the distinction between their method and existing dynamic NLOS approaches. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more detailed discussion of how their dataset differs from other dynamic NLOS datasets and include relevant citations. To enhance clarity, we advise incorporating a preliminary section that recaps Mamba and its relevance to the paper's contributions. Furthermore, we recommend conducting ablation experiments to validate the effectiveness of Spatial-Temporal Mamba and Cross ST-Mamba by replacing them with other existing modules. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the rationale for using SSMs in their framework and provide quantitative results for the real dataset to better assess output quality.
