Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper explores the generalization problem in image deraining, revealing that deep networks often overfit to degradation patterns in training data, leading to poor performance on unseen patterns. The authors propose that training with fewer background images can enhance deraining effectiveness, albeit at the expense of background reconstruction quality. They introduce two new quantitative metrics to evaluate rain removal and background restoration separately. Additionally, the paper contributes to the field of interpretable-based image deraining, opening new perspectives for the community and providing insights into low-level vision interpretability research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-organized and clearly written.
2. It presents interesting findings regarding the relationship between training data complexity and deraining performance, contributing valuable insights to the community.
3. Extensive experiments validate the authors' assumptions, making the work accessible for new researchers in deraining tasks.
4. The paper is recognized for opening new perspectives in the community and is considered a pioneering work in interpretable-based image deraining.

Weaknesses:
1. The choice of CNN-based methods (RCDNet and SPDNet) raises questions about the applicability of findings to Transformer-based methods, which may behave differently.
2. The authors' definition of relative complexity between background and rain is unclear and requires further elaboration.
3. The paper does not adequately address the implications of sacrificing background quality for improved rain removal, which contradicts common practices in image restoration.
4. Proposed metrics do not effectively isolate the evaluation of rain removal and background reconstruction, leading to potential misinterpretations of model performance.
5. The selected models are not state-of-the-art, limiting the generalizability of the findings.
6. There is a concern regarding the overall contribution of the paper, as noted by one reviewer.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their definition regarding the relative complexity between background and rain. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include experimental analysis of Transformer-based deraining methods to compare generalization performance. The authors should also reconsider the implications of their findings on background quality and explore the use of more advanced models in their experiments. Finally, we suggest refining the proposed metrics to better isolate the evaluation of rain removal and background reconstruction, ensuring they accurately reflect model performance in deraining tasks. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors clarify the paper's contributions to address the concerns raised regarding its overall impact.
