Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Bayesian Optimization algorithm designed for scenarios where a subset of variables can be queried at each iteration, with each subset incurring different costs. The authors propose a method based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) acquisition function, structured in four stages to maximize expected value while considering costs. The theoretical analysis demonstrates the algorithm's no-regret property under specific conditions, and empirical results indicate competitive performance against baseline methods across various benchmarks, although the algorithm's effectiveness diminishes with fixed cost-group sizes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an original problem in Bayesian Optimization, providing a thorough theoretical analysis and empirical evidence of the algorithm's effectiveness.
- The algorithm is sound, integrating established Bayesian Optimization concepts, and the theoretical results are well-explained.
- The writing is generally clear, with important equations and results presented effectively.

Weaknesses:
- The relevance of the problem setting to the Bayesian Optimization community is unclear, as the empirical evaluation relies on simulated data rather than real-world applications.
- The assumption of known and independent input distributions is restrictive, limiting the algorithm's applicability.
- The heuristic for selecting subsets appears sub-optimal, particularly when expensive subsets yield poor observations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical evaluation by including comparisons against Causal Bayesian Optimization methods and discussing how their settings differ. Additionally, consider addressing the limitations of assuming known distributions and explore potential extensions for scenarios where distributions are estimated from data. Clarifying the link between theoretical results and the heuristic selection process would enhance the paper's coherence. Lastly, revising the first paragraphs of Section 4 for clarity and improving the readability of figures, particularly Figure 2, would strengthen the presentation.
