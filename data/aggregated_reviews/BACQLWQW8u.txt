Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive study on multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) through a causal generation process that identifies four types of latent variables: domain-specific and label-irrelevant, domain-specific and label-relevant, domain-invariant and label-irrelevant, and domain-invariant and label-relevant. The authors propose a Subspace Identification Guarantee (SIG) model based on variational inference, which relaxes stringent assumptions of previous methods. Theoretical guarantees for subspace identification are provided, and empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method across multiple benchmark datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a solid theoretical foundation for the identifiability issue in multi-source domain adaptation, addressing a fundamental problem.
- The proposed framework introduces a novel data generation process that expands on previous models, providing convincing theoretical analysis and satisfactory experimental results.
- Extensive experiments validate the practical utility of the proposed method, showcasing its performance on various datasets.

Weaknesses:
- Several theoretical points, particularly in Theorem 1, require clearer explanations, especially regarding conditional independence and linear independence assumptions.
- The experimental details, particularly concerning toy data generation and potential spurious correlations, need further clarification.
- The framework's similarity to earlier works on domain generalization should be acknowledged, and differences should be explicitly discussed.
- The assumption that source and target domains contain the same labels may need reevaluation, particularly in the context of open-set or partial MSDA scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of theoretical explanations, particularly in Theorem 1, by providing better intuitions for the assumptions made. Additionally, the authors should clarify the experimental details regarding toy data generation and address potential spurious correlations. It would be beneficial to discuss the similarities with earlier works on domain generalization and explicitly outline the differences. Furthermore, we suggest exploring the implications of the framework in open-set or partial MSDA scenarios, potentially including results from datasets with fewer target classes than source classes.
