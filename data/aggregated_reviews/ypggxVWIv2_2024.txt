Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper proposes a benchmark, GTBench, for evaluating the strategic reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through ten different games. The authors conduct experiments comparing LLMs with traditional methods and among LLMs themselves, analyzing experimental results and game-theoretic properties. The evaluation includes various open-source and closed-source models, employing metrics like ELOs and Relative advantage.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is logically clear, well-written, and provides a meaningful evaluation of LLMs' strategic reasoning abilities.
2. The experiments are comprehensive, including multiple models and prompting methods, and they evaluate game-theoretic properties such as Nash equilibrium and Pareto efficiency.
3. The framework and taxonomy are clear, and the paper offers valuable insights into LLM performance across different game tasks.

Weaknesses:
1. The evaluation protocol raises questions about whether it genuinely assesses strategic reasoning or merely decision-making, particularly since it focuses on competitive zero-sum games.
2. The selected games may not adequately challenge LLMs' strategic reasoning capabilities, as some, like Tic-Tac-Toe, have known optimal strategies.
3. The benchmark's generalizability to other strategic scenarios is unclear, and there is a lack of evaluation against human opponents, which could provide deeper insights.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the distinction between strategic reasoning and decision-making, particularly in the context of competitive versus cooperative games. Expanding the range of games to include general-sum and multi-player scenarios would enhance the evaluation's robustness. Additionally, incorporating evaluations against human opponents and discussing the implications of biases in LLMs' strategic decision-making would strengthen the paper. Finally, addressing the limitations of the current benchmark and exploring more complex game scenarios would provide a more comprehensive assessment of LLM capabilities.
