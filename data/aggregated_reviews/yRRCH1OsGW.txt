Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents MDGen, a generative model designed to sample molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories conditioned on key frames. The authors propose a flow-based generative framework that applies video generation techniques to molecular modeling, demonstrating its effectiveness on tetrapeptides through various downstream tasks, including forward simulation, interpolation, upsampling, and dynamics-conditioned inpainting. The model's performance is primarily evaluated on tetrapeptide systems, showcasing its potential but also indicating challenges in generalizing to larger proteins.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The work is pioneering in applying video generation techniques to MD trajectory generation, addressing a significant problem in computational biology.
2. The authors demonstrate a versatile modeling framework capable of performing multiple tasks using the same architecture.
3. Comprehensive evaluation on tetrapeptides provides valuable insights into modeling these systems.

Weaknesses:
1. The experimental baselines primarily consist of Markov State Models, lacking comparisons with other state-of-the-art models, which limits the validation of MDGen's effectiveness.
2. The results are proof-of-concept and may not adequately demonstrate transferability to larger protein systems.
3. The reliance on key frames restricts the model's ability to perform unconditional generation, which could limit its applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison of MDGen with other models, such as Timewarp and ITO, to strengthen the experimental validation. Additionally, we suggest conducting ablation studies to analyze the influence of different components within MDGen, particularly regarding the flow matching framework and the Hyena architecture. It would also be beneficial to include a dedicated Related Works section to discuss relevant literature comprehensively. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore alternative tokenization strategies and additional conditioning types to enhance the model's applicability to a broader range of molecular systems.
