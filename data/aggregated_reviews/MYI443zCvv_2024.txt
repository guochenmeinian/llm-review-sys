Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DEPrune, a pruning method targeting depth-wise separable convolutions (DSConv) that achieves structured sparsity conducive to depth-wise refactorization. The authors propose a pruning strategy based on the Diagonal-wise Refactorization (DR) computation strategy, which allows for efficient point pruning in depth-wise convolution layers. To enhance GPU performance, the authors introduce two techniques, BWT and HSR, which improve load balancing and memory access alignment. Experimental results demonstrate significant speedup in models like MobileNet and EfficientNet.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The pruning method effectively utilizes the DR computation strategy, enabling efficient masking of depth-wise convolution columns.
2. The BWT and HSR techniques significantly enhance GPU processing by achieving load balance and aligning computations with tile sizes.
3. Comprehensive evaluation results break down the contributions of the pruning method, BWT, and HSR, showcasing their individual impacts.

Weaknesses:
1. The overhead associated with the pruning method is not analyzed, leaving questions about the time required for deciding pruning points and loading balance.
2. The accuracy drop relative to the pruning ratio is concerning; modifications to the algorithm to set HSR constraints during the pruning phase could be explored to mitigate this.
3. The evaluation is limited to specific models (MobileNet-V2, MobileNet-V3, and EfficientNet-B0), raising questions about the method's applicability to other neural network architectures.
4. Some references are incomplete, and the clarity of figures, particularly Figure 1, is questioned.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the pruning method's overhead, detailing the time required for pruning point decisions and loading balance. Additionally, we suggest exploring modifications to the algorithm to set HSR constraints during the pruning phase to potentially enhance accuracy without recalibration. It would be beneficial to evaluate DEPrune on a broader range of neural network models beyond those currently tested. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide complete references and clarify the visual representations in figures, particularly addressing the concerns regarding Figure 1.
