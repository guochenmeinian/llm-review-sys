Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into binary classification using a non-Gaussian mixture model, focusing on the asymptotic behavior of Generalized Linear Models (GLM) as both the number of training samples and the dimensionality of the feature space approach infinity. The authors analyze empirical risk minimization in high-dimensional settings, employing the replica method to derive self-consistent equations for training loss and generalization error. The theoretical results are validated through experiments with synthetic data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is clearly written, with mathematical derivations that are easy to follow.
- The theoretical analysis of generalized linear models in high-dimensional data is a novel and significant contribution.
- The empirical evaluations appear to support the theoretical findings.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks experiments on real data, limiting the demonstration of the model's practical applicability compared to simpler Gaussian mixtures.
- The presentation of results is chaotic and difficult to follow, with vague explanations and a lack of formal structure (e.g., no theorems or lemmas).
- The motivation for using non-Gaussian distributions is insufficiently justified, and the limitations of the proposed heavy-tailed distribution generation process are not discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by formally structuring results as Theorems and Lemmas, particularly addressing the vague sections from L.130 to L.158. Additionally, we suggest including empirical evaluations on real datasets to showcase the practical relevance of the non-Gaussian model. The authors should also discuss alternative modeling approaches, such as normalizing flows, to enhance the robustness of their findings. Finally, providing more intuition behind the results, especially regarding the role of non-Gaussian elements in the self-consistent equations, would benefit reader comprehension.
