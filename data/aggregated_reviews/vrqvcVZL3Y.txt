### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework, COMI, for taxonomy completion that leverages large language models (LLMs) to integrate semantic and structural information. The authors conduct comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach compared to existing methods. The methodology is explained clearly, and the paper introduces innovative techniques such as semantic compression and mixup data augmentation, which enhance model understanding and efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper provides a significant advancement in taxonomy completion, crucial for knowledge organization and information retrieval.
2. The innovative use of semantic compression and mixup data augmentation sets a high benchmark for future research.
3. The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly improving inference speed.

Weaknesses:
1. The complexity of the model and vague descriptions may hinder reproducibility.
2. The reliance on LLMs raises concerns regarding computational resource demands and potential biases.
3. The paper lacks a deeper discussion on limitations and generalizability across different applications and datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the reproducibility of their work by providing more detailed descriptions of the methodology, particularly how compressed concepts are utilized in prompts. Additionally, a clearer organization of sections, especially regarding ablation studies and discussions, would enhance readability. The authors should also address the limitations of their approach and consider including qualitative examples to demonstrate performance. Finally, providing access to the code and compressed tokens prior to publication would facilitate review and implementation.
