Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DisenGCD, a cognitive diagnosis model that enhances robustness and accuracy by utilizing a meta multigraph-assisted disentangled graph learning framework. The authors propose a disentangled graph framework that separates the student-exercise-concept dependency graph into distinct graphs for interactions, relations, and dependencies. This approach aims to improve representation modeling and mitigate the effects of noise in student interactions. The empirical evaluation demonstrates that DisenGCD outperforms state-of-the-art cognitive diagnosis models across multiple datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it accessible to readers, with detailed mathematical formulations and explanations.
2. The proposed disentangled graph learning approach is innovative and enhances the robustness of cognitive diagnosis models.
3. Comprehensive experiments validate the model's effectiveness, demonstrating improved performance and robustness through various experimental setups.

Weaknesses:
1. The model exhibits high computational complexity, which may limit its practical application.
2. The interpretability of the model is not adequately addressed, which is crucial for acceptance in educational contexts.
3. The paper lacks a detailed discussion on challenges related to data privacy and security in practical applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section by summarizing recent advancements in disentangled graph representation learning and illustrating the relationship of this work with prior studies. A more detailed introduction to the incorporated datasets should be provided, including clearer illustrations of the target tasks and evaluation metrics. Additionally, the authors should include more model variants to demonstrate the effectiveness of the added graphs (e.g., w/o G_R, w/o G_D, and w/o both). It would also be beneficial to discuss the choice of using GAT for learning representations and to explore alternative graph neural network models. Lastly, addressing the implications of data privacy and security in the implementation of DisenGCD would enhance the paper's transparency and reliability.
