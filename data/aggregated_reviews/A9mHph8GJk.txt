Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents NAS-X, a novel method for estimating posterior expectations in Reweighted Wake Sleep (RWS) architectures. Unlike traditional self-normalized importance sampling (SNIS), NAS-X employs a Sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) approach, utilizing smoothing distributions instead of filtering distributions to enhance particle efficiency and reduce variance. The authors achieve this through the density-ratio approach known as SIXO, which estimates twist sequences necessary for the method. The experiments validate NAS-X's effectiveness in both synthetic and real-world scenarios, particularly in discrete latent variable settings and complex tasks like Hodgkin-Huxley models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an important topic in machine learning, focusing on efficient particle-based posterior estimation in sequence models.
- It is well-written, with a clear motivation and explanation of the need for smoothing SMC.
- The main technical contribution, SIXO-based smoothing SMC, is noteworthy, demonstrating compatibility with RWS updates.
- The empirical validation showcases NAS-X's advantages over competitors, particularly in real-world applications.

Weaknesses:
- The potential impact of the work is limited, as SMC-based inference in RWS architectures is a niche area, and the contribution may appeal to a small audience.
- The multi-level approximations in NAS-X introduce complexity, raising concerns about robustness and the quality of learned twists, which are not sufficiently evaluated in experiments.
- The claim that smoothing SMC yields lower-variance estimates compared to filtering SMC is not directly investigated, and additional insights would be beneficial.
- The experimental setup description lacks clarity and structure, requiring readers to navigate between sections and supplemental material.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the relationship between SIXO and NAS-X, explicitly stating the differences and whether NAS-X offers more than just an application of SIXO to RWS. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments to evaluate the quality of learned twists and to directly investigate the variance claims associated with smoothing SMC. The authors should also enhance the structure of the experimental setup section and provide clearer references to supplemental material. Finally, a discussion of the limitations of NAS-X, including runtime analysis and potential societal impacts, would strengthen the paper.
