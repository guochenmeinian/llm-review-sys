Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on conformal drug property prediction under covariate shift, where the calibration and test data are not exchangeable. The authors propose CoDrug, an energy-based model that utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data to model the conditional \( p(y|x) \) and employs kernel density estimation (KDE) to rectify distribution shifts. Theoretical guarantees are provided, and experiments demonstrate that CoDrug effectively reduces coverage gaps compared to unweighted models, with applications in estimating logP values for de novo designed molecules.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses an important practical problem in drug design, providing a novel method for uncertainty quantification under covariate shift.  
- The quality of the paper is high, with clear contributions, solid mathematical foundations, and a fair experimental setting.  
- The writing is generally clear and easy to follow, and the experiments are conducted on a variety of relevant datasets.

Weaknesses:  
- The originality of the work is questioned, as many methodological choices appear to be straightforward applications of existing techniques.  
- The empirical evaluation lacks a comprehensive comparison with alternative methods, which could strengthen the understanding of the proposed method's effectiveness.  
- There is insufficient discussion of limitations and conditions under which KDE may fail.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 5.3 and consider relocating Section 4.2 after 4.3 to enhance the flow of the paper. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more exhaustive comparison with alternative methods to substantiate the effectiveness of CoDrug. It would also be beneficial to elaborate on the limitations of the proposed method and clarify the significance of the unlabeled ZINC dataset in the experimental results. Finally, we encourage the authors to address the novelty of their approach more explicitly to strengthen their contribution.
