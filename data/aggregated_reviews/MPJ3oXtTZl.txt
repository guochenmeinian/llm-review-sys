Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents G-Retriever, a retrieval-augmented method for graph question-answering tasks, which integrates LLMs, GNNs, and RAG. The authors develop a comprehensive benchmark called GraphQA, converting existing datasets into a uniform format. G-Retriever operates through four main steps: indexing, retrieval, subgraph construction using the Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree (PCST) method, and answer generation via an LLM. Extensive experiments validate G-Retriever's effectiveness and efficiency across multiple domains.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of the GraphQA benchmark significantly enhances the evaluation of graph QA applications.
2. The motivation for G-Retriever is clear, and the paper is well-structured.
3. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that G-Retriever outperforms baseline models.
4. Code availability ensures reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
1. The lack of an ablation study in Section 5.1 leaves the contribution of node and text attributes unexplored.
2. The rationale for selecting PCST in Section 5.3 is unclear, and comparisons with naive approaches are needed.
3. The novelty of the GraphQA benchmark is limited, primarily involving reformatting existing datasets.
4. Insufficient detail in evaluating hallucinations requires further elaboration.
5. The concept of "chat with their graph" is not clearly defined or explained.
6. There are no empirical analyses supporting the claim of improved explainability.
7. The paper lacks quantitative or qualitative analyses regarding the quality of retrieved subgraphs.
8. Efficiency evaluations focus on training times rather than inference times, which may misrepresent G-Retriever's performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the "chat with their graph" concept by providing further explanations and examples. Additionally, empirical analyses should be included to support claims regarding the explainability of G-Retriever. The authors should also provide necessary experimental details in the main text to enhance understanding and consider justifying the use of PCST by exploring alternative methods for subgraph retrieval. Finally, including analyses of the quality of retrieved subgraphs and comparing inference times during efficiency evaluations would strengthen the paper.
