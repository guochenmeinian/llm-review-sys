### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for detecting anomalous circuits in the Tor network, focusing on routing and usage anomalies. The authors propose a three-step detection methodology that includes classifying circuit types, identifying anomalous Entry-Exit node pairs, and clustering these nodes into potential malicious organizations. The study claims to have uncovered 1,960 anomalous nodes, providing insights into hidden Sybil groups. The methodology employs modified middle nodes for traffic data collection, which raises ethical concerns regarding user privacy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The methodology is comprehensive, employing a well-structured approach that includes traffic data collection, classification, anomaly detection, and clustering.
- The large-scale experimental validation using over 45 million circuit traces enhances the credibility of the findings.
- The study addresses an important security challenge in the Tor network, potentially improving its privacy and security.

Weaknesses:
- The scope of anomalous behavior detection is limited, focusing primarily on Entry-Exit pairs and neglecting other attack vectors within Tor.
- The reliance on modified middle nodes may pose practical implementation challenges and ethical concerns regarding user privacy.
- The paper lacks a detailed evaluation of real-time performance and does not adequately address potential latency issues.
- There is insufficient discussion on how adversaries might adapt to evade detection, and the rationale behind the detection methodology is not well articulated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the potential challenges of deploying this system at scale in a decentralized network like Tor, particularly regarding the resources required for maintaining multiple modified middle nodes. Additionally, the authors should provide a detailed evaluation of the real-time performance of the proposed system, including potential latency impacts on user connections. It would be beneficial to elaborate on strategies to counter adversaries that may modify their behavior to avoid detection and to clarify how the proposed method distinguishes between anomalous and benign behaviors. Finally, we suggest enhancing the related work section to clearly articulate the research gaps and the significance of the contributions compared to existing approaches.
