### Key Points
This paper presents a method aimed at enhancing multi-hop knowledge base question answering (KBQA) by incorporating co-relation information through a dual relation graph. The authors propose a framework that includes primal entity graph reasoning, dual graph information propagation, and dual-primal graph interaction. The evaluation on datasets WebQuestionsSP and Complex WebQuestion demonstrates a new state-of-the-art performance in KBQA.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The incorporation of co-relation information is an interesting approach, leading to significant performance gains.
- Solid experimental analysis is provided, detailing the effects of varying scales and connectivity of entity/relation graphs, as well as the impact of the dual graph.
- The paper is well-written and presents a clear evaluation, including useful ablation studies.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the method is limited, resembling existing approaches like NSM with only incremental additions.
- The performance gains are insufficiently demonstrated due to the absence of critical baselines.
- The writing style deviates from standard conventions, with formatting issues in tables and formulas.
- Concerns about reproducibility arise from a lack of detailed implementation information.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their motivation for using semantic information from neighborhood relations, particularly addressing the challenges posed by complex constraints. Additionally, we suggest including more comprehensive baseline comparisons, especially against retrieval-based techniques designed for multi-hop KBQA. The authors should also refine the writing style to adhere to standard conventions and provide detailed implementation specifics to enhance reproducibility. Finally, we advise removing the section titled ‘A Example Appendix’ in the final version.
