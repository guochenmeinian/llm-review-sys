### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the impact of YouTube ads on data consumption, particularly in developing countries where mobile data is costly. The authors establish a measurement framework using Selenium to quantify the bandwidth overhead caused by video ads, finding a 13.2% increase in data usage. The study highlights the inequities faced by users in developing regions and proposes potential solutions for buffering issues. However, concerns arise regarding the methodology, particularly the lack of diverse vantage points for data collection across different countries.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors provide original insights into the hidden costs of YouTube ads, emphasizing the equity implications for users in developing countries.
- The methodology is generally well-structured, and the findings are statistically significant.
- The paper is well-presented, with clear writing and a thorough analysis of the problem.

Weaknesses:
- The measurement setup lacks diversity in vantage points, potentially skewing the results regarding ad delivery and bandwidth overhead.
- The analysis does not adequately consider user behavior variations based on connectivity costs and bandwidth availability.
- Some figures and tables require clarification and improved presentation for better comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the methodology by ensuring measurements are taken from diverse vantage points in the countries studied to enhance the representativeness of the data. Additionally, the authors should incorporate user behavior characteristics and contextual factors into their analysis to provide a more nuanced understanding of the findings. We suggest including summary statistics in Section 3.1 to better illustrate the data landscape and clarify the results expressed in terms of percentages rather than ratios. Furthermore, addressing the presentation issues in figures and tables will enhance the overall clarity of the paper. Lastly, we encourage the authors to discuss the implications of their findings on the ad ecosystem and consider the ethical ramifications of their research.
