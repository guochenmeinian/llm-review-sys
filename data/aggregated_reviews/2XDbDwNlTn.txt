### Key Points
This paper presents FACTIFY 3M, a large-scale multimodal dataset for fact verification, addressing the critical issue of disinformation. The dataset includes 3 million samples comprising textual claims, ChatGPT-paraphrased claims, associated images, pixel-level image heatmaps, 5W question-answering pairs, and adversarial fake news stories. The authors propose using data augmentation techniques and emphasize the dataset's potential to enhance interpretability and support research in multimodal fact verification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The dataset is comprehensive and addresses a pressing societal issue related to disinformation.  
- It incorporates advanced technologies such as ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion for data augmentation, enhancing its novelty.  
- The paper is well-written and structured, providing a rich resource for researchers.  

Weaknesses:  
- The authors claim to be the first to introduce adversarial attacks, overlooking related works in the field.  
- There is a lack of evaluation for the classification accuracy of the collected data, which raises concerns about its reliability.  
- The paper lacks in-depth experimental evaluations or case studies demonstrating the dataset's practical applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by conducting human evaluations on the heatmap for more accurate interpretations. Additionally, providing concrete examples and use cases would strengthen the case for the dataset's utility in multimodal fact verification tasks. Furthermore, addressing the classification accuracy of the collected data and clarifying the rationale behind targeting only the false class for adversarial attacks would enhance the paper's credibility.
