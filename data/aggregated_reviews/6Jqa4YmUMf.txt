Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comparison of training strategies for machine translation (MT) models, specifically contrasting a single multi-domain model with an aggregation of smaller domain expert models (DEMs). The authors conduct experiments on multiple domain datasets, demonstrating that well-trained DEMs can outperform a larger multi-domain model (MDM) under certain conditions. The study evaluates various output selection methods, revealing that DEMs can achieve superior performance depending on the approach used.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is clearly written and well-structured.
- It provides thorough experimental support for its claims, particularly regarding the effectiveness of DEMs.
- The findings regarding the potential of different ensembling strategies are noteworthy and could be beneficial for practitioners.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments are limited to English-Japanese translation tasks, which may not sufficiently support the conclusions drawn.
- There is a lack of important baselines, such as models with adapter layers and alternative sampling techniques for domain data.
- The paper does not explore the failure conditions of the winning strategy, nor does it examine results across more language pairs or less concentrated domains.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the breadth of their experiments by including additional language pairs and exploring looser domain definitions. It would also be beneficial to incorporate significant baselines, such as models with adapter layers and classifiers for domain prediction. Furthermore, we suggest conducting significance testing to assess the gains and reporting results using additional metrics like BLEU or BLEURT to validate the findings. Lastly, a more detailed discussion on the potential limitations and failure conditions of the proposed strategies would enhance the paper's depth.
