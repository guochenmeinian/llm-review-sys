### Key Points
This paper investigates the impact of epistemic expressions, particularly certainty and uncertainty, on language models (LLMs) through an innovative approach that employs zero-shot prompting and integrates verbal and numerical markers into trivia question prompts. The authors analyze how these expressions affect model accuracy, revealing that the addition of certainty expressions unexpectedly decreases performance. They hypothesize that this behavior stems from the prevalence of uncertainty expressions in answers and certainty expressions in questions within pre-training datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The findings highlight a significant flaw in LLM behavior regarding epistemic markers, providing valuable insights into model performance.  
- The paper is well-written, with clear motivation and thorough analysis, particularly in Sections 5 to 7, which explore the underlying causes of observed behaviors.  
- The contrasting results against initial hypotheses are intriguing and contribute to a deeper understanding of LLMs.

Weaknesses:  
- The evaluation design has limitations, such as the unclear process for building the list of epistemic markers and the restricted model setup, which affects the significance of results.  
- Some assumptions in the evaluation may lead to misleading scoring, necessitating further validation.  
- Minor issues include unclear experimental settings and typographical errors that need correction.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the process for building the list of epistemic markers, detailing the sources and motivations for crowd-sourced markers. Additionally, please provide a comprehensive description of the model setup, including specific pre-trained models used. We suggest validating the evaluation design to ensure it accurately captures model behavior without unintentional biases. Furthermore, addressing minor issues such as typographical errors and the organization of sections will enhance the paper's clarity. Lastly, consider adding a regression analysis to confirm the conclusiveness of results presented in Section 4.2.
