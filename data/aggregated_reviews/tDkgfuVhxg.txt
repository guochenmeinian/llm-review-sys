### Key Points
This paper presents an extended analysis of attention decoding using the MOET dataset, focusing on localizing a subject's center of attention based on gaze positions and saccades. The authors propose three contributions: improving previous machine learning models for attention decoding, defining new two-stage model architectures for comparison with existing approaches, and presenting initial results for classifying subjects' attention loci on MOET. While the study is a thorough comparative analysis, it lacks significant novelty and is primarily a summary of prior literature.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is clearly written and well-organized.
- It addresses an important problem in cognitive science by defining attention decoding from eye movements.
- Justifications for data cleaning and heuristic baselines are well-articulated.
- Model architecture figures and results tables are clear.

Weaknesses:
- The study primarily summarizes existing literature rather than presenting novel methods.
- The assumption that gaze fixation coincides with latent attention is overly simplistic.
- Hyperparameter tuning results lack explanation regarding their significance and generalizability.
- The paper does not adequately address the implications of errors in bounding box estimations.
- The dataset's issues with gaze points not aligning with bounding boxes are not thoroughly discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the framing of the study to emphasize its contributions rather than its literature review aspect. Address the assumption that gaze fixation aligns with latent attention, providing a more nuanced discussion of oculomotor behavior. Clarify the reasons behind hyperparameter tuning results and explore their potential generalizability. Discuss the implications of bounding box estimation errors more comprehensively and provide a detailed analysis of the dataset's cleaning process. Additionally, consider including a comparison of crowded versus less cluttered scenes and support the assumption of user variability in gaze tracking with empirical evidence. Lastly, clarify the new benchmark and class labels to enhance understanding.
