### Key Points
This paper presents a study of correlation clustering in the streaming model, focusing on estimating the cost of clustering rather than the clustering itself. The authors propose $(a,b)$-approximation algorithms, achieving an $(O(1), \delta n^2)$-approximation with $polylog(n)/\delta^5$ space and a $(3, \delta n^2)$-approximation in expectation using $2^{O(1/\delta)} polylog(n)$ space. They provide lower bounds indicating that certain approximations require significant space, and they conduct experiments demonstrating their algorithms' effectiveness in distinguishing clusterable from non-clusterable graph settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem addressed is interesting and relevant in both theoretical and practical contexts.
- The paper is well-written, with clear proofs and justifications for the results.
- The experimental results effectively demonstrate the algorithms' capabilities in real-world scenarios.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of certain ideas is unclear, as some may be inspired by previous work.
- The empirical results could benefit from more practical motivation and examples beyond theoretical discussions.
- Some sections are clumsily written, leading to potential confusion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity in distinguishing novel contributions from prior work, particularly regarding the inspiration from [AW'22]. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the empirical section by including real-world examples to motivate the practical aspects of cost estimation. Furthermore, we advise rewriting sections that are currently unclear, such as l104-110, to improve readability. Lastly, addressing the legibility of figures in the supplementary material would enhance the presentation quality.
