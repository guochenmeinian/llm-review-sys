Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents novel projection-free optimization methods for solving simple stochastic bilevel optimization problems. The authors propose techniques that utilize a conditional gradient algorithm and variance reduction to approximate the lower-level problem's solution set. The theoretical guarantees provided demonstrate efficiency for both convex and non-convex upper-level functions, with significant improvements in sample complexity over previous methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The originality of extending cutting planes to stochastic bilevel optimization is notable.
- The theoretical quality is commendable, showing substantial improvements in complexity results.
- The overall structure and clarity of the paper are well-executed.
- The research offers lower complexity guarantees, enhancing the field of stochastic simple bilevel optimization.

Weaknesses:
- The assumption that the constraint set $\mathcal{Z}$ is compact and convex may limit practical applicability.
- The rationale for using the number of samples as the abscissa in experiments is unclear, and a comparative analysis of time efficiency is missing.
- Numerous typographical errors detract from the paper's professionalism.
- The paper lacks references to game theory literature, which could broaden its accessibility and context.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how randomness is incorporated in Example 1 and explain why stochastic simple bilevel optimization is necessary for the modeling approach. Additionally, please address the typographical errors and unify notations throughout the paper for consistency. We suggest providing a detailed discussion on existing works in general bilevel optimization to clarify their applicability to the proposed methods. Furthermore, consider exploring the implications of allowing variable batch sizes in the algorithms to enhance practical applicability.
