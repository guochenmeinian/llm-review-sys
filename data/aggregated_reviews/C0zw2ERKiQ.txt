Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an empirical investigation aimed at evaluating the synthesis performance of generative adversarial networks (GANs) through a new measurement system that utilizes Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) as a reliable metric. The authors focus on the reliability and robustness of various feature extractors and distributional distances, demonstrating that CKA correlates better with human perceptual evaluations than traditional metrics like Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) and Kernel Inception Distance (KID). The study includes extensive experiments across multiple datasets and highlights vulnerabilities of certain extractors to histogram matching attacks, emphasizing the need for robust evaluation methods. Additionally, the authors expand their evaluation to include state-of-the-art generative models and introduce a metric for assessing image-to-image translation performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper rigorously explores the evaluation of generative models, addressing the limitations of existing metrics like FID.
- It identifies reliable feature extractors and demonstrates the effectiveness of CKA through extensive empirical experiments, showing better sample efficiency and agreement with human evaluations.
- The integration of multiple feature extractors enhances the evaluation's semantic coverage, and the user study involving 100 participants validates that CKA aligns well with human judgment.
- The paper provides extensive quantitative results and visualizations that clarify the findings.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the work is limited, as CKA is already established for evaluating distribution similarity, and the paper lacks a comprehensive discussion of state-of-the-art methods like stable diffusion and midjourney.
- The experiments do not include an ablation study to support the conclusions, weakening their persuasiveness and isolating the effectiveness of individual extractors and CKA.
- Some sections are not strictly parallel, which may affect clarity and logical flow, and the paper primarily focuses on GANs, which may limit its applicability to other generative models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their work by incorporating discussions of state-of-the-art generative models, such as stable diffusion and midjourney, to contextualize their findings. Additionally, including an ablation study would enhance the persuasiveness of their conclusions by demonstrating the individual contributions of the feature extractors and CKA to the overall measurement system. We also suggest that the authors provide a more comprehensive comparison of CKA with other metrics beyond FID and KID, such as precision and recall, to strengthen their evaluation. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to improve the clarity of the presentation by ensuring that sections are more parallel and logically structured, and to consider assessing the diversity and novelty of generated samples in future work to enhance the evaluation framework.
