### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the security of Natural Language Interfaces to Databases (NLIDB) through the TrojanSQL framework, which facilitates backdoor attacks by embedding pre-selected triggers in datasets. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of TrojanSQL on seven victim models, achieving a high attack success rate and indicating the difficulty of defense against such attacks. The study explores two specific injection techniques: boolean-based and union-based injections, contributing definitions and principles to the field.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- It addresses an important issue in the NLP community that has not been thoroughly explored.
- The proposed method is simple, effective, and supported by extensive experiments across various text-to-SQL parsers.
- The definition of the loss function for backdoor attacks is a notable contribution.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments are limited to a single dataset (Spider), which may not represent real-world scenarios; additional datasets like KaggleDBQA and EHRSQL would enhance the study.
- The presence of a large number of poisoning samples in the dataset raises concerns about practical applicability and detection ease.
- The significance of union-based injection is questioned, and many experimental details lack clarity, particularly regarding comparisons between the two attack types.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental design by including additional datasets to validate the robustness of TrojanSQL in diverse contexts. Clarifying the details of the experiments, especially the comparison between boolean-based and union-based injections, would strengthen the paper. Additionally, addressing the concerns regarding the dataset's composition and the practicality of the attack would enhance the overall impact of the research. Finally, we suggest that the authors provide more evidence to substantiate their claims about the limitations of existing approaches, such as including a detector with experimental results.
