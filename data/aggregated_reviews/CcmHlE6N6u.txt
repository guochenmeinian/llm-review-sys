Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents LuSh-NeRF, a model designed to reconstruct clean and sharp NeRFs from handheld low-light images by addressing three forms of degradation: low intensity, noise, and motion blur. The authors propose a Scene-Noise Decomposition (SND) module for noise removal and a Camera Trajectory Prediction (CTP) module for estimating camera motions based on low-frequency scene information. Experiments demonstrate that LuSh-NeRF outperforms existing methods in rendering bright and sharp novel-view images from low-light scenes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. This is the first work to reconstruct degradation-free images from low-light photographs with motion blur.
2. The authors introduce a new method for scene-noise decomposition from the implicit scene representation, utilizing frequency information for accurate kernel prediction in NeRF.
3. The qualitative results are appealing, and the authors show better quantitative scores for their method.

Weaknesses:
1. The mathematical presentation is unclear, particularly in Eq. 5, where the blurring operation is missing, and inconsistencies exist in notation across equations and figures.
2. The novelty of the CTP module is questionable, as it appears to draw from existing methods without sufficient differentiation.
3. The exclusion of high-frequency edge areas in gradient computation is problematic, as blurring is often most visible in these regions.
4. The dataset contribution is limited, as it primarily relies on images captured by prior work, raising questions about the authors' claims regarding dataset originality.
5. Several important references related to deblurring methods are missing, and the related works section lacks proper organization and explanation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of mathematical equations, particularly in Eq. 5, by explicitly including the blurring operation and ensuring consistent notation throughout. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more thorough explanation of the CTP module to clarify its novelty and differentiate it from existing methods. It would be beneficial to include high-frequency regions in the gradient computation to enhance the model's performance on edges. We also recommend that the authors emphasize the experimental evaluations of their dataset contribution and consider incorporating ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of various components in LuSh-NeRF. Finally, please ensure that all relevant references are included in the related works section, with concise explanations for each cited work.
