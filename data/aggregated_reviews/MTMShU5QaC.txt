Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Diffusion-KTO, a novel approach for aligning text-to-image diffusion models with human preferences using per-image binary feedback instead of pairwise preference data. The key contributions include extending the human utility maximization framework to diffusion models, developing an objective for training on binary feedback, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods like Diffusion-DPO through experiments, and showing alignment with specific user preferences via synthetic experiments. The authors fine-tune Stable Diffusion models using their Diffusion-KTO objective and evaluate the results against various baselines, indicating that Diffusion-KTO produces images preferred by humans and scores higher on automated metrics. The authors also provide direct comparisons with SFT baselines, including automatic win rates and human evaluations, demonstrating a 72.3% preference for Diffusion-KTO over SFT. They argue that the discussion should focus on interpreting results rather than the absence of comparisons, emphasizing that Diffusion-KTO's ability to avoid undesirable outputs is a key differentiator from SFT.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper demonstrates originality by extending the utility maximization framework to diffusion models and introducing a new alignment objective that utilizes abundant binary feedback data.
- Comprehensive evaluations using both automated metrics and human studies, along with comparisons against multiple baselines, showcase rigor in experimental design.
- The authors provide thorough comparisons, including automatic win rates and human evaluations, supporting the effectiveness of Diffusion-KTO.
- The methodology is well-structured and clear, with detailed explanations and visual results supporting reproducibility.
- The paper addresses statistical significance and practical implications of improvements, contributing to the discussion on model performance.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a detailed analysis of how biases in preference data may affect the aligned model, which would enhance understanding of potential limitations.
- The method's novelty is questioned, as it appears to be a straightforward application of KTO to diffusion models, with potential overlaps with existing preference-tuning methods.
- The experiments focus primarily on Stable Diffusion v1-5 and v2-1, suggesting a need for broader model inclusion to demonstrate generalizability.
- Personalization to individual preferences is only shown through synthetic experiments, limiting practical implications.
- The practical significance of small improvements remains unclear, particularly in comparisons between Diffusion-KTO and SFT or Diffusion-DPO.
- The selection criteria for visual results in Figure 5 lack clarity, raising questions about the representativeness of the displayed images.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of biases in preference data and its impact on the aligned model. Additionally, we suggest expanding the range of diffusion models evaluated to better demonstrate the generalizability of the approach. The authors should also provide a more rigorous explanation of the derivations in Section 4.1 and clarify the definitions and motivations for key components like Q_ref. Furthermore, we recommend improving the clarity of the practical significance of their results, particularly in the comparisons between Diffusion-KTO and SFT or Diffusion-DPO. Including error bars or 95% confidence intervals in Tables 3 and 4 would enhance the interpretation of these comparisons. We also suggest providing a more detailed explanation of the selection process for images in Figure 5 to ensure transparency and reproducibility. Finally, integrating techniques such as classifier guidance into the diffusion model could further enhance its ability to avoid undesirable outputs.
