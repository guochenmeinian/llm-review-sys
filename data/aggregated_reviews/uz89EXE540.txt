### Key Points
This paper presents an approach to self-learn rules that serve as interpretable knowledge for relation linking in knowledge base question answering (QA) systems. The authors propose a novel method called "Self-Supervised Rule Learning to Link Text Segments to Relational Elements of Structured Knowledge," addressing issues such as data hunger, lack of interpretability, and limited generalization in neural approaches. The method utilizes a masked training strategy on logical forms derived from sentences, enabling the extraction of robust and interpretable rules that map text segments to relational elements in knowledge bases. The evaluation on datasets CLUTRR and SWQ demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a fresh perspective by modeling relation linking as a self-supervised rule learning task, which can enhance generalization and reduce the need for annotated data.
- The proposed method offers interpretability through the generation of rules that define natural language predicates as weighted mixtures of knowledge base paths.
- Comprehensive evaluation shows high-quality results that generalize well across domains.

Weaknesses:
- The methodology is intricate and requires clearer exposition, which may hinder accessibility for a broader audience.
- The paper lacks concrete examples to illustrate the learned rules and does not adequately explain the generation of logical forms, affecting the reliability assessment of the approach.
- Insufficient details for reproducibility are provided, including the quality of extracted logical forms and the performance impact of the semantic parser.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology by providing a more lucid exposition and additional examples to illustrate the learned rules. It is crucial to include a clear explanation of how logical forms are generated and the accuracy of this process, as it significantly impacts the reliability of the proposed approach. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors enhance the description of the relationship between paths, rules, and relation linking to facilitate better understanding. Lastly, providing more details for reproducibility, including the potential public availability of code, would greatly benefit the research community.
