Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Equivariant Diffuser for Generating Interactions (EDGI), an $SE(3) \times \mathbb{Z} \times S_n$-equivariant diffusion model aimed at enhancing model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) and planning. The authors propose a novel approach that incorporates spatial, temporal, and permutation symmetries, demonstrating improved sample efficiency and generalization capabilities in navigation and manipulation tasks. The empirical results indicate that EDGI outperforms non-equivariant baselines, particularly in low data regimes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of equivariant diffusion is innovative, providing a fresh perspective on symmetries in planning and MBRL.
- The method effectively incorporates a variety of symmetries, enhancing generalization performance for unseen tasks.
- The design of a novel equivariant U-net architecture supports multiple representations, increasing flexibility.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a thorough comparison with prior works on equivariance, leaving unclear distinctions from existing methods.
- There is insufficient analysis and ablation studies regarding the impact of the three types of equivariance on performance.
- The experimental section could be more comprehensive, particularly in justifying the choice of symmetries and exploring data augmentation as a baseline.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the conceptual explanations surrounding equivariant symmetries and their role in sample efficiency. Additionally, providing a detailed comparison with previous methods that utilize equivariance would strengthen the paper. We suggest including ablation studies to determine the contribution of each symmetry to performance and considering data augmentation as a baseline for validation. Furthermore, a more thorough discussion on network design choices and their implications for preserving equivariant symmetries would enhance the paper's rigor. Lastly, addressing the computational costs and scalability of the proposed model in complex environments would provide a more realistic perspective on its applicability.
