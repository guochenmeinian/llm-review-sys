Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents two stochastic optimization algorithms for instrumental variable regression (IVaR) that function on streaming data without requiring matrix inversions or mini-batches. The authors prove that TOSG-IVaR converges at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\log T/T)$ and OTSG-IVaR at a rate of $O(1/T^{1 - \iota})$ for any $\iota > 0$, with $T$ representing the number of iterations. The proposed methods effectively circumvent the "forbidden regression" problem by directly addressing the conditional stochastic optimization problem, and numerical experiments support the theoretical claims.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper offers a novel perspective on IVaR by framing it as a conditional stochastic optimization problem, enabling the development of online algorithms for streaming data.
2. The algorithms, TOSG-IVaR and OTSG-IVaR, are computationally efficient, avoiding matrix inversions and mini-batches, making them suitable for large datasets.
3. By directly tackling the optimization problem, the algorithms eliminate the need for approximating dual variables, a limitation in previous formulations.
4. The paper is well-structured, clearly presenting background, contributions, limitations, and summarizing proof techniques alongside supportive experimental results.

Weaknesses:
1. There is a lack of comprehensive comparison with existing IVaR methods regarding computational complexity and empirical performance on real-world datasets, which would enhance the paper's contributions.
2. The theoretical assumptions, such as identifiability conditions and moment assumptions, may be restrictive in practical applications. A discussion on the robustness of the algorithms under these assumptions would be beneficial.
3. The contribution of the second algorithm appears marginal, as it is an intuitive adaptation of the 2SLS method to the SGD framework without sufficient justification for its advantages over traditional methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by providing a thorough comparison with existing IVaR methods, particularly focusing on computational complexity and empirical performance on real-world datasets. Additionally, discussing the robustness of the proposed algorithms under the theoretical assumptions would strengthen the analysis. The authors should also elaborate on the advantages of Algorithm 2 over the canonical offline 2SLS method, potentially including theoretical and empirical comparisons. Furthermore, we suggest enhancing the motivation for IVaR problems with streaming data by discussing practical scenarios and augmenting the experimental section with more comprehensive real-world data evaluations. Lastly, clarifying the update rules for non-linear models in Algorithm 2 would address existing concerns regarding its applicability in such contexts.
