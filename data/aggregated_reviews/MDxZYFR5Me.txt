Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method, Mix-IRLS, for estimating parameters in a mixture of linear regression (MLR) models, particularly addressing the challenges posed by imbalanced mixtures where some components are significantly rarer than others. The authors argue that existing maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) perform poorly under such conditions and propose a sequential estimation approach using robust regression methods. The paper includes empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of Mix-IRLS on both synthetic and real-world datasets, as well as theoretical guarantees for its performance in sufficiently imbalanced settings. Additionally, the authors propose improvements over conventional MLE, although a more precise characterization of these advantages is needed.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method offers an interesting alternative to MLE in MLR, demonstrating efficiency and simplicity.
- The algorithm is robust to noise and outliers, and does not require prior knowledge of the number of components.
- The paper is well-organized, with clear assumptions and empirical results supporting the method's effectiveness.
- The authors effectively addressed concerns raised in the rebuttal and incorporated feedback from other reviewers, particularly with the addition of the CO2 experiment section.

Weaknesses:
- Notations and terminology are sometimes unclear, such as the definition of "significantly imbalanced" and the term $n_{\text{info}}$.
- The motivation behind certain equations and hyperparameters is insufficiently explained, particularly regarding the intuition for equation (2b) and the weight in Phase II.
- The experimental section lacks detailed descriptions, making it difficult to interpret results, especially concerning the definition of "median error" and the choice of initial values.
- The theoretical analysis primarily focuses on infinite sample settings, which limits practical applicability; finite sample analysis is needed.
- The advantages of the proposed method over conventional MLE are not characterized with sufficient precision.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of notations and terminology, particularly by defining "significantly imbalanced" and clarifying the meaning of $n_{\text{info}}$. Additionally, the authors should provide more motivation for the equations used, especially for equation (2b) and the hyperparameters involved. Enhancing the experimental section with detailed descriptions of the methodology and definitions, such as "median error," would strengthen the paper's findings. Furthermore, we suggest including a finite sample analysis to complement the theoretical results, making them more applicable to real-world scenarios. Finally, we recommend that the authors improve the characterization of the advantages of their approach over conventional MLE to strengthen the paper further.
