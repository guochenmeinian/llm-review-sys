Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents BaFormer, a novel boundary-aware Transformer network aimed at enhancing the efficiency of Temporal Action Segmentation (TAS) while maintaining high performance. The authors propose a method that tokenizes video segments into instance tokens and utilizes instance queries for segmentation, alongside a global query for boundary prediction, which allows for continuous segment proposals. The model's inference employs a voting strategy that significantly reduces computational costs while achieving competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods like DiffAct. Experiments across various TAS benchmarks validate BaFormer's efficiency and effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method is simple yet effective, achieving performance gains and improved inference speed over previous methods.
2. Detailed ablation studies substantiate the effectiveness of BaFormer, demonstrating its competitive performance relative to two-stage methods.
3. The approach is well-written and clearly described, making it accessible to readers.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the approach is limited, primarily relying on existing frameworks, with the main innovation being the boundary-aware query voting, which is a post-processing step.
2. There are inconsistencies in performance claims regarding running time and FLOPs in the tables, leading to confusion about the fairness of comparisons.
3. The paper lacks sufficient qualitative results and additional ablation studies, particularly regarding the impact of different query token numbers and loss functions.
4. Notations in the paper are confusing, with inconsistent variable definitions that hinder understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of the paper by clearly articulating the unique contributions beyond existing frameworks. Additionally, we suggest providing a detailed breakdown of modeling forward time and post-processing time to clarify performance claims. To enhance the paper, include more qualitative results and additional ablation studies, particularly focusing on the effects of different query token counts and loss functions. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify notations and ensure consistent variable definitions throughout the paper to facilitate better comprehension.
