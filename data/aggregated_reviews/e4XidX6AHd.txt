Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for decomposing information from two random variables into common and unique components, utilizing a variant of Gacs-Korner common information. The authors propose a variational relaxation to compute the practical loss, which allows for a stochastic mapping rather than a deterministic function, facilitating optimization. The methodology aims to address challenges in extracting common information, which is typically difficult to acquire due to the constraints of joint distributions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The introduction of Gacs-Korner common information for partitioning data is novel and presents a principled approach to the problem.  
- The empirical evidence supports the advantages of the proposed method, and the authors have designed experiments across various datasets to validate their architecture.  

Weaknesses:  
- The experimental results lack effectiveness and do not sufficiently compare the proposed method with existing literature on disentangled representations, which diminishes its novelty.  
- The connection between the proposed method and Gacs-Korner common information appears tenuous, as the derivation resembles a minor variation of a vanilla VAE, leading to limited empirical advantages.  
- Key concepts, such as the differences between common and mutual information, require clearer explanations and illustrative examples.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental design by including direct comparisons with established methods in the literature to demonstrate the unique contributions of their approach. Additionally, qualitative experiments using paired data streams from different modalities could better showcase the strengths of their method. Clarifying the implementation details, particularly regarding the conditional divergence minimization term and the balance between parameters, would enhance the paper's clarity. Finally, addressing potential limitations and negative societal impacts would strengthen the manuscript.
