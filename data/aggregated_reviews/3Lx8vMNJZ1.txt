Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on minimizing Borda regret in dueling bandits under a generalized linear model, where each arm pair is associated with a context vector. The authors propose algorithms for both stochastic and adversarial settings, demonstrating that their solutions achieve regret bounds matching the established lower bounds. The paper also discusses the construction of hard instances and provides empirical evidence supporting the theoretical findings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed algorithms match the upper bounds for both stochastic and adversarial settings.
- The construction of hard cases is interesting and contributes to the theoretical framework.
- The paper is well-written, with clear notation and a reader-friendly presentation of algorithms and proofs.
- The results fill an important research gap and are supported by experiments on real and synthetic data.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental results are not very convincing and lack robustness.
- The algorithms are relatively straightforward extensions of existing approaches, limiting their novelty.
- The setup for experiments is confusing, as the two algorithms target different contexts but are evaluated together.
- The discussion on the G-optimal design is not present in the main text, which is vital for understanding the novelty of the work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental setup to better differentiate between the single context and adversarial settings. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a summary of the technical challenges encountered in analyzing the algorithms to highlight new ideas. Clarifying the assumption of a linear model for BEXP3 in the abstract and discussing the implications of the G-optimal design would enhance the paper's quality. Finally, addressing the minor typographical errors and ensuring consistency in notation throughout the paper would improve readability.
