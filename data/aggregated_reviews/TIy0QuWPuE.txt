### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of post-processing calibration techniques, specifically Platt scaling and isotonic regression, and their impact on model calibration and the alignment between score distributions and true event distributions. The authors employ simulated and real-world datasets to demonstrate that while these techniques improve traditional calibration metrics, they often lead to divergence between score distributions and actual event probabilities. The work primarily focuses on XGBoost binary classifiers.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant problem in model calibration, highlighting the risks of relying solely on calibration metrics without considering score distribution alignment.
- The experiments are well-designed, comparing different calibration techniques and showcasing their strengths and limitations through rigorous analysis using both simulated and real-world data.
- The discussion on the limitations of current calibration methods and the proposal to optimize model parameters based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence offers a fresh perspective on the topic.
- The introduction is well-structured, and the paper effectively frames the problem of calibration metrics not fully capturing discrepancies.
- The explanation of KL divergence is adequate and well-articulated.

Weaknesses:
- The explanation of score heterogeneity is insufficiently formalized and lacks coherence, making its significance unclear.
- There is a lack of deeper theoretical grounding for the observed effects of calibration techniques on score heterogeneity, with insufficient explanation for the divergence between calibration and score distribution alignment.
- The evaluation is limited to two calibration methods, and the inclusion of more modern techniques could enrich the comparison.
- Several sections lack clarity, such as insufficient information about Brier Score and the relevance of the 45-degree diagonal line.
- Key terms like mu, s, and beta are not clearly defined, leading to confusion.
- Section 4 does not provide adequate analysis or interpretation of results, and the appendix contains numerous graphs and tables without explanations, making them difficult to analyze.
- There is no mention of validation methods for the results provided.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the formalization and clarity of the explanation regarding score heterogeneity to enhance reader understanding. Additionally, the authors should provide deeper theoretical insights into the effects of calibration techniques on score heterogeneity. Expanding the evaluation to include modern calibration methods, such as beta calibration or spline-based methods, would enrich the analysis. 

We suggest that the authors clarify key terms and concepts, particularly in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, and provide a more thorough explanation of the relevance of the 45-degree diagonal line. The authors should also enhance Section 4 with detailed analyses of the results and improve the appendix by providing explanations for the graphs and tables. Finally, we recommend including validation methods for the results to strengthen the paper's findings.
