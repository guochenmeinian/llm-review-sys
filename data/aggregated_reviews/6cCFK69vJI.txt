Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Building TimeSeries (BTS) dataset, which includes diverse time-series data from three buildings in Australia over a three-year period. The dataset aims to enhance research in building analytics by promoting interoperability through adherence to the Brick schema. It encompasses over ten thousand time series data points and 240 unique ontologies, addressing significant gaps in existing datasets. The authors demonstrate the dataset's utility through benchmarks on time-series ontology classification and zero-shot forecasting, contributing to climate change mitigation and improved human well-being.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The BTS dataset is comprehensive, providing real-world data from three diverse buildings, which is rare in the field.
- It surpasses the ontological breadth of existing datasets, facilitating deeper insights into building dynamics and performance.
- The dataset is publicly accessible, and the authors have taken care to anonymize sensitive information, addressing privacy concerns.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset's limited number of buildings may restrict its impact on transfer learning and zero-shot generalization research.
- Key details regarding dataset preprocessing, featurization, and class statistics are inadequately described, affecting clarity.
- Anomalous data points have not been investigated, which could hinder real-world applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by moving critical details from the appendix to the main text, particularly regarding dataset preprocessing and the ontology problem. Additionally, addressing the anomalous data points and providing insights from building managers would enhance the dataset's applicability. To strengthen the benchmarking section, we suggest including more rigorous baselines and conducting hyperparameter tuning for the models used. Lastly, a formal mathematical description of the knowledge graph and its alignment with the time series would benefit future multimodal research.
