### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of stopping strategies in conversational search systems (CSSs), adapting traditional information retrieval (IR) stopping rules and proposing new ones based on textual features. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of these rules through experiments on multiple datasets, revealing the importance of features such as the number of unique nouns in predicting user stopping points. The study aims to enhance understanding of user behavior in CSSs and contribute to the design of more effective conversational agents.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a methodologically sound approach, clearly explaining the adaptation of stopping rules and empirical validation.
- It offers valuable insights into user behavior, identifying key textual statistical features that influence stopping behavior.
- The related work section is comprehensive, situating the research within existing literature effectively.

Weaknesses:
- There are inconsistencies between the lists of rules in different sections, which could confuse readers.
- The presentation could be improved for clarity, particularly regarding the numerous abbreviations and the complexity of the features discussed.
- The theoretical aspects of stopping behavior are underexplored, lacking depth in discussing cognitive factors and user context.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the alignment between the lists of rules in sections 3 and 4, possibly including explicit linking text or diagrams for clarity. Additionally, providing more details on the datasets' collection methods and interaction specifics would enhance the validity of the models. We suggest simplifying the fitted models through backward model selection or ablation and reporting statistics like partial eta-squared to clarify feature importance. Furthermore, addressing the theoretical implications of stopping criteria and discussing their relevance to future CSS developments would enrich the paper's contribution. Lastly, enhancing the readability of the presentation by condensing content and clarifying terminology would benefit the audience.
