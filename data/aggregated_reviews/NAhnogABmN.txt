### Key Points
This paper presents 'GraphTranslator,' a framework designed to align graph models (GMs) with large language models (LLMs) for both pre-defined and open-ended tasks. The authors propose a Translator module to convert node embeddings into a language interpretable by LLMs, thereby enhancing the performance of tasks such as zero-shot node classification and graph question answering. The paper identifies significant challenges in the graph domain, including modality gaps and alignment data scarcity, which the proposed method aims to address.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The motivation for the research is clearly articulated, highlighting the gap in existing methods that cannot handle both task types simultaneously.  
- The theoretical foundation of GraphTranslator is robust, addressing key challenges in the graph domain.  
- Effective visual representations, particularly in Figure 2, enhance understanding of the proposed architecture.  
- The paper is well-organized, presenting ideas with clarity and coherence.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks a performance comparison to demonstrate the proposed method's advantages in speed and cost efficiency.  
- Concerns exist regarding the Producer module's functionality, particularly in ensuring the accuracy of LLM-generated textual descriptions.  
- The exploration of input settings is limited, primarily focusing on zero-shot prompts, while broader configurations could be beneficial.  
- The reliance on ChatGPT for evaluation raises concerns about biases and the need for human evaluation.  
- Limited diversity in model selection, using only GraphSAGE and ChatGLM-6B, may weaken generalizability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including a comparative analysis that clearly demonstrates the advantages of GraphTranslator over existing methods in terms of speed and cost. Additionally, the authors should provide a robust explanation or validation mechanism to ensure the accuracy of the textual descriptions generated by the Producer module. Exploring a wider range of input settings, including few-shot prompts, would enhance the robustness of the evaluation. Furthermore, we suggest incorporating human evaluation alongside ChatGPT to provide a more reliable assessment of the proposed method. Lastly, the authors should consider including a variety of GMs and LLMs in their experiments to strengthen the generalizability of their findings.
