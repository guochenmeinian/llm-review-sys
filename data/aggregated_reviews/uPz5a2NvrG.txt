Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a normal-abnormal decoupling memory network for medical report generation, specifically targeting the optimization of visual extraction based on anomaly semantics. The authors demonstrate that their method outperforms baseline models on the MIMIC-CXR dataset. The paper includes a thorough ablation study indicating that each component contributes positively to performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The separate modeling of normal and abnormal reports is an interesting approach.
2. The proposed method shows superior performance on the benchmark MIMIC-CXR dataset.
3. The methodology is novel, enhancing understanding of radiology report structures and improving anomaly perception.

Weaknesses:
1. The abnormal mode memory component lacks clarity and is difficult to interpret.
2. The reliance on a keyword-based method for classifying normal-abnormal semantics is noisy and weakens this section of the paper.
3. The paper primarily presents results from a single dataset, limiting its generalizability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the abnormal mode memory section to enhance interpretability. Additionally, we suggest refining the classification of normal and abnormal semantics to address the noise issues inherent in the current keyword-based approach. It would also be beneficial to include results from multiple datasets to strengthen the paper's contributions. Furthermore, please provide details regarding the GPUs used, the training epochs, and the type of noise impacting network optimization. Lastly, ensure that all missing references, such as the Hungarian algorithm, are cited appropriately.
