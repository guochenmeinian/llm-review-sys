Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a model for estimating the causal effect of a sequence of interventions on another sequence, addressing challenges in causal inference for large discrete spaces. The authors propose a parameterization that allows the decomposition of the effect into individual time-point-wise effects, which is shown to be both theoretically sound (identifiability) and empirically effective. The method utilizes a VAE-based fitting approach and incorporates predictive intervals from conformal prediction, demonstrating competitive performance in experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work is original, demonstrating that a specialized parameterization can yield better theoretical and empirical results compared to general black-box models.
- The parameterization is not overly restrictive, as it can recover various types of functions, making the method broadly applicable in the field.
- The inclusion of automated uncertainty quantification through conformal prediction enhances practical adoption, particularly in medical applications.

Weaknesses:
- Clarity is a significant drawback; the contribution and context of the work are not well articulated, making it difficult to discern the exact contribution and the missing elements in the field.
- The mathematical formalization and notation are challenging to follow, leading to confusion regarding the estimands and functional forms.
- The experimental evaluation lacks sufficient baseline comparisons, with concerns about the redundancy of certain baselines and the limited scope of conformal prediction analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by reorganizing sections to clearly outline previous work and the specific contributions of their method. The problem statement should explicitly define the estimands being targeted. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify how the functional form incorporates "compositionality" of interventions. To enhance the experimental section, consider including more diverse baselines beyond GRU-2 and moving the analysis of conformal prediction to the main text. Lastly, addressing the notation and mathematical formalization will significantly aid reader comprehension.
