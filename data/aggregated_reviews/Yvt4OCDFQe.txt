### Key Points
This paper presents three approaches to few-shot learning using a Quantum Denoising Diffusion Model (QDDM): (1) LGGI, which trains a QDDM with few-shot samples to generate synthetic samples for dataset augmentation before training a quantum neural network (QNN) for classification; (2) LGNAI, which employs a trained noise predictor network to predict labels by matching predicted and actual noise; and (3) LGDI, which denoises images using the trained noise predictor and extracts labels by measuring differences between the denoised and true images. The authors demonstrate improved performance over direct training of QNN with few-shot samples.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed methods are intuitive and mathematically rigorous.  
- The numerical experiments on datasets like MNIST show robustness of the framework.  

Weaknesses:  
- There is a lack of explanation for the performance improvements of the proposed methods, particularly in more complex tasks.  
- The performance drop on actual quantum computers compared to simulations is significant.  
- Key details, such as specifications of the QNN and the number of qubits used, are missing.  
- There is no comparison with classical methods, leaving the advantages of quantum components unclear.  
- Concerns regarding the trainability of the quantum dense architecture and the issue of barren plateaus are not addressed.  
- The scalability and computational cost of the LGNAI and LGDI methods are inadequately discussed.  
- The absence of error bars in figures limits understanding of result variability.  
- Lack of anonymized source code restricts reproducibility and transparency.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their explanations regarding the performance of the proposed methods, particularly in relation to more complex tasks. It is essential to address the significant performance drop observed on actual quantum computers. The authors should include specifications of the quantum neural network and the number of qubits used for QDDM training to enhance readability. A comparison with classical methods is necessary to clarify the advantages of the quantum approach. Additionally, addressing the trainability of the quantum dense architecture and the issue of barren plateaus would strengthen the paper. The authors should provide more information on the scalability and computational cost of the LGNAI and LGDI methods. Including error bars in figures 8-12 is crucial for understanding result variability. Finally, providing anonymized source code would significantly enhance the transparency and impact of the study.
