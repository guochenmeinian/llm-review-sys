Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SeqComm, a novel multi-level communication framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) that enables asynchronous coordination among agents through two communication phases: negotiation and launching. The authors prove that the policies learned through this framework guarantee monotonic improvement and convergence. The empirical evaluation on the StarCraft multi-agent challenge v2 (SMACv2) demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods, addressing the coordination problem by allowing agents to communicate their actions and dynamically determine decision-making priorities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces an innovative communication scheme that significantly enhances coordination in multi-agent settings.
- It provides a solid theoretical foundation with rigorous proofs for policy improvement and convergence.
- The empirical evaluation is comprehensive, showing consistent performance improvements across multiple maps in SMACv2.
- Detailed ablation studies validate the importance of dynamic decision priority determination.
- The method addresses both full and local communication scenarios, making it relevant for real-world applications.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on homogeneous agents with parameter sharing may limit applicability in diverse real-world scenarios.
- There is insufficient discussion on the computational complexity introduced by the multi-level communication scheme, particularly in large-scale systems.
- The paper lacks a thorough analysis of the sensitivity to hyperparameters and the potential for deadlocks in the asynchronous mechanism.
- Limited comparisons with more recent state-of-the-art multi-agent communication methods beyond TarMAC reduce the robustness of the evaluation.
- The absence of accompanying code undermines reproducibility and fairness compared to other submissions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the computational complexity of SeqComm, particularly in relation to the number of agents and the negotiation phase. It would be beneficial to include a sensitivity analysis regarding hyperparameters, such as the number of sampling trajectories (F) and the length of predicted future trajectories (H). Additionally, we suggest that the authors address the potential for deadlocks in the asynchronous mechanism and provide measures to prevent or resolve them. Expanding the evaluation to include comparisons with more recent MARL communication algorithms would strengthen the paper. Finally, we urge the authors to include the code with the submission to enhance reproducibility and comply with NeurIPS guidelines.
