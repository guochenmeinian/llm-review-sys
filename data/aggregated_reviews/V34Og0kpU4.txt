### Key Points
This paper presents GEES, a demand response system designed to manage edge servers for web services in edge computing while incorporating differential geo-obfuscation. The authors claim that GEES significantly reduces energy consumption while safeguarding users' location information. Through various experiments, they demonstrate that GEES achieves satisfactory location privacy protection and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in energy efficiency. The paper also explores the trade-off between user location privacy and energy savings, providing a well-motivated solution to a relevant problem in cloud and edge computing.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The topic is timely and addresses critical issues in energy consumption and user privacy in edge computing.
2. The problem formulation and proposed solutions are well-articulated, with a clear demonstration of the need for GEES.
3. The paper is well-written, accessible to non-experts, and includes a solid theoretical analysis along with experimental validation.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the methods, particularly the DDP algorithm's reliance on Particle Swarm Optimization, is not clearly distinguished.
2. Mathematical formulations lack rigor and clarity, hindering reader comprehension.
3. Graphical representations, especially in Figures 6 and 8, are ambiguous and could lead to misinterpretation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and rigor of the mathematical formulations, ensuring that all notations are consistent and precise. Additionally, we suggest revising the graphical representations to enhance readability and comprehension, particularly in Figures 6 and 8. It would also be beneficial to provide a detailed threat model addressing potential attacks on the privacy enhancements proposed. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the strategies of users and edge servers in the game described in Section 3.1 to enhance understanding. Lastly, consider validating GEES through a prototype to assess its performance in real-world scenarios.
