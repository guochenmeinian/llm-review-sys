### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for inference on Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) by approximating the posterior with a normalizing flow over positive semi-definite (PSD) matrices. The authors propose a method for inferring conditional independencies in a Gaussian model, utilizing a Bayesian approach with a pseudo-distribution based on the p-norm. The method employs variational inference and normalizing flows to enhance posterior approximation accuracy, with a temperature parameter allowing interpolation between Bayesian and MAP solutions. Additionally, the work addresses structure learning in GGMs using sub-l1 pseudo norms to penalize dense precision metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The innovative use of normalizing flows for GGM inference merges advantages from Bayesian and frequentist approaches.
- The framework for GGM estimation appears novel, with solid supporting mathematics.
- The proposed method is flexible, accommodating a wide range of prior and likelihood functions.
- The paper is well-written and includes illustrative toy experiments.

Weaknesses:
- There is a significant lack of comparison between the proposed framework and established methods, particularly the graphical lasso with concave approximations of the l0-norm.
- The experimental section is weak, focusing on a single real problem without comparisons to other related methods.
- The authors have not adequately addressed the limitations of their approach, and the empirical evaluation is limited in scope.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including comparisons with established methods, such as iterative reweighted l1-norm for graphical lasso, to evaluate the performance of their proposed framework. Additionally, the authors should discuss the limitations of their approach more thoroughly. It would also be beneficial to clarify the use of the letter "p" for both probability density and norm parameter to avoid confusion. Lastly, addressing the scalability and computational cost of the proposed method would enhance the paper's contribution.
