Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SynCx, a fully convolutional recurrent complex-valued autoencoder designed for unsupervised object discovery. The authors propose a novel approach that utilizes complex weights and phase information to enhance feature binding through recurrence, allowing for improved object separation. The model utilizes recurrence and complex-valued weights for object-centric learning and is evaluated on standard datasets, though it has not been tested on specially constructed stimuli. The recurrent dynamics are applied only to the phase component, raising questions about the potential benefits of a closed-loop recurrence that incorporates both phase and magnitude. The authors clarify that their design choices are not intended to be biologically plausible and address concerns regarding the modReLU activation function, ensuring that the magnitude remains non-negative. The paper discusses initialization strategies and the performance of their model compared to baselines, emphasizing its efficiency in terms of parameters and training time. Additionally, the authors discuss synchrony-based and slot-based models as complementary strategies for addressing the binding problem in artificial neural networks and clarify their use of t-SNE for non-linear dimensionality reduction rather than clustering.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The writing is clear and the paper is well-structured, making it accessible and easy to follow.
- The introduction of complex weights is well-motivated and contributes positively to the synchrony-based binding models.
- SynCx shows competitive performance against existing methods while avoiding reliance on color cues and additional training heuristics.
- The model demonstrates innovative use of complex-valued weights and recurrence for object-centric learning.
- The authors provide detailed responses to reviewer comments, clarifying technical aspects and addressing concerns about model performance and initialization.
- The paper highlights the computational efficiency of the proposed model compared to existing baselines.
- The authors effectively clarify the use of t-SNE and the generalization of their visualization procedure.
- The model architecture is well-documented, with plans for comparative analysis against baselines.
- The focus on perceptual grouping is acknowledged and addressed.

Weaknesses:
- The justification for using complex weights over real weights is insufficient, especially given prior neuroscience evidence supporting real weights.
- The evaluation pipeline lacks clarity, particularly regarding the relationship between object assignment and phase map visualization, which raises questions about the model's binding capabilities.
- The comparison of SynCx with baseline models is questionable due to the increased number of parameters from complex weights, and the performance metrics need further scrutiny.
- The reliance on color cues remains a significant limitation, and the model's generalizability to naturalistic stimuli is uncertain.
- There is inconsistency in the visualization and clustering procedures, leading to confusion regarding the representation of phase values.
- The reliance on color cues in visualizations raises questions about the model's robustness, particularly in grayscale scenarios.
- The model, despite having fewer parameters, does not consistently outperform baselines in reconstruction and object separation.
- There is a lack of exploration into adding layers to enhance model performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the use of complex weights by addressing the concerns raised regarding their alignment with neuroscience evidence. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the evaluation pipeline to ensure that object assignment and phase map visualization are derived from the same decoder layer and clustering algorithms. It would be beneficial to include comparisons with earlier models outside the synchrony-based family to better contextualize SynCx's performance. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore the implications of using a closed-loop recurrence that incorporates both phase and magnitude, as this may align more closely with biological processes. We also recommend improving the clarity of the visualization and clustering procedures, ensuring consistency in how phase values are represented across different plots. Addressing the limitations related to color reliance and providing clearer guidance on the optimal number of iterations for varying object counts would strengthen the manuscript. Lastly, we suggest that the authors explore the impact of adding more layers to their architecture to better compete with the baselines and provide actionable insights into perceptual grouping that could enhance the scientific contributions of their work.
