Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents RegBN, a novel approach for normalizing multimodal data to mitigate unwanted variability and bias. The authors propose a non-parametric regularization technique utilizing the Frobenius norm to enhance cross-modality consistency, allowing models to identify underlying patterns. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of RegBN across various datasets and research areas.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written.
- Extensive performance evaluations demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed approach across multiple recent multimodal methods and seven datasets.
- The topic of mitigating variability and bias in multimodal data is significant, and the proposed method offers a fresh perspective on improving reliability in multimodal learning.

Weaknesses:
- The method's novelty is questioned, as it resembles l2 regression with Frobenius norm regularization, and L-BFGS is a commonly used optimization technique.
- There is insufficient exploration of cross-modal consistency, which is crucial for multimodal model performance.
- The authors should provide more discussion on the relationship between RegBN and existing methods like DRO, as well as clarify the assumptions regarding confounding factors.
- Comparisons with competitive normalization methods, such as layer norm and group norm, are lacking.
- The choice of datasets may be excessive; focusing on two or three could yield more impactful results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their method by providing clearer distinctions from existing techniques like l2 regression and L-BFGS. Additionally, the authors should enhance the discussion on cross-modal consistency and its relevance to the proposed method. It would be beneficial to include comparisons with competitive normalization methods and clarify the relationship between RegBN and DRO. We also suggest focusing on a smaller number of datasets to strengthen the analysis and consider providing a synthetic multimodal dataset for thorough evaluation. Lastly, addressing minor ambiguities in notation and ensuring clarity in figures and captions will enhance the overall presentation.
