### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of 12 areas of bias that can affect the judgment of LLMs in various content types. The authors propose the CALM framework, which quantifies these biases through principle-guided modifications to test responses. The empirical results demonstrate the presence of biases across state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT and GPT-4, highlighting their vulnerability in tasks requiring emotional judgment. The study contributes to the understanding of bias in AI decision-making, emphasizing the cognitive and philosophical nature of these biases.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-structured and provides compelling evidence regarding biases in LLMs.  
- The introduction effectively contextualizes the research within the rise of LLM usage and its implications for AI integrity.  
- The categorization of biases, particularly verbosity and sentiment bias, reflects a strong theoretical contribution.  
- The CALM framework offers a novel, automated methodology for quantifying biases, enhancing reproducibility.  
- The findings underscore the challenges of achieving neutrality in LLM judgments.

Weaknesses:  
- The introduction lacks a deeper discussion of the social and ethical implications of biased judgments in sensitive domains.  
- The methodology requires further clarification on the principle-guided modifications to enhance transparency.  
- The paper could benefit from a more comprehensive comparison to earlier benchmarks to assess progress in bias mitigation.  
- Ethical considerations are briefly mentioned but need expansion to address real-world implications of biases in LLM applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by discussing how biases in LLM judgments might contribute to social injustices in areas like hiring, law, and healthcare. Additionally, we suggest providing a clearer explanation of the principle-guided modifications in an appendix to enhance reproducibility. The authors should also consider comparing their results to earlier benchmarks to better illustrate progress in bias mitigation. Expanding the ethical considerations section to address the societal impacts of biased judgments would strengthen the paper. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore alternative terminology, such as "pathologies," to describe the biases, as this may provide a clearer understanding of the underlying mechanisms affecting model outputs.
