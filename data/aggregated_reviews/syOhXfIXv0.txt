### Key Points
This paper presents Coover, an automatic approach for assessing cookie compliance by analyzing cookie values, which the authors argue is a more reliable indicator of purpose than traditional attributes. Coover employs fine-tuned GPT-3.5 for cookie classification, achieving an F1 score of 0.95, and highlights significant non-compliance with GDPR regulations among Alexa's Top 1k websites. The research addresses a gap in cookie compliance evaluation and introduces a manually curated dataset of 51,144 cookies and 118,363 segments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The introduction of Coover as a novel framework for cookie compliance analysis.  
2. The empirical evaluation demonstrates strong performance metrics.  
3. The dataset created is valuable for future research and highlights widespread non-compliance.

Weaknesses:  
1. Potential dataset bias and lack of transparency regarding the dataset and method code hinder reproducibility.  
2. The evaluation relies heavily on manually labeled data, which may not scale effectively.  
3. The paper does not address ethical concerns related to automated compliance analysis or the applicability of Coover to less structured websites.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the transparency of their dataset and method code to facilitate reproducibility in future studies. Additionally, addressing potential biases in the dataset and discussing how Coover would cope with real-world applications where cookies frequently change would strengthen the paper. We also suggest that the authors consider the ethical implications of automating compliance checks and explore comparisons with simpler, more interpretable models for cookie classification.
