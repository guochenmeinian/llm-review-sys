### Key Points
This paper presents a TWD-based method that automatically selects useful word embeddings during a tree approximation of Wasserstein distance. The authors propose an entropy algorithm to address the discriminative feature group selection problem, demonstrating effectiveness and efficiency. However, the experimental results raise concerns, particularly regarding the use of different baselines for effectiveness and efficiency testing, and the performance of TWD-GFS with Clustertree compared to Quadtree.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The TWD-based method effectively addresses the discriminative feature group selection problem.  
- The paper provides substantial performance gains over prior approaches in calculating word-mover's distance, particularly in high-dimensional settings.  
- The originality of the approach and its empirical results are noted as significant contributions.

Weaknesses:  
- The experimental results are not entirely convincing due to the use of different baselines for effectiveness and efficiency testing.  
- The technical contribution is limited, as the feature selection relies on pre-defined groups, restricting broader applicability.  
- There are gaps between the performance of the targeting task and the feature selection problem, raising questions about the method's efficacy in document distance applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their experimental design by consistently using the same baselines for effectiveness and efficiency testing, specifically including FROT and SRW in Table 2. Additionally, the authors should provide a detailed explanation of why TWD-GFS with Clustertree performs worse than with Quadtree. It would also be beneficial to clarify how feature groups are set up in synthetic experiments and to address the choice of eta values for synthetic data. Finally, we suggest comparing tree-construction and training time for TWD-GFS with cost matrix calculation time for other methods across different datasets and feature groups.
