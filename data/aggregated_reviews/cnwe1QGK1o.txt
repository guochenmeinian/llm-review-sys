### Key Points
This paper presents RecipFL, a federated learning framework addressing resource-skew scenarios where a few powerful devices coexist with numerous weaker ones. The authors propose a graph hypernetwork to generate weights for heterogeneous client models, enabling meaningful contributions from weak devices and incentivizing strong devices to participate in federated learning. The paper establishes a generalization bound for RecipFL and validates its effectiveness through extensive experiments across various tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper tackles a critical problem in federated learning related to resource skewness.
2. The proposed framework is innovative and model-agnostic, enhancing collaboration among diverse neural network models.
3. Comprehensive experimental analysis supports the framework's robustness.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a detailed explanation of how the hypernetwork generates personalized weights for client models.
2. The evaluation is limited to scenarios with 1 or 2 strong devices, lacking justification for this focus and not addressing a broader range of practical cases.
3. The datasets used for evaluation are small and not practical, with insufficient discussion on their adequacy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of how the hypernetwork generates personalized weights for client models, including whether pre-training is required and the specific training procedures involved. Additionally, we suggest expanding the evaluation to include a wider range of scenarios with varying distributions of strong and weak devices to assess generalizability. The authors should also provide more comprehensive information about the datasets used, including their relevance and adequacy for the study. Furthermore, addressing the complexity of implementing the graph hypernetwork and its implications for real-world applicability would enhance the paper's usability.
