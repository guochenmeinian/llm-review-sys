### Key Points
This paper presents a study on how LLMs understand unanswerable questions, exploring three approaches: (1) prompt manipulation, which provides hints about unanswerability, significantly improving detection rates; (2) beam relaxation, which identifies cues in generated outputs, showing that larger beam sizes enhance performance, although the top output's quality does not improve; and (3) linear classification using SVM on the first generated token, demonstrating the possibility of linearly separating answerable from unanswerable questions. The authors validate their findings across three datasets (Squad 2, Natural Questions, and MuSiQue), achieving unanswerable question detection accuracy between 75% and 92% without degrading overall task performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a significant problem and provides a thorough analysis using three distinct approaches and datasets.
2. The linear separation method and its visualization are particularly noteworthy.
3. The proposed methods could potentially reduce hallucinations in LLM outputs.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper's scope is limited to contexts where answers are found solely within the provided passage, which should be clarified.
2. The different approaches are not compared, and the reasons for the poorer performance in few-shot settings compared to zero-shot are unclear.
3. The effectiveness of beam relaxation with or without hints is not specified.
4. The reliance on specific keywords for the first two approaches is inadequately discussed, suggesting that a simple classifier using these keywords could enhance result reliability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors clarify the constraints of their study regarding the context of answers.
2. The authors should compare the different approaches directly and provide insights into the performance discrepancies between few-shot and zero-shot settings.
3. We suggest that the authors specify whether beam relaxation is conducted with or without hints.
4. The authors should elaborate on the impact of keyword selection on their results and consider implementing a classifier based on these keywords to improve reliability.
5. Please address the numerous typos and grammatical issues throughout the paper.
