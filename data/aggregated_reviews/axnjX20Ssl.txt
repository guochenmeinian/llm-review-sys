Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for improving geometry reconstruction through a view-consistent Depth-Normal (D-Normal) regularizer that couples normal with geometric parameters, allowing for the optimization of all parameters from monocular normal priors. The authors argue that their approach effectively updates all parameters (rotation, scale, and position) compared to previous methods, which primarily update only rotation and scale. They propose a densification and splitting strategy to enhance the size and distribution of 3D Gaussian distributions, leading to improved surface modeling. The paper also includes a theoretical analysis of the influence of normal maps on the optimization of Gaussian positions, asserting that the gradient with respect to position is independent of the normal direction. Experimental results indicate that the method achieves better reconstruction quality and faster training speeds compared to existing methods like 3DGS and 2DGS, particularly in challenging scenarios such as textureless scenes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The proposed Depth-Normal regularizer effectively utilizes monocular normal priors in 3DGS-based reconstruction and demonstrates significant improvements in reconstruction quality and rendering speed across multiple datasets.  
2. The authors provide a comprehensive analysis of their D-Normal formulation, supported by detailed mathematical proofs, demonstrating its advantages over traditional methods.  
3. The proposed geometrically meaningful confidence term and densification strategy are innovative contributions that address existing limitations in Gaussian-based methods.  
4. The paper is well-written and presents its concepts clearly, making it easy to follow.

Weaknesses:  
1. The contributions appear limited, as the core idea of combining depth normals and rendered normals for supervision closely resembles existing works, such as 2DGS and Gaussian Surfels, which are not adequately referenced.  
2. The theoretical basis for the claims regarding the independence of normal supervision from Gaussian position updates is contested, with reviewers expressing concerns about its accuracy.  
3. The justification for using monocular priors lacks clarity, and some reviewers suggest that simpler regularization methods could yield comparable results.  
4. The paper does not sufficiently differentiate its contributions from concurrent works, leading to questions about its originality and necessity for comparison.  
5. There is skepticism about the effectiveness of normal map supervision in updating Gaussian positions, suggesting that some claims in the paper may require refinement or justification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related work, particularly addressing the similarities with 2DGS and Gaussian Surfels, and provide appropriate citations. Additionally, the authors should clarify the limitations of monocular normal priors and discuss the oversmoothing issue observed in the DTU results. We suggest that the authors improve the theoretical justification for their claims regarding the independence of normal supervision from Gaussian position updates, addressing the concerns raised by reviewers. Furthermore, the authors should provide a clearer motivation for the use of monocular priors, especially in dense view settings, and consider focusing on more challenging datasets to demonstrate the robustness of their method. Finally, we encourage the authors to include a detailed discussion of how their work differs from concurrent methods, emphasizing unique contributions to strengthen their submission.
