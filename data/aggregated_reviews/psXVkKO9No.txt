### Key Points
This paper presents Self-AIXI, an extension of the universal Bayes-optimal agent (AIXI), which integrates self-prediction with reinforcement learning rather than planning. The authors provide theoretical evidence that Self-AIXI inherits optimality properties from AIXI, demonstrating that it converges to the same policies as AIXI. The main contribution lies in the theoretical analysis of this self-predicting agent within universal, Bayes-optimal frameworks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and theoretically sound, with extensive theoretical analysis supporting all claims.
- It introduces a self-predicting agent that could lead to practical approximations of AIXI, providing a potential direction for future research in universal AI.

Weaknesses:
- The overall contribution appears limited, as Self-AIXI inherits its optimality from AIXI without clear motivation for increasing complexity through reinforcement learning.
- The paper lacks direct practical applications and does not clearly connect empirical discussions with theoretical work, leaving the significance of the proposed methods ambiguous.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for the complexity introduced by incorporating reinforcement learning instead of planning. Additionally, the related work section could be expanded to better relate to Self-AIXI. We suggest providing a more extensive explanation of Table 1 and clarifying the connection between empirical claims and theoretical results, particularly by formally defining terms like "learning" and "self-prediction" within the framework of reinforcement learning. Finally, including preliminary results towards a concrete algorithm could enhance the practical relevance of the work.
