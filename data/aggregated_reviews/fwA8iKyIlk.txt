### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to automatic text simplification (ATS) by focusing on elaborative simplification, which adds content to improve clarity. The authors utilize the Question Under Discussion (QUD) framework to model elaborations as answers to implicit questions. They introduce the ElabQUD corpus, which expands on previous work by including 2878 questions linked to 1299 elaborations. The authors investigate whether generating QUDs can enhance elaboration generation, demonstrating that access to QUDs significantly aids in producing coherent elaborations, although challenges remain, particularly with masked elaborations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a neglected aspect of ATS, emphasizing content addition for simplification.
- The methodology is convincing, with rigorous resource building and evaluations combining both automatic and manual assessments.
- The exploration of the QUD framework is innovative and well-executed, contributing valuable insights to the field.

Weaknesses:
- The focus on a specific issue may limit the broader impact of the findings on ATS performance.
- There is a lack of discussion regarding the risk of hallucinations in elaborations, particularly since some elaborations involve explanations that may not be directly supported by the text.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the risk of hallucinations in elaborations, especially given the potential for LLMs like GPT-3 to generate misleading information. Addressing this issue could enhance the depth of the paper and provide a clearer understanding of the limitations of their approach. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the definitions of focus and topic structure in the context of elaboration, as this may be of interest to the QUD community.
