Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an ML-based method to address districting problems by converting them into a capacitated minimum spanning tree (CMST) problem, subsequently applying a learning to optimize approach through imitation learning. The authors propose a decision-aware learning framework utilizing graph neural networks (GNN) and the Fenchel-Young loss, demonstrating improved performance over existing methods. Extensive numerical studies provide valuable insights, although the paper's focus on a specific problem class limits broader applicability discussions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The mapping from districting to a minimum spanning tree problem is elegantly justified.
- The numerical studies are well-designed, particularly the analysis of model generalizability.
- The connection between CMST and districting enhances the understanding of decision-aware learning.
- The structured approach yields high-quality solutions for large districting problems.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks connections to other problem classes and broader applicability discussions.
- Missing discussions and comparisons with benchmarks from the operations research community, particularly regarding closed-form approximations for uniformly distributed demands.
- Insufficient explanation of the technical contributions related to GNN compared to existing work.
- The datasets used are small, and the performance metrics are limited to 'cost' without exploring traditional districting metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the broader applicability of their method beyond the specific problem class addressed. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with relevant benchmarks from the operations research community, particularly regarding closed-form approximations. Clarifying the technical contributions of the GNN methodology in relation to existing work would enhance the paper's rigor. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore and report on traditional districting performance metrics and the efficiency of their method.
