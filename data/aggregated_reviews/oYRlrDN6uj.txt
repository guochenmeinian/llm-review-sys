### Key Points
This paper presents a Transformer variant that aims to preserve similarities in token representations across layers by replacing the traditional attention mechanism with an orthogonal decomposition \(XU\Sigma V\). The authors argue that this approach ensures injective mappings and low entropy in representations. They validate their method through extensive experiments on various language model benchmarks, demonstrating improved performance and providing an analysis of multi-head self-attention from a statistical physics perspective.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-motivated and addresses an interesting question regarding the preservation of token similarity across layers.
- The proposed method shows promising results and contributes to the understanding of attention mechanisms in Transformers.

Weaknesses:
- The organization of the paper is loose, and the connection between theory and methods is unclear. There is excessive redundant material, particularly between lines 95 and 114.
- The key assumption that token similarity remains consistent across layers may not hold for all NLP tasks, and the actual contributions of the paper are not clearly articulated.
- The paper lacks a comprehensive ablation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of each component, and the baselines used for comparison are weak.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization of the paper to clarify the correspondence between their theoretical claims and practical methods. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed ablation study to substantiate the contributions of each component. It would be beneficial to address the validity of their key assumption regarding token similarity across layers and clarify the practical implications of maintaining consistent distances between tokens. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors analyze the reasons behind the claimed improvements in speed and parameter efficiency, and provide a clearer justification for the necessity of Lipschitz continuity in their model.
