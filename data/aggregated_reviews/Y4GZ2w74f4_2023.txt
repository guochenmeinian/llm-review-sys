Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents VisIT-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating instruction-following visual large language models (LLMs). It consists of approximately 700 vision-language instructions across 70 instruction families, offering human-verified reference outputs and an Elo-based ranking system for multimodal chatbots. The evaluation demonstrates that Elo rankings align closely with human assessments, highlighting the benchmark's reliability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. VisIT-Bench introduces a unique and open benchmark dataset that effectively evaluates instruction-following capabilities of vision-language models through diverse and challenging test examples.
2. The incorporation of both automatic and Elo-based human evaluations enhances the trustworthiness of the results.
3. The dataset construction process is reasonable, with detailed dense captions and verified outputs that improve evaluation accuracy.

Weaknesses:
1. The data size of VisIT-Bench is relatively small compared to other benchmarks, which may limit its comprehensiveness.
2. The term "dynamic" in the context of the benchmark is ambiguous, as it suggests an evolving dataset, which is not the case.
3. Concerns exist regarding the evaluation method, particularly the reliance on GPT-4, which shows only about 70% agreement with human evaluations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the term "dynamic" by explicitly stating that it refers to the Elo-leaderboard's adaptability rather than the dataset's content. Additionally, the authors should provide more detailed information on the annotation process for dense captions and clarify how spatial relations are addressed in the evaluations. It would also be beneficial to include a cost estimate for conducting evaluations using GPT-4, as well as to elaborate on the recommended evaluation methodâ€”whether to use references or not. Lastly, addressing the limitations related to the small dataset size compared to other benchmarks would strengthen the paper.
