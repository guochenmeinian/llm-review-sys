### Key Points
This paper presents the *Keep on Swimming* (KoS) adversarial attack method for multi-model systems, focusing on scenarios where attackers have limited access. The authors demonstrate that their approach achieves higher attack success rates with smaller perturbations compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly when targeting the second model in a two-model pipeline. The method is described as reproducible and effectively articulated, with a clear algorithmic framework.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- High attack success rates, showing substantial improvement over previous methods.
- The method is reproducible, with detailed descriptions of datasets and models used.
- Clear articulation of the algorithm, making it easy to understand.

Weaknesses:
- Experiments are limited to a single dataset of only 20 samples, raising concerns about robustness.
- Lack of clarity on the application of the method to real-world models and existing adversarial defenses.
- Insufficient theoretical analysis of the KoS algorithm.
- The method is slower than baseline approaches due to its iterative nature, with little discussion of this drawback.
- The novelty is questioned as the approach primarily combines existing techniques.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental design by including a larger and more diverse dataset to strengthen the validity of their findings. Additionally, providing quantitative evidence to support claims about smaller perturbations would enhance the paper's credibility. Clarifying the nature of the attacks (targeted vs. untargeted) and exploring the method's applicability to other multi-modal systems would also be beneficial. Furthermore, addressing the slower performance of the KoS method compared to baseline approaches and including a formal theoretical analysis would significantly enhance the paper's depth. Lastly, we suggest relabeling the "Keep on Swimming ISDP" method in Table 1 as "KoS ISDP (Ours)" for clarity regarding the authors' contributions.
