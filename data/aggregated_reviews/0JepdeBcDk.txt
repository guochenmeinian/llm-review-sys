### Key Points
This paper presents a method for measuring feature attributions in Siamese encoders, extending the integrated gradients approach proposed by Sundararajan et al. (2017). The authors introduce "integrated jacobians" to summarize feature interactions between input pairs, allowing for token-to-token attributions. The method is empirically validated through experiments on various models, demonstrating its applicability in practice, particularly for fine-tuning pretrained transformers.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The extension of integrated gradients to Siamese settings is thorough and well-justified.
- The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation and practical demonstrations of the method's effectiveness.
- Various analyses comparing multiple layers and properties are included.

Weaknesses:
- The method appears limited to sequence-to-sequence settings, raising questions about its broader applicability.
- Experimental details are insufficiently described, making it difficult to fully understand the results and methodology.
- There is a lack of evidence regarding the faithfulness of computed pair-wise feature attributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental setup by providing more detailed descriptions of the models and datasets used. Specifically, clarify the meaning of terms such as "labels" and "vanilla transformers" in Table 1, and ensure that figures and tables are adequately explained in the main text. Additionally, we suggest addressing the ambiguity in the description of the error as a function of N and ensuring that all relevant figures are included in the main body of the paper. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore the applicability of their method to a wider range of architectures beyond Siamese encoders.
