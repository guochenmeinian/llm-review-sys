### Key Points
This paper adapts a retrieval-based Levenshtein Transformer (LevT) to utilize translation memory, proposing TM3-LevT. The main contributions include introducing a combination layer in LevT, employing a maximal cover policy instead of Levenshtein distance, and proposing a simplified method for aligning TM matches to target sentences to determine edit policy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The simplified alignment approach in Section 4.2 is interesting, leveraging the small number of n-way TM matches.
- The paper rigorously compares the proposed architecture against various models, highlighting limitations and suggesting methods to overcome them.
- The novelty of combining multiple fuzzy matches for translation is a significant contribution.

Weaknesses:
- The simplified alignment method is challenging in machine translation; comparing it to established IBM models would strengthen the paper.
- Evaluation is limited to WMT14, which is generally criticized, though it may be justified in this context. However, comparisons to the EN-DE portion with a dictionary were absent.
- The complexity of the framework and the strength of the baseline model raise concerns about the clarity and effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the technical details, particularly in explaining the modifications to the original LevT model and the combination operation. Providing a detailed example in the appendix could enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest comparing the proposed alignment method to established IBM models to validate its effectiveness. To strengthen the evaluation, consider including results from additional language pairs and ensuring that the baseline model incorporates fuzzy matches. Finally, addressing the notation and presentation issues throughout the paper will improve readability.
