### Key Points
This paper presents a methodology that combines fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and quantum federated learning (QFL) to enhance privacy preservation in federated learning. Fully homomorphic encryption allows clients to securely communicate updates to encrypted model weights, enabling cooperative training without exposing local data. Quantum federated learning offers improved computational efficiency and additional privacy benefits. However, the paper lacks clarity on how the benefits of FHE and quantum neural networks synergistically enhance privacy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The integration of FHE and QFL presents a novel approach to privacy preservation in federated learning.  
- The methodology allows for secure updates and cooperative training without compromising local data.

Weaknesses:  
- Insufficient analysis on how FHE and quantum neural networks work together to provide additional privacy benefits.  
- The paper does not adequately assess or discuss the combined advantages of using FHE with quantum neural networks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of how fully homomorphic encryption and quantum neural networks interact to enhance privacy benefits. A detailed discussion on the synergistic effects of this combination is essential, as it is a key contribution of the paper.
