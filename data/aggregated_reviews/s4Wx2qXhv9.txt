Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents two statistical innovations to enhance standard randomized smoothing: the use of a randomized Clopper-Pearson interval, which marginally increases the certified radius, and an improvement in sample efficiency through confidence sequences, achieving a roughly 2x speedup over existing methods. The authors propose sample-efficient methods for computing probabilistic robustness certificates, allowing adaptive determination of sample sizes based on a certification radius \( r \) and significance level \( \alpha \). The methods demonstrate a reduction in sample consumption by 1.5â€“3 times compared to prior work.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work leverages interesting statistical techniques to improve randomized smoothing, enhancing both certified radius and sample efficiency.
- The methods are original, importing statistical techniques not previously applied in this context, and are well-motivated with generally sound theory and experiments.
- The proposed algorithms for adaptively determining sample sizes are simple to implement, potentially encouraging broader adoption.

Weaknesses:
- The paper contains grammatical and structural errors, necessitating careful proofreading.
- The union-bound and betting-based confidence sequences yield similar results, raising questions about the necessity of including both.
- The flow of the paper is poor, making it difficult to follow; better transitions between sections are needed.
- The complexity of the proposed approaches does not seem to justify the relatively minimal improvements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the manuscript by addressing grammatical issues and enhancing the flow between sections. Specifically, they should clarify the necessity of both confidence sequences and provide a more concrete explanation of the bounds mentioned on line 189. Additionally, we suggest revising Section 3 to better integrate the discussion of related work and results. The authors should also discuss limitations more thoroughly, including the applicability of their methods to different datasets and models.
