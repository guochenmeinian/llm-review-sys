### Key Points
This paper empirically studies the impact of optimization and regularization hyperparameters—weight-decay, dropout, and gradient-clipping—on post-training quantization (PTQ) performance of large language models (LLMs). The authors perform PTQ to int8 using simple affine scaling on a GPT-style architecture and find that increased regularization generally reduces performance degradation after quantization. At 52B parameters, the best hyperparameter settings yield a 0.26% average performance degradation, challenging the notion that activation outliers are an inherent property of LLMs. The authors compute various statistics of weights and activations, arguing these may provide insights into robustness against quantization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is mostly clearly written and easy to follow.
2. The problem setting is well motivated, highlighting the challenges of quantizing transformer-based language models.
3. The proposed method for mitigating performance drop due to quantization is straightforward—utilizing higher regularization levels—and the empirical result of 0.26% degradation is commendable compared to larger drops in other models.

Weaknesses:
1. The claim regarding outlier dimensions lacks clear establishment in the experiments, which primarily focus on zero-shot NLP tasks rather than defining the role of outliers in quantization performance.
2. The paper does not address the potential influence of different model architectures on quantized performance, leaving open the question of whether the methodology applies to architectures like OPT.
3. The interpretation of the 0.26% average degradation is unclear, as it seems impressive compared to a 42% drop in a comparable model but normal relative to other performance drops within the GPT-style model.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their claims regarding outlier dimensions by explicitly defining them early in the paper and providing a more detailed analysis of their role in quantization performance. Additionally, the authors should discuss the applicability of their methodology across different model architectures and provide a clearer context for the significance of the 0.26% performance degradation. Including quantitative comparisons to prior work and clarifying the experimental protocol would enhance the rigor and presentation of the study. Finally, a summary of the ablation studies related to the proposed training recipe would strengthen the paper's impact.
