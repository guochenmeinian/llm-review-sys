### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to domain adaptation using hypernetworks, specifically targeting scenarios where the target domain is not accessible during training. The authors propose three models (Hyper-DN, Hyper-DRF, Hyper-PADA) that leverage hypernetworks for parameter sharing at both domain and example levels. They introduce an example-based adaptation method that generates a "signature" for each input example, embedding it within the semantic space of the source domains. The extensive evaluation across sentiment analysis and natural language inference tasks demonstrates that these models outperform some naive baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and addresses a practical problem in domain adaptation.
- The innovative application of hypernetworks for parameter sharing in NLP is noteworthy.
- Extensive empirical evaluation across multiple domains and languages provides convincing evidence of the proposed approach's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for using hypernetworks is not sufficiently clear, with questions raised about why they enhance generalization.
- The methods are described as straightforward, and some arguments in the paper are weak or vague.
- The focus on classification tasks limits the applicability of the approach to other NLP tasks, and the reliance on large pretrained models raises concerns about computational efficiency.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind using hypernetworks, specifically addressing the intrinsic mechanisms that facilitate generalization. Additionally, the authors should provide more insights or experiments regarding the role of prompts in enhancing generalization. Expanding the evaluation to include other NLP tasks beyond classification could strengthen the paper. Furthermore, we suggest exploring alternative methods for learning shared and domain-specific aspects of the input, such as disentanglement, and providing more visualization and interpretability to validate the effectiveness of the hypernetwork. Lastly, we advise against placing significant findings in the appendix to enhance accessibility for reviewers.
