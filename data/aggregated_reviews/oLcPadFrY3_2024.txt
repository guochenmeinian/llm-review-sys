Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents AdaPKC, an adaptive radar semantic segmentation method that enhances the PeakConv (PKC) model by introducing adaptive peak receptive fields through two data-adaptive band-pass filtering mechanisms. The authors demonstrate AdaPKC's applicability in various radar perception scenarios, achieving improved performance in radar semantic segmentation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces an adaptive method for adjusting the peak receptive field, showing some innovation.
- Extensive experiments validate the method's performance, demonstrating significant improvements over strong baselines.
- The paper is well-written and includes rigorous ablation studies, providing solid evidence of the proposed method's efficacy.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of AdaPKC is limited, as it builds upon existing methods and shows only marginal performance improvements over PKC.
- Some figures, particularly Figure 1, lack clear explanations, and the captions for Figures 2 and 3 do not adequately summarize their contents.
- The evaluation does not address the model's computational efficiency or its performance in real-time applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Figure 1 by providing a detailed explanation of the content, specifically regarding the red and purple ellipses. Additionally, we suggest supplementing the captions for Figures 2 and 3 to enhance reader comprehension. The authors should also include an analysis of the computational efficiency of the model, detailing the added computational cost from the proposed modules. Furthermore, a comparison with dilated convolution techniques should be made to clarify the advantages of their method. Lastly, we encourage the authors to discuss the limitations of their approach, particularly regarding the applicability of AdaPKC to other baselines similar to PKC.
