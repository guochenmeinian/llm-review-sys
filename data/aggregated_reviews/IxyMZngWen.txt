### Key Points
This paper presents "DiscDiff," a novel latent diffusion model designed for generating synthetic DNA sequences by embedding these sequences into a continuous latent space using an autoencoder. The authors propose a new metric, Fr√©chet Reconstruction Distance (FReD), to evaluate the quality of the generated sequences. The work also contributes a significant dataset of promoter-gene sequences from various species, showcasing promising evaluations of the diffusion synthesis of DNA sequences.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and motivated, clearly formulating the proposed framework.
- The downstream research for the latent diffusion model is an attractive problem worthy of exploration.
- Creative metrics like FReD are introduced, enhancing the evaluation of generated sequences.
- The contribution of a cross-species dataset is significant.

Weaknesses:
- The authors should elaborate on the superiority of the framework compared to autoregressive-based generative models.
- The paper would benefit from utilizing pre-trained knowledge in open-sourced large generative models (e.g., StableDiffusion, GPT2) to boost performance.
- There is a need for clarification regarding chromatin markers mentioned in the paper.
- The evaluation of promoter-gene sequences could be stratified into promoter and gene body separately.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the advantages of DiscDiff over autoregressive-based generative models. Additionally, consider leveraging pre-trained models to enhance the framework's performance. It would also be beneficial to visualize the Sei embeddings of real and synthetic sequences using UMAP for better interpretability. Furthermore, the authors should analyze the sequence composition (e.g., GC content, k-mer composition) of real versus synthetic sequences and explore the application of designing enhancer sequences.
