### Key Points
This paper presents a method for personalized image generation, named AttnDreamBooth, which decomposes the personalization process into three training stages: embedding alignment, attention map refinement, and subject identity capture. The authors propose to address the limitations of existing methods, specifically Textual Inversion and DreamBooth, by enhancing identity preservation and text alignment in generated images. The effectiveness of their approach is demonstrated through qualitative and human evaluations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The manuscript is well-written and easy to understand.
- The proposed method effectively combines textual inversion and DreamBooth techniques, achieving competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods.
- The introduction of a super-category attention map for calibrating the attention map is an interesting contribution.

Weaknesses:
- Some sections are verbose, particularly the introduction, which reiterates points already made without adding new information.
- Important comparisons with existing methods, especially with Textual Inversion and DreamBooth, are lacking, as well as a comparison with recent advancements in the field.
- The proposed method incurs high computational costs, requiring 20 minutes for training on an NVIDIA A100, which is significantly longer than DreamBooth.
- The method appears to rely on a collection of techniques from existing methods, raising concerns about its originality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and conciseness of the manuscript by reducing redundancy in the introduction and ensuring that each section adds new insights. Additionally, we suggest including a detailed comparison with recent state-of-the-art methods, such as SuTI, Instruct Imagen, and HyperDreambooth, to contextualize the contributions of AttnDreamBooth. Furthermore, providing experimental results to support claims about the impact of retaining prior preservation loss would strengthen the paper. Lastly, addressing the high computational cost associated with the method would enhance its practicality for users.
