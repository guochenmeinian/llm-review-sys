### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive survey of narrative understanding tasks, including reading comprehension, summarization, and question answering, along with their associated datasets and evaluation measures. The authors propose a framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to estimate latent author thoughts using task descriptions and prompts, providing insights into future directions for narrative understanding.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a thorough survey and taxonomy of narrative understanding tasks, serving as a valuable resource for researchers.
- It presents a clear and accessible write-up, enhancing understanding for both new and experienced readers.
- The proposal of a Bayesian estimation approach for understanding the author's thoughts adds significant value.

Weaknesses:
- The broad scope may exceed the depth suitable for an 8-page conference paper, suggesting a need for a narrower focus or consideration for journal submission.
- The proposed framework lacks evaluations or practical implementations, leaving its effectiveness unproven.
- There is a need for a more fine-grained categorization of tasks and datasets, considering factors such as dataset size, annotation procedure, and domain.
- The absence of quantitative and qualitative studies limits objective comparisons among the discussed works, and the lack of a concrete task-specific example for the Bayesian estimation makes it difficult to understand its practical application.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the categorization of tasks and datasets by including factors such as dataset size, annotation procedure, and domain. Additionally, we suggest providing evaluations or practical implementations of the proposed framework to demonstrate its effectiveness. To enhance clarity, we encourage the inclusion of a task-specific example for the Bayesian estimation of the author's thoughts. Finally, consider narrowing the focus of the survey or expanding it into a comprehensive journal article to allow for more detailed analyses and discussions.
