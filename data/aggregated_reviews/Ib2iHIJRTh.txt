Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a generative model for global climate simulations by integrating the DYffusion framework with Spherical Fourier Neural Operators (SFNOs) to respect spherical earth geometry. The model demonstrates stable rollouts for 10-year climate simulations and outperforms existing machine learning baselines in accuracy and ensemble variability. The authors effectively utilize diffusion models to create a probabilistic climate emulator, addressing computational efficiency and the challenges of traditional physics-based models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper significantly advances machine learning applications in climate modeling, enhancing model accuracy and ensemble generation.
- It is well-written, making complex climate modeling concepts accessible to a broader audience.
- The combination of SFNOs and DYffusion is well-justified, focusing on stable rollouts and sampling efficiency.
- The evaluation includes relevant analyses, baselines, and metrics.

Weaknesses:
- The stochasticity introduced by MC dropout and Stochastic depth lacks clear motivation, raising questions about their appropriateness for representing atmospheric state distributions.
- The evaluation of climate variability in the ensemble primarily relies on Table 2, which lacks comparative spread metrics for the generative baselines, making context difficult to ascertain.
- Claims in the conclusion may overstate the model's capabilities, particularly regarding its applicability to climate change, given its stationary climate assumption and reliance on simulation data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for using MC dropout and Stochastic depth, possibly including an ablation study to clarify their contributions. Additionally, we suggest including spread metrics for the generative baselines in Table 2 to provide context for the proposed method's performance. It would also be beneficial to tone down the climate change-related conclusions to reflect the model's current limitations and clarify that it is trained on simulation data, which may introduce biases. Finally, we encourage the authors to include qualitative comparisons of generated fields to enhance understanding of the model's performance.
