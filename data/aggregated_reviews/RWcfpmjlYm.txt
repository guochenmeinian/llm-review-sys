Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents BanditPAM++, an enhanced algorithm for the k-medoids clustering problem, which aims to select k centers from data points to minimize the sum of distances to the nearest center. The authors propose improvements over the BanditPAM algorithm, specifically through the Virtual Arms technique and Permutation-Invariant Caching method, allowing BanditPAM++ to achieve the same solution as PAM with high probability while significantly reducing distance computations. Experimental results indicate that BanditPAM++ can be up to 10 times faster than BanditPAM on real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel algorithm that effectively combines techniques from multi-armed bandit literature with k-medoids clustering, resulting in substantial speed improvements.
- The theoretical guarantees support the claims of performance, and the experimental results demonstrate significant advantages in running time.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation of empirical results is confusing, with inconsistencies in method naming and discrepancies in runtime data across figures.
- The theoretical assumptions, particularly regarding the sub-Gaussian distribution and the maximum number of swap steps, are not adequately discussed, raising questions about their implications on the algorithm's performance.
- The evaluation is limited to two datasets, which may not sufficiently demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and consistency of the presentation, particularly in the empirical results section, by ensuring uniform naming conventions and addressing discrepancies in runtime data across figures. Additionally, we suggest including a table that summarizes the specific speedup values of BanditPAM++ over various dataset sizes and k values for clearer comparison. Furthermore, the authors should provide a more detailed discussion of the theoretical assumptions, particularly the implications of the sub-Gaussian distribution assumption and the maximum number of swap steps on the algorithm's results. Lastly, expanding the experimental evaluation to include more datasets would strengthen the paper's contributions.
