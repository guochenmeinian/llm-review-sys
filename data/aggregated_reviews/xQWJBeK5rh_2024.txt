Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the SICSM framework, which integrates Selective State Space Models (SSMs) with Generative Flow Networks (GFNs) to address structural inference challenges in dynamical systems with irregularly sampled trajectories and partial observations. SICSM utilizes SSMs to model input-dependent transition functions and GFNs to approximate the posterior distribution of the system's structure. The authors evaluate SICSM across multiple datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in inferring complex interactions in partially observed systems. Additionally, the paper enhances the JSP-GFN method by effectively compressing multi-dimensional trajectories into a one-dimensional form and incorporates additional regularization terms into the graph prior of the reward function, significantly improving the learning process. The authors also acknowledge the need for clearer terminology and notation in their illustrative examples, particularly regarding the dynamics of a system of balls and springs, and recognize the limitation of relying solely on synthetic datasets while exploring advanced synthetic data generation techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The integration of Selective SSMs with GFNs is a novel approach that effectively addresses significant challenges in structural inference for dynamical systems.  
- The incorporation of additional regularization terms enhances the learning process and addresses graph structure properties.  
- The adaptation of JSP-GFN to handle multi-dimensional trajectories is a notable advancement.  
- The research is thorough, with extensive evaluations across various datasets, enhancing the reliability of the findings.  
- The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with effective illustrations of methodologies and results.  
- SICSM has broad applicability in scientific discovery and system diagnostics, particularly in handling real-world complexities.

Weaknesses:  
- The implementation of SICSM is computationally intensive, potentially limiting accessibility and widespread adoption.  
- The paper lacks clarity regarding the novelty of its contributions and the interaction between its components, particularly the necessity of the GFN.  
- The evaluation is limited to one metric (AUROC), making it difficult to assess robustness, and comparisons to relevant methods like CUTS are absent.  
- The reliance on synthetic datasets is a significant limitation, as it may not fully represent real-world scenarios.  
- Initial clarity issues in the text may hinder understanding for some readers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding the novelty of their contributions and the interactions between the components of SICSM. It would be beneficial to include additional evaluation metrics, such as structural hamming distance (SHD) and F1-score, to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the method's robustness. We also suggest incorporating comparisons to relevant methods like CUTS to ensure a fair evaluation. Additionally, providing more details on the computational resources required for training and strategies for optimizing resource usage would enhance the paper's accessibility. We encourage the authors to address the limitations of using synthetic datasets more thoroughly in the manuscript, possibly by outlining their plans for future work involving real-world data. Finally, we recommend that the authors ensure that any necessary results included in the appendix are clearly referenced in the main body for accessibility, and improve the clarity of terminology and notation in their examples to enhance reader comprehension.
