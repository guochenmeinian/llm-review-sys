### Key Points
This paper studies a model of content creation and consumption on online user-generated content platforms, focusing on a Cournot competition where creators adjust their creation volume. The authors propose a theoretical framework analyzing Pure Nash Equilibria and explore how platform designers can balance consumer and creator utility through mechanism design. The paper includes experiments with synthetic data and empirical data from the MovieLens dataset, highlighting the tradeoff between user satisfaction and creator engagement.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper presents a strong contribution with valuable insights for researchers in UGC, mechanism design, and ML for social media.  
- Clarity is high, with a well-structured narrative and strong motivation.  
- The authors effectively model the traffic competition among creators and provide necessary proofs and empirical validation of their findings.

Weaknesses:  
- The assumptions regarding creator behavior and user traffic contributions may be overly simplistic, potentially limiting the model's applicability across diverse platforms.  
- The paper may overstate the generality of its insights, particularly regarding the Cournot competition dynamics across different platforms like Netflix and TikTok.  
- Limited practical implications are noted, as the experiments are constrained to small datasets, raising questions about scalability and efficiency in larger contexts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for their assumptions, particularly regarding creator competition dynamics and user engagement. Specifically, clarify how resource and budget heterogeneity among creators and consumers may affect the model's applicability. Additionally, we suggest providing more robust evidence supporting the claim that major platforms exhibit Cournot competition dynamics. It would also be beneficial to elaborate on the practical efficiency of the proposed optimization solution in larger datasets and to explicitly compare the C4 model with previous C3 game studies to highlight unique contributions.
