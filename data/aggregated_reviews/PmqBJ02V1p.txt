Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of principal components regression (PCR) in an adaptive data setting, where future observations depend on previously observed data. The authors provide computable bounds on the L2 error of online PCR, extending prior work by removing the soft sparsity assumption in favor of a dependence on the signal-to-noise ratio. The results are also applied to panel data settings commonly modeled via latent factor models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The results are new, technically sound, and provide a solid theoretical foundation for PCR in adaptive settings.
- The bounds are computable under reasonable assumptions, and the application to causal inference is well-motivated.
- The paper effectively employs self-normalized martingale concentration results, contributing insightful theoretical findings.

Weaknesses:
- There is limited discussion on why PCR is preferred for online learning problems beyond existing results in generic error-in-variables settings.
- The application section lacks depth, ultimately restating prior results without clear practical implications.
- The absence of empirical evidence and numerical evaluations raises concerns about the practical utility of the theoretical findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion around the preference for PCR in online learning contexts, providing more context and justification. Additionally, we suggest expanding the application section to include a more detailed exploration of practical implications and potential use cases. Incorporating empirical evaluations would strengthen the paper by demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed bounds in real-world scenarios. Finally, clarifying the assumptions regarding noise and adaptivity in the theoretical proofs would enhance the overall rigor of the work.
