### Key Points
This paper presents PR-MCS, a multilingual metric designed to evaluate image captioning by distinguishing perturbed text from original captions. The authors introduce a new evaluation dataset, M-FineCap3k, which includes translations from English into five languages. The proposed method demonstrates the ability to effectively identify lexically perturbed text across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant issue regarding the susceptibility of evaluation metrics to perturbations, contributing to the field of image captioning.
- The multilingual aspect of the study enhances its relevance and utility for a broader audience.
- The introduction of M-FineCap3k provides a valuable resource for future research.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution of the current method appears limited, as it relies on the original multilingual CLIP model and inherited perturbation signals, lacking thorough analysis of the selected perturbation types.
- There is insufficient comparison with other baseline methods, limiting the validation of the proposed metric's extensibility.
- Results can be unclear and confusing, particularly regarding the correlation between human evaluations and the proposed metric.
- The dataset's construction lacks detailed verification, including aspects like annotator agreement and quality assurance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their results, particularly by providing comparisons with other baseline metrics such as UMIC and reference-based metrics. Additionally, conducting a thorough analysis of the perturbation types used and demonstrating their impact on performance would strengthen the paper. It would also be beneficial to include more details on the dataset construction process, including annotation methods and quality checks. Finally, we suggest enhancing the coherence between the multilingual and perturbation-prevention aspects of the paper, possibly by exploring existing methods in word sense disambiguation that leverage multilinguality.
