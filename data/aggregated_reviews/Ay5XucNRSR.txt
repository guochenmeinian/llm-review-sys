### Key Points
This paper presents a Multimodal Taylor Series (MTS) network for detecting multimodal misinformation by explicitly modeling interactions between text and image modalities through Taylor series expansion. The authors claim that this approach enhances interpretability and scalability while demonstrating superior performance on various benchmark datasets. The method addresses key limitations of existing techniques and provides comprehensive experimental validation, including ablation studies that elucidate multimodal feature interactions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Strong theoretical foundation and novel approach to multimodal interaction modeling.
2. Comprehensive experimental validation with significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.
3. Clear practical benefits and implementation details, along with thorough ablation studies.

Weaknesses:
1. Limited exploration of failure cases and the robustness of the model across diverse real-world datasets.
2. Insufficient analysis of computational complexity and hyperparameter tuning, particularly regarding the optimal number of layers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the thoroughness of the ablation studies by evaluating the impact of modern ReLU variants and clarifying the specific hyperparameters of the MTS layer. Additionally, including a comparison of the overhead and model size of different methods, as well as AUC values for various approaches, would enhance the analysis. It would also be beneficial to explore the implications of concatenating $M_n$ and $D_n$ instead of direct addition. Finally, we suggest evaluating the MTS network on more diverse and real-world internet datasets to assess its robustness and performance in heterogeneous environments.
