### Key Points
This paper presents a method for computing sentence embeddings, termed InterSent, which emphasizes interpretability and supports compositional operations such as sentence fusion, difference, compression, and reconstruction. The authors utilize a transformer encoder (BERT) and a two-layer MLP for composing embeddings, incorporating both a contrastive and a generative objective to enhance interpretability and performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InterSent achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmark datasets, particularly in tasks related to semantic textual similarity and sentence retrieval.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a well-motivated and simple idea that significantly advances the field of sentence embeddings.
- Results show impressive improvements over baselines, particularly in interpretability and compositional operations.
- The writing is clear and the organization is effective, making the paper easy to follow.
- Extensive analysis and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- The definitions of fusion and difference operations are overly simplistic, with fusion appearing to merely concatenate sentences and difference removing one sentence, raising questions about practical value.
- The evaluation datasets are automatically constructed, leaving uncertainty about InterSent's performance in real-world scenarios.
- The experimental design may unfairly favor InterSent by optimizing its encoder while keeping baseline encoders frozen, potentially skewing results.
- More detailed explanations of the supervised and unsupervised contrastive baselines are needed for clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the definitions and implementations of the fusion and difference operations to enhance their practical applicability. Additionally, providing a more detailed qualitative analysis of both successes and failures would enrich the paper. Clarifying the relationship between InterSent and the tasks listed in L68-L72 is essential for understanding its applications. Finally, addressing the concerns regarding the experimental design and providing clearer explanations of the contrastive baselines will strengthen the paper's arguments.
