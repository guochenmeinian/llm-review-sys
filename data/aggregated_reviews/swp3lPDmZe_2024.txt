Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the First-Glance Off-Policy Selection (FPS) framework, which aims to enhance policy selection in human-centric systems (HCSs) like education and healthcare by addressing participant heterogeneity. FPS segments participants into sub-groups with similar traits, utilizes variational auto-encoding (VAE) for trajectory augmentation, and selects optimal policies based on an estimator of policy selection criteria. The method is evaluated in real-world applications, demonstrating significant improvements in learning outcomes and healthcare treatment.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of the FPS framework is a significant innovation that addresses participant heterogeneity through sub-group segmentation.
- The method is simple, easy to implement, and has been tested in real-world settings, showing promising results.
- The paper demonstrates methodological rigor, particularly in using VAE for trajectory augmentation and developing an unbiased value function estimator.

Weaknesses:
- The applicability of the proposed method is limited to problems with a finite number of policies, as it evaluates each candidate policy separately.
- The real-world experiment lacks a randomized controlled trial design, which raises questions about the robustness of the findings.
- The assumption of independent initial state distributions may oversimplify real-world complexities, potentially leading to suboptimal policy selections.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the sub-group partitioning process, particularly how it integrates with off-policy evaluation (OPE) and addresses variance. Additionally, the authors should consider discussing the implications of non-stationary state transitions and how the FPS framework can adapt to such scenarios. A more detailed comparison with existing work, particularly Keramati et al. (2022), would strengthen the contribution of the proposed method. Finally, we suggest that the authors clarify the scalability of FPS in large-scale real-world settings, especially in healthcare contexts.
