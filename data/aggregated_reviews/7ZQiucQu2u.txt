Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents diagonal Fisher information leakage (dFIL) as a framework for assessing privacy guarantees in instance encoding. dFIL quantifies the invertibility of encoding mappings and establishes that the reciprocal of dFIL, along with Fisher information, serves as a lower bound for the mean squared error (MSE) of input reconstruction attacks, derived from van Trees' inequality. The authors conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate dFIL's effectiveness as a privacy metric.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. dFIL is an intuitive privacy metric for unbiased reconstruction attacks, supported by the Cram√©r-Rao bound.
2. The limitations of dFIL are thoroughly discussed, enhancing the paper's credibility.
3. The paper is well-written and structured, facilitating comprehension of complex concepts.

Weaknesses:
1. dFIL's applicability is limited as unbiased attacks are rare in ML; biased attacks necessitate consideration of Fisher information, potentially overshadowing dFIL's significance.
2. The technical contribution is minor, primarily stemming from van Trees' inequality, which may not distinguish the paper in the field.
3. The empirical validation is limited, with simplistic reconstruction attacks; more sophisticated evaluations are needed.
4. The paper lacks a rigorous analysis of the privacy and utility trade-off, particularly regarding noise addition and its implications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the empirical and theoretical properties of Fisher information to clarify its relative importance compared to dFIL. Additionally, the authors should consider incorporating more complex reconstruction attacks from the privacy literature to enhance the robustness of their findings. A more rigorous analysis of the privacy and utility trade-off, particularly regarding noise addition, should be included to provide a clearer understanding of the implications of their approach. Lastly, expanding the range of use-cases for dFIL would enhance its practical utility and relevance in the field.
