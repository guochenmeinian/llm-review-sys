Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CRoSS, a novel image steganography framework that leverages text-driven diffusion models to enhance security, robustness, and controllability compared to traditional cover-based methods. The authors claim this is the first application of diffusion models in image steganography, achieving these benefits without additional training. The framework is validated through various experiments, demonstrating advantages over existing methods. The paper emphasizes the necessity of a comprehensive assessment of fidelity, security, and robustness, arguing that dismissing CRoSS solely based on fidelity under ideal conditions is one-sided. While RIIS shows better fidelity under ideal conditions due to its training requirement, CRoSS demonstrates superior performance in security and robustness in practical scenarios where distortions occur. The authors assert that comparing CRoSS and RIIS in real-world applications is reasonable.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- CRoSS innovatively applies diffusion models to image steganography, creatively addressing limitations of traditional methods.
- The presentation is clear, with well-defined goals and methodology.
- The paper includes a benchmark of 260 images, which may be beneficial for the community.
- Detailed analysis and discussions are provided throughout the paper.
- The paper highlights the importance of evaluating steganography algorithms beyond just fidelity, incorporating security and robustness as critical factors.
- The introduction of diffusion models into image steganography is a valuable contribution that enhances the understanding of CRoSS's advantages.

Weaknesses:
- Equation 3 lacks detailed representation, and its relationship to Appendix H of guided diffusion needs clarification.
- The dataset's size (260 images) raises concerns about the validity of the quantitative conclusions, especially given the similarity between secret and stego images.
- The performance of CRoSS is constrained by inherent errors from the VAE in Stable Diffusion, leading to low PSNR values (23.79 dB).
- The requirement for the recipient to know the exact prompt or condition for image retrieval may be impractical.
- The guidance scale set to 1 may limit the range of secret image selection and compromise editability.
- The argument against the dismissal of CRoSS based solely on fidelity may lack sufficient empirical support in the context of real-world applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Equation 3 and its connection to Appendix H of guided diffusion. Additionally, conducting large-scale quantitative experiments on popular datasets such as BOSSbase and BOWS2 would strengthen the findings. The authors should explore prompts with lower correlation to secret images and consider a broader range of distortions to verify robustness. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of the current dataset and enhancing the extraction accuracy metrics would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the method's effectiveness. Lastly, we recommend that the authors improve the empirical analysis of CRoSS's performance in real-world scenarios to strengthen their argument regarding its security and robustness, and provide more detailed comparisons with RIIS under practical conditions to enhance the clarity and depth of the evaluation.
