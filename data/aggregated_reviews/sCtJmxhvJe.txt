### Key Points
This paper presents a novel dataset annotated for gender bias using a best-worst scale (BWS) approach, allowing for nuanced annotation beyond binary classification. The dataset is generated using GPT-3.5-Turbo with various prompting methods to ensure diversity in gender bias and linguistic representation. The authors analyze the dataset to identify key themes and trends in biased content, emphasizing the importance of detecting subtle implicit gender bias.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The dataset provides explicit rankings of gender bias, expanding upon existing binary classification datasets.  
- The authors thoroughly analyze dataset creation, inter-annotator agreement, and sample themes.  
- The annotation process is well-designed, with careful monitoring and evaluation of annotator consistency.  
- The authors demonstrate familiarity with related literature and make the annotated datasets freely available.  

Weaknesses:  
- There is insufficient discussion on the method used to convert labels into scores, particularly regarding implicit assumptions.  
- The paper lacks engagement with literature on handling annotation disagreement for subjective labels.  
- The limitations of using GPT models to generate biased text are not adequately addressed.  
- The diversity of annotators is limited, which may affect the dataset's representativeness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the conversion of labels into scores, making implicit assumptions explicit. Additionally, engaging with literature on annotation disagreement would strengthen the paper. We suggest incorporating a more thorough analysis of the limitations of GPT models in generating biased text. Furthermore, consider enhancing the diversity of annotators to enrich the dataset. Finally, we advise clarifying the purpose of the benchmarking section and previewing the findings in the abstract to better inform readers about the contributions of the paper.
