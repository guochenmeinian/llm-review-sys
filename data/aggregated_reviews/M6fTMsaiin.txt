### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach, GraphPAR (Graph models with Provable fAiRness), addressing fairness issues in pre-trained graph models (PGMs). The authors propose a parameter-efficient adapter combined with two adversarial debiasing methods to ensure efficient parameter training and theoretical guarantees for fairness. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphPAR across three datasets, showing improvements in fairness metrics while maintaining classification quality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, logically structured, and presents a novel idea that fills gaps in fairness within graph models.
- The combination of theoretical justification and empirical evidence enhances the credibility of the findings.
- The proposed method shows promising results in improving fairness metrics while maintaining high utility.

Weaknesses:
- The discussion of methods lacks depth, and visual demonstrations, such as t-SNE, would improve clarity.
- The experimental design for verifying whether $\alpha$ satisfies expectation is inadequate; ground truth comparisons with synthetic data would be more effective.
- Theorems presented are somewhat general and lack motivation specific to the methodology.
- Notation and terminology are inconsistent, leading to potential confusion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of their methods, particularly by incorporating visualized demonstrations to clarify complex data and results. Additionally, the experimental design should include ground truth comparisons for $\alpha$ using synthetic data. Clarifying the rationale behind the computation of the semantics vector $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ and ensuring consistent notation throughout the paper would enhance understanding. Finally, conducting experiments on a broader range of diverse graph datasets would solidify the findings.
