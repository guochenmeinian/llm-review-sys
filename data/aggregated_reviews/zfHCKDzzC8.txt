Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a methodology for estimating direct and indirect effects of healthcare interventions by modeling the mediation and outcome processes as a non-parametric temporal point process. The authors propose a joint modeling approach that allows for two causal paths: a direct path representing the treatment's direct effect and an indirect path through mediation. They validate their model through experiments on both real-world and semi-synthetic datasets, demonstrating its superiority over baseline models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed model addresses an important issue in healthcare: distinguishing between direct and indirect effects.
2. The design of the causal model is reasonable, with a clear motivation and convincing analysis.
3. The authors conduct experiments on diverse datasets, showing that their model outperforms existing methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The potential correlation between treatment and outcome, which could introduce bias, is not adequately addressed. The authors should consider methods like IPTW to mitigate this issue.
2. Recent literature on treatment effects and causal inference using non-parametric temporal point processes is not sufficiently referenced.
3. The assumptions (A1, A2, A3) may not hold in observational studies, raising concerns about the model's applicability in real-world scenarios.
4. Some methodological details are lacking, such as the specifics of the diet data used and the demographics of the patients involved.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve their discussion on the correlation between treatment and outcome by exploring methods like IPTW to reduce bias. Additionally, incorporating recent related works on causal inference would strengthen the paper's foundation. We suggest conducting a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness of the model against unobserved confounders. Clarifying the details regarding diet data and patient demographics would enhance the methodological transparency. Lastly, providing factual prediction performance metrics, such as MSE for glucose prediction, would offer a clearer assessment of the model's effectiveness.
