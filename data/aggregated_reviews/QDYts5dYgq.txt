Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a GNN-based rigid-body simulator that utilizes learned signed distance fields (SDFs) to enhance collision detection efficiency. The authors propose connecting surface nodes between objects based on proximity thresholds of their signed distances, resulting in sparser graph edges compared to previous methods. The evaluation demonstrates the simulator's capability to handle large-scale scenes with hundreds of objects, achieving visually plausible results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with a straightforward and implementable main idea.
- The novel integration of SDFs for collision detection in a GNN context is a significant contribution.
- The experiments showcase the simulator's scalability and performance improvements over existing GNN-based methods.

Weaknesses:
- The storytelling is biased, particularly in comparing the proposed method with mesh-based GNN simulators, failing to adequately discuss their respective advantages and limitations.
- The paper lacks clarity on certain technical details, such as the dynamic creation of collision edges and the specifics of SDF construction.
- The experimental results are not sufficiently interpreted, particularly regarding the performance differences between small and large scenes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the balance in storytelling by providing a fair comparison of mesh-based GNNs, highlighting their pros and cons. Additionally, clarify the technical details regarding the dynamic creation of collision edges and the SDF construction process. We suggest enhancing the discussion around the experimental results, particularly the reasons for performance variations in different scene sizes. Lastly, ensure consistency in the presentation of figures and terminology throughout the paper.
