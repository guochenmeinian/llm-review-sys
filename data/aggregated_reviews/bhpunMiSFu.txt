### Key Points
This paper presents a self-guided graph structure refinement (SG-GSR) framework aimed at enhancing the robustness of graph neural networks (GNNs) against adversarial attacks. The authors propose a method that extracts clean subgraphs from attacked graphs, addressing challenges such as loss of structural information and imbalanced node degree distribution through graph augmentation and group-training strategies. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of SG-GSR across various scenarios, including e-commerce fraud.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation for the proposed method is clear and well-supported.
2. The paper is well-organized and easy to follow.
3. Extensive empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, including novel applications in e-commerce fraud.

Weaknesses:
1. The proposed graph augmentation strategies are heuristic, lacking theoretical analysis or guarantees that could strengthen the method's validity.
2. The computational complexity is a concern, particularly regarding graph embedding and node-to-node similarity computations.
3. Some experimental results are not rigorously conducted, and the absence of hyperparameter search details for baselines diminishes the credibility of the results.
4. The paper's language and formatting require further polishing, including the font size of tables and images.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by refining the language and formatting. Additionally, please provide theoretical analyses or deeper experimental discussions to support the heuristic nature of the graph augmentation strategies. To enhance the experimental rigor, include details on the hyperparameter search for the baselines. We also suggest addressing the computational complexity by demonstrating the scalability of SG-GSR with comparative experiments on time consumption against other GSR models. Lastly, consider evaluating the model's performance at intermediate adversarial attack rates to reflect more practical scenarios.
