Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of Noise2Score for unsupervised image denoising, capable of handling various noise models beyond the exponential family. The authors propose a self-supervised learning algorithm that utilizes the score of the noisy image distribution, demonstrating its effectiveness through extensive experiments on different noise types, including additive, multiplicative, and mixed noise.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The extension of Noise2Score allows for the handling of diverse noise distributions, significantly broadening its applicability.
2. The paper is well-written, with clear examples and extensive experimental validation showcasing the proposed method's performance.

Weaknesses:
1. The contribution appears incremental and relies on an approximation (equation (7) replacing equation (6)) that is insufficiently discussed.
2. The method is highly dependent on accurate noise parameter estimations, limiting its practicality for real-world applications.
3. The authors do not compare their method with SURE-based approaches, which could provide valuable insights.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the approximation error between equations (6) and (7), including numerical details in practical scenarios. Additionally, it would be beneficial to exhibit ill-posed cases where the approximation may fail and discuss the implications for the denoising algorithm. We also suggest providing qualitative comparisons in the supplementary materials and clarifying the method's reliance on known noise distributions, as well as addressing the potential for handling unknown noise parameters. Lastly, correcting notation mistakes in equations (5) and (7) would enhance clarity.
