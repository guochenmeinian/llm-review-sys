### Key Points
This paper presents a novel API-based setting for few-shot learning in text classification, where the encoder operates as a black-box API and a classifier is trained on the API output embeddings. The authors propose a transductive learning regularizer utilizing the Fisher-Rao distance, addressing real-world constraints of using pre-trained models without accessing their internals. The evaluation includes both real-world applications and controlled studies, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper tackles a timely and relevant problem in NLP, providing a solid evaluation in real-world settings.  
- The proposed transductive learning regularizer shows promising performance and contributes to the understanding of few-shot learning.  
- The contributions have the potential for significant impact on the NLP community, particularly in scenarios involving privacy constraints.

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty of the technique is primarily concentrated in Section 3.3, where the Fisher-Rao regularizer is insufficiently explained, particularly regarding its intuition and application as a regularizer.  
- The relationship between the proposed scenario and few-shot learning is questioned, as it may not clearly differentiate from standard supervised learning with labeled data.  
- Some experimental details and parameter settings are underspecified, which may hinder reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the Fisher-Rao regularizer in Section 3.3, particularly clarifying the intuition behind computing the Fisher-Rao distance between query instances and its role as a regularizer. Additionally, the authors should address the concerns regarding the connection between their proposed scenario and few-shot learning, potentially providing a clearer justification for this relationship. To enhance reproducibility, we suggest that the authors specify the settings of parameters more clearly and ensure that training and evaluation data are more widely available. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to revise figures and tables for clarity, including adjusting color tones for grayscale readability and ensuring consistent ordering across tables.
