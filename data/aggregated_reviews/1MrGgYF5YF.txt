Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the FG-CIGBC framework tailored for Behavior Graph Classification (BGC), comprising two main components: (1) a graph partitioning phase utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) and (2) an incremental model adaptation phase. The authors claim this is the first unified framework for fine-grained and class-incremental behavior graph classification, addressing significant challenges in the BGC domain with adequate experimental evidence. However, the core contributions appear more application-oriented than novel, particularly regarding the gPartition and gAdapt modules, which employ KMeans for class annotation despite its known limitations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The framework effectively combines out-of-distribution detection with incremental learning, addressing critical issues in behavior graph classification.
- Extensive experiments validate the framework's superiority over existing methods, demonstrating robust performance across various datasets.
- The paper is well-structured, with clear presentation and comprehensive analysis of experimental results.

Weaknesses:
- The integration of LLM-based graph construction, OOD detection, and incremental learning may dilute the paper's focus and technical contribution.
- The use of KMeans in the gAdapt module raises concerns due to its sensitivity to initial centroids, outliers, and unevenly distributed data.
- Certain sections lack conciseness, and the overall paper could benefit from reduced length and improved coherence.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the technical novelty of the framework by addressing the limitations of KMeans in the gAdapt module and providing a clearer discussion on how these challenges are mitigated. Additionally, please provide results on how well forgetting is prevented and separate evaluations of the graph partition and OOD detection modules to clarify their contributions. We suggest simplifying the gAdapt part without losing effectiveness and conducting further experiments to assess the robustness of FG-CIGBC in varying class ratios. Lastly, careful proofreading is needed to eliminate minor errors and enhance the overall clarity of the paper.
