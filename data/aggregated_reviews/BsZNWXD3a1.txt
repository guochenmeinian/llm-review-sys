Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework for optimizing prompts in text-to-image generation, combining supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning to enhance aesthetic quality while preserving user intent. The authors propose a two-stage pipeline involving a supervised fine-tuning stage on human-engineered prompts and a reinforcement learning process utilizing relevance and aesthetic losses. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms manual prompt engineering in both automatic metrics and human preference ratings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured, clearly written, and easy to understand, effectively explaining complex concepts.
- The originality of the framework, termed "Prompt Adaptation," represents a significant contribution to the field.
- The detailed experimental section provides useful insights, demonstrating that the proposed approach yields better aesthetic results than heavily manually engineered prompts.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental section lacks robustness, with insufficient validation of the general framework and no exploration of different model architectures.
- The choice of model architecture (Stable Diffusion V1.4 and GPT-2) appears arbitrary, and the potential for generalization to other architectures is unclear.
- The dataset used for supervised fine-tuning is biased towards artistic styles, limiting the generalizability of the framework.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section to validate the robustness of the framework further. Specifically, conducting experiments with various model architectures and exploring the impact of different language models would enhance the findings. Additionally, addressing the biases in the dataset by balancing art styles and categories at the outset could improve generalizability. Providing comparisons with alternative methods for optimizing prompts and including non-cherrypicked examples of human and optimized prompts in the appendix would also strengthen the paper.
