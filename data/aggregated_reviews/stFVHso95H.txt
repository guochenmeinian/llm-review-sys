### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework for aligning large language models (LLMs) with structured information extraction tasks through a Controllable State Transition model and the Structure2Text Decider. The authors identify key challenges in task type, output format, and modeling granularity, proposing a method that enhances task-specific focus and reduces errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly improves performance in Named Entity Recognition (NER), Relation Extraction (RE), and Event Argument Extraction (EAE), ensuring structured outputs that enhance data utility.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work effectively identifies a significant gap between information extraction tasks and LLM training corpora, proposing an innovative method to bridge this gap.
- The formalization of language model generation as a state transition process is novel and provides a clear mechanism for aligning generative and extractive paradigms.
- Comprehensive evaluations show competitive performance against strong baselines, demonstrating the method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- Certain sections lack clarity, particularly Lines 489â€“499, which contain numerous symbols that complicate understanding.
- The absence of a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) baseline for GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 is unexplained, and comparisons with other state-of-the-art Named Entity Recognition (NER) methods are missing.
- Inconsistencies between reported numerical results in the text and tables detract from the reliability of claims, and the methodology lacks detailed explanations for heuristic baselines, hindering reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity in sections with dense formatting and elaborate on the absence of CoT baselines for GPT-4 and GPT-3.5. Additionally, including qualitative analyses of outputs before and after implementing the proposed method would illustrate its impact more clearly. The authors should also ensure consistency between reported numerical results and corresponding tables, clarify comparisons with models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and provide heuristic rules for baselines to enhance reproducibility. Finally, addressing the lack of sections on Discussion, Limitations, and Future Work would strengthen the overall narrative and comprehensiveness of the paper.
