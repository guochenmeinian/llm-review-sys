Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents RAM-MIL, a novel approach that integrates Optimal Transport (OT) in Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) to enhance performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, specifically for whole slide images (WSIs). The methodology involves training a standard MIL model to extract features, retrieving nearest neighbors using OT, and merging these representations for classification. The authors clarify that their method utilizes weakly-supervised learning instead of traditional fully supervised methods that require patch-level labels, making it distinct from existing patch-level techniques. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in performance across various datasets, including CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17, and RAM-MIL outperforms existing methods, including Yang et al.'s domain adversarial learning approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively combines concepts from Unsupervised Domain Adaptation and feature alignment to address out-of-domain performance, a critical issue for real-world applications.
- The novelty of the RAM-MIL framework is acknowledged, particularly its focus on weakly-supervised learning for slide-level classification.
- Extensive experimentation and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the OT approach over simpler methods.
- The authors provide clear experimental comparisons that highlight the advantages of their method over existing techniques.
- The writing is mostly clear, and the related work section is comprehensive, addressing potential misunderstandings regarding intrinsic and normal dimensions.

Weaknesses:
- The computational cost of inference with RAM-MIL is high due to the need for recalculating distance measures, especially with dynamic test sets.
- The assumption that instance labels for target bags are known undermines the interpretability section, suggesting it should be removed.
- The evaluation is limited to a single dataset, CAMELYON16, which may not represent broader retrieval tasks in histopathology.
- The paper could benefit from a more comprehensive discussion of existing works in domain adaptation for WSIs.
- Some reviewers noted that the presentation may have led to confusion regarding the intrinsic and normal dimensions, indicating a need for clearer explanations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind the Dimensionality Reduction experiments and provide training time comparisons between OT and other distance metrics. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with other important baselines for slide retrieval, such as SISH and Yottixel, to strengthen the evaluation. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the definition of "input data dimension" and its relationship to MIL performance, as well as provide a more thorough discussion on the optimal intrinsic dimension and its determination. We also recommend enhancing the discussion on existing works in domain adaptation for whole slide images, specifically addressing the limitations of fully supervised methods. Finally, we encourage the authors to ensure that the camera-ready version undergoes careful revisions to enhance clarity and coherence throughout the manuscript.
