### Key Points
This paper presents a new Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) dataset called Multi-Scenario Anomaly Detection (MSAD), which includes 35 human-related and 20 non-human anomalies across 14 distinct scenarios with varying motion patterns and challenging conditions. The authors conduct a comprehensive survey of existing VAD datasets and evaluate MSAD using recent deep learning models, revealing that its performance is sensitive to the choice of backbones. The paper also discusses the limitations of current methods and the societal implications of the dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors thoroughly reviewed prior works on VAD datasets and deep learning models.
2. They performed a comprehensive evaluation of the MSAD dataset and the model, including single and cross-scenario assessments.
3. The dataset effectively covers a wide range of real-world anomalies, providing a robust foundation for future research.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a comprehensive and objective review of the field, focusing excessively on the shortcomings of existing datasets without adequately defining 'anomaly' in various contexts.
2. There is insufficient discussion regarding the selection of evaluated methods and their implementation details.
3. The dataset contains visible human identities, raising ethical concerns regarding privacy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve Section 4.3 by clarifying why MSAD is sensitive to the choice of backbones. Additionally, we suggest condensing the justification for the new dataset to allow more space for dataset description and experimentation discussion. The authors should also include a more insightful discussion on the limitations of current methods and the rationale behind the selected evaluation methods. Furthermore, it is crucial to address the ethical concerns by blurring human identities in the dataset and providing explicit details about permissions and licensing. Lastly, the authors should consider incorporating spatio-temporal localization-based metrics alongside Frame-level AUC to ensure robust evaluation against spurious correlations.
