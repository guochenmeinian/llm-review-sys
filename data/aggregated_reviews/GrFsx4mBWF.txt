Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of the linear regression problem under the new definition of $(\alpha, \delta)$-fairness consistency as a fairness constraint. The authors derive that under this constraint, the minimax optimal error is $dM/n$ when $\alpha < 1/2$ and propose an estimator that achieves this optimal rate of convergence. Additionally, the paper investigates the minimax error in regression under demographic parity (DP), addressing both direct and indirect discrimination and providing extensive theoretical analysis of upper and lower bounds under the DP constraint.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper establishes matching upper and lower bounds on the minimax optimal error and proposes a regression algorithm achieving this optimal error under a specific fairness constraint.
- It introduces the concepts of direct and indirect discrimination, which are novel and realistic, supported by helpful examples.
- The theoretical analysis is comprehensive, with detailed proofs highlighting technical difficulties and new techniques developed to handle challenges in the analysis.

Weaknesses:
- The assumption that $\alpha \leq 1/2$ is not sufficiently discussed, leaving questions about its restrictiveness and implications for cases where $\alpha > 1/2$.
- The paper lacks empirical studies or examples, which would enhance understanding of the theoretical contributions.
- Some writing could be sharpened, and there are multiple typos present.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the restrictiveness of the assumption that $\alpha \leq 1/2$ and clarify how to approach cases where $\alpha > 1/2$. Additionally, we suggest incorporating empirical studies or examples to validate the theoretical findings. Furthermore, the authors should address the clarity of certain statements, such as the implications of enforcing strict demographic parity and the equivalence of their fairness regressor with those in existing literature. Lastly, we encourage the authors to refine the writing for clarity and correct any typographical errors.
