### Key Points
This paper presents GRENADE, a self-supervised graph-centric language model designed for learning expressive representations from text-attributed graphs (TAG). The authors propose two novel self-supervised learning algorithms: Graph-Centric Contrastive Learning, which enhances representation through neighborhood information, and Graph-Centric Knowledge Alignment, which aligns representations from pre-trained language models (PLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). Experimental results indicate that GRENADE outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various downstream tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The writing is clear and accessible.
2. The proposed algorithms effectively leverage both PLM and GNN representations, addressing a crucial need in multimodal learning.
3. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements in representation learning for node classification and link prediction tasks.

Weaknesses:
1. The method section is poorly presented, lacking clarity.
2. The expressiveness of the proposed method is asserted but not sufficiently proven or analyzed.
3. There is no exploration of GRENADE's performance on non-homophilous graphs.
4. The computational effort required by GRENADE is not discussed.
5. Comparisons with graph-only SSL approaches, such as Auto-SSL, are absent, and results from Graph Transformer Networks are missing from Table 2.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation of the method section for clarity. Additionally, the authors should provide a thorough analysis of the expressiveness of GRENADE. Exploring the performance of GRENADE on non-homophilous graphs would enhance the robustness of the proposed SSL objectives. A discussion on the computational effort required by GRENADE is essential. Finally, including comparisons with graph-only SSL approaches like Auto-SSL and results from Graph Transformer Networks in Table 2 would provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of incorporating PLMs.
