Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a similarity-based approach to detect large quasi-cliques in graphs, proposing two algorithms that exploit vertex neighborhood similarity and a containment score. The authors conduct extensive experiments to evaluate their algorithms, which focus on quasi-cliques within the ego-network of specific vertices. However, the algorithms' limitations in generalization and comprehensive evaluation significantly weaken the paper's contribution.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem studied is interesting and relevant to graph data analysis.
- New algorithms are proposed to tackle the quasi-clique detection problem.
- The paper is well-written, and the experimental evaluation is thorough.

Weaknesses:
- The technical contribution is limited, with algorithms only applicable to ego-networks.
- The datasets used for evaluation are small, impacting the robustness of results.
- Some algorithm components are inadequately evaluated, and important related works are not discussed.
- The performance impact of varying the parameter \(\alpha\) is unclear, and the setting of parameters \(\gamma\) and \(b\) lacks practical guidance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by using larger datasets to enhance the credibility of their findings. Additionally, the authors should provide a more comprehensive discussion on the theoretical contributions and clarify the relationship between the parameters \(\gamma\) and \(b\) and graph structures. A detailed comparison of the proposed algorithms with state-of-the-art methods, including a rigorous analysis of their time complexity, is necessary. Furthermore, the authors should address the limitations of their algorithms regarding generalization beyond ego-networks and include a more exhaustive review of related literature. Lastly, we suggest highlighting the practical applications of their work in web-based contexts more explicitly.
