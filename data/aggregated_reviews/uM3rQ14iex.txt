Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the causal bandits problem without prior knowledge of the causal graph and in the presence of latent variables. The authors propose a randomized algorithm to identify possibly optimal minimal intervention sets (POMISs) based on partial discovery of the causal graph, demonstrating that this is sufficient for finding POMISs. The paper extends methodologies from Lee and Bareinboim (2018) and provides a finite sample POMIS-discovery algorithm with coverage guarantees and regret upper bounds. Experiments indicate a clear advantage over learning all latent confounders in random, triangulated directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper addresses an important problem in the causal bandits area, considering unknown graphs and latent variables.  
2. The theoretical demonstration that partial discovery of the causal graph suffices for finding POMISs is significant (Theorem 3.1).  
3. The proposed two-phased algorithm is well-analyzed theoretically, and the experimental results convincingly show the benefits of partial structure discovery.

Weaknesses:  
1. The proposed regret bound may become excessively large when either $\epsilon$ or $\gamma$ is small.  
2. The optimality of the proposed algorithm and upper bounds is unclear, with no discussion provided.  
3. The running time of the algorithms is not discussed, and there are several typos and unclear definitions throughout the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the assumptions regarding latent variables, particularly the mutual independence assumption, and discuss its implications more thoroughly. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the access to values used in assumptions 4.1 and 4.2, and compare their algorithm's regret bound with that of a naive algorithm iterating over all possible interventions. Furthermore, we advise addressing the running time of the algorithms and correcting the identified typos, particularly in the definitions of transitive reduction and d-separation. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore the impact of graph structure and parametric assumptions on the performance of their algorithm in more detail.
