Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a causal effect regularization technique, CausalReg, aimed at identifying and removing spurious attributes. CausalReg is shown to be robust against non-identifiable issues, finite sample errors, and noise. The authors provide theoretical proofs that guarantee the identification of causal effects under specific data generation structures and demonstrate through experiments that CausalReg outperforms other methods in controlling spurious correlated features.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and grounded in solid causality theory, addressing an important problem in machine learning.
- The theoretical results are insightful, and the empirical results show that the proposed method achieves comparable or superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Weaknesses:
- Major:
  1. The paper lacks experiments on precision and recall regarding the discovery of spurious and causal attributes, particularly in comparison to methods requiring binning techniques.
  2. The mathematical definition of spurious attributes is not clearly articulated.
- Minor:
  1. Figures appear distorted.
  2. Legends in Fig 3 lack clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the mathematical definition of spurious attributes. Additionally, conducting experiments to evaluate precision and recall in identifying spurious and causal attributes would strengthen the paper, particularly in comparison to methods that utilize binning techniques. The authors should also address the empirical generation of counterfactual samples for various datasets and explore the implications of multiple inter-correlated spurious attributes. Finally, including discussions or comparisons with other relevant methods in the literature would enhance the paper's contribution.
