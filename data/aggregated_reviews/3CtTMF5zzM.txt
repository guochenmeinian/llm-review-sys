### Key Points
This paper presents new results on no-$\Phi$-regret learning in non-concave games, demonstrating that no-$\Phi$-regret learning is achievable when $\Phi$ is finite or "local," allowing for efficient approximation of $\Phi$-equilibria at a rate of $\text{poly}(1/\epsilon)$. The authors define the $\Phi$-equilibrium concept, which can recover known notions like CCEs under specific modifications of $\Phi$. Efficient algorithms for finding $\epsilon$-approximate $\Phi$-equilibria are also proposed.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper provides novel insights into non-concave games, an area where positive results are scarce.  
- It is well-written and self-contained, with a clear problem formulation that aids understanding.  
- The results extend existing frameworks to include infinite local strategy modifications, contributing technical novelty.

Weaknesses:  
- The structure is questionable, with Section 1 being overly lengthy and the remainder feeling rushed.  
- Some statements are repetitive, and the paper could benefit from more concise writing.  
- The lack of empirical results to validate theoretical claims is noted, particularly regarding the realistic complexity of the sampling procedure.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the structure by condensing Section 1 and expanding on Algorithm 1 within the main text. Consider moving some content from Section 4 to the appendix to enhance readability. Additionally, addressing the triviality of the regime $\delta = O(\epsilon)$ explicitly would be beneficial. We suggest including empirical results to strengthen the theoretical findings, particularly regarding the efficiency of the sampling procedure.
