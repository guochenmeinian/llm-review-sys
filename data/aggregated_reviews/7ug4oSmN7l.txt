### Key Points
This paper presents a learning-based method to address the Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP) by transforming undirected edges into directed arcs and utilizing a graph attention network to build a Direction-aware Attention Model. The authors propose a training process that combines supervised learning for initial policy generation with reinforcement learning based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for strategy refinement, followed by dynamic programming for depot placement optimization. Experimental results demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness in evaluation criteria.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized, with detailed experimental outcomes presented through graphs and tables, enhancing reader comprehension.
- The dataset used reflects real-world scenarios, increasing practical relevance.
- The combination of supervised and reinforcement learning is innovative, and the qualitative comparisons in real street scenes are particularly noteworthy.

Weaknesses:
- The method's novelty is limited, as converting graph G from arcs to nodes is a common heuristic approach for CARP, adding complexity.
- The baseline comparisons are outdated, lacking recent advancements in CARP solutions.
- The presentation lacks clarity in defining the CARP problem and related concepts, and there are writing errors that need correction.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their approach by exploring more efficient graph processing methods rather than relying on common heuristics. Additionally, we suggest updating the baseline comparisons to include more recent works in the field. The authors should also clarify the presentation of the CARP problem and ensure that writing errors are corrected throughout the manuscript. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to discuss the training time and the amount of data required for algorithm training to better assess the trade-offs involved.
