### Key Points
This paper presents CARE, a cluster-aware multi-view graph anomaly detection method that enhances adjacency matrices with pseudo-labels to capture node affinities and employs a similarity-guided loss to mitigate bias. The authors connect these approaches to graph spectral clustering, and experimental results demonstrate CARE's superiority over existing methods in terms of AUROC and AUPRC across diverse datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Extensive experiments show significant improvements, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed method in graph anomaly detection tasks.
- The paper provides systematic theoretical analysis and justifications for the loss functions, making it easy to follow.
- CARE effectively combines local and global affinities, showcasing versatility on both single-view and multi-view graphs.
- Code availability enhances reproducibility and utility for the research community.

Weaknesses:
- Performance is sensitive to hyperparameters, such as the similarity balancing coefficient (ùõº) and regularization coefficient (ùúÜ), necessitating hyperparameter tests.
- The similarity-guided loss has \(O(n^2)\) complexity, which may be infeasible for large graphs despite the proposed sampling strategy.
- Experiments are limited to relatively small datasets (maximum ~25,000 nodes), with no exploration of larger-scale graphs.
- The manuscript overlooks several closely related studies that could enhance theoretical and methodological comparisons.
- The conclusion lacks detail on future research avenues, missing emerging topics like prompt learning and sparsification strategies.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion by including more robust baseline comparisons with recent multi-view graph-based anomaly detection methods. Additionally, we suggest reporting model performance using other popular GNN architectures, such as SGC, APPNP, GAT, and GCNII. It would also be beneficial to clarify the treatment of views in the proposed framework, particularly regarding the lack of weighting for different views. Finally, we encourage the authors to expand the conclusion to detail future research directions, incorporating emerging topics relevant to CARE's potential extensions.
