Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a matrix mixer framework for sequence models, applying an LxL matrix M to a sequence representation X of length L. The authors propose Hydra, a bi-directional variant of structured state space models (SSMs), utilizing quasiseparable matrices to enhance performance in non-causal tasks. The framework identifies desirable properties of M, such as data dependence and extendability, and demonstrates that Hydra outperforms existing models, including transformers, in tasks like masked language modeling and image classification. Additionally, the paper analyzes the expressivity of different quasiseparable (QS) ablation matrices, specifically addressing the "Add," "No-Shift," and "No-Diag" variants. The authors clarify the relationships among these matrix classes and provide empirical performance data, indicating that higher expressivity correlates with better GLUE scores. An ablation study on the impact of convolution in the model's performance shows that QS consistently outperforms the Add variant, with convolution enhancing performance across both methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper introduces a general framework for matrix mixing and highlights properties like Sequence Alignment.  
2. Hydra effectively extends the Mamba model with bidirectional capabilities, showing superior performance in various settings.  
3. The framework motivates new sequence models using Vandermonde or Cauchy matrices and provides insights into existing methods.  
4. The authors provide a clear and structured analysis of the expressivity of various ablation matrices, supported by empirical data.  
5. The ablation study on convolution effectively highlights the advantages of the QS method over traditional heuristics.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The writing lacks clarity in several sections, hindering readability and comprehension of key concepts, such as "common data transformations" and "structured matrices."  
2. The theoretical motivations for quasiseparable matrices and their practical implications are not clearly established.  
3. The experiments are limited in scope, lacking comparisons with recent state-of-the-art models and additional applications for Hydra.  
4. The response regarding the No-Shift variant lacks clarity, particularly concerning the inclusion of the $DX$ term.  
5. The proof of expressivity relationships does not establish a strict subset for No-Shift, which raises questions about the validity of the expressivity argument presented.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing, particularly in defining key terms and concepts, such as "data dependence" and "structured matrices." Additionally, we suggest providing clearer theoretical justifications for the properties of quasiseparable matrices and their impact on performance. Expanding the experimental section to include comparisons with recent models and additional applications for Hydra would strengthen the paper. We also recommend improving the clarity of the explanation regarding the No-Shift variant, specifically addressing whether the $DX$ term is included in the ablation table results. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors provide a more rigorous proof to demonstrate that No-Shift is a strict subset of QS, ensuring that the expressivity argument is robust and clear for readers. Lastly, we encourage the authors to incorporate the ablation study on convolution into the main text to strengthen their overall arguments.
