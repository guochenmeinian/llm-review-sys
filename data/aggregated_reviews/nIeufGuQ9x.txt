Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel diffusion model for scene flow estimation, enhancing accuracy and robustness against noisy inputs and occlusions. The authors propose a denoising diffusion model that effectively filters sensor-induced noise while averaging over multiple hypotheses to introduce uncertainty without modifying the training process. Additionally, the integration of transformers with diffusion models is introduced, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as FlyingThings3D, KITTI Scene Flow, and Waymo-Open.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation for employing diffusion models in scene flow estimation is well-justified, addressing real-world challenges like occlusion and noise.
2. The proposed method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.
3. The paper is well-written and accessible, facilitating reader comprehension.
4. Strong reproducibility of results is ensured.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks qualitative results, particularly visual comparisons of scene flow results on challenging datasets, making it difficult to interpret the method's performance relative to existing approaches.
2. The organization of Section 3.2 could be improved for clarity.
3. The proposed method's technical contribution is limited, as it does not introduce a new concept beyond existing work on optical flow estimation using diffusion models.
4. Some claims may be overreaching, such as stating the authors are the first to apply a diffusion model to scene flow estimation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including qualitative results, such as visual comparisons of scene flow outputs on challenging datasets. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the organization of Section 3.2 for better clarity and addressing the potential negative impact of the work on society in the main paper. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to evaluate other popular architectures beyond the GMSF model and to clarify the definitions of terms like "uncertainty" within the text. Lastly, we advise revising any overclaimed statements to reflect a more accurate representation of the contributions made in the field.
