Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a geometric reconstruction-based domain adaptation method for synthetic to real transfer of hand/human pose estimation models. The authors propose a reconstruction loss that enhances model generalization to the target domain, leveraging a broader range of unlabeled data compared to pseudo-label methods. The method demonstrates improved performance on standard benchmarks through the integration of self-supervised losses, including a geometric reconstruction loss and an integrated pseudo-labeling loss.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method utilizes unlabeled data effectively through a novel reconstruction scheme, which is a new direction compared to existing pseudo-labeling approaches.
- The incorporation of a pseudo-labeling strategy combining 2D and 3D confidence significantly enhances performance, particularly in challenging semantic categories.
- The paper is well-structured, with meaningful ablation studies that validate the technical contributions.

Weaknesses:
- The concept of reconstruction for domain adaptation is not entirely novel, and the clarity of the implementation details, particularly regarding the perceptual reconstruction loss and its dependency on the quality of the pretrained model, is lacking.
- The occlusion map's specifics and its handling of self-occlusions are unclear, as is the comparison of computational costs with other methods.
- There is insufficient discussion on the limitations of the proposed method, particularly regarding the necessity of a video dataset for the target domain and the potential for adaptation collapse.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the implementation details, particularly regarding the perceptual reconstruction loss and its effectiveness with varying quality of pose predictions. Additionally, we suggest providing a more thorough comparison with existing reconstruction-based methods to substantiate the proposed method's advantages. It would also be beneficial to clarify the specifics of the occlusion map and its implications for self-occlusion handling. Finally, addressing the limitations of the method, including the requirement for video datasets and potential adaptation collapse, would strengthen the manuscript.
