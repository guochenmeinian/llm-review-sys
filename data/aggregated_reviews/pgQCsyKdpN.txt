Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents AdaptiveISP, a task-driven and scene-adaptive image signal processing (ISP) method that utilizes deep reinforcement learning to optimize both ISP structures and parameters for object detection tasks. The authors propose a framework that dynamically adjusts the ISP pipeline based on scene requirements, aiming to enhance detection performance while managing computational costs. Experimental results indicate that AdaptiveISP outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, particularly in dynamic scenes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The AdaptiveISP pipeline effectively integrates ISP and detection, transforming a fixed process into a task-oriented tuning problem, showcasing significant potential for specific applications.
- The method demonstrates good performance on some datasets, with clear and high-quality figures that enhance understanding.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments are limited to YOLO detectors, which weakens the generalizability of the findings; broader validation across different architectures is necessary.
- The reliance on pre-trained object detection models raises concerns about performance in varying conditions, particularly in real-world scenarios with rapidly changing factors like lighting.
- The discussion on related works is insufficient, particularly regarding the ISP pipeline's impact on both task performance and image quality.
- The datasets used for comparison lack diversity, and there is a need for testing on more comprehensive datasets, such as DAWN, to validate performance in real-world applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation of the method's computational flexibility by providing a broader range of results for the $\lambda_c$ parameter and analyzing how time and memory demands change with varying ISP module pools. Additionally, conducting experiments on other object detection architectures and third-party datasets would strengthen the conclusions. The authors should also enhance the discussion on related works, particularly regarding the ISP pipeline's role in both task performance and image quality, and consider incorporating new benchmarks for evaluation.
