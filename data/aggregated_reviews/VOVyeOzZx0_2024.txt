### Key Points
This paper presents solutions via convex programs to estimate Fr√©chet bounds for Programmatic Weak Supervision (PWS). The authors utilize estimates of true labels through label models to derive bounds on the accuracy of weak labelers. They conduct experiments to validate these bounds and assess their performance with weak labelers of varying qualities. The proposed method addresses the challenge of model evaluation without a gold-standard dataset, leveraging dual optimization problems and smooth function relaxation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper provides a solid theoretical analysis of the PWS setup, focusing on individual weak labeler performance.
2. The authors derive consistent asymptotic distributions for their estimators and offer confidence intervals for finite sample data.
3. The application of Frechet bounds to programmatic weak supervision is novel and significant.

Weaknesses:  
1. The motivation for label set selection is unclear, as pruning weak labelers may not be necessary in scenarios where valid bounds are achieved.
2. The paper is somewhat technical and difficult to follow, particularly in explaining connections to appendices and the primary tools used for results.
3. The introduction lacks clarity regarding the problem and state-of-the-art issues, making it hard to grasp the contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by explicitly stating the context and relevance of label set selection in their approach. Additionally, enhancing the writing to better guide readers through technical sections and explicitly noting connections to appendices would aid comprehension. It would also be beneficial to discuss the practical applications of their method more thoroughly, including the conditions under which it can be effectively utilized. Lastly, improving the quality and explanation of figures, particularly Figure 1, would enhance the overall presentation.
