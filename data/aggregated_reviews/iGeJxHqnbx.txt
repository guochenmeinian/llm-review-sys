Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents QCircuitNet, a dataset that includes code descriptions of significant quantum algorithms along with natural language descriptions of computation problems, post-processing functions, and verification methods. The aim is to facilitate the training of machine learning algorithms for designing new quantum algorithms. The authors benchmark several established large language models (LLMs) using this dataset, revealing that the task exceeds the current capabilities of these models. The authors approach quantum algorithm design by treating quantum circuits as programming languages, which enhances scalability for large systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The innovative perspective of treating quantum algorithms as languages is both interesting and fruitful.
2. The dataset captures essential features of quantum algorithm designs, including problem settings, circuit descriptions, post-processing, and verification.
3. It includes most established quantum algorithms and primitives, providing a solid foundation for evaluation.

Weaknesses:
1. The dataset's size is currently too small to be broadly useful, limiting its effectiveness for extensive research.
2. The results from LLMs are disappointing, indicating challenges in applying LLM technology to complex quantum circuit generation tasks.
3. The verification function's binary nature may not adequately reflect partial correctness in algorithm implementations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors emphasize the theoretical benefits of using circuit descriptions for quantum algorithms, particularly regarding the scalability of representations.
2. The authors should consider expanding the dataset by incorporating random quantum or Clifford circuits to enhance its variety and size.
3. We suggest that the authors report the standard deviation of scores in their evaluation tables for a more comprehensive analysis.
4. The authors should clarify the limitations of their evaluation methods, particularly regarding the scalability of quantum circuit simulations.
5. We recommend that the authors explore training LLMs from scratch on this dataset, as this could yield more relevant insights than using pre-trained models.
6. The introduction could benefit from improved clarity and structure to better convey the significance of the research.
