### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for discovering data-dependent parameter space symmetries in neural networks by utilizing infinitesimal symmetries and Lie group generators. The authors propose to optimize over the group action approximated by a neural network and the infinitesimal generator of the parameter symmetry group to ensure loss invariance. The method extends symmetries identified in smaller subnetworks to larger architectures, revealing both known and novel symmetries, thus providing valuable insights into neural network structures.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The theoretical justification for analyzing hidden symmetries in smaller components to infer overall symmetries is solid and valuable for understanding weight space symmetries.
- The framework automates the discovery of symmetries, reducing manual effort and potentially simplifying the analysis of complex models.
- The paper is well-written and engaging, making it accessible to readers.

Weaknesses:  
- Contributions in Sections 2 and 3 are somewhat related but orthogonal, with Section 2 lacking practical significance.
- The complexity of the group action neural network raises concerns about its dependence on parameters, potentially limiting its usefulness.
- Hyperparameter tuning appears rough, which may diminish practical applicability and could lead to the vanishing of certain terms.
- The scalability of the framework to larger architectures is not fully explored, and the computational cost remains unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the practical significance of Section 2 by directly integrating its formulation into the subsequent sections. Additionally, consider simplifying the form of the group action to enhance its interpretability and usefulness. We suggest refining hyperparameter tuning to equalize loss terms, potentially enhancing the visibility of the block-diagonal structure in results. Clarifying the definition of $L_\text{Lie deriv}$ and the derivatives in Equation 2 prior to their introduction would enhance clarity. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore the potential for emergent symmetries in larger architectures and provide empirical validation on more complex models.
