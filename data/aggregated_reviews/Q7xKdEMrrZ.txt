Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a significantly larger dataset for antibody-antigen epitope prediction and introduces a performant graph convolutional network (GCN) model, WALLE. The dataset is three times larger than previous efforts and is specifically framed for the classification of classical residues in antigens and bipartite edges between antibodies and antigens. The authors leverage sound biological intuition in constructing the dataset and provide a clear mathematical description of the task. The proposed model WALLE serves as a strong baseline for future research in this area.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work introduces a robust and well-structured dataset for epitope prediction, which is the largest available for this task.
- The authors effectively discuss previous works and the rationale behind their methodological choices, including the use of GCNs and various embedding generation methods.
- The paper is well-documented, allowing for reproducibility and ease of use through a PyTorch Geometric dataset object.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset currently excludes certain therapeutic antibody formats, such as VHHs/nanobodies, which could enhance its applicability.
- The description of the model's decoder is ambiguous and lacks sufficient detail.
- Comparisons with larger models like ESM2-650M and AF2-Multimer are needed to strengthen the baseline performance claims.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset composition by including additional antibody formats, such as VHHs, and provide a visual representation of the antibody types included. Additionally, we suggest that the authors elaborate on the decoder's functionality to clarify its operation. To enhance the baseline comparisons, the authors should consider using the larger ESM2-650M model and include results from AF2-Multimer. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clearly articulate the limitations of their work in a dedicated section and expand the related work to include other antibody-antigen datasets.
