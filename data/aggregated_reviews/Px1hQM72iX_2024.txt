Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for user representation in retrieval and recommendation systems through a density-based approach that utilizes Gaussian process regression (GPR). The authors propose the GPR4DUR method, which aims to enhance the performance of personalized recommendations by effectively capturing user interest variability and incorporating uncertainty-awareness. The paper includes extensive experiments demonstrating the method's efficacy compared to existing techniques and introduces new evaluation protocols tailored for multi-interest retrieval.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces a unique density-based user representation method that creatively redefines user representation by focusing on the density of user interactions.  
- The quality of the research is high, supported by thorough experimentation and detailed evaluations, showing significant performance improvements.  
- The authors effectively apply Gaussian Processes to characterize user interests, incorporating uncertainty to identify niche interests.  
- A comprehensive suite of evaluation metrics tailored for multi-interest contexts is presented, providing a robust framework for future research.  

Weaknesses:  
- The proposed method's reliance on item categories as auxiliary information may lead to unfair comparisons with baselines that only consider user-item interactions.  
- Important baselines, such as STOSA, DT4Rec, and BERD+, are missing from the comparisons, which could impact the validity of the results.  
- The Interest-wise Relevance (IR) metric may not be reliable due to its dependence on potentially inaccurate learned item embeddings.  
- The core motivation of the paper is not clearly articulated, particularly regarding the adaptability and uncertainty aspects of the proposed method.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the differences between SUR and MUR, providing reasonable explanations or proofs for why MUR is superior. Additionally, the authors should define the specific manifestations of adaptability and uncertainty in the recommendation scenario, along with clear assumptions and explanations. The introduction should be revised to better connect the motivation with the proposed method, addressing how manually selecting clusters limits adaptability. Furthermore, we suggest including a more detailed analysis of the relationship between multiple interests and uncertainty, as well as incorporating additional user features in the ranking stage to enhance accuracy. Lastly, the manuscript should be proofread to correct typos and improve overall clarity.
