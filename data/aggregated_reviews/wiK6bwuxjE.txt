Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a monocular 3D detection framework, MonoMAE, inspired by Masked Autoencoders (MAE), aimed at improving detection in the presence of object occlusions. It employs a depth-aware masking module to simulate occlusions by adaptively masking non-occluded object features based on depth, alongside a lightweight completion network that reconstructs these masked features. The framework generates training pairs of non-occluded and occluded representations, enhancing its occlusion handling capabilities while maintaining low computational overhead during inference.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method outperforms conventional techniques across datasets like KITTI and nuScenes, demonstrating its effectiveness and achieving real-time inference.
2. An extensive ablation study substantiates the impact of the proposed module.
3. The framework is well-structured, clearly presenting the problem, methodology, and results.

Weaknesses:
1. Performance improvement is marginal, particularly on cross-validation in Table 6, and there is a lack of evaluation on the Waymo dataset.
2. The reliance on depth-aware masking may not accurately replicate natural occlusion patterns, potentially affecting model robustness.
3. The paper lacks detailed analysis on the accuracy of the occlusion classification network and the query completion network, which are crucial for understanding overall performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including results on the Waymo dataset to strengthen generalizability claims. Additionally, providing a detailed analysis of the computational efficiency, including speed and resource usage, would enhance the practicality of MonoMAE for real-time applications. Clarifying how occlusion levels are defined and their influence on training and evaluation processes will provide a clearer understanding of the methodology. Finally, including performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for the Non-Occluded Query Grouping classification would be beneficial, as would a report on the accuracy of the query completion network to demonstrate its contribution to overall detection performance.
