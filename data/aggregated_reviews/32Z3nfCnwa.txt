Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of adversarial contextual multi-armed bandits (MAB) with a focus on variance-aware regret bounds, utilizing a realizable general function class for approximating context-dependent rewards. The authors prove both upper and lower regret bounds that depend on cumulative data variance rather than the number of episodes, T. They analyze three settings: (1) strong adversary, (2) weak adversary, and (3) learning from a function class, providing matching lower bounds for each. The algorithm adapts the SquareCB method from Foster and Rakhlin (2020) and incorporates a confidence function set to enhance learning efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The variance-dependent regret bound is a significant contribution to the reinforcement learning community, particularly in contextual bandits.
- The comprehensive analysis across three settings, with both upper and lower bounds, demonstrates the authors' extensive work.

Weaknesses:
- The literature review lacks clarity, particularly in distinguishing between variance-dependent bounds and minimax regret bounds.
- The differences among the three settings are not well articulated; the authors should adopt accepted terminology such as "oblivious" and "adaptive adversary."
- The necessity of the Eluder dimension in all bounds is not intuitively explained.
- The implications of using a confidence set of functions on running time complexity are not addressed.
- The paper contains comments indicating it may have been rushed, suggesting a lack of thorough proofreading.
- The introduction of the Hellinger-Eluder dimension lacks justification and appropriate citations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the related literature review by clearly separating variance-dependent bounds from minimax regret bounds. Additionally, we suggest using established terminology for the adversarial settings to enhance comparability with existing literature. It would be beneficial for the authors to provide an intuitive explanation for the necessity of the Eluder dimension in their bounds. Furthermore, addressing the running time complexity implications of the confidence set of functions is essential. We also advise the authors to thoroughly proofread the manuscript to eliminate comments and ensure clarity. Finally, justifying the use of the Hellinger-Eluder dimension with appropriate citations or explanations is crucial for the paper's credibility.
