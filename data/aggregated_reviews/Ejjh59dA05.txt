### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for generating counterfactual explanations (CFE) for node classification tasks in graph neural networks (GNNs) using thresholded Banzhaf values. The authors claim that their method is training-free, efficient, and theoretically demonstrates lower sample complexity compared to Shapley values. The proposed approach is shown to outperform existing baselines in terms of time efficiency and robustness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The theoretical analysis of computational efficiency is generally sound.
- The method provides a novel application of Banzhaf values for generating counterfactual explanations without additional training.
- Empirical results indicate that Banzhaf values are more efficient than Shapley values in certain contexts.

Weaknesses:
- The authors compare fewer baselines and conduct experiments on only three artificial datasets, raising concerns about the generalizability of their findings to real-world applications.
- The performance gain over Shapley values is not significant, which may limit the perceived contribution of the work.
- The paper lacks clarity in certain technical aspects, such as the properties of semivalues and the notation used throughout.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve their experimental design by including a broader range of baselines and conducting experiments on real-world datasets to enhance the credibility of their findings. Additionally, the authors should clarify the notation and definitions used in the paper, particularly regarding the properties of semivalues and the MSR estimator. It would also be beneficial to discuss the limitations and societal implications of their work, as well as to elaborate on the robustness of their method in the presence of noisy data. Finally, we suggest that the authors consider developing a new metric that evaluates both fidelity and time efficiency holistically.
