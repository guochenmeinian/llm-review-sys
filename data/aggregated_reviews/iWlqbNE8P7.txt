Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework named TREAT (Time-Reversal Symmetry ODE) aimed at enhancing dynamical system modeling through a physics-informed approach. The authors propose incorporating Time-Reversal Symmetry (TRS) as a regularization term to improve model precision, demonstrating its ability to preserve energy in conservative systems and provide strong inductive bias for non-conservative, reversible systems. Theoretical proofs indicate that TRS minimizes higher-order Taylor terms, enhancing modeling accuracy. The framework's effectiveness is validated through experiments on nine diverse datasets, showing improvements over existing models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The introduction of TRS as a regularization term for dynamical system modeling is intuitive and well-motivated.  
- Theoretical analysis shows that TRS minimizes higher-order Taylor terms, enhancing modeling accuracy.  
- Extensive experiments demonstrate that TREAT outperforms other neural ODE models.  
- The implementation of the regularization term is straightforward, and the results indicate significant improvements over baseline models.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper only utilizes graphODE as the backbone; it would be beneficial to include experiments with other neuralODE methods to demonstrate compatibility.  
- The theoretical analysis in Theorem 3.1 bounds the error in the embedding space, but the loss function in Equation 10 describes the error from the original space, necessitating clarification on the encoder/decoder error.  
- The paper lacks a comprehensive review of other energy-preserving/time-reversal neural ODE solvers.  
- The code requires cleaning and proper documentation, including docstrings and comments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including experiments with other neuralODE methods, such as vanilla neuralODE, to demonstrate the compatibility of TRS regularization. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the difference between the error bounds in the embedding space and the original space due to encoder/decoder errors. A more comprehensive review of existing energy-preserving/time-reversal neural ODE solvers would enhance the paper's contribution. Finally, we urge the authors to clean and document the code thoroughly to facilitate reproducibility.
