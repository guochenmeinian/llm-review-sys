Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel tensor decomposition approach based on Legendre decomposition and convex optimization, specifically designed for non-negative tensors. The authors interpret tensors as probability measures over multidimensional discrete spaces, allowing for a regulated complexity that avoids the challenge of selecting an optimal rank for decomposition. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method demonstrates competitive accuracy and computation time compared to existing low-rank approximation techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is innovative, featuring a convex optimization formulation and eliminating the need for rank parameter tuning.
- The paper is well-structured, clearly written, and effectively illustrates the design principles and interactions among modes.

Weaknesses:
- The advantages of the proposed approach over baseline methods are not clearly demonstrated, particularly regarding the quality of low-rank approximations in datasets with graphic images.
- The paper lacks a thorough comparison with effective rank-adaptive methods, such as the rank-adaptive TT-cross method and tensor ring.
- There are no estimates of the computational complexity, leaving unclear the dimensions that limit the method's applicability.
- The definition of Legendre decomposition is vague, making the paper less self-contained and complicating the verification of correctness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the advantages of their method by providing specific examples of reconstructed images from datasets with graphic images. Additionally, a more comprehensive comparison with effective rank-adaptive methods should be included to substantiate claims of superiority. The authors should also provide estimates of the computational complexity and clarify the dimensions that may limit the applicability of their approach. Furthermore, we suggest refining the definition of Legendre decomposition and ensuring that the optimization method and proof of convexity are presented with a clearer structure. Lastly, addressing the repeated phrases in the text and enhancing the positioning of graphics would improve the overall presentation.
