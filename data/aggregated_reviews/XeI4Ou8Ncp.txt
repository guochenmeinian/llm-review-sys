### Key Points
This paper presents a framework that utilizes a large language model (LLM) to generate explainable next-day stock predictions from web-mined social texts. The framework comprises three modules: a summarization module that extracts key information, an explanation module that employs a self-reflective agent and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for generating predictions, and a prediction module that fine-tunes the LLM. The authors claim that the SEP framework outperforms traditional deep learning methods and pre-trained LLMs in terms of prediction accuracy, Matthews correlation coefficient, and Sharpe ratio, while also demonstrating the quality of generated explanations through qualitative analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a significant problem in explainable stock prediction using LLMs.
2. The SEP framework demonstrates efficient performance.
3. The organization and writing of the paper are commendable.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the self-reflective agent is limited, as similar concepts have been applied in prior works.
2. The summarization module's effectiveness requires verification and discussion in an ablation study.
3. There is insufficient verification that the SEP framework can effectively weigh the varying impacts of chaotic social texts on stock prices.
4. The paper lacks a clear definition of what constitutes a good explanation and relies on subjective qualitative analysis.
5. The comparison with existing LLM-based stock prediction frameworks is absent, limiting the evaluation of state-of-the-art performance.
6. Ethical implications of using LLMs for stock prediction are not discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of technical details, particularly in sections like 3.3.2, and provide a clearer explanation of the training data used. Additionally, we suggest that the authors include a quantitative analysis to support claims about the SEP framework's ability to weigh stock factors and sentiments, as mentioned in section 4.2.2. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to present ablation results by removing the summarization module in section 4.3 to validate its impact. Lastly, we advise the authors to address the potential ethical and social implications of their framework and suggest ways to mitigate associated risks.
