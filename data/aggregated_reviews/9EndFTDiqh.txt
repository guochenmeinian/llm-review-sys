Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates whether to train models in parameter space or function space, specifically through the proposed function-space MAP (FS-MAP) objective. The authors analyze the advantages and disadvantages of both parameter space MAP (PS-MAP) and FS-MAP, demonstrating that neither is universally superior. They provide a scalable approximation for FS-MAP, addressing practical concerns in deep learning applications. The empirical evaluation includes synthetic and real-world benchmarks, revealing insights into the performance of FS-MAP compared to PS-MAP.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a thorough analysis of the pros and cons of both parameter space and function space MAP estimation.
- It presents a scalable approximation for large neural networks, expanding the applicability of function space MAP estimation.
- The writing is clear, and the findings are likely to be impactful for future research in function-space inference.

Weaknesses:
- The universality of the demonstrated pros and cons is questionable, given the reliance on a relatively simple toy dataset.
- The empirical results on real-world data do not consistently show advantages for FS-MAP over PS-MAP, raising concerns about the methodology.
- The paper lacks a related work section, which limits its contextualization within existing literature.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical evaluation by testing FS-MAP on a wider range of tasks beyond classification to assess its generalizability. Additionally, we suggest including a related work section to better situate the contributions within the existing literature on function-space inference. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the definitions and mathematical formulations in the main text to enhance accessibility, ensuring that critical concepts are self-contained. Finally, we encourage a more thorough discussion of the experimental results, particularly addressing the similarities observed between FS-MAP and PS-MAP in various settings.
