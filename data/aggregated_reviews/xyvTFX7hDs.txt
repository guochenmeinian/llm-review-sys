### Key Points
This paper presents a data augmentation approach for multilingual multimodal reasoning, focusing on cultural concept adaptation. The authors propose constructing an external cross-language concept mapping graph to correlate concepts across cultures, which facilitates word-level and phrase-level replacements in the dataset for training. Additionally, the method incorporates a three-tier code-switching strategy and a concept-based mixup for multimodal data augmentation. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements over baseline models in zero-shot and few-shot settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to understand.
- It introduces a novel external cross-language concept mapping graph that effectively enhances dataset diversity.
- The experiments are comprehensive and provide strong support for the proposed method's efficacy.

Weaknesses:
- The performance degradation of ablation models compared to the baseline is not clearly articulated, leaving uncertainty about which data augmentation strategy contributes to performance gains.
- Key details regarding the concept-based mixup method and the selection process for low-resource cultural concepts are insufficiently explained.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the performance impact of individual data augmentation strategies by conducting simultaneous ablation studies. Additionally, please provide more detailed information about the Concept-Based Mixup method, specifically the object detection algorithm used and the process for replacing high-resource image elements with low-resource ones. Furthermore, we suggest elaborating on the selection criteria for low-resource cultural concepts and considering the potential for code-switching between low-resource cultures to enhance data augmentation. Lastly, conducting a human evaluation of the generated cultural adaptation graph quality and an error analysis to identify model prediction patterns would strengthen the study.
