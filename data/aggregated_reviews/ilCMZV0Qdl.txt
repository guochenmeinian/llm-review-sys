### Key Points
This paper presents the Emotion-Semantic Correlation Model (ESCM) aimed at improving empathetic response generation by leveraging dynamic emotion-semantic correlations. It identifies the limitations of static word embeddings in existing empathetic dialogue systems (EDS) and proposes a model that constructs dynamic emotion-semantic vectors. Experiments conducted on the EMPATHETIC-DIALOGUES dataset demonstrate improvements over several baselines, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The identified issue of static word embeddings is relevant not only to EDS but also to broader emotion analysis tasks.
- The research is comprehensive, with validation through both automatic and human evaluations.
- The approach is well-founded in linguistic research and includes extensive experiments that show effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for the study lacks persuasive examples, particularly regarding the importance of emotional word relations.
- Some terminology is confusing, leading to ambiguity in understanding the concepts of emotion and semantics.
- The paper does not adequately address recent advancements in EDS, such as the Emp-RFT model, which may overshadow the proposed contributions.
- Clarity and intuitiveness of explanations could be improved, as convoluted language hinders understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their explanations, particularly in sections that are currently convoluted. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include more recent studies in the discussion to contextualize the contributions of ESCM. We suggest that the authors explore the use of contextualized word embeddings, such as LLMs or ELMo, to enhance the model's performance. Furthermore, analyzing the computational efficiency of the model and its performance with pre-trained language models (PLMs) could provide valuable insights. Lastly, a thorough proofreading of the paper is necessary to correct formatting errors and improve overall presentation.
