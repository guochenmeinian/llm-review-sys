Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method to enhance weakly-supervised semantic segmentation using sparse annotations through a Potts relaxation approach, extending traditional CRF-like methods. The authors propose second-order polynomial relaxations to address limitations in existing methods and evaluate their framework on the PASCAL dataset. They introduce a soft self-labeling mechanism that generates soft pseudo-labels to capture uncertainty and a collision cross-entropy loss. The work also provides new experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the Potts model across various architectures, including ViT, and discusses the implications of these findings for the broader field of segmentation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is technically sound and well-explained.
- The paper addresses an important challenge in reducing manual annotation efforts in image segmentation.
- The approach is intuitive and easy to reproduce, supported by experiments showing strong performance against previous methods.
- The authors have incorporated significant experimental results that address previous concerns, particularly regarding the Potts model's applicability to ViT.
- The paper contributes to the understanding of CRF relaxations and their role in weakly supervised semantic segmentation, providing a proof-of-concept that simple ideas can outperform complex systems.

Weaknesses:
- Comparisons with recent methods in sparsely annotated semantic segmentation are insufficient, neglecting point-supervised challenges.
- The reported 1% improvement in mIoU is perceived as lacking significance, raising questions about the novelty of the work.
- Evaluation is limited to the PASCAL dataset, with results from larger datasets like Cityscapes and ADE20K not adequately emphasized.
- The absence of per-category mIoU data leaves uncertainty about the method's effectiveness across different classes.
- The paper does not assess the efficiency of Potts relaxation in terms of FLOPs, which is crucial given the computational costs associated with CRF-like methods.
- The significance of the reported performance improvements is questionable, with a lack of error bars and clarity on the baseline models used.
- The rationale behind design choices is not sufficiently explained from a vision perspective, and the motivation for soft labeling is unclear.
- Some minor writing issues remain unaddressed, which detracts from the overall clarity of the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors improve the comprehensiveness of their comparisons by including recent works and discussing point-supervised methods.
2. The authors should conduct additional experiments on larger datasets and clarify the significance of their results, including standard deviations.
3. We suggest that the authors evaluate the efficiency of Potts relaxation by reporting FLOPs and comparing them with existing methods.
4. The motivation for using soft labeling should be articulated more clearly in the abstract and throughout the paper.
5. We encourage the authors to provide mIoU per category to assess the method's effectiveness across different classes.
6. We recommend that the authors improve the abstract by explicitly stating the importance of relaxation as their main contribution and clarify the motivation behind "managing the scope of this study" in Section 2.1.
7. To address concerns regarding the impact on other segmentation models, we suggest including more detailed experimental results for ViT and discussing the significance of the Potts model across architectures.
8. Lastly, we urge the authors to address minor writing issues in the final version to improve clarity and readability.
