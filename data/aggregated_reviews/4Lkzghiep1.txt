Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies online strategic classification from a combinatorial perspective, introducing the Strategic Littlestone dimension, which captures the complexity of the hypothesis class and manipulation graph. The authors demonstrate that this dimension quantifies the minimax number of mistakes made by deterministic learners in the realizable setting and provide improved upper bounds in the agnostic setting. They also address scenarios where the manipulation graph is unknown to the learner, deriving bounds on the minimax value in both realizable and agnostic settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- The problem setting is well-motivated, and the technical contributions are novel, particularly the proof of the lower bound in terms of the Strategic Littlestone dimension.
- The results improve upon previous work and provide a tight characterization of the realizable setting.

Weaknesses:
- There is a lack of lower bounds for the minimax regret in terms of the Strategic Littlestone dimension, particularly in the realizable setting.
- The paper does not address randomized learners in the realizable setting, leaving uncertainty about the characterization of realizable strategic online learnability.
- The focus on deterministic learners in the agnostic setting raises questions about the utility of the Strategic Littlestone dimension, which currently appears to characterize only deterministic realizable learnability.
- The intuition behind the Strategic Littlestone dimension is not fully developed, making it difficult to understand its implications compared to traditional Littlestone trees.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on lower bounds for randomized learners to clarify the relationship between deterministic and randomized realizability. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more detailed explanation of the intuition behind the Strategic Littlestone dimension, including a comparison with shattered Littlestone trees. Enhancing the proof sketch of Theorem 3.2 and including the full proof in the main text would also aid in comprehension. Finally, addressing the computational complexity of Algorithm 1 would strengthen the paper's contributions.
