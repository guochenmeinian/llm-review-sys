### Key Points
This paper presents a novel prompt-based editing approach for text style transfer, transforming the problem into a classification task rather than traditional generation methods. The authors propose a combination of modules, including an edit-based search method (steepest-ascent hill climbing) to generate candidate sentences, evaluated through a scoring function based on style, fluency, and semantic similarity. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art prompting systems across three benchmark datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed prompt-based editing method is applicable to various problems involving large models, particularly where output consistency with input is crucial.
- The experimental results are robust, with detailed analysis supporting the claims.
- The approach addresses the error accumulation issue common in prompt-based methods and shows strong performance in experiments.

Weaknesses:
- The clarity of the candidate text generation process using the search method is insufficiently detailed.
- The core reliance on the steepest-ascent hill climbing algorithm may render the work incremental, as it closely resembles previous methodologies.
- The approach may struggle with complex styles and requires careful tuning of hyperparameters, limiting its applicability in low-resource settings.
- The writing quality needs improvement, particularly in grammar and punctuation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the candidate text generation process by providing a more detailed description of the search method. Additionally, consider addressing the inherent limitations of the steepest-ascent hill climbing algorithm and exploring alternative methods that could enhance flexibility in style transfer. It would be beneficial to investigate the feasibility of the approach with more complex styles and discuss the computational implications of the scoring prompts in practical settings. Lastly, we encourage the authors to refine the writing for better clarity and coherence throughout the paper.
