### Key Points
This paper presents Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA), a method for assessing the dynamical similarity between systems, particularly neural networks. The authors combine and modify techniques from Dynamical Mode Decomposition (DMD) and Statistical Shape Analysis to focus on dynamics rather than geometry. They demonstrate the method's effectiveness in distinguishing between systems with different dynamics and identifying similarities across various neural network architectures trained for similar tasks. Additionally, the authors extend the analysis of Williams et al. (2022) into the time domain, providing a theoretical grounding for their method, addressing noise dynamics, and discussing matrix similarity in the context of the Cayley transform. However, concerns arise regarding the fairness of comparisons with existing methods, as the competing method lacks access to time information, suggesting that a stronger baseline could enhance the context for interpreting results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is technically sound and elegantly combines existing techniques.
- The extension of analysis into the time domain is a valuable contribution.
- The analysis effectively captures similarities in neural dynamics that traditional methods overlook.
- The theoretical grounding for the method has been improved, and previous concerns regarding Figure 4 and noise dynamics have been addressed.
- The writing is generally clear, and the experiments are well-chosen and executed.

Weaknesses:
- The separation of experimental setup and results in the manuscript is confusing, requiring unnecessary back-and-forth reading.
- Some experimental details are unclear, and the reliance on prior knowledge from cited papers is excessive.
- Comparisons with existing methods may be misleading due to the lack of time information in the competing approach.
- The current metric for matrix similarity may not fully capture the necessary equivalence due to restrictions of the Cayley transform.
- The claim that DSA measures topological structure lacks sufficient proof and clarity, particularly regarding the dynamics of the eigenspace.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization of sections 2.3 and 3 to present experimental setups and results together, enhancing clarity. Additionally, provide brief descriptions of specific tasks, such as the 3-bit flip flop, within the paper to aid reader comprehension. Clarifying notation changes in equations and the implications of the deformation analysis would also enhance understanding. We suggest using more cautious language in claims regarding DSA's ability to capture topological similarity, such as "may identify similarity" instead of definitive statements. Furthermore, we recommend incorporating a comparison to a spectral method that utilizes time information, such as applying the method of Williams et al. (2022) to a spectral representation of the data. Explicitly summarizing the noise situation in the manuscript by mentioning the three key points regarding deterministic settings, the effects of noise, and the practical benefits of small amounts of noise would be beneficial. It would also be helpful to clarify in the text around Eq. 4 that $d=0$ implies the two $A$ matrices are (unitarily) similar, and to note that the converse is not generally true. Additionally, we encourage the authors to explore optimizing the generic matrix similarity metric using gradient descent and to consider defining an analogous metric to DSA based on eigenvalues, while addressing the potential issues of non-normality. Lastly, we suggest mentioning the limitation of DSA's sensitivity to changes in timescales.
