### Key Points
This paper presents a method for detecting fraudulent users on the Internet, motivated by the challenge that fraudulent users often mimic ordinary users, leading to similar features and interactions despite differing labels. The authors propose a disentangled feature learning method to differentiate user behaviors and a capsule voting method to consolidate small capsules into larger ones. Additionally, a contrastive learning method is introduced to address the issue of label scarcity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CapsGI across four real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is clearly organized and tackles an important real-world problem in online social networks.
- The motivation is well-articulated and empirically supported, particularly in Section 5.4.
- Extensive experiments yield significant improvements (over 3%) with standard deviations provided.

Weaknesses:
- The authors' interpretation of 'disentangled' representation in Section 4.1 lacks clarity and does not align with established definitions, resembling multi-head attention without imposing specific projection requirements.
- The distinction between the proposed capsule voting and existing graph pooling methods is unclear, as it resembles techniques like DiffPool and StructPool.
- The term "scalability" in Section 5.5 is misapplied, as it typically refers to performance with increasing input data size.
- Some manuscript sections are unclear, particularly regarding the camouflage aspect of fraudsters using GNNs.
- Benchmark datasets lack sufficient description, particularly regarding the number of labeled fraudsters.
- The related work section does not adequately cover non-GNN approaches.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the disentangled representation in Section 4.1 to align with established definitions and ensure that the independence of features is demonstrated. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the differences between their capsule voting method and existing pooling techniques, such as DiffPool and StructPool. Furthermore, we advise the authors to accurately use "scalability" in Section 5.5 and provide a clearer explanation of the camouflage aspect of fraudsters using GNNs. It would also be beneficial to enhance the description of benchmark datasets, particularly the labeling of fraudsters, and to expand the related work section to include successful non-GNN approaches. Lastly, we recommend that the authors provide information on the computation time required for their approach, as this could impact the perceived performance gains.
