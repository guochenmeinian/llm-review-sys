### Key Points
This paper presents a method to identify and filter damaging passages in retrieve-then-read architectures, achieving at least a 10% accuracy improvement on two popular QA tasks. The authors categorize passages into five types based on their Exact Match (EM) results and demonstrate that removing definite negative and semi-negative passages can enhance performance. The study highlights that low attention scores can contribute to correct predictions, while high attention scores do not guarantee accuracy. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The methodology for identifying different passage types and relevant probe patterns is interesting and lays groundwork for understanding detrimental effects on FiD-based architectures.  
- The insights gained from experimental results can inform future research directions.  
- The simplicity of the proposed method is a notable advantage.

Weaknesses:  
- The writing and organization of the paper require improvement, with sections lacking clarity and prioritization.  
- The paper does not adequately explain why more information can be detrimental to model performance, presenting observations without hypotheses.  
- The approach's reliance on gold-answer data for passage selection limits its applicability to real-world scenarios, and the binary classifier tends to classify all passages as useful.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization and clarity of the paper, particularly in sections discussing Selection Inference, Attention Analysis, and Binary Classification. The authors should provide more details on how the binary classification operates and whether it considers the question as input. Additionally, we suggest addressing the lack of concrete solutions for identifying harmful passages without gold-answer data. Clarifying the experimental section and relating findings to the main points would enhance comprehension. Finally, we encourage the authors to refine the writing style for better readability and to ensure that all figures and captions are consistent and clear.
