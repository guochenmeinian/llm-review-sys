Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to evaluating explainability methods by addressing the issue of encoding, defined as when the explanation's identity provides additional information about the target beyond the selected input values. The authors propose a measure termed "ENCODE-METER" and introduce the DET-X score, which is designed to strongly detect encoding. They analyze existing evaluation methods, categorize them into weak and strong detectors, and empirically validate DET-X through experiments on simulated and real-world datasets, including image recognition and sentiment analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a precise mathematical definition of encoding, filling a significant gap in interpretability literature.
- The classification of evaluation methods into weak and strong detectors provides a clear framework for assessing feature attribution robustness.
- The authors rigorously prove that DET-X effectively detects encoding, differentiating it from existing methods.
- Empirical validation on both simulated and real-world applications demonstrates the practical utility of DET-X.
- The paper highlights the relevance of its contributions to current AI applications by uncovering encoding in LLM-generated explanations.

Weaknesses:
- Clarity is a major concern; the paper is dense and at times unintelligible.
- Weak contextualization with prior work, as related literature is succinctly presented in the main text and some is relegated to the appendix.
- The proposed DET-X score may require complex implementation and computational resources, potentially limiting its practical adoption.
- Experiments are limited to specific datasets and tasks, suggesting a need for broader application to strengthen claims.
- The paper lacks a dedicated limitations section, which could provide clearer insights into the constraints of the proposed methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by restructuring the paper to enhance readability, including spacing between paragraphs and simplifying dense sections. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more intuitive definition of "encoding explanations" earlier in the paper, ideally in the abstract or introduction. To strengthen contextualization, we advise integrating related work into the main text rather than the appendix. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to evaluate DET-X on a wider variety of datasets and tasks to assess its generalizability. Lastly, we recommend including a dedicated limitations section to transparently discuss the assumptions and potential constraints of their work.
