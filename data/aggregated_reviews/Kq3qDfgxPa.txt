### Key Points
This paper presents ROPU, a courier route planning framework that addresses the uncertainty of pickup requests using a spatio-temporal attention network for prediction and a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for route optimization. The authors evaluate their solution with data from a major logistics company in China, demonstrating improved performance in terms of pickup overdue rate, delivery overdue rate, and travel distance compared to existing methods. The paper includes a thorough discussion of the problem and its significance in the context of last-mile delivery.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors utilize a variety of baseline methods and conduct ablation experiments, enhancing the reliability of their results.
- The detailed explanation of the ROPU framework aids reader comprehension.
- The evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed solution in a real-world context.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset is limited to a small geographical area and short time span, which may affect the generalizability of the findings.
- The model does not account for variations in courier proficiency, raising concerns about practical applicability.
- The evaluation metrics are insufficient, lacking measures like delivery accuracy and cost-effectiveness.
- The absence of pseudocode and parameter sensitivity analysis diminishes reproducibility and reliability.
- The paper is poorly organized, with unclear expressions and formatting issues.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset by including diverse geographical locations and extending the time frame to enhance generalizability. Additionally, consider incorporating variations in courier proficiency and expanding the evaluation metrics to include delivery accuracy, speed, and cost-effectiveness. Providing pseudocode and conducting parameter sensitivity analysis would enhance reproducibility. Furthermore, we suggest clarifying the design of the RL algorithm, particularly the state and reward definitions, and improving the writing clarity in sections discussing conformal prediction and the spatial-temporal attention network. Lastly, addressing the paper's relevance to the Web conference and refining the organization and formatting would significantly enhance its quality.
