### Key Points
This paper presents a three-stage framework for experimental design that includes data collection, model retraining, and model deployment, offering performance guarantees relevant to real-life machine learning practitioners. The authors propose a solid theoretical mathematical foundation, supported by empirical results demonstrating improvements over baseline methods. However, the experiments are conducted in synthetic settings, which may not accurately reflect real-world data distributions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper has a robust theoretical foundation with numerous definitions, proofs, and lemmas.
- The introduction of a three-stage framework integrating sequential experimental design is innovative and relevant for large-scale data applications.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on synthetic experiments limits the applicability and lacks performance comparisons on real-world datasets.
- The theoretical concepts could benefit from additional context to enhance readability, and some demonstrations, such as the axes in figures, are not clearly explained.
- The absence of a Bayesian approach raises concerns about the appropriateness of the study for the workshop, and the lack of preliminary information on experimental design may hinder understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of theoretical concepts by providing additional context and explicit explanations for figures. It would be beneficial to include a comprehensive conclusion that summarizes the findings. Additionally, we suggest incorporating a Bayesian approach and enhancing the discussion on the novelty of the framework, along with more descriptive explanations of vague statements related to experimental design. Finally, we encourage the authors to conduct experiments on real-world datasets to strengthen the applicability of their findings.
