Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents BIOSCAN-1M, a large-scale high-resolution image dataset of insects, labeled with taxonomy data (primarily order and family) and benchmark results using conventional CNN/Transformer-based image classification. The dataset comprises 1 million RGB images, taxonomic classifications, and genetic information from insects collected in Costa Rica, Canada, and South Africa. The authors provide baseline results for deep learning models with different backbones and loss functions, highlighting high accuracy for common classes but lower accuracy for minority classes. Additionally, the paper includes a comprehensive analysis of the BIOSCAN_1M_Insect dataset, detailing classification tasks for Insect-Order and Diptera-Family using various model architectures and loss functions. The authors conducted 24 trials with three dataset variations (Large, Medium, Small) and four unique models, ultimately selecting the ViT-Base-Patch16-224 with Cross-Entropy loss as the best performer. The revised manuscript includes confusion matrices, updated experimental results, and a discussion of future work involving DNA barcode sequences and Barcode Index Numbers (BIN).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The dataset is substantial, representing significant expert effort in annotation, making it a valuable resource for taxonomy-based classification.  
- The authors conducted extensive experimentation with a well-defined methodology, including the use of multiple seeds for validation.  
- The paper effectively integrates feedback from reviewers, enhancing clarity and depth, particularly regarding dataset limitations and classification challenges.  
- The inclusion of confusion matrices and detailed experimental results in the supplementary materials strengthens the manuscript's rigor.  
- The authors provide a clear explanation of the domain background and sufficient detail for machine learning practitioners.  
- Thoughtful decisions regarding dataset splits and subsetting enhance usability for a variety of users and computational constraints.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks a discussion on the limitations of the dataset, particularly regarding the annotation process and the consistency of classification results.  
- The dataset's limited fine-grained information at the species level poses challenges for establishing benchmark tasks.  
- Some claims regarding dataset content may be misleading, particularly concerning the availability of species-level information.  
- The initial performance results for Medium-Diptera-Family classification lacked justification, necessitating revisions.  
- The authors acknowledge that the current model performance may not fully address class imbalance issues.  
- There are minor areas that could benefit from further clarification to strengthen the overall impact of the findings.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the dataset's annotation process, specifying whether labels were assigned by human experts, barcode matching, or a combination of both. Additionally, we suggest including benchmarks for more challenging classification tasks, such as genus or species, to better illustrate the dataset's utility. Providing confusion matrices in supplementary materials would enhance the understanding of classification performance across different classes. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore the use of DNA barcodes in future tasks and to clarify the relationship between the dataset and existing biological datasets, particularly regarding potential overlaps and use cases. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the limitations associated with the BIOSCAN_1M_Insect dataset by providing more detailed discussions in the main text. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explore advanced data augmentation techniques, such as random vertical filtering and random rotation, to potentially enhance model performance. Lastly, we encourage the authors to consider developing a benchmark task for the species level as future data becomes available, which could significantly contribute to the field.
