### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into enhancing negation understanding in pretrained language models (PLMs) by continuing the pre-training of BERT models. The authors propose a technique that involves two epochs of pre-training on 5000 examples featuring negative statements, utilizing a regularization term to prevent "catastrophic forgetting" and restricting updates to the top layers of BERT models. Their loss function incorporates a masked language modeling (MLM) objective and a next sentence objective, with specific masking strategies for negated sentences. The results indicate significant reductions in error rates for various models on the negated LAMA dataset, outperforming existing negation models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed framework with Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) regularization and weighted loss is innovative and effectively enhances negation understanding.
- Empirical evidence demonstrates that the negated augmented models outperform classical models across multiple benchmarks, showing robust performance improvements.

Weaknesses:
- The approach relies on very specific training techniques, raising concerns about its generalizability and robustness.
- The data generation process is limited, as it extracts only two sentences from each Wikipedia page, potentially affecting the results if errors occur.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the rationale behind updating only the top layers of the models compared to fine-tuning all layers. Additionally, expanding the data generation process to include a broader range of examples would enhance the robustness of the findings. Finally, addressing the explainability of the proposed method in terms of how it aids negation understanding would strengthen the paper's contributions.
