### Key Points
This paper presents an improvement in the sample complexity of diffusion models through parallel sampling techniques, achieving $\tilde{O}(\text{poly} \log d)$ results for reverse SDE and PFODE settings. The authors provide a general version of Girsanov’s theorem to address the dependence introduced by Picard iteration. The analysis includes both SDE and ODE samplers, marking a significant theoretical contribution to parallel sampling for diffusion models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The general version of Girsanov’s theorem is novel and relevant for parallel sampling, generating independent interest.  
- The paper is technically solid, well-written, and presents clear proofs, enhancing its comprehensibility.  
- The rates of $O(\mathrm{poly log}(d))$ time complexity are compelling and echo previous work.  

Weaknesses:  
- The framework for the PIADM type algorithm closely resembles Algorithm 2 from prior work, merely substituting the ULMC process with a denoised process. A discussion on the technique's challenges beyond Girsanov’s theorem would be beneficial.  
- The novelty of the PFODE-ULMC type algorithm compared to existing methods is insufficiently addressed.  
- The application of Picard iterations lacks comparison with other parallel methods, such as randomized midpoint methods, which would strengthen the evaluation.  
- The results of Theorems 3.3 and 3.5 depend on specific optimization levels, limiting insights into the practical implications of parallel sampling.  
- Assumptions 3.3 and 3.4 are overly strong and not commonly satisfied, warranting a more detailed comparison with assumptions in sequential sampling analyses.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the challenges associated with the technique beyond Girsanov’s theorem. Additionally, please provide a clearer comparison of the proposed methods with existing parallel techniques, such as randomized midpoint methods. It would be beneficial to present bounds that depend on the various parameters involved in the optimization process, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the practical implications of the proposed methods. Lastly, we suggest addressing the strength of assumptions 3.3 and 3.4 in relation to their applicability in real-world scenarios, and consider including empirical validation to support the theoretical claims made in the paper.
