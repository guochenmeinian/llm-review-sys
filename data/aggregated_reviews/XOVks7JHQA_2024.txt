Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an uncertainty quantification method for graphical models, utilizing linear propagation to model uncertainty. The authors propose an alternative algorithm for message passing that is theoretically justified and empirically validated through simulation studies, demonstrating competitive results and fast convergence in downstream tasks. The method aims to address gaps in existing approaches, particularly in scalability, interpretability, and unbiasedness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with clear motivation and solutions that facilitate reader comprehension.
- The theoretical analysis is robust, with detailed explanations of necessary preliminaries and proofs.
- The originality of the problem addressed is notable, as it introduces a new definition of uncertainty based on interval width, decomposed into bias and variance.

Weaknesses:
- Validation primarily relies on datasets with high homophily, limiting the comprehensiveness of the results; experiments on datasets with high heterophily are necessary.
- Some figures, particularly Figure 1, lack clarity and necessary explanations, making it difficult to understand certain concepts.
- The formatting, especially in the appendix, is unprofessional, with issues such as large blanks and oversized tables.
- Limitations of the proposed method are inadequately discussed, leading to an impression that the method is flawless.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the validation of their method by conducting experiments on datasets with high heterophily to enhance the comprehensiveness of their findings. Additionally, clarifying the illustrations in figures, particularly Figure 1, and ensuring that all terms are well-defined will aid reader understanding. We also suggest revising the formatting in the appendix for a more professional presentation. Finally, it is crucial for the authors to explicitly discuss the limitations of their method, including any computational overheads associated with LinUProp, to provide a balanced view of its performance.
