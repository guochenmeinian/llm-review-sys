### Key Points
This paper presents the Induction-Augmented Generation (IAG) framework, which enhances implicit reasoning in Open-Domain Question-Answering (QA) tasks by integrating inductive knowledge statements. The authors propose two models: IAG-GPT, which generates inductive knowledge using GPT-3 and combines it with retrieved documents, and IAG-Student, which is trained through knowledge distillation with GPT-3 pseudo labels and optimized via a differentiable beam search algorithm. The experiments demonstrate that IAG-GPT achieves state-of-the-art performance on CSQA2.0 and StrategyQA, while IAG-Student outperforms RAG baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant challenge in implicit reasoning and introduces a novel framework that advances the state of the art in NLP.
- The methodology is well-defined, and the authors conduct extensive experiments that yield reasonable results.
- The integration of inductive knowledge into the answer generation process is effectively demonstrated.

Weaknesses:
- The model's generalization ability is a concern, as it assigns inductive information to all questions, potentially leading to unnecessary complexity. A question classifier could help determine the necessity of inductive information.
- There is a notable performance gap between IAG-GPT and IAG-Student, raising questions about the effectiveness of the distilled model.
- The reliance on external models like GPT-3 may limit accessibility for researchers with fewer resources.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalization ability of the model by implementing a question classifier to identify when inductive information is necessary. Additionally, we suggest conducting more experiments on larger models to address the performance gap between IAG-GPT and IAG-Student. Clarifying the strict structure of the prompt, particularly the Knowledge part, is also advised. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to analyze the failure modes of their approach and provide a more thorough discussion on the limitations of the IAG framework.
