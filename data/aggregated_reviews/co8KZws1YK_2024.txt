Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents U-LightOT, a lightweight solver for the Unbalanced Entropic Optimal Transport (UEOT) problem, utilizing a Gaussian Mixture approximation for the potential \( v_{\theta}(y) \) and measure \( u_{w}(x) \). The authors prove that this approximation allows for a tractable KL divergence to the ground truth UEOT plan. U-LightOT is evaluated on Gaussian Mixture and Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation tasks, demonstrating its efficiency and theoretical guarantees. Additionally, the authors propose enhancements to their work based on feedback received during the review process, including the addition of a table in Appendix C detailing the optimal transport (OT) cost and Wasserstein-2 distance for Gaussian mixture experiments, as well as additional metrics in Appendix E for a more thorough comparison of accuracy, Fréchet Distance (FD), and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) between generated and target distributions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a theoretical analysis of generalization bounds and the universal approximation property for the Gaussian mixture parametrization.
- The proposed method is efficient, requiring only minutes of CPU training for experiments.
- The writing is clear and easy to follow.
- The authors demonstrate a willingness to incorporate reviewer feedback, enhancing the clarity and depth of their analysis.
- The proposed additions to the appendices will provide valuable quantitative comparisons that strengthen the paper's contributions.

Weaknesses:
- The optimization objective and Gaussian Mixture approximation are similar to prior work, limiting the novelty.
- Concerns exist regarding the Gaussian Mixture parametrization's effectiveness for complex distributions, such as those in generative modeling on CIFAR-10.
- The experiments are modest, primarily focusing on low-dimensional data, and lack robustness assessments against outliers.
- The initial version may have lacked sufficient detail in the comparative metrics, which could hinder the reader's understanding of the method's effectiveness relative to competitors.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on how the parameters \( K \) and \( L \) (the number of Gaussians in the mixtures) affect the results, as their implications are currently unclear. Additionally, conducting experiments on more diverse datasets and including robustness assessments would enhance the paper's contributions. A detailed wall-clock time comparison with competing methods should also be provided to substantiate claims of efficiency. Furthermore, we suggest including ablation studies on the number of Gaussian modes \( N \) and \( M \) to better understand their impact on performance. Lastly, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the results by ensuring that the new tables in the appendices are well-explained in the main text and providing a more detailed discussion on how the added metrics impact the overall conclusions.
