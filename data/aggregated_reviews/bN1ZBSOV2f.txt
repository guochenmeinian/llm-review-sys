Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an algorithm for sequential testing of homogeneity and independence hypotheses using a betting framework. The core idea involves learning a classifier to differentiate between distributions \(P\) and \(Q\) (for two-sample testing) or \(P_{XY}\) and \(P_X \times P_Y\) (for independence testing) based on previously seen data. The algorithm places bets on new observations, adjusting a betting budget that starts at 1, and rejects the null hypothesis if the budget exceeds \(1/\alpha\). The authors demonstrate that their test controls type-I error and is consistent under alternatives if a non-trivial classifier can be learned, while also providing a strategy for selecting betting fractions to enhance performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively integrates recent advancements in sequential testing with general classification algorithms, allowing for the use of any existing learning framework.
- The theoretical presentation is adequate, and the empirical results support the theoretical claims, showcasing good performance.

Weaknesses:
- The main innovation appears to be the use of adaptive betting fractions, which raises questions about the relationship to Pandeva et al. [2022]. Clarification on how the tests can be rephrased in terms of E-values for easier comparison is needed.
- The notation can be confusing in places, particularly regarding the meaning of \(\sigma\) and the expectation in certain contexts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the notation, specifically by defining \(\sigma\) in line 75, clarifying the expectations after line 104, and introducing the \(\vee\) and \(\wedge\) notation for min/max. Additionally, we suggest splitting Section 1 into two distinct sections to better delineate the motivation and contributions from the problem setting. It would also be beneficial to provide more technical details on the betting strategies, as this is a key concept. Lastly, consider investigating strategies to enhance performance for small \(t\) in the sequential setting, as the current approach may not perform optimally at the beginning of the testing process.
