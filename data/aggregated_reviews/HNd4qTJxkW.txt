Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel embedding method called HeatGeo, which utilizes heat diffusion to perform dimensionality reduction while preserving manifold distances. The authors claim that HeatGeo is state-of-the-art (SOTA) in preserving both manifold distances and cluster structures, and that it can approximate existing methods like PHATE and t-SNE depending on the parameters. The paper provides a systematic treatment of heat diffusion MDS methods and includes experiments on various datasets, including RNAseq data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Systematic and principled mathematical treatment of heat diffusion methods.
- Originality in proposing heat geodesic embeddings linked to Riemannian geometry.
- Clear presentation of theoretical derivations and experimental evaluations.
- Benchmarks against several embedding methods on artificial datasets.

Weaknesses:
- Relationship to PHATE is unclear, raising questions about the novelty of HeatGeo.
- Bold claims regarding cluster preservation and approximation of t-SNE are not sufficiently supported by evidence.
- Insufficient evaluation, with many embeddings not shown, and runtime complexity not discussed.
- Writing style is dense and poorly structured, leading to confusion in key areas.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the relationship between HeatGeo and PHATE to better establish its novelty. To support claims about cluster preservation, we suggest including the embeddings corresponding to Table 2 and using more suitable datasets for clustering experiments, such as 100D Gaussians or MNIST. Additionally, we advise that the authors clarify the claims regarding the approximation of t-SNE by providing specific examples and visual comparisons. It would also be beneficial to discuss the runtime complexity of HeatGeo in Section 7 and to improve the overall organization and clarity of the paper by addressing the dense writing style and ensuring all mathematical notations are well-defined.
