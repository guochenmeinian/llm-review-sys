Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework called Lambda for entity alignment in knowledge graphs, specifically addressing the challenge of unlabeled dangling entities. The authors propose a GNN-based encoder and a positive-unlabeled learning algorithm to detect and align entities. The framework is theoretically supported with guarantees of unbiasedness, uniform deviation bounds, and convergence. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing baselines on real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles the significant challenge of entity alignment in scenarios with unlabeled dangling entities, which is a practical and relevant issue.
- The proposed method, which combines selective neighborhood aggregation with positive-unlabeled learning, shows promising results across multiple datasets.
- Theoretical proofs are provided to support the method's validity, and extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The writing quality needs improvement, particularly in defining key terms like 'GA16K' and ensuring clarity in methodology.
- The discussion of related work is insufficient, lacking detailed comparisons with existing models such as Dual-AMN and LightEA.
- The experimental setup requires further analysis, particularly regarding discrepancies in performance metrics across different tables.
- The paper does not conduct large-scale experiments to validate the scalability of the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing, particularly by defining 'GA16K' earlier in the paper. Additionally, enhancing the discussion of related works in the appendix and providing explicit comparisons with models like Dual-AMN and LightEA would strengthen the paper. We suggest conducting large-scale experiments to demonstrate the scalability of the proposed method and analyzing the experimental setup to address the performance discrepancies noted in the results. Finally, a deeper exploration of the iPULE module's application across different entity alignment methods would enhance the paper's contribution.
