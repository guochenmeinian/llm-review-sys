Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents YOLOv10, an advancement in the YOLO series for real-time object detection, focusing on eliminating Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and optimizing model architecture for efficiency and accuracy. The authors propose a consistent dual assignments strategy for NMS-free training, which significantly accelerates inference speed with minimal accuracy impact. Comprehensive experiments validate that YOLOv10 achieves a favorable balance between efficiency and accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of consistent dual assignments for NMS-free training is an innovative solution that enhances end-to-end deployment efficiency.
2. The paper provides a comprehensive strategy for optimizing model components, marking a significant advancement over prior works.
3. Extensive empirical evidence demonstrates improvements in both speed and accuracy compared to previous models.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation of the paper is unclear, appearing to optimize YOLOs from an engineering perspective with solutions largely derived from existing technologies. The novelty is weak, with concepts similar to H-DETR and others.
2. The paper lacks evidence supporting claims regarding the complexity of deploying DETRs and their performance compared to YOLOv10.
3. There is insufficient discussion on related works regarding hybrid or multiple group label assignment strategies, and the implementation of a one-to-many head may increase training costs without comparative data on training time and costs.
4. A more detailed exposition of the architectural design rationale is needed, and further performance analysis of NMS-free training should be provided.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper's motivation and highlight the novel contributions more distinctly. Additionally, please provide comparative data on training time and costs associated with the one-to-many head. It would be beneficial to include a discussion on related works in hybrid label assignment strategies and to report latency for YOLOv10 with the original one-to-many training using NMS. Furthermore, we suggest presenting training outcomes for YOLOv10 at 300 epochs to provide a comprehensive evaluation of its efficiency.
