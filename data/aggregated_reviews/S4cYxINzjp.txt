### Key Points
This paper presents BacChain, a backdoor attack targeting chain-of-thought prompting for Large Language Models (LLMs). The method involves poisoning the dataset by adding a trigger to the prompt and corresponding reasoning steps, which alters the final output during inference. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on state-of-the-art models, including Llama2, GPT-3.5, PaLM2, and GPT-4.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The attack requires no access to the model or training process and incurs no computational overhead, yet effectively targets LLMs.
- Experiments reveal a correlation between the reasoning capability of LLMs and the success of the attack.
- The analysis in Section 4.3 indicates that LLMs perceive the trigger as an additional reasoning step.
- The paper addresses potential defenses against the attack.
- The studied problem is compelling, and the paper is well-written.

Weaknesses:
- The practical use case of this method needs further exploration to assess its threat level.
- The addition of backdoor words and reasoning steps can be easily detected with a limited number of samples in chain-of-thought prompting.
- The discussion on potential defenses (Shuffle and Shuffle++) is too high-level; a more detailed description of the processes would be beneficial.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the exploration of the practical use case of the BacChain method to better understand its implications. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed description of the processes involved in the potential defenses, particularly Shuffle and Shuffle++, to enhance clarity and depth.
