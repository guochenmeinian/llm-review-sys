Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents UKnow, a Unified Knowledge Protocol designed to organize multimodal news events into a knowledge graph (KG) by categorizing data into five types: in-image, in-text, cross-image, cross-text, and image-text. The authors propose a three-phase pipeline for data extraction, symbolization, and graph construction, and validate the protocol through experimentation on common-sense reasoning and vision-language pre-training tasks. A new dataset has been released, which is publicly accessible and includes raw image-text pairs and annotated events.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well organized and clearly written, providing a logical structure for the proposed knowledge protocol.
2. The concept of the knowledge protocol is innovative, allowing for the construction of training datasets suitable for various downstream tasks.
3. The newly collected dataset is extensive, with detailed documentation available for public access.

Weaknesses:
1. The correlation between the knowledge view and Phase 1 is insufficiently explained, which may hinder understanding of the graph's foundation.
2. The main paper lacks balance, with important benchmarking results relegated to supplementary materials, while details on the data pipeline dominate the main text.
3. The choice of baselines for benchmarking could be more comprehensive, incorporating more recent state-of-the-art works.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the correlation between the knowledge view and Phase 1 to clarify its significance in establishing the graph. Additionally, we suggest rebalancing the paper to emphasize benchmarking results in the main text, as these are equally important for the community. Furthermore, an extended benchmarking effort should include more baselines and validation on different types of raw data to enhance the robustness of the findings. Lastly, clearer explanations of the Information Symbolization stage, particularly regarding the acquisition of edge N_e and the role of the index, would strengthen the paper's clarity.
