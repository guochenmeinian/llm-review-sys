### Key Points
This paper explores the diagnosis and treatment of False Behavior in the Patches generation process within the Program Repair Model. The authors propose a framework for diagnosing and treating False Behavior, introducing the Behavior Vector for diagnosis and two treatment methods: abortion and masked bypassing. Experimental results demonstrate that adding these modules can effectively increase the number of correctly repaired programs without altering the baseline. The paper provides a novel perspective on improving Automatic Program Repair (APR) by addressing the false behaviors of transformer-based models, supported by extensive experimental results across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper presents a novel approach to diagnosing and treating false behaviors in program repair models.
- It includes extensive experimental results, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods in identifying correct and incorrect patches.
- The treatment methods, particularly abortion and masked bypassing, show significant potential for improving model performance.

Weaknesses:
- The writing lacks clarity, with some key points inadequately explained, making it difficult for readers to comprehend.
- The novelty of the Behavior Vector is questionable, and it is unclear if it outperforms using the model itself for classification.
- The paper does not provide sufficient training details for the CodeGen model, and the impact of false negatives is not clearly addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and readability of the paper by providing more detailed descriptions and explanations of key concepts. Specifically, clarify the differences between the Attention MASK in section 3.2 and provide illustrative examples. Additionally, ensure that the meanings of each row and column in the results tables are clearly explained, and specify whether model parameters remain consistent across experiments. We suggest justifying the choice of the Behavior Vector over using a specific token like [CLS] for classification. Furthermore, please provide comprehensive training details for the CodeGen model, including input size and learning rate. Lastly, clarify the impact of false negatives on the system's performance.
