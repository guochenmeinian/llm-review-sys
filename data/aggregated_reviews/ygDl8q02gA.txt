Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies the problem of recovering an exact $k$ partition of a set using a same-cluster oracle that may lie up to $\ell$ times. The authors propose an algorithm with optimal query complexity up to constants and provide a lower bound. They also explore the implications of the oracle's error model on query complexity, particularly in the context of clustering with adversarial responses.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The results are clean and complete, with the algorithm's query complexity matching the lower bound.
2. The main algorithm is concise, simple, and captures the problem effectively, demonstrating optimal guarantees.
3. The lower bound is non-trivial and introduces interesting ideas.
4. The paper is well-written, with clear notations and explanations, and is cohesive and organized.
5. The problem of guaranteed exact cluster recovery in the presence of noise is novel and has potential applications.

Weaknesses:
1. The algorithm's simplicity contrasts with the complexity of the lower bound, suggesting a need for more detailed explanations on the latter, particularly regarding the construction of a good responder's strategy.
2. The practical significance of the oracle's error model is questionable, as it is unclear why the oracle would consistently make at most $\ell$ errors or why $\ell$ would be known in advance.
3. The main algorithm appears similar to those without faulty oracles, necessitating a clearer distinction for the reader.
4. The requirement to know $\ell$ in advance may limit the model's applicability in real-world scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the lower bound by providing more details on constructing a good responder's strategy. Additionally, it would be beneficial to compare their algorithm with the optimal algorithm for the no-error oracle. Clarifying the practical implications of the oracle's error model and addressing the concerns regarding the fixed upper bound on errors would enhance the paper's relevance. Lastly, including a comparison with existing literature on same-cluster queries would provide valuable context and strengthen the paper's contributions.
