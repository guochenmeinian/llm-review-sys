Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a sample-based method called the Feature Likelihood Score (FLS) for evaluating generative models, addressing the shortcomings of existing metrics like FID and IS. The authors propose using a pre-trained network (InceptionV3 or CLIP) to extract image features and fit isotropic Gaussians around generated samples, optimizing variance to maximize likelihood for training samples. FLS aims to measure fidelity, novelty, and diversity, with the added benefit of detecting overfitting and memorization. The authors demonstrate that FLS correlates well with established metrics and performs robustly across various datasets and models. Furthermore, the paper includes a comparative analysis of FLS and FID, arguing that FLS addresses critical shortcomings of FID, such as its bias towards smaller sample sizes and insensitivity to overfitting. The authors emphasize the importance of using specific metrics alongside holistic measures for a comprehensive evaluation of generative models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles a significant problem in generative model evaluation and proposes an innovative solution that accounts for novelty, overfitting, and memorization.
- The theoretical foundation of FLS is well-grounded, and the method shows promising results across multiple datasets and models.
- FLS is less biased by sample size compared to FID, making it applicable in scenarios with fewer evaluation samples.
- The authors effectively highlight the limitations of FID and the advantages of FLS, particularly in scenarios with smaller datasets.
- The flexibility of the feature likelihood methodology is well-articulated, allowing for nuanced evaluations of overfitting and fidelity.
- The paper benefits from thorough discussions that address reviewer concerns, leading to improved clarity and understanding.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity on the specific feature space used in experiments and does not analyze the pros and cons of using InceptionV3 versus CLIP.
- There is insufficient discussion on the number of samples required for reliable FLS evaluation, particularly concerning its ability to detect overfitting.
- The interpretability of FLS may be less intuitive than FID, raising concerns about potential misuse.
- Limitations of FLS, particularly regarding its application to larger datasets and modern generative models, are not adequately addressed.
- There is a need for more specific measures to evaluate different aspects of generative models, as different users have varying requirements.
- The reliance on a single holistic metric may not fully capture the complexities of model performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by specifying the feature space used in each experiment and providing a comparative analysis of InceptionV3 and CLIP. Additionally, the authors should include a detailed assessment of the minimum number of samples required for reliable FLS evaluation, particularly for overfitting detection. Updating Figure 10 to include comparisons with KID and standard deviations would enhance the robustness of the findings. A discussion on the limitations of FLS, especially regarding its scalability to larger datasets and its performance on text-to-image models, should also be included. We suggest that the authors provide guidelines on best practices for using FLS in various evaluation scenarios. Furthermore, improving the clarity of how different metrics can complement FLS in evaluating specific aspects of generative models and incorporating more detailed discussions on the implications of using specific metrics alongside FLS could enhance the paper's robustness. Finally, including further empirical evidence on the performance of FLS in diverse scenarios would strengthen the argument for its adoption over FID.
