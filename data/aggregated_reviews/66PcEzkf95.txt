Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive audit of 14,000 web domains to assess the evolution of consent for web crawling, particularly regarding the use of content in training AI models. The authors analyze changes in robots.txt files and terms of service over time, revealing a trend towards increased restrictions on data access. They identify a rapid increase in restrictions on AI training through robots.txt and terms of use, forecasting that 21.7% of C4 data will be restricted by mid-2025. The findings highlight discrepancies between robots.txt instructions and actual terms of service, as well as consent asymmetries and inconsistencies in data signaling. The authors quantify the mismatch between web data sources and actual uses of conversational AI, revealing that much of the training data is misaligned with AI applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research provides a substantial and well-organized analysis based on a large sample size.
- The paper offers valuable insights into the changing landscape of web data accessibility, which is relevant to AI developers and data controllers.
- The authors effectively connect their findings to existing literature and provide a thorough examination of the implications of their results.
- The detailed methodology and clarity in the appendix, particularly regarding human annotator training and data classification, are commendable.

Weaknesses:
- The authors do not acknowledge contextual factors influencing the observed shifts in data accessibility, which detracts from the depth of the analysis.
- The synthesis and conclusions drawn from the findings lack depth, particularly regarding the implications of increasing restrictions on web content.
- The reliance on popular datasets may skew results, potentially overlooking smaller websites that also wish to be included in training corpora.
- The prediction of future restrictions using the SARIMA model lacks motivation and validation, raising concerns about its reliability.
- The forecast section is perceived as weak due to its low interpretability, and the discussion does not adequately explore the positive aspects of evolving data usage policies.
- The title may not accurately reflect the linear focus of the analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including a dedicated limitations section to clarify the constraints of their research. Additionally, addressing the contextual reasons behind the observed trends in data accessibility would enhance the analysis. The authors should also validate their prediction model or consider removing it if it cannot be substantiated. Furthermore, providing a breakdown of pay rates for data annotators by country would improve transparency. We suggest improving the alignment between the paper's results and the key take-home messages, particularly regarding "the future of the internet" and "the future of web-derived training data." Clarifying the definitions of "open web" versus "walled gardens" could enhance the discussion. We also encourage adding caveats around the forecasting methodology to address concerns about its short-term predictions and exploring the positive implications of data restrictions in greater detail. Lastly, we recommend a reevaluation of the title to better reflect the content of the analysis.
