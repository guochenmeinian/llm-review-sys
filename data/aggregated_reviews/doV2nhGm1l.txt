Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Hyper-Skin dataset, a collection of 330 hyperspectral cubes from 51 subjects, aimed at reconstructing skin spectra from RGB images for cosmetology applications. The dataset spans a wide wavelength range from 400nm to 1000nm and includes 448 spectral bands with a resolution of 1024x1024 pixels, facilitating the analysis of skin conditions and cosmetic efficacy. The authors provide a comparative analysis against existing datasets, notably the SHRD, highlighting differences in objectives and methodologies. They demonstrate the dataset's utility through advanced models and address concerns regarding participant size, illumination effects, and the need for cross-dataset comparisons.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths of the Hyper-Skin dataset include its specific focus on facial skin spectral reconstruction, innovative design tailored for skin analysis, high resolution, and comprehensive spectral coverage, which enhance the potential for detailed analysis. The authors have made significant revisions based on reviewer feedback, improving clarity and quality. However, weaknesses include the limited participant diversity, which raises concerns about bias and generalization, and the lack of cross-dataset comparisons that could validate the dataset's effectiveness. Additionally, the static illumination during data collection may impact results, and there are minor concerns regarding the accuracy of certain equations presented.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the diversity of participants in their experiments to enhance dataset generalization. Additionally, we suggest incorporating cross-dataset comparisons to better demonstrate the generalization ability of the Hyper-Skin dataset. Addressing the small participant size and discussing measures taken to mitigate bias would enhance the dataset's reliability. A clearer connection between data utilization plans and analysis methods should be established, and the authors should acknowledge the potential impact of static illumination on results. Lastly, we suggest providing a comparison table of dataset specifications and explicitly contrasting their dataset with existing ones to highlight unique contributions, as well as incorporating traditional algorithms based on statistical or physical models for a more comprehensive analysis in future work.
