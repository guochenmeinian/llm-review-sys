Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ROA-Star, an enhancement to the AlphaStar training framework for StarCraft II, aimed at improving computational efficiency and adaptability to opponent strategies. The authors propose the use of goal-conditioned exploiters—Exploitative Exploiters (EIE) and Explorative Exploiters (ERE)—to target both high win-rate strategies and under-explored tactics. Additionally, they introduce an auxiliary loss for opponent strategy prediction and a scouting reward to enhance the agent's ability to gather information on opponents. Experimental results indicate that ROA-Star outperforms AlphaStar in robustness and adaptability, supported by strong empirical evidence against human experts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides strong empirical results, demonstrating the effectiveness of ROA-Star against top human experts.
- The writing is generally clear and correct, with detailed explanations of methods and experiments.
- The approach shows promise for generalization to other complex environments beyond StarCraft II.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks sufficient implementation details, and there is no code release, which limits reproducibility.
- Some experimental results are only briefly mentioned in the main text, with detailed discussions relegated to supplementary material.
- The long-term scaling of ROA-Star compared to AlphaStar remains unclear, particularly regarding performance convergence against human experts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Table 1 by specifying the training duration for each agent, particularly the comparison between ROA-Star and AlphaStar. Additionally, please provide pseudo-code for the EIE and ERE algorithms in the main text to enhance reproducibility. We suggest expanding Section 5.2 to clarify the analysis for readers unfamiliar with StarCraft II, possibly reorganizing Figure 4 for better comprehension. Emphasizing the phenomenon of degraded exploiter performance in Figure 6 and marking the 50% win rate line in Figure 7 would also improve clarity. Finally, addressing the societal impact of the work and discussing potential limitations of the scouting reward and frozen opponent prediction model would strengthen the paper's overall contribution.
