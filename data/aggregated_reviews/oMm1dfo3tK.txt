### Key Points
This paper presents a computational framework for constrained sampling using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) with self-concordant barrier functions on Riemannian manifolds. The authors propose an "involution checking step" that ensures unbiased sampling, providing both theoretical guarantees and computational experiments on real-world and synthetic data. The work builds upon and improves existing methods, particularly addressing biases noted in Kook et al. (2022).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- Strong theoretical contributions, particularly in addressing discrepancies in prior work.  
- The algorithm is novel and considers practical numerical integrators.  
- The intuition behind the choice of self-concordant barriers is well-informed.  
- The paper provides clear theoretical gaps in Kook et al. (2022a).  

Weaknesses:  
- The presentation is dense and at times difficult to read, with cumbersome notation, particularly in the Appendix.  
- There is a lack of rigorous non-asymptotic theory, which is necessary for a complete understanding of the algorithm's performance.  
- Numerical experiments do not consistently demonstrate clear improvements over existing methods, raising questions about their validity.  
- Some claims regarding existing work are imprecise, and the gap between theory and practice is not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by simplifying notation and enhancing explanations of technical details. It would be beneficial to provide a more thorough discussion on the lack of non-asymptotic convergence results and their implications. Additionally, we suggest that the authors elaborate on the numerical experiments, including parameter tuning, to strengthen the validity of their comparisons. Finally, addressing the imprecise statements regarding existing work and ensuring that all claims are accurate will enhance the paper's rigor.
