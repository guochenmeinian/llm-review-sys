Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an examination of the relationship between consensus and equilibrium within multi-agent systems characterized by multiple interacting sub-populations. The authors argue that consensus reflects intra-population stability, while equilibrium denotes inter-population stability. They demonstrate that smooth fictitious play (SFP) can facilitate both consensus and convergence to equilibrium across various multi-agent scenarios, including network population games. The authors also explore how the consensus formation process influences equilibrium selection, particularly in the context of two-population Stag Hunt Games.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively integrates the concepts of consensus and equilibrium, providing strong theoretical insights and interesting experimental results.
- The organization and clarity of the manuscript enhance its accessibility to readers.
- The work extends existing literature by presenting novel theoretical results, particularly regarding SFP in network population games without requiring a coordinative reward structure.

Weaknesses:
- The justification for the network population game model is insufficient, particularly regarding its applicability to real-world scenarios and belief updates.
- The rationale for using smooth fictitious play dynamics and the inclusion of the \(\nu\) penalty term in the utility function lacks adequate explanation.
- There is no discussion on how the \(\epsilon\) term and \(A_{ij}\) influence consensus and convergence.
- The empirical conclusions drawn from the variance of initial beliefs require further clarification and justification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the network population game model by providing tangible motivating examples that illustrate its relevance to real-world applications. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on the necessity of the \(\nu\) penalty term in the utility function and clarify its role in the convergence and consensus study. It would also be beneficial to discuss how the \(\epsilon\) term and \(A_{ij}\) affect the consensus and convergence dynamics. Finally, we suggest including a more comprehensive discussion of the limitations of the study, potentially in an appendix, to enhance the manuscript's rigor.
