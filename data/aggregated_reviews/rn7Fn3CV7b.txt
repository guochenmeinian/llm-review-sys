### Key Points
This paper presents a covariance and variance optimization framework (OVO) aimed at mitigating dataset biases in joint entity and relation extraction tasks. The authors propose covariance optimization (COP) to reduce feature collinearity and variance optimization (VOP) to minimize within-class variance, thereby addressing long-tail distribution bias. Experiments demonstrate improvements over several strong baselines, although initial evaluations lacked out-of-distribution (OOD) results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed framework effectively alleviates data biases and enhances feature representation.
- Significant improvements are observed in various datasets for joint entity and relation extraction tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The main claim of reducing dataset bias is inadequately supported by experiments, particularly lacking OOD evaluations.
- The causal analysis contains flaws, including unclear definitions and inconsistencies in the structural causal model (SCM).
- The framework's optimization problems may be slow and resource-intensive, with insufficient detail on training time and GPU memory usage.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental design by including results on out-of-distribution data to substantiate claims of bias reduction. Clarifying the motivation behind the variance optimization method and ensuring consistent definitions of symbols throughout the paper is essential. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed analysis of the SCM, including the rationale for connections between nodes and a thorough examination of the causal assumptions made. Finally, addressing the computational efficiency of the framework and analyzing the impact of different batch sizes would enhance the robustness of the study.
