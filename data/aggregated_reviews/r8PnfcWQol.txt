Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive framework for data generation, model training, and method evaluation focused on the combinatorial space of Existential First-order Queries with multiple variables (EFO_k). It identifies biases in existing dataset construction processes and introduces the EFOk-CQA dataset, which contains 741 query types for empirical evaluation. The authors evaluate various complex question answering (CQA) models, revealing structural biases in existing data and providing insights into query hardness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research gap is clearly identified, and the proposed framework effectively enumerates non-trivial abstract query graphs.
- The paper comprehensively covers the entire pipeline, enhancing reproducibility and reliability.
- The EFOk-CQA dataset significantly expands existing datasets, allowing for a broader evaluation of complex query answering models.

Weaknesses:
- The introduction lacks clarity, with concepts like "combinatorial answers" and "structural hardness" poorly defined.
- There is insufficient algorithmic detail for generating the EFOk-CQA dataset, lacking pseudocode and complexity analysis.
- The evaluation metrics are limited to Hits@10, with no consideration of other metrics like Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@5.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction by presenting a motivating example that links to the scalability issues addressed by the framework. Additionally, the authors should provide a clear algorithm description for generating the EFOk-CQA dataset, including pseudocode and a complexity analysis. Expanding the evaluation metrics to include Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@5 would also enhance the benchmark's comprehensiveness. Finally, addressing potential biases in the new dataset and discussing the limitations of the proposed benchmark would strengthen the paper.
