### Key Points
This paper presents DisCo, a novel GNN-free disentangled graph condensation framework that addresses scalability challenges in existing methods. DisCo separates the processes of node condensation and edge translation, significantly reducing computational complexity. The authors conduct extensive experiments on large datasets, including ogbn-paper100M, demonstrating superior scalability and performance, with up to 5% higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. DisCo achieves 10x faster condensation than existing methods and effectively handles large-scale datasets.
2. The methodology is simple, intuitive, and avoids complex bi-level optimization, enhancing efficiency.
3. The paper is well-organized, making it easy for readers to understand its contributions.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the method is limited, with similarities to existing works like GCDM and SimGC not clearly addressed.
2. The performance of DisCo is unstable across experiments, and the authors do not discuss potential trade-offs between accuracy and computation.
3. The authors did not provide code for reproducibility, and the ablation study lacks structure-free experiments to test the edge translation module's effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by explicitly differentiating DisCo from similar methods like GCDM and SimGC, or acknowledging their contributions. Additionally, we suggest conducting a thorough ablation study to demonstrate the necessity of edges in the condensation graph and including structure-free experiments. To enhance reproducibility, please provide the code and clarify the source of baseline performance. Lastly, consider visualizing the condensed graph to assess its structural fidelity to the original graph.
