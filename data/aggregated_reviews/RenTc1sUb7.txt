### Key Points
This paper presents an approach for extracting entities from visually rich documents, specifically addressing the Few-shot Visually-rich Document Entity Retrieval (FVDER) problem through a novel formulation as an entity-level, N-way soft-K-shot learning within a meta-learning framework. The authors introduce a new dataset designed to reflect practical challenges in FVDER and utilize various methods, including metrics-based and gradient-based meta-learning techniques, achieving significant improvements over existing baselines. Additionally, the paper identifies potential directions for further enhancement, such as developing algorithms to differentiate between OTD and ITD and considering correlations among entity instances in meta-learning tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper proposes a novel solution to the challenging FVDER problem, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods.
- The introduction of a new dataset aids the community in benchmarking new approaches.
- The incorporation of asymmetric across-document rejection (ADR) sampling effectively addresses entity occurrence imbalances.
- The use of meta-learning techniques enhances model generalization in out-of-task-distribution contexts.

Weaknesses:
- The derived dataset relies on existing small open-source datasets, lacking a sufficient number of classes and entities for robust few-shot learning.
- The paper does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed methods.
- Task definitions and claims of uniqueness lack clarity, making it difficult to differentiate this work from standard NER tasks.
- More extensive experimentation on publicly available datasets is needed to validate the proposed methods' effectiveness and generalizability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the task definition and the claims regarding the uniqueness of the problem. Specifically, addressing the confusions raised about the variability of entity occurrences and the N-way definition would strengthen the paper. Additionally, we suggest that the authors conduct comparisons against few-shot multimodal NER techniques, not just meta-learning approaches. Providing more detailed explanations of the entity-level imbalanced few-shot VDER scenarios and the implementation details would enhance reproducibility. Finally, discussing potential biases or limitations in the FewVEX dataset would improve the credibility of the experimental findings.
