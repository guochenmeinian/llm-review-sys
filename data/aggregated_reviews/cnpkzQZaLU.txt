### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework, Context-TAP, aimed at estimating persistent long-term trajectories of query points in videos. The authors argue for the necessity of incorporating spatial context features, proposing two modules: 1) a Source Feature Enhancement (SOFE) module and 2) a Target Feature Aggregation (TAFA) module, which enhance trajectory accuracy by aggregating spatial context features from both source and target images. Context-TAP demonstrates superior performance, ranking first across four benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and easy to understand.
2. Extensive experimental results show that Context-TAP outperforms existing baseline models significantly.
3. The SOFE module effectively enlarges the perception field in the cost volume, improving performance.
4. The integration of context features via attention mechanisms motivates design in other correspondence tasks.
5. The thorough ablation study reveals the necessity of the attention-based TAFA and the number of samples.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation and solution appear conventional, lacking novelty as the use of spatial context features is common in the field.
2. The impact of spatial context features on occlusion prediction accuracy is not discussed.
3. Efficiency comparisons focus solely on parameter counts, neglecting time and memory usage.
4. The benefit of TAFA is not substantial, and additional correlations could be explored.
5. Clarity issues exist in the writing and presentation of results, particularly regarding the relationship between PIPs and Context-TAP.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing, particularly in the description of contributions and results. It would be beneficial to discuss how spatial context features affect occlusion prediction accuracy and to include time and memory usage in efficiency comparisons. Additionally, consider moving the better model $K=6$ from the supplementary material to the main paper for better visibility. We suggest exploring additional correlations that could enhance TAP and reconsider the naming of the framework to avoid confusion with TAP-Net. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the relationship between the different implementations of PIPs referenced in the paper.
