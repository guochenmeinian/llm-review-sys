Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to personalized dictionary learning (PerDL) for heterogeneous datasets through a federated meta-algorithm called PerMA. The authors provide theoretical guarantees on the identifiability, convergence, and robustness of PerMA, demonstrating its applications in various learning tasks, including imbalanced datasets and video surveillance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper proposes PerMA, which can provably recover both global and local dictionaries from heterogeneous datasets.  
- Theoretical guarantees on identifiability, convergence, and robustness are provided, with interesting results on the Surveillance Video Dataset.  
- The writing is clear, and the algorithm's description is well-articulated.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks comparisons with existing methods for dictionary learning or federated learning, such as personalized PCA (PerPCA), which would help evaluate its performance.  
- In the Surveillance Video experiments, the rationale for using only one original image and one local atom is unclear, and a single case study seems insufficient.  
- The distinction between the proposed "global matching and local update" and existing methods is not adequately highlighted.  
- The experiments primarily present qualitative results, which limits the assessment of the method's effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by:  
- Including a comparison of PerMA with existing state-of-the-art methods (e.g., [Gkillas et al., 2022] and/or [Huang et al., 2022]).  
- Providing quantitative results in Sections 5.2 and 5.3, such as a table comparing PSNR, MSE, or SSIM metrics for different strategies, and considering the F-score for surveillance video.  
- Clarifying the rationale behind the choice of one original image and one local atom in the experiments.  
- Discussing the ethical implications of their work more broadly, particularly in the context of video surveillance.  
- Addressing the influence of the dimension \( r_g \) of the global dictionary on the algorithm's performance and including more experiments, particularly on tabular datasets.
