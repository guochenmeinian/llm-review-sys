### Key Points
This paper presents the DeepMind Control Visual Benchmark (DMC-VB), a dataset aimed at evaluating representation learning methods for offline reinforcement learning (RL) in continuous control tasks with visual distractions. The authors propose three benchmark evaluations to assess the utility of pretrained visual representations, addressing gaps in prior research by incorporating diverse tasks and visual variations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- DMC-VB encompasses a wide array of tasks, including locomotion and navigation, with varying difficulty levels and both static and dynamic visual variations.
- The systematic pairing of state and pixel observations allows for a thorough investigation of the "representation gap."
- The proposed benchmarks provide clear metrics for evaluating representation learning methods, promoting standardization in the field.

Weaknesses:
- The benchmarks primarily rely on behavior cloning (BC) algorithms, lacking comparisons with offline RL algorithms.
- The inclusion of more complex control tasks could enhance the dataset's quality and applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the benchmarks by including comparisons with offline RL algorithms such as IQL or CQL. Additionally, exploring more complex environments and robotics tasks would enrich the dataset. Clarifying the performance discrepancies observed in Figures 3 and 5 regarding pre-trained visual representations, particularly whether these features are frozen or if fine-tuning could yield better results, would also be beneficial. Lastly, considering the coverage of mixed versus expert datasets in the antmaze domains could provide insights into the advantages of suboptimal data for agent performance.
