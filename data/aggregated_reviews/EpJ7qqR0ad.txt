### Key Points
This paper presents the Grounded Compositional Concept Learning (GCCL) task, introduces two datasets (CompFlickr and CompCOCO), and proposes the MetaReVision method, which integrates retrieval and meta-learning to address this task. The study aims to enhance models' generalization abilities in combining primitive concepts into novel compositions. The empirical evaluation is solid, reporting state-of-the-art results, but the practical applications of the GCCL task remain unclear.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of retrieval and meta-learning is a novel approach.
- The task and datasets are well-designed for studying compositional concepts.
- The empirical evaluation demonstrates effectiveness in novel concept recognition.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed MetaReVision method is overly complicated and difficult to follow.
- The practical applications of the GCCL task are not clearly articulated.
- The experiments primarily utilize older models, raising concerns about the relevance of results.
- There are numerous typos and unclear experimental details throughout the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the MetaReVision method's implementation and provide more detailed explanations of the experimental setup. It would be beneficial to clarify the differences between Compositional Learning and Grounded Compositional Concept Learning in one concise sentence. Additionally, addressing the potential impact of significant differences between training and test data on the retriever's performance is essential. We suggest evaluating more advanced models, such as BLIP-2, to strengthen the empirical results. Lastly, we encourage the authors to correct typos and enhance the overall presentation of figures and text for better readability.
