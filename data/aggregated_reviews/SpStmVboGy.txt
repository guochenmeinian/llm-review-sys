Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents two algorithms, FedSGDA+ and FedSGDA-M, aimed at addressing the minimax optimization problem within the federated learning framework. The authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis and numerical evaluations, demonstrating the algorithms' effectiveness in both nonconvex concave and nonconvex PL settings. The study highlights the algorithms' convergence rates and communication efficiency, contributing valuable insights to the field of federated learning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed algorithms offer significant contributions to solving minimax optimization problems, with solid theoretical foundations and promising numerical results.
- The algorithms achieve the best convergence rates compared to existing methods, particularly under heterogeneous data conditions.
- The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear mathematical proofs and notations.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation requires improvement, particularly in clarifying the motivation and development of the algorithms.
- Some assumptions made in the theoretical analysis may be overly restrictive, potentially limiting the applicability of the results.
- The experimental comparisons lack a comprehensive baseline, as several relevant algorithms are omitted from the analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind their algorithms and provide a more detailed discussion on the assumptions made, particularly regarding the second inequality in (2) and the bounded gradient assumption in Section 4.1. Additionally, we suggest separating the server-side and client-side algorithm presentations for better understanding. It would be beneficial to include numerical studies on data heterogeneity, client numbers, and computation costs to strengthen the empirical validation of the proposed methods. Finally, we encourage the authors to address the relationship between their algorithms and existing works more comprehensively, ensuring that comparisons are fair and well-justified.
