Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for disentangling structural and functional representations in machine learning-assisted protein engineering, specifically for T-cell receptor (TCR) design. The authors propose a disentangled Wasserstein autoencoder with an auxiliary classifier to learn separate embeddings for structural and functional components. They validate their approach through empirical studies on TCR binder generation, demonstrating that their method outperforms several baseline techniques. Additionally, the authors explore modeling TCR sequences by focusing on the hypervariable region while utilizing a constant consensus sequence for the conserved regions. They propose two baselines for comparison: one that modifies only the hypervariable region and another that embeds the hypervariable and conserved regions separately. The results indicate that while the performance of the trimmed models is lower than the full sequence model, the validity of sequences remains largely unaffected, suggesting that the conservative region plays a critical role in binding scores.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The exploration of Wasserstein autoencoders for protein engineering is novel, addressing the fundamental challenge of separating functional and structural knowledge.
- The disentanglement measurement is well-formulated, and the training objective effectively maximizes this measurement.
- The paper provides a clear computational approach to TCR design, demonstrating the impact of different modeling strategies on sequence generation.
- The results highlight the importance of the conservative region in influencing binding scores, contributing to the understanding of TCR interactions.

Weaknesses:
- The authors' claim of being the "first approach" to utilize disentangled representations is misleading, as their method represents implicit disentanglement, while prior works have achieved explicit disentanglement.
- The focus on TCRs, a well-studied area, raises concerns about the generalizability of their findings. The claims regarding functional and structural patterns are limited by the focus on the CDR3Î² region, potentially undermining the generalizability of the findings.
- The definition of "structural backbone" is unclear, and the reliance on a sequence classifier does not adequately support claims of structural conservation.
- There is insufficient discussion of related work, particularly regarding methods like NetTCR and other antibody engineering approaches. The choice of metrics and comparison with ERGO rather than NetTCR raises questions about the robustness of the evaluation.
- Clarity is lacking in method descriptions and metric justifications, such as the choice of the 0.5 operating point for binding scores.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their claims regarding the novelty of their approach by discussing the differences between implicit and explicit disentanglement. Additionally, they should benchmark their method against motif-scaffolding techniques and provide experiments on other protein systems to strengthen their claims. 

We suggest that the authors clarify the definition of "structural backbone" and provide evidence supporting its conservation. A more comprehensive discussion of related works, particularly NetTCR, would enhance the context of their contribution. Furthermore, we advise the authors to justify the choice of the 0.5 operating point for binding scores and provide clearer definitions for all symbols used in their methodology. Lastly, including a detailed analysis of failure modes and limitations of their method would provide valuable insights into its applicability.
