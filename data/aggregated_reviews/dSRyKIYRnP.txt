Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel spiking neural network that integrates continuous attractor neural networks (CANN) with excitation-inhibition balanced networks (E-INN). The authors propose a model featuring two distinct sets of synapses: one for strong, fast irregular firing and another for weak, slow attractor dynamics. The model demonstrates improved performance in signal tracking tasks, characterized by accelerated convergence of attractor states and maintained E-I balance. The paper also derives insights from simulations and introduces a firing-rate model to elucidate the observed dynamics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making complex theoretical concepts accessible.
- It addresses the significant challenge of reconciling E-I balance with attractor models, offering insights that may extend to other attractor models beyond CANNs.
- The combination of established models is creative and demonstrates their harmonious coexistence.

Weaknesses:
- Several equations in the spiking model lack homogeneity, suggesting missing constants, which could hinder clarity.
- The body text is not entirely self-contained, with key definitions relegated to the appendix.
- The biological plausibility of the proposed two-set synapse model is not adequately discussed.
- The stability of the bump dynamics and the implications of localized input on balance are questioned.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the equations in the spiking model by ensuring all units are correctly defined. Additionally, the authors should provide a more comprehensive discussion on the biological feasibility of their two-set synapse model. It would be beneficial to clarify the definitions of quantities such as $U_E$, $r_E$, $k$, and $[\cdot]_{+}$ within the main text. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors address the stability of the bump dynamics and the implications of their findings in relation to existing literature on balanced networks. Lastly, the authors should consider including a more detailed explanation of how the equilibrium of the CANN part is theoretically defined and whether an energy function can be established.
