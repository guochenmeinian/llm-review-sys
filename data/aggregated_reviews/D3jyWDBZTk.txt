Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ShopBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) in the context of online shopping. It encompasses 57 tasks that cover four key shopping skills: concept understanding, knowledge reasoning, user behavior alignment, and multilinguality. The authors conduct extensive experiments with both proprietary and open-source LLMs, revealing that the dataset serves as a challenging benchmark. Additionally, the impact of instruction fine-tuning (IFT) and in-context learning (ICL) is investigated.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper effectively addresses the specific challenges of LLM solutions for online shopping, with a dataset designed to tackle these issues.
2. ShopBench covers a wide range of essential tasks and skills for online shopping, ensuring thorough evaluation.
3. The benchmark is derived from real-world Amazon data, enhancing its applicability.
4. Evaluation of over 20 LLMs provides valuable insights into the current state and future prospects of LLM-based shopping assistants.

Weaknesses:
1. The uniqueness of the dataset is limited, as many challenges are partially covered in previous work.
2. While the dataset is challenging, its effectiveness for fine-tuning improvements is limited.
3. The paper lacks a clear conclusion and future solutions for identified issues, particularly regarding the integration of LLMs with current ranking models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation and conclusion sections. Additionally, the authors should provide a more systematic approach to the selection of the four aspects and 57 tasks, integrating them into a fundamental online shopping pipeline. It would be beneficial to revise observations about domain-specific models and ensure a fair comparison with their base counterparts. Lastly, we suggest enhancing the related work section to include seminal existing benchmarks and demonstrating how ShopBench uniquely measures model performance compared to other benchmarks.
