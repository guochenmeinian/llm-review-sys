### Key Points
This paper presents Flow-DPO, an innovative multi-agent learning framework that employs online Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enhance mathematical reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) through the generation of high-quality reasoning traces. The authors demonstrate significant improvements over traditional fine-tuning methods using both self-generated and ground-truth traces across standard mathematical datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The multi-agent design, utilizing both an Answer LLM and a Stop LLM for iterative reasoning trace generation, is a novel approach that facilitates nuanced decision-making.  
2. The application of online DPO with rollouts provides a dynamic method for optimizing LLM reasoning, outperforming static preference learning.  
3. The paper is well-structured, with clear motivation and promising results on benchmark datasets, highlighting the advantages of the multi-agent framework combined with DPO.

Weaknesses:  
1. The discussion on catastrophic forgetting is inadequate, and the paper lacks a comparison with standard Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) methods.  
2. The complexity of the multi-agent training setup introduces significant computational overhead, potentially limiting scalability.  
3. There is limited qualitative analysis, and further elaboration on computational complexity and hyperparameter tuning is needed for better understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on catastrophic forgetting and include a comparison with standard MCTS to clarify the effectiveness of their approach. Additionally, providing code or access to data sources used in the simulations would enhance reproducibility. We also suggest incorporating more qualitative evaluations, such as visualizing intermediate reasoning steps and clarifying the novelty of their method in relation to existing work in multi-agent learning and DPO with rollouts. Lastly, addressing the computational complexity and hyperparameter tuning, particularly regarding chunk sizes and stop criteria, would be beneficial.
