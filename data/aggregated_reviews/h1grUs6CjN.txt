Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the generalization gap of robust empirical risk minimization (ERM) for linear regression, emphasizing how the choice of optimization algorithm and architecture influences this gap. The authors propose that a steepest descent algorithm concerning the $l_p$ norm achieves the minimum $l_p$ norm interpolating solution for linearly separable data, while a reparametrization into a two-layer diagonal linear network biases toward the minimum $l_1$ norm solution. Additionally, the paper explores the implicit bias of robust ERM and its connection to robust generalization, particularly in the context of regularization choices for given perturbation sets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper establishes connections between implicit bias (from optimization algorithms and architecture) and adversarial robustness.
2. It includes an interesting discussion on optimal regularization for robust ERM concerning $l_\infty$.
3. The experiments are thorough and well-presented, supporting the theoretical findings.

Weaknesses:
1. The supporting arguments are incomplete; for instance, Section 2.1 primarily discusses the $l_\infty$ threat model without broader context, and Section 3.2 lacks a formal connection regarding the diagonal linear network's bias toward the minimum $l_1$ solution.
2. The technical contributions appear minor, as many results are extensions of well-known ERM findings, making the advancements to robust ERM seem straightforward.
3. The theoretical studies may be limited, and some results are derived from prior works, lacking novel insights.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the completeness of their arguments, particularly by expanding the discussion in Section 2.1 to include various threat models beyond $l_\infty$. Additionally, we suggest formalizing the connection in Section 3.2 regarding the diagonal linear network's bias toward the minimum $l_1$ solution. To enhance the technical contribution, the authors should clarify the novelty of their results and elaborate on the challenges faced in proving the implicit bias in linear models. Finally, including a result on steepest gradient dynamics for diagonal models would strengthen the analysis.
