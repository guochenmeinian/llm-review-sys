Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an approach utilizing deep learning (DL) for network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), emphasizing the necessity for continual updates to address "concept drift." The authors propose a novel method to tackle class-imbalance issues that lead to "catastrophic forgetting" (CF) and the associated computational overhead. Their contributions include techniques to enhance sample selection for memory replacement in continual learning and to estimate virtual SGD in memory-incremental learning (MIR) to reduce computational overhead. Specifically, they introduce Extended Class Balancing Reservoir Sampling (ECBRS), which tracks class counts to prioritize the replacement of samples from classes with higher counts, and Perturbation Assistance for Parameter Approximation (PAPA), which estimates virtual SGD updates using a two-component Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Empirical results show that ECBRS outperforms seven existing methods across 12 datasets, and PAPA reduces training time compared to MIR while achieving similar accuracy. The authors empirically validate their contributions across various datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
+ Addresses a relevant problem in the machine learning domain.
+ Conducts a large-scale evaluation with multiple repetitions.
+ Achieves good results that are somewhat theoretically grounded.
+ Provides rich supplementary material with detailed information.
+ The estimation of virtual SGD updates is an innovative approach.
+ Empirical results demonstrate that ECBRS generally outperforms existing methods, and PAPA effectively reduces training time.

Weaknesses:
- Utilizes inappropriate datasets that do not convincingly support the NIDS hypothesis.
- Contains somewhat confusing theoretical arguments and bold assumptions.
- Risks data snooping due to methodology design.
- Lacks clarity in several technical aspects and practical deployment considerations.
- The rationale for the applicability of error distribution from one task to another in PAPA requires further exploration.
- Font sizes in Tables 2-4 and some figures are too small, making them difficult to read.
- Certain aspects of the methodology need clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset selection by utilizing NID-specific datasets that reflect real-world scenarios, such as the MCP dataset. Additionally, we suggest including shallow methods in the evaluation to demonstrate the proposed method's relevance compared to traditional approaches. Clarifying the assumptions regarding the stability of malicious classes and the influx of correctly labeled samples is essential. We invite the authors to enhance the clarity of Section 3.2 and provide a detailed explanation of Figure 3. Furthermore, addressing the potential data snooping issue and expanding the limitations section in the main text would strengthen the paper. We also recommend improving the discussion on the applicability of error distributions across tasks in PAPA. Please increase the font sizes in Tables 2-4 and some figures for better readability. Additionally, clarifying specific items in the methodology to enhance understanding is necessary. Consider including a brief description of CBRS and MIR to make the paper more standalone. Lastly, focus on network intrusion datasets for evaluation, as the relevance of image datasets is unclear in the context of the proposed methods.
