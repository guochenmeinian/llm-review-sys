### Key Points
This paper presents a new denoising autoencoder for cryo-EM micrographs, named DRACO, which utilizes vision transformers (ViTs) and is trained on masked pairs of images with a noise2noise loss function combined with a reconstruction loss. A significant contribution is the curation of a large dataset of 270,000 experimental micrographs from public sources, which supports the model's training. The authors demonstrate that DRACO achieves state-of-the-art performance in denoising, particle picking, and micrograph curation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The manuscript accurately describes the problem and the limitations of traditional autoencoder training methods.  
- The proposed model is well-illustrated with figures and clear notation.  
- The effort to ensure high-quality training and testing datasets is commendable.  
- The results on evaluation tasks are impressive, despite some concerns about their calculation.

Weaknesses:  
- The method's description lacks detail, making implementation unclear, particularly regarding the input to the ViT and the [MASK] token.  
- Justifications for architectural choices, loss function construction, and data augmentation strategies are insufficiently explained.  
- Evaluation methods for the first two tasks require better motivation, particularly the SNR calculation and definitions of true/false positives in particle picking.  
- Section 5.4 is misleadingly labeled as an ablation study, focusing more on hyperparameter variation without removing or replacing pipeline steps.  
- Language issues, such as "theological analysis," detract from clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the method description by providing detailed implementation specifics, particularly regarding the input to the ViT and the [MASK] token. Additionally, we suggest justifying the architectural choices and loss function construction more thoroughly. The evaluation methods should be better motivated, with clear definitions for metrics used in particle picking. We also advise revising Section 5.4 to accurately reflect its content as a hyperparameter study rather than an ablation study. Finally, we encourage the authors to address language issues for improved clarity.
