### Key Points
This paper presents a multi-view temporal graph enhanced reasoning framework for temporal reasoning over time-involved documents, explicitly modeling the temporal relationships among facts. The authors propose a novel approach that constructs a multi-view heterogeneous temporal graph and utilizes a GNN-based graph reasoning component, culminating in a time-enhanced decoder for generating answers. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research topic is interesting, and the solution is clear.
- The proposed method shows promising results, outperforming several baselines.
- The idea of constructing a temporal graph is reasonable and innovative.

Weaknesses:
- The design of the proposed method lacks motivation, particularly regarding the segmentation of the heterogeneous temporal graph into two views.
- The construction of the time-focused graph is inadequately described, raising questions about the nature of time nodes and their relationships with fact nodes.
- The supervised baselines used are outdated, with some being from 2020, and the experimental analyses lack sufficient detail and explanation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the graph construction process, specifically detailing how time nodes are obtained and classified, as well as the relationships between time nodes and fact nodes. Additionally, we suggest updating the supervised baselines to include state-of-the-art QA models post-2022 and providing consistent baselines across different QA experiments. Finally, we encourage the authors to enhance the experimental analyses by offering explanations for instances where the proposed method underperforms compared to existing baselines.
