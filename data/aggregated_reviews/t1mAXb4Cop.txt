Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents MolPuzzle, a benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in molecular structure elucidation, involving the deduction of a molecule's structure from various spectral data. The dataset comprises 234 instances and over 18,000 QA samples across three interlinked sub-tasks: molecule understanding, spectrum interpretation, and molecule construction. The authors demonstrate that existing models, particularly GPT-4o, perform significantly worse than humans on complex tasks, highlighting the gap in LLM capabilities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work introduces a novel benchmark that effectively combines multiple modalities, reflecting real-world chemistry practices.
- The extensive evaluation of various state-of-the-art LLMs provides valuable insights into their performance and limitations.
- The dataset's comprehensive nature facilitates thorough assessments of LLM capabilities in molecular structure elucidation.

Weaknesses:
- LLMs exhibit limited understanding and reasoning in complex chemistry concepts, particularly in tasks 2 and 3.
- The dataset may lack sufficient diversity, potentially affecting the generalizability of model performance to real-world applications.
- The paper does not explore fine-tuning of models to enhance performance, which could have strengthened the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset's diversity by including a wider range of molecular structures and biological classes. Additionally, we suggest providing a working link to the code and data repository, as the current link leads to a 404 error. The authors should also expand the related work section to include other approaches to molecular structure elucidation, such as rule-based or other ML methods. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to elaborate on how specialized multimodal LLMs could be developed to improve performance, including potential fine-tuning strategies. Lastly, clarifying the creation of QA pairs for Stage 3 and providing more details on the iterative construction process would enhance the paper's clarity.
