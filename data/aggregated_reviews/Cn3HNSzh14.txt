### Key Points
This paper presents an empirical study evaluating different control mechanisms for text simplification, introducing a method that predicts edit operations for specific grade levels on an instance-per-instance basis. The authors analyze the impact of control tokens at both corpus and instance levels, demonstrating that instance-level control tokens yield better simplification quality. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The authors provide a thorough analysis of controllable text simplification using low-level tokens, which can aid users with varying literacy levels.  
- The proposed model achieves good results and includes an extensive evaluation of previous methods.  
- The study offers sufficient support for its claims and deepens understanding in the field.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks examples to illustrate the effects of different systems and relies solely on automatic metrics without human evaluation, raising concerns about the correlation with user preferences.  
- The innovation appears incremental, with results showing minimal variation. Additionally, the selection process for Control Predictor features is not explained, and the study is limited to one dataset.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including examples to demonstrate the effects of different control mechanisms and conducting human evaluations to validate the automatic metrics. Additionally, providing a detailed explanation of how Control Predictor features were selected would enhance clarity. The authors should also consider testing their method on multiple datasets to assess its generalizability and explore the use of other models for achieving control in text simplification. Finally, defining critical keywords and elaborating on various control tokens would strengthen the paper's contributions.
