Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) using Equivariant Neural Fields (ENFs) and Neural ODEs, emphasizing a space-time continuous approach that respects the inherent symmetries of the PDEs. The authors propose a meta-learning strategy to structure the latent space, enhancing generalization and data efficiency. The framework demonstrates effectiveness across various geometries and PDEs, particularly in complex dynamics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. **Data efficiency**: The framework enhances generalization from limited data by preserving PDE symmetries.  
2. **Novel initialization method**: The meta-learning approach simplifies the learning process, leading to improved performance compared to autodecoding.  
3. The method significantly reduces overfitting and shows good stability at 3â€“5x the training length.  
4. The proposed architecture effectively addresses equivariance in PDE solving, making it valuable for scientific applications.

Weaknesses:  
1. **Error Accumulation**: The use of ODESolver may lead to error accumulation over time, particularly beyond the training horizon, affecting long-term predictive accuracy.  
2. **Lack of Comparative Analysis**: The paper lacks comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, such as Geo-FNO, GNOT, and Transolver, which would strengthen its claims.  
3. The computational cost of the method compared to baselines is not adequately addressed.  
4. The empirical study is limited, lacking extensive benchmarks and large-scale datasets, particularly with irregular domains.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical study by including established benchmarks and large-scale datasets like PDEbench and CFDBench, especially for irregular domains. Additionally, a more extensive comparison with state-of-the-art methods should be conducted to validate the proposed framework's effectiveness. Testing the model over longer timespans would help address the error accumulation issue. Furthermore, providing detailed comparisons of training and inference times against existing methods would enhance the robustness of the results. Lastly, consider extending the method to handle non-equivariant boundary conditions and clarify how to choose invariance groups when underlying operators are unknown.
