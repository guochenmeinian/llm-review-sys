### Key Points
This paper presents a knowledge graph reasoning approach, the Relational rUle eNhanced Graph Neural Network (RUN-GNN), which addresses the sequentiality of relation composition and lagged entity information propagation. The authors propose a query related fusion gate unit and a buffering update mechanism, conducting experiments on various KG datasets for link prediction tasks. The results demonstrate good performance, although the novelty of the work is questioned as it appears to combine existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well motivated and executed, with clear architectural visualizations that enhance understanding.
- Extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets yield impressive results, often achieving state-of-the-art performance.
- The writing is generally clear, making the logical flow easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the approach is questionable, as it seems to rely on existing methods without sufficient differentiation.
- The writing requires improvement, particularly in clearly stating the motivation and justifying design choices.
- The related works section is incomplete, lacking references to recent KG-based embedding methods and inductive reasoning techniques.
- The evaluation lacks efficiency analysis and comparisons with baseline models, which are crucial for assessing the proposed method's performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction by explicitly stating the motivation for enhancing relational rules in GNNs and displaying learned rules in the experimental section. Additionally, the authors should provide a thorough comparison with baseline models, including PRGNN, and incorporate a detailed efficiency analysis of the proposed buffering update mechanism. We also suggest including more ablation studies to elucidate the design choices for the query related fusion gate unit and the buffering update mechanism. Finally, the authors should strengthen the related works section by including recent references relevant to KG-based methods and consider evaluating on larger datasets such as YAGO.
