Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Transition-Constant Normalization (TCN) designed for various image enhancement tasks, incorporating a transition-constant constraint to improve information transmission. The authors propose multiple formats for TCN, demonstrating its extensibility and effectiveness through extensive experiments across diverse scenarios, including low-light image enhancement and medical segmentation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation for the TCN is clearly articulated, and its design is reasonable, allowing for flexibility in application.
2. The method's architecture is straightforward, and the experiments validate its effectiveness across different tasks.
3. The paper is well-organized, making it easy to follow, with a clear presentation of results.

Weaknesses:
1. The claim that existing normalization methods are unsuitable for image enhancement is questionable, given that methods like Dncnn and RepSR successfully utilize normalization.
2. The main figure illustrating the TCN mechanism lacks clarity, requiring careful reading to understand its functionality.
3. The choice of baseline methods is outdated for certain tasks, raising concerns about the TCN's compatibility with more recent architectures.
4. The motivation for the TCN's design may not be directly linked to image enhancement, as traditional methods like CNNs and transformers have proven effective without this constraint.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the main figure depicting the TCN mechanism to enhance understanding. Additionally, the authors should provide a more thorough discussion on why existing normalization methods are inadequate for image enhancement, especially in light of successful implementations in prior works. It would be beneficial to include more recent baseline methods to demonstrate the TCN's effectiveness comprehensively. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of the TCN's design, particularly regarding its application to small resolution features, would strengthen the paper. Lastly, correcting writing errors and ensuring accurate equation and figure denotations are essential for clarity and professionalism.
