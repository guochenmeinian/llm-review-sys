Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents **WBCAtt**, a novel dataset for white blood cell (WBC) recognition that is densely annotated with 11 morphological attributes, which are crucial for hematologists in diagnosing blood-related diseases. The authors acknowledge that the dataset was not collected by them but argue that it offers richer and denser annotations than existing works. They conduct experiments using a standard CNN model, primarily ResNet50, to predict these attributes and evaluate the effectiveness of the peer loss method in mitigating annotation noise, showing mixed results. The authors also explore interesting applications of the dataset in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) relevant to pathology and hematology, while including findings for other models in supplementary materials.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is large and contains high-quality, clinically relevant annotations of white blood cell morphology, providing rich annotations for dense attributes and filling a gap in existing research.
- The authors provide detailed reasoning for each morphological attribute and demonstrate the application of peer loss to handle annotation noise, with clear results presented.
- The authors have made efforts to improve the manuscript based on reviewer feedback, including better organization of supplementary materials.

Weaknesses:
- Concerns regarding annotation quality arise from the limited involvement of pathologists, with only a few ambiguous cases reviewed, which may impact the dataset's perceived value.
- The dataset is imbalanced in terms of attributes, and the authors have not explored alternative model architectures beyond ResNet50, potentially overlooking performance insights from other backbones.
- There is a need for a data balancing strategy or loss weighting to ensure fair model performance across attributes, and the dataset's derivation from a single source limits its generalizability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the transparency of the annotation process by providing more details about the number of pathologists involved and their experience levels. It would also be beneficial to include annotations from multiple annotators for a larger portion of the dataset to enhance reliability. Additionally, we suggest that the authors address the imbalanced data issue and explore other model architectures, such as ViT, for benchmarking. We encourage the authors to include results from all tested backbones in the main paper to provide a comprehensive view of model performance. Finally, linking morphological attributes to clinically relevant downstream tasks and exploring data balancing strategies or loss weighting could further enhance the dataset's applicability and fairness in model performance across all attributes.
