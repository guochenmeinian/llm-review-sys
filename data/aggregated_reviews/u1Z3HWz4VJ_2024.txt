Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel adversarial training (AT) algorithm called RAMP, which aims to enhance robustness against multiple \( l_p \) attacks while maintaining accuracy. The authors propose two main components: (i) a logit pairing loss that enables a model robust against one \( l_p \) norm to also exhibit robustness against another \( l_q \) norm (with \( q \neq p \)), and (ii) a parameter update strategy that combines updates from natural training and adversarial training. Theoretical analysis indicates that this approach allows for faster convergence and improved accuracy-robustness trade-offs compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) AT models. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that RAMP achieves a superior accuracy-union robustness trade-off relative to existing methods. However, the theoretical analysis lacks a clear investigation of the correlations among distributions caused by different perturbations, and the novelty of the proposed method compared to existing approaches, such as TRADES, is questioned.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- **Original AT algorithm**: RAMP uniquely addresses the dual challenges of enhancing robustness against multiple \( l_p \) perturbations and improving the accuracy-robustness trade-off.
- **Theoretical analysis**: The paper provides a deep theoretical examination of how gradient projection impacts adversarial robustness, supporting the effectiveness of the proposed updates.
- **Comprehensive experiments**: The evaluation includes various models and datasets, considering multiple perturbation values for \( l_\infty \), \( l_1 \), and \( l_2 \).
- The approach demonstrates effectiveness in improving union accuracy with significant margins.

Weaknesses:
- **Limited computational analysis**: The time per epoch analysis is insufficient, as it is based solely on ResNet-18 and CIFAR-10, despite using other models in experiments. More results are needed to substantiate claims about runtime costs.
- **Trade-off concerns**: RAMP's clean accuracy is consistently lower than that of the baseline E-AT, raising questions about the effectiveness of the accuracy-robustness trade-off. The authors should clarify why this occurs and how to enhance clean accuracy.
- **Novelty issues**: The logit pairing concept is not novel, and the algorithm's focus on \( l_1 \), \( l_2 \), and \( l_\infty \) norms is seen as too narrow. Broader perturbation types should be considered for greater generality.
- The implementation details for the \( l_0 \) attack and common corruption attacks are insufficiently described, hindering comprehensive assessment. The theoretical analysis does not adequately investigate the correlation among distributions from different perturbations, raising concerns about the novelty of the work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of computational costs by including time per epoch results for additional models, such as WRN-28-10 and others on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the observed clean accuracy drops and explore methods to enhance this metric while maintaining union accuracy. To address concerns regarding novelty, we suggest considering a wider range of perturbations, including \( l_0 \) bounded perturbations and common corruptions, to broaden the applicability of RAMP. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the implementation details for the \( l_0 \) attack and common corruption attacks to allow for a more thorough evaluation of their method. Lastly, we suggest conducting a more in-depth theoretical analysis of the correlations among distributions caused by different types of perturbations to enhance the novelty and rigor of their work. A significant revision may warrant a re-submission for a more thorough review process.
