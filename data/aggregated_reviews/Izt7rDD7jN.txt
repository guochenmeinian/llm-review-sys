### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical framework for online smoothed learning of piecewise affine models (PWA) in time-series data, demonstrating that it can achieve sublinear regret in dynamics prediction. The authors propose a decomposition of the hypothesis class into affine classes across polyhedral components and an indicator for component selection. They establish results on parameter recovery and simulation regret, although the regret bound is noted to be weak.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper contributes significantly to the fields of learning in dynamical/control systems and online learning, particularly with its polynomial regret bound in system parameters.  
- The main algorithm is straightforward to implement and shows promise for real-world applications, especially in robotics.  
- The writing quality is generally good, making the main developments easy to follow.  

Weaknesses:  
- The regret bound is weak, essentially $o(T)$, and could benefit from a more robust proof.  
- The parameter recovery rate is slow, and the authors should clarify the implications of referring to it as a "parametric rate."  
- Some assumptions, such as Assumption 2 regarding jumps in PWA, may not be as mild as suggested.  
- The paper contains several typographical errors and lacks clarity in certain definitions and assumptions, which may confuse readers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the regret bound to provide a more palatable rate before submission. Additionally, the authors should consider enhancing the parameter recovery bound, possibly by controlling the $L^2$ prediction error of the hypothesis class. It would be beneficial to add reference [A] to the related work section and address the implications of the assumptions made, particularly regarding their strength and practical applicability. Furthermore, we suggest clarifying the meaning of "$\Theta(\sigma_{dir}^{d})$-smoothness" and ensuring that all assumptions are formally stated. Lastly, addressing the typographical errors and providing more context for key definitions would enhance the paper's clarity.
