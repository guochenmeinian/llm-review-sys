Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents multiple methods for generating synthetic time series data under user-defined constraints, including both hard and soft constraints. The authors propose a Constrained Optimization Problem (COP) approach that utilizes a seed time series to optimize the L2 distance while adhering to constraints. Additionally, they introduce a conditional diffusion model, DiffTime, which incorporates these constraints into the diffusion process. The paper includes a comparative evaluation against existing models using both real-world and synthetic datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well-written, clear, and provides substantial motivation for the importance of constrained time series generation. The methods are evaluated comprehensively against existing models, demonstrating superior performance. The clarity of the context and solutions is commendable.

Weaknesses:  
The originality of the approaches is somewhat limited, with the first three methods appearing as simple adaptations of existing techniques. The clarity of certain terms and definitions in the paper needs improvement. The experiments lack a robust case study to support the motivation for constrained generation, and the use of t-SNE for results visualization is not rigorous. Additionally, the paper does not adequately address the challenges of nonstationary data or provide sufficient implementation details.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and definition of key terms, such as "seed" and "desired property," to enhance reader understanding. It would be beneficial to include a case study or demonstrate the advantages of their methods on a downstream task to strengthen the argument for constrained generation. We suggest incorporating more datasets and baselines in the experiments, including a naive approach for comparison. Furthermore, the authors should clarify how COP is applied in unconstrained settings and consider including diffusion models as baselines for DiffTime. Lastly, addressing the potential optimization issues related to incorporating constraints during training would enhance the robustness of the paper.
