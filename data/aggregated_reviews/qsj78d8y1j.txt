Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a bidding algorithm that achieves root T regret compared to the best Lipschitz bidding function, representing a stronger baseline than previous works. The authors utilize a primal/dual framework to derive this algorithm, which also yields good interval regret. Additionally, the paper includes results on transforming a no-regret algorithm to satisfy budget and ROI constraints with high probability and discusses the limitations of achieving similar regret bounds under bandit feedback.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors effectively highlight the novel aspects of their analysis.
- The paper is well-written and accessible.
- The problem of automated bidding is of significant interest to the community.
- The model is general, covering various auction settings and buyer objectives, and provides solid theoretical results, including near-optimal regret bounds.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution of using a Lipschitz baseline instead of a constant multiple is unclear without familiarity with the literature.
- The paper is dense and challenging for non-expert readers, with some sections being overly long and difficult to parse.
- The technical focus overshadows practical implications, and the complexity of the proposed algorithms may hinder understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by simplifying overly complex sections and providing clearer transitions between problem formulation and algorithmic solutions. Additionally, discussing relevant prior work, particularly [18], earlier in the introduction would provide better context for the paper's contributions. We also suggest that the authors address practical implementation challenges of their algorithms and consider deferring some technical discussions to later sections or an appendix for better readability.
