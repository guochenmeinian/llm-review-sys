### Key Points
This paper presents the SMRC^2 model for learning representations of scientific papers, focusing on two main components: 1) a semantic information learning phase utilizing a GNN encoder and LM encoder, trained with a Wasserstein distance constraint; and 2) a relatedness information learning phase that constructs a multi-document citation graph, with a GNN decoder predicting masked edges. The model aims to enhance representation of scientific literature by integrating content and topological information. The authors also introduce a new dataset to facilitate further research in multi-document representation learning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The SMRC^2 model effectively combines semantic content and topological relatedness, showing improved performance on benchmarks.
- The introduction of Wasserstein distance as a constraint is a significant contribution, demonstrating better results compared to KL divergence.
- The paper is generally well-structured and provides a comprehensive analysis of experimental results.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments lack sufficient depth, with limited baseline comparisons and insufficient ablation studies to validate proposed strategies.
- The clarity of the paper is compromised by vague descriptions, particularly regarding dataset creation and the specifics of the GNN's message passing mechanism.
- The title is misleading and does not accurately reflect the content of the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the abstract and introduction, explicitly stating the outputs of their model. Additionally, providing an illustrative example early in the paper would enhance understanding. The authors should clarify the motivation behind using GNNs and provide detailed descriptions of the dataset creation process, including the selection criteria for the Bio-Sci dataset. We also suggest including more recent baseline models in the experiments and conducting additional ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies. Finally, addressing the specifics of the GNN's message passing mechanism in Section 3.2 would strengthen the paper's technical rigor.
