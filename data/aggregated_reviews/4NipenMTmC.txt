### Key Points
This paper presents ArtistAuditor, a tool designed to detect style piracy in AI models without altering original artworks. It utilizes style extraction and a discriminator to determine if a model has been fine-tuned on an artistâ€™s style, demonstrating high accuracy (AUC > 0.937) and effectiveness on the Scenario platform. The authors propose a novel method for copyright auditing by employing multi-granularity style representations, aiming to address the challenges of copyright infringement in generative AI.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The writing is clear, and the methodology is well-structured, providing a comprehensive overview of style piracy.
- The experiments are abundant and multi-dimensional, showcasing the tool's practical applicability and robustness.

Weaknesses:
- The method relies heavily on existing style extraction techniques, offering limited novelty. The threshold-based decision-making approach may be impractical, requiring constant adjustment.
- The experiments lack comprehensiveness, particularly regarding the impact of adversarial perturbations and the limited set of comparison methods, which weakens the robustness of the findings.
- Clarity issues exist in technical details, and some figures require improved captions and readability enhancements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding the metrics used for scoring the baseline, ensuring that the baseline is judged using the most similar possible metric to the proposed tool. Additionally, we suggest including a more comprehensive set of comparison methods to strengthen the evaluation. Addressing the potential impact of adversarial perturbations on ArtistAuditor's effectiveness would enhance the paper's quality. Furthermore, we advise revising the writing style to adhere to citation norms, using authors' names where appropriate to improve readability. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore how ArtistAuditor performs with artworks from less well-known artists and to clarify the computational requirements for running the tool on consumer-grade GPUs.
