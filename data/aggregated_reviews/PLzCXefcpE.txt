Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the effectiveness of re-sampling methods in long-tailed image classification, revealing that re-sampling can lead to overfitting on irrelevant contexts. The authors propose a context-shift augmentation module to mitigate this issue. Experimental results demonstrate improvements on datasets such as CIFAR-LT and ImageNet-LT, although the authors acknowledge that their method does not achieve state-of-the-art performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors explore an important and under-addressed issue regarding the sensitivity of re-sampling to irrelevant contexts.
- The paper is well-structured, making it easy to follow, and includes extensive experiments and ablation studies.
- The proposed context-shift augmentation method shows promise in improving performance on long-tailed datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The synthetic experiments, particularly with CMNIST-LT, do not convincingly support the claims regarding spurious correlations.
- The paper lacks comparisons with several relevant state-of-the-art methods and data augmentation techniques.
- The presentation could be improved, as some sentences are difficult to parse, and definitions for key concepts like "context" and "content" are missing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing formal definitions for "context" and "content." Additionally, conducting experiments on more complex datasets and including comparisons with state-of-the-art methods such as Long-Tail Learning via Logit Adjustment and Balanced Contrastive Learning for Long-Tailed Visual Recognition would strengthen the submission. We also suggest visualizing the generated dataset and the Grad-CAM maps to better illustrate the effectiveness of the context-shift augmentation. Finally, a more thorough analysis of hyperparameters, particularly \(\lambda\) in Eq. (7), should be included to address concerns about their selection.
