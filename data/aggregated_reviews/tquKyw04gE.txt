### Key Points
This paper presents a new dataset, AnonNER, for fine-grained Named Entity Recognition (NER) across 12 languages, addressing challenges such as effective context representation and performance degradation due to noise. The dataset includes noisy inputs simulating visual and phonetic errors and is built from public resources like Wikipedia and Wikidata. The authors evaluate the XLM-RoBERTa model on this dataset, demonstrating the impact of noise on performance. The dataset's unique contribution lies in its focus on noisy test sets, which is a relatively unexplored area in NER literature.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset tackles realistic challenges in NER, including short text representation and noise from digitization.
- It covers a diverse range of languages and entity types, contributing significantly to the field.
- The evaluation section, particularly regarding noise, is well-articulated and informative.

Weaknesses:
- The paper's main contributions are largely relegated to a lengthy appendix, which diminishes the clarity of the primary text.
- The novelty of the dataset is questioned, as it closely mirrors the methodology of previously published work (MultiCoNER).
- There are missing references related to noisy and fine-grained NER datasets, and the lack of a data link is a significant oversight.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper's structure by integrating critical dataset creation details into the main body rather than the appendix. Additionally, clarifying the unique methodological contributions of this dataset compared to existing works, particularly Malmasi et al. (2022a), would enhance transparency. The authors should also ensure that all relevant references are included and provide a link to the dataset within the paper. Finally, addressing the formatting issues with tables to comply with the ACL template is essential for presentation quality.
