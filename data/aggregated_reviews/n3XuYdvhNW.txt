### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approximation to the squared Wasserstein distance, termed min-SWGG, which is based on the sliced Wasserstein distance (SWD) and projected Wasserstein distance (PWD). The authors derive a tighter upper bound for the squared Wasserstein distance compared to PWD and connect min-SWGG to Wasserstein Generalized Geodesics using a pivot measure. The paper includes efficient algorithms for computing min-SWGG and demonstrates its application in image color transfer, point cloud matching, and empirical optimization, showing promising computational efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is comprehensive in its formulation of min-SWGG and presents significant theoretical contributions, including a new optimal transport approximation and connections to generalized geodesics.  
- The writing is clear, with a well-structured introduction and a self-contained background.  
- Experimental results indicate better computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Weaknesses:  
- The practical applications are underwhelming, with experiments primarily on synthetic data, lacking convincing demonstrations in high-dimensional scenarios.  
- The paper contains many grammatical and spelling errors, which detracts from its presentation quality.  
- The formulation of min-SWGG is seen as incremental, and the complexity of the algorithm in more general settings is not adequately addressed.  
- Some important details and experimental results are relegated to the supplementary material, which may not be ideal for clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical background by providing sufficient and/or necessary conditions for the existence of minimizers in Definition 4.1. Additionally, the authors should connect the distance defined in equation (13) to the literature on linearized optimal transport distances. A careful proofreading of the manuscript is essential to correct grammatical and spelling errors. We also suggest enhancing the practical aspect of the paper by including experiments on truly high-dimensional applications and providing more descriptive captions for figures, particularly Figure 4, to clarify the experimental messages.
