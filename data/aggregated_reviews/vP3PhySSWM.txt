Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Inductive Graph Alignment Prompt (IGAP), a method designed to address the gap between graph pre-training and inductive fine-tuning. The authors propose a graph prompting technique that introduces learnable prompts to align graph signals and structures, supported by theoretical insights from graph spectral theory. The experiments demonstrate IGAP's effectiveness across transductive, semi-inductive, and inductive settings, highlighting its versatility.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- IGAP offers an innovative approach that effectively bridges the data gap in graph neural networks (GNNs).
- The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of graph pre-training, identifying key gaps and proposing solutions.
- Extensive empirical validation showcases the method's effectiveness across various scenarios.

Weaknesses:
- The complexity of the approach may pose challenges for practitioners, given its reliance on theoretical concepts.
- There is limited discussion on the scalability of IGAP for large graphs.
- The potential for overfitting exists, particularly in cases where pre-training and fine-tuning data differ significantly.
- Experimental setups lack standard deviations, and the selection of "best checkpoints" for model comparison raises concerns.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical support for the graph structural prompt by providing synthetic results when \( U_{pt_k} \) is known and replacing \( P_t U_{ft_K} \) in Eq. 18 to validate its effectiveness. Additionally, conducting repeated experiments with statistical analyses would enhance the reliability of the results. We also suggest clarifying the model comparison methodology by using validation data to select a single checkpoint for each baseline. Lastly, addressing the scalability of IGAP in real-world applications and potential overfitting risks would strengthen the paper.
