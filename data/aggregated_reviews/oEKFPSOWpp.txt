Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents NeuralSteiner, a two-phase global routing scheme aimed at optimizing wirelength and overflow in VLSI design. The authors introduce a novel approach that builds upon HubRouter, dividing the routing process into two stages: predicting candidate points and connecting them while minimizing overflow. NeuralSteiner demonstrates a significant reduction in overflow (up to 99.8%) with a minimal increase in wirelength (1.8%). The method effectively generalizes to large-scale circuits, utilizing a CNN structure for candidate point recognition and a heuristic construction method for Steiner trees.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. NeuralSteiner effectively reduces overflow in global routing, demonstrating empirical success with significant improvements over traditional methods.
2. The proposed parallel technique allows for simultaneous routing of non-conflicting nets, alleviating time constraints.
3. The paper is well-structured, with clear motivations and thorough experimental validation.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks an analysis of time complexity in the construction stage, raising concerns about scalability.
2. Some experimental settings are not disclosed, and the results may be confusing due to the inclusion of training dataset cases.
3. The reliance on a post-processing algorithm for RST construction limits the end-to-end nature of the approach.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the distance calculation in line 222 by providing a detailed explanation in the final version, specifying that it is based on the weighted graph NAG and determined according to Equation 8. Additionally, we suggest including a comprehensive analysis of time complexity for the construction stage to address scalability concerns. It would also be beneficial to clarify the unique technical contributions of NeuralSteiner compared to prior works like HubRouter. Lastly, providing the number of Steiner points inserted in the results tables would enhance the understanding of the optimization process.
