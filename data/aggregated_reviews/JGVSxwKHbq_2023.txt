Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the GeoDE dataset, a manually collected, geographically diverse dataset comprising 61,940 images across 40 classes and 6 world regions, specifically designed for object recognition without personally identifiable information. The dataset aims to address copyright and privacy issues inherent in web-scraped datasets, such as DollarStreet, and provides a unique compilation of images from distinct global regions. The authors demonstrate that training with GeoDE can effectively mitigate challenges posed by the diverse appearances of objects across different regions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
* The meticulous image collection approach addresses privacy, consent, and copyright concerns.
* GeoDE surpasses the DollarStreet dataset in terms of the number of images, enhancing model training and evaluation.
* The dataset reveals regional variations in object appearances, impacting the accuracy of object recognition methods.

Weaknesses:
* The high cost of the data collection method limits scalability, affecting the dataset's representativeness and diversity.
* The broad geographical divisions may not capture nuanced differences in object appearances among countries, potentially introducing biases.
* The differentiation between GeoDE and DollarStreet remains limited, and a more detailed comparison is necessary.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the granularity of geographical divisions to capture country-specific object appearance differences, which could help mitigate unknown data biases. Additionally, we suggest including a comparison of GeoDE with large object detection datasets like COCO to highlight its strengths in object recognition tasks. A detailed analysis of image resolutions and a long-term data maintenance plan should also be provided to enhance the dataset's usability and sustainability.
