Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the algorithm PROTES for solving discrete optimization problems through probabilistic sampling to create a probability function of minimal (or maximal) values of a target function. The authors utilize a tensor train (TT)-representation for tensors to enhance computational efficiency. The method is tested on 20 problem instances and compared with seven other methods, demonstrating stability and performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized and clearly written.
- The technical method is intuitive, with good empirical performance and comprehensive comparisons to relevant state-of-the-art baselines.
- Detailed motivation and analysis of computational complexity enhance the comprehensiveness of the work.

Weaknesses:
- The method lacks sufficient motivation, and the update rule is unclear, making it difficult to assess its contribution to the field.
- The application to constrained optimization is underexplained, and the instance sizes for QUBO problems are too small.
- Testing only one instance per problem limits the ability to generalize the efficacy of the method.
- The relationship between the optimization method and other sections is hard to follow, and the experiments seem too simplistic to fully demonstrate effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for the method and clarify the update rule to enhance understanding of its contribution. Additionally, a more thorough discussion on handling general constrained optimization problems is necessary. The authors should consider testing multiple instances per problem size to provide a clearer picture of the method's generalizability. We also suggest expanding the dimensionality spectrum of test problems and including error bars in the experimental results to better illustrate the probabilistic nature of the approach. Lastly, a clearer explanation of the tensor network diagram and the computational complexities of prior works should be included to strengthen the comparison with existing methods.
