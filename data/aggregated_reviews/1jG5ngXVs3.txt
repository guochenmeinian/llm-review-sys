Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents FlowTurbo, a framework designed to accelerate flow-based generative models. Key contributions include: 1) a lightweight velocity refiner for efficient velocity offset estimation during sampling; 2) a pseudo corrector that reduces model evaluations while maintaining second-order convergence; and 3) sample-aware compilation to create a static graph for enhanced speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant acceleration (30-58%) in class-conditioned and text-to-image generation, achieving a state-of-the-art sampling speed of 38 ms/image with an FID of 3.93 on ImageNet 256x256. FlowTurbo's compatibility with multi-step sampling allows its application to tasks such as image editing and inpainting.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The introduction of a lightweight velocity refiner and the use of pseudo correctors are novel and effective.  
- Comprehensive experimental results validate the proposed methods across various tasks, including detailed ablation studies.  
- The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear visualizations, such as Figure 2, illustrating key concepts.  
- FlowTurbo achieves real-time performance without compromising image quality, showcasing its versatility for multiple applications.

Weaknesses:  
- The choice of insta-flow as the teacher model for text-to-image generation limits exploration of other flow-based models, such as sd3.  
- The design and arrangement of sampling blocks are somewhat confusing, requiring empirical tuning for different tasks.  
- Missing comparisons with efficient diffusion distillation methods and other flow-based models hinder a complete evaluation of FlowTurbo's advantages.  
- The paper lacks an ablation study on the architecture of the refiner and how it adapts to different model sizes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the exploration of alternative flow-based models, such as sd3, to enhance the robustness of their findings. Additionally, providing a clearer rationale for the design and order of sampling blocks would aid in understanding their configuration. We suggest including comparisons with efficient diffusion distillation methods to substantiate claims of FlowTurbo's efficiency. Finally, an ablation study on the refiner architecture and its adaptability to different model sizes would strengthen the paper's contributions.
