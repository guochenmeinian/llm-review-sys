Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new benchmark for Chinese historical document analysis, named $M^5$HisDoc, which includes approximately 8,000 multi-style images. The dataset is divided into two subsets: $M^5$HisDoc-R (Regular) and $M^5$HisDoc-H (Hard), and is designed for tasks such as text line/character detection and recognition, and reading order prediction. The authors conduct thorough baseline experiments demonstrating the dataset's potential to address novel challenges in historical document analysis. Additionally, the paper provides a comprehensive study on historical document analysis, focusing on evaluation metrics like 1-NED, CR, AR, and ARD, which assess the performance of the OCR model. The dataset includes historical documents from various Chinese dynasties, and the authors acknowledge the limitations of their dataset, particularly its focus on Chinese historical texts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
- The paper is well-written, clearly articulating its motivation and contributions.
- The dataset is diverse and meticulously annotated, filling a significant gap in historical document research.
- Extensive baseline experiments are conducted, showcasing the dataset's applicability.
- The paper effectively describes the data collection and preparation processes, along with evaluation methods.
- The authors demonstrate a commitment to enhancing the clarity of their work by addressing reviewer comments and incorporating additional examples and explanations.

**Weaknesses:**
- The paper lacks clarity on the historical context of the documents included in the dataset.
- There is insufficient comparison with existing datasets, particularly regarding the diversity and unique character counts.
- The rationale for focusing on character-level annotation is not adequately justified.
- The distinction between text line detection and recognition is not clearly articulated, potentially confusing readers unfamiliar with these concepts.
- The evaluation metrics lack intuitive explanations for non-experts, and the historical context of the dataset is inadequately presented.
- The dataset is limited to Chinese historical documents, raising questions about the availability of similar datasets for other languages.
- The download link for the dataset is invalid, and some details about the dataset's sources and licenses are missing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the historical periods of the documents included in the dataset. Additionally, providing a comparison between the OCR model predictions and expert annotations would enhance understanding of the model's contributions. The authors should clarify how the 300 images from MTHv2 and 700 images from SCUT-CAB were selected. We also suggest that the authors justify their focus on character-level annotation over line-level methods, given the advancements in segmentation-free OCR techniques. Furthermore, we recommend improving clarity around the different tasks, particularly distinguishing between text line detection and recognition. Providing more discussion on the evaluation metrics would benefit non-expert readers. Including examples of model output, especially errors alongside ground-truth annotations, would enhance understanding. Finally, the authors should ensure that the dataset download link is functional and provide comprehensive details about the dataset's sources and licensing in the main text, as well as information about the museums from which images were sourced, along with their redistribution policies.
