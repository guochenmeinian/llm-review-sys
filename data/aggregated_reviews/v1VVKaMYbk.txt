Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents H2RBox-v2, an innovative approach that enhances HBox-supervised oriented object detection by integrating a self-supervised branch for angle regression and a weakly-supervised branch utilizing a new CircumIoU loss. The authors propose to leverage reflection symmetry to improve detection accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various datasets, including DOTA and HRSC.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel concept of using reflection symmetry for angle regression, which is a significant advancement in the field.
- H2RBox-v2 demonstrates improved performance over its predecessor, H2RBox, and is well-structured, making the methodology clear and understandable.
- The approach effectively bridges the gap between HBox-supervised and RBox-supervised detection, potentially reducing annotation costs.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical foundation regarding reflection symmetry is not fully comprehensive, particularly in scenarios with multiple objects in an image.
- The methodology lacks clarity, especially concerning the CircumIoU loss, which is not adequately defined in the methodology section.
- The ablation studies do not convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed components, raising questions about the significance of the PSC coder and the relationship between reflection symmetry learning and multi-branch self-supervised learning.
- The inference process for H2RBox-v2 is unclear, particularly regarding the expected computational overhead compared to H2RBox.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors enhance the theoretical analysis in Section 3.1 by restating the logic regarding reflection symmetry to clarify its implications in multi-object scenarios.
2. We suggest that the authors provide a clearer definition and explanation of the CircumIoU loss in the methodology section to distinguish it from prior works.
3. We encourage the authors to conduct additional experiments to validate the significance of the PSC coder and its impact on performance across different datasets.
4. We advise the authors to clarify the inference process for H2RBox-v2, including any computational overhead introduced by the self-supervised branch.
5. We recommend revising figures and tables for clarity, particularly Figure 2, to highlight key points and improve overall presentation.
