Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Thought Cloning (TC), an imitation learning method that not only clones behaviors but also the thoughts associated with those behaviors, using descriptive texts. The authors apply TC to a partially observable 2D grid world domain, demonstrating that it yields superior performance compared to traditional behavior cloning (BC) in terms of training speed and generalization to out-of-distribution environments. The paper discusses the implications of TC for AI safety and interpretability, making a strong empirical case for its effectiveness, particularly in the BabyAI environment.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach is innovative and could have significant impact if scaled.
- The paper is well-written and organized, making it easy to follow.
- TC shows advantages over BC, including faster training and improved generalization.
- The cognitive science motivation is compelling, enhancing the contribution's significance.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution would be stronger if the authors demonstrated scalability to more complex domains.
- The arguments regarding human cognition are somewhat loose and could benefit from clarification.
- The paper lacks a thorough comparison with prior work in the field of natural language-based learning.
- The ablation study is inadequately described, leaving interpretation ambiguous.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their arguments regarding human cognition and provide more detailed explanations for Equation 1. Additionally, please include what error bars represent in the figures. To strengthen the paper, we suggest conducting experiments in more diverse environments beyond BabyAI and addressing the limitations related to the collection of high-quality thoughts for training TC agents. Finally, we encourage a more robust safety analysis to substantiate the claims regarding the safety implications of TC.
