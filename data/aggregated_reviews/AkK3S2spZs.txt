### Key Points
This paper presents a framework utilizing algorithmic game theory to analyze potential data sharing among competing firms training machine learning models. The authors investigate the trade-offs faced by data-using agents regarding collaboration to enhance their ML performance while considering the impact on profits. The analysis draws from conventional market models in economics, specifically a Stackelberg game setup involving two companies, where the larger company $F_1$ has a superior cost function ($\beta_1 > \beta_2$) and more data ($n_1 > n_2$). The authors derive collaboration criteria for both firms, indicating that while the first firm's incentives to collaborate remain unchanged compared to the Cournot case, the second firm's incentives decrease. However, due to the conditions set, the second firm will always prefer collaboration. The analysis suggests that the first firm can achieve larger profits in the Stackelberg setup compared to the previous Cournot equilibrium, with implications for regulations on data sharing.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-motivated, addressing the understudied incentives for data sharing among firms.
- It effectively combines theoretical modeling with simulation evidence, enhancing reader comprehension of the implications.
- The assumptions made are generally plausible, and the authors provide a solid argument for their relevance.
- The analysis incorporates the Stackelberg game framework, providing clear collaboration criteria for both firms.
- The findings regarding the incentives for collaboration are well-supported by the mathematical derivations.
- The comparison with the Cournot case adds depth to the analysis and highlights the implications of the Stackelberg setup.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on conventional economic assumptions poses a threat to the validity and long-term impact of the work; empirical validation is needed.
- The discussion of data as a "key asset" is overly broad, lacking specific use cases that could clarify the context of claims and results.
- The framework does not adequately address the potential for commons or public goods, nor does it engage with sociological perspectives on collective action.
- The reduction in the second firm's incentives for collaboration could be explored in greater detail to understand its implications fully.
- The paper could benefit from a more explicit discussion on the practical applications of the findings in real-world scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by explicitly stating the empirical contexts for their assumptions, enhancing the discussion on the contextual dependency of their analyses. Additionally, incorporating a brief mention of commons and public goods could enrich the framework. Engaging with literature on collective action may provide valuable insights. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of the simulations used and discussing the implications of different data distributions among collaborative partners would strengthen the analysis. We also suggest that the authors improve the exploration of the decreased incentives for the second firm to collaborate, providing more context on its implications. Lastly, including a discussion on the practical applications of their findings would enhance the relevance of the analysis and including a high-level summary of each section could improve clarity and accessibility for a broader audience.
