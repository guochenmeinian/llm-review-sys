Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an enhancement to Deep Thinking Networks by introducing Lipschitz constraints to address stability issues during training and inference. The authors identify problems related to exploding latent representations and propose a method that ensures Lipschitz smoothness, demonstrating its effectiveness through various examples, including the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). The proposed model, DT-L, shows improved stability and performance, particularly in extrapolating solutions to NP-Hard problems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is clearly written and well-motivated, with a logical progression from problem identification to solution proposal and validation.
- The approach is mathematically grounded, and the experiments are thorough, utilizing multiple random seeds and reporting error bars.
- The work is original and presents significant findings, particularly in the context of easy-to-hard generalization and TSP solving.

Weaknesses:
- The idea, while straightforward, may limit the perceived technical contributions of the work.
- Results for DT-L on TSP appear inferior to those of NN Tours and BNN Tours, warranting further explanation.
- The examples presented are somewhat simplistic, raising questions about the broader applicability of DT-L.
- Additional visualizations are needed to intuitively illustrate the advantages of DT-L over DT and DT-R.
- The title lacks informativeness; incorporating "Lipschitz smoothness" could enhance clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by defining acronyms such as IPT and specifying units in Table 1. Additionally, addressing the concerns regarding the performance of DT-L on TSP and providing more comprehensive visualizations would strengthen the paper. We also suggest exploring the implications of Lipschitz constraints on computational complexity and training time, as well as considering extensions of the DT-L model to other iterative algorithms and transformer architectures. Finally, enhancing the interpretability of the learned algorithms could make the decision-making process of the DT-L model more transparent.
