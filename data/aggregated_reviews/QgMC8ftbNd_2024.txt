Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an abstract model of reinforcement learning (RL) with information structures, investigating necessary conditions for sample-efficient learning. The authors propose a POST/POSG framework that allows for the representation of arbitrary dynamics and information structures in decision-making problems, emphasizing its ability to analyze statistical complexity. The framework encompasses various previously studied models, such as partially-observable sequential teams (POST) and partially-observable sequential games (POSG), and characterizes the complexity of observable dynamics in sequential decision-making problems. The authors argue that while reformulating problems as POMDPs or MDPs is possible, it leads to an explosion in model size, which hampers the analysis of statistical complexity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The results are general and encompass findings from several prior works, providing a solid theoretical foundation for understanding the complexity and tractability of POST and POSG problems, including upper bounds on sample complexity.  
- The framework's generality allows for rich analysis of complex systems and effectively connects to existing literature, such as the Witsenhausen intrinsic model.  
- The discussion on the weakly-revealing condition extends existing observability conditions to arbitrary information structures, which is a notable contribution.  

Weaknesses:  
- The technical novelty and originality are unclear, as the framework appears to largely abstract existing analyses, particularly from Liu et al. (2022b).  
- The identification of a new, concrete, and tractable problem class is lacking, as existing classes like POMDPs and POMG have already been studied.  
- The claim regarding the explosion in model size due to reformulations is not straightforward and may require further clarification.  
- The complexity measure relies on finite state and action spaces, which limits its applicability to infinite or continuous cases.  
- The complexity of the relationship between state-space cardinality and statistical complexity is not fully explored.  
- Presentation issues hinder comprehension, particularly regarding definitions and concepts like core tests.  
- The theoretical nature of the results necessitates empirical validation to demonstrate practical implications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by providing layman summaries for technical definitions, particularly for concepts like core tests. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the significance of their framework beyond its generality, possibly by identifying a new, meaningful tractable class. It would be beneficial to improve the clarity of the claim regarding model size explosion due to reformulations, possibly by adding a remark on MDP/POMDP reformulations in the Appendix. We also encourage the authors to move part of the discussion from Appendix D to the main text for better accessibility and to provide insights on how Definition 6 applies in specific examples to enhance understanding of the learnability of partially observable systems. Finally, including empirical results to validate the theoretical claims and addressing the sensitivity of results related to the m-step \(\mathcal{I}^{\dagger}\)-weakly revealing condition would strengthen the paper.
