### Key Points
This paper investigates the linguistic phenomenon of negation within the context of LLMs, presenting a dataset of 400K examples with True/False labels, predominantly featuring negation. The authors explore LLMs' understanding of negation through zero-shot and fine-tuning experiments, concluding that negation remains a challenge for these models. The study emphasizes the need for a well-grounded linguistic analysis to enhance LLM performance on negation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is a valuable resource for future research, constructed through sound linguistic reasoning and representative of various aspects of negation.
- The paper includes a thorough qualitative analysis performed by human annotators and a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs of different sizes and types.
- The authors provide well-founded explanations for observed model performance and behavior, particularly in the fine-tuning experiment with Vicuna.

Weaknesses:
- The relatively low number of examples evaluated by humans (only 220 out of 400K) limits the qualitative evaluation's strength.
- The construction of the dataset is somewhat ambiguous, lacking sufficient examples for the different patterns described.
- The evaluation metric "Coherence" is not clearly defined, and the core insights from the results are not fully articulated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset by ensuring a more representative selection of examples for each pattern, ideally increasing the number of human-evaluated examples to around a thousand. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the definition of "Coherence" and elaborating on the insights from the results, particularly regarding the performance discrepancies observed in LLaMA65B. Furthermore, exploring in-context learning performance and incorporating various additional approaches to assess negation understanding would enhance the credibility of the findings.
