### Key Points
This paper presents a study on enhancing educational texts with images sourced from the web. The authors curate a diverse dataset from textbooks and web images, conduct a thorough analysis of this dataset, design an effective image assignment procedure, and perform extensive evaluations of both the dataset and the algorithms used. The study is comprehensive and convincingly demonstrates the potential of "Enhancing Textbooks with Visuals from the Web."

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The dataset is carefully curated, providing significant benefits to the research community.  
- Thorough analyses validate the dataset's usefulness and the effectiveness of the image assignment procedure.  
- Extensive evaluations confirm the contributions of both the dataset and the assignment algorithms.  
- The paper is well-written and organized, making it accessible, with valuable insights into the data and its implications for future research.

Weaknesses:  
- Some minor points may require additional support or detail, particularly regarding annotation quality and specific methodological aspects.  
- The mathematical explanations in certain sections may be perceived as dry, potentially limiting engagement for some readers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the annotation quality assurance process, as this will strengthen the paper. Additionally, we suggest elaborating on the sliding window approach mentioned in line 303, including specifics such as window size. Finally, consider comparing the performance of fine-tuned versus pretrained models, as this could provide further insights into the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
