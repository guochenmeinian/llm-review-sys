Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach that utilizes diffusion models with cross-attention to enhance the learning of disentangled representations in images. The authors propose encoding images into concept tokens and employing cross-attention to link the encoder with the U-Net of the diffusion model, demonstrating that the diffusion process creates information bottlenecks that facilitate disentanglement. The method is trained end-to-end on simple datasets, showing favorable results compared to existing disentanglement methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is clear, well-structured, and well-written, with effective figures and visualizations.
- The approach is novel in utilizing cross-attention with features from an image encoder for feature disentanglement.
- Empirical results validate the functionality of each component in the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- The ablation studies are limited to one dataset, raising concerns about the consistency of results across different languages.
- The model does not compare itself to Diff-AE, which could provide valuable insights into its performance.
- The use of "latent" diffusion is not adequately explained or analyzed, and results on pixel-level diffusion are lacking.
- The experimental setup relies on small datasets, which may not reflect the complexities of real-world data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the robustness of their findings by conducting ablation studies on multiple datasets to assess consistency across different languages. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with Diff-AE and other relevant baselines such as DIPVAE and SODA to strengthen the empirical results. Clarifying the rationale behind the use of "latent" diffusion and providing pixel-level results would enhance the analysis. Finally, addressing the typos and improving the clarity of certain sections, such as the implementation details and ablation study descriptions, would benefit the overall presentation.
