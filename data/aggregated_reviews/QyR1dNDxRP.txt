### Key Points
This paper studies the tempered overfitting phenomenon in deep neural networks (DNNs) with binary weights, demonstrating the upper bound of test loss in both minimum-size and random interpolators. The authors provide theoretical results on tempered overfitting without imposing strict data dimensionality constraints. The analysis is grounded in a new bound on the size of a threshold circuit consistent with a partial function.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1) The paper presents innovative research on the overfitting behavior of DNNs with binary weights, contributing to the literature on neural network generalization capabilities.  
2) The theoretical foundation is robust, based on a new bound that enhances understanding of the results.  
3) The paper is well-structured and clearly explains the research problem and methodology.

Weaknesses:  
1) The claim regarding the interpolation of noisy datasets using a neural network of constant depth may only hold under specific conditions.  
2) The mathematical symbols are used casually, requiring clearer definitions for terms such as $A(S)$, $\mathcal{H}$, and $\tilde{h}_{S}$.  
3) The motivation for selecting quantized networks is unclear, necessitating further explanation.  
4) The statement $d_0=o(\sqrt{N/\log(N)})$ raises concerns about data dimensionality consistency.  
5) Theorem 3.1 requires more explanation for better comprehension.  
6) The term $N^2 \mathcal{D}_{max}$ in Theorems 4.1 and 4.3 needs clarification regarding its significance.  
7) The definition of a consistent dataset and its implications for the proof require further discussion.  
8) The paper could benefit from empirical validation of the theoretical results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of mathematical symbols by providing explicit definitions for terms like $A(S)$, $\mathcal{H}$, and $\tilde{h}_{S}$. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the motivation behind using quantized networks and address the dimensionality concerns related to $d_0$. More detailed explanations of Theorem 3.1 and the implications of $N^2 \mathcal{D}_{max}$ are necessary for reader comprehension. We also encourage the authors to consider including synthetic experiments to validate their theoretical findings, despite the primary theoretical focus of the paper. Lastly, a thorough discussion of the limitations and potential future directions of the research would enhance the paper's contribution.
