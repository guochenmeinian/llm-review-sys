Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents MALT, a novel adversarial targeting method that improves upon AutoAttack by refining the selection of target classes based on local almost linearity assumptions. The authors demonstrate that MALT outperforms AutoAttack in terms of both speed and effectiveness across standard benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. MALT achieves a fivefold increase in speed while successfully attacking additional samples previously unreachable by AutoAttack. The authors provide empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of their method and its applicability to non-linear models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The study reveals a significant flaw in AutoAttack, emphasizing that optimal target class selection for linear classifiers should not rely solely on model confidence levels. This insight enhances the understanding of adversarial targeting.
2. MALT shows impressive speed advantages, with an average speedup of five times compared to AutoAttack, making it a more efficient solution for adversarial attack detection.
3. The empirical findings are robust, consistently demonstrating MALT's superiority over AutoAttack in identifying adversarial examples.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of MALT may be somewhat diminished by its focus on refining class selection, which could temper the overall contribution of the manuscript.
2. The selection of the parameter c (c=100) raises questions about its generalizability across different datasets, indicating a need for further exploration.
3. The performance advantage of MALT over AutoAttack is not clearly established, and the empirical measurements of speedup may be influenced by various factors, necessitating clearer reporting of forward and backward passes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by exploring the optimal value of c across various datasets. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide clearer comparisons of MALT's performance against the standard APGD-T algorithm and other relevant baselines, including the actual number of forward and backward passes for AutoAttack. Addressing these points could strengthen the empirical validation of MALT's advantages and enhance the paper's practical relevance in the context of modern adversarial attack research.
