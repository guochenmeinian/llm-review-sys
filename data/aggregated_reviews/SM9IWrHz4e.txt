Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the first tractable algorithm that achieves minimax optimal regret for average reward tabular MDPs without requiring prior knowledge of the span of the optimal bias function. Additionally, it proposes a novel algorithm for weakly communicating MDPs that is tractable and achieves minimax optimal regret up to logarithmic factors, while also providing a polynomial bound on computational cost.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces the first tractable algorithm achieving minimax optimal regret for average reward tabular MDPs.  
- It does not require prior knowledge of the span of the optimal bias function.  
- The algorithm operates directly in the average-reward setting without reduction to a discounted setting.  
- It resolves a longstanding open problem in the field, potentially influencing future research on similar challenges.  

Weaknesses:  
- The algorithm's complexity and presentation make it difficult to identify key components.  
- The experimental results do not convincingly demonstrate the theoretical claims, particularly regarding the algorithm's performance without prior knowledge of the span.  
- The requirement to solve linear programs for each doubling epoch limits generalizability beyond the tabular setting.  
- The paper contains grammatical and typographical errors, and the presentation feels rushed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by simplifying the exposition of the algorithm's key components. Additionally, we suggest including experiments that more effectively demonstrate the algorithm's performance in varying settings, particularly those that highlight its adaptability to the span of the optimal value function. Furthermore, we advise the authors to address the concerns regarding the fairness of comparisons in the experimental results and to ensure that all notation is well-defined and consistent throughout the paper. Finally, we encourage the authors to carefully proofread the manuscript to eliminate grammatical and typographical errors.
