Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the concept of "sandbagging" in large language models (LLMs), focusing on their potential for strategic underperformance during evaluations. The authors explore various models and methodologies, including password-locking techniques, to assess how models might selectively underperform on dangerous capability evaluations. Their findings highlight the brittleness of model evaluations and the implications for AI safety.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors effectively motivate the dangers of sandbagging, emphasizing its potential for model developers to selectively underperform on critical evaluations.
2. Definitions of strategy, underperformance, and evaluation are well-articulated, particularly the connection to legal responsibility and the inclusion of relevant figures.
3. A diverse range of open and closed-source models is utilized in the experiments.
4. The transparent reporting of prompt engineering hours is commendable.
5. The clever use of both direct prompting and password-locking methods is a notable strength.

Weaknesses:
1. The focus on only multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA) benchmarks is limiting and should be addressed in future work.
2. The paper's clarity and presentation need improvement; some concepts are assumed without sufficient proof or references.
3. The novelty of the findings is questioned, particularly regarding the generalizability of the results beyond safety-specific tasks.
4. Statistical significance in determining underperformance is inadequately addressed, as non-deterministic model behavior can lead to score variability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing more concrete proofs and references for assumed concepts. Expanding the dataset to include a wider variety of tasks, particularly in open-ended generative settings, would enhance the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explore the implications of sandbagging in non-safety tasks to strengthen their claims about strategic underperformance. Finally, addressing the statistical significance of model performance variations would provide a more robust framework for evaluating underperformance.
