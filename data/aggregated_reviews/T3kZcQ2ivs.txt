Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a critical examination of Knowledge Base Embeddings (KBE), highlighting the disconnect between link prediction performance and semantic tasks such as word similarity, analogy, and part of speech tagging (POS). The authors demonstrate that high performance in link prediction, particularly on the WN18RR dataset, does not correlate with success in semantic evaluations. They introduce FuncE, which performs better in semantic tasks but less effectively in link prediction. The findings underscore the necessity for careful evaluation design and model architecture.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a thorough analysis of KBE pitfalls, demonstrating that link prediction performance does not correlate with semantic and downstream evaluations.
- The experiments are well-structured, with hypotheses supported by robust arguments.
- The evaluation of multiple KBE models strengthens the authors' claims.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation is limited to a single downstream task (POS tagging), which raises questions about the generalizability of the findings.
- Some organizational aspects of the paper could be improved for clarity, including task descriptions and dataset examples.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization and clarity of the paper by providing a better description of the tasks and datasets, including examples of their content. Additionally, we suggest expanding the evaluation to include more challenging downstream tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), to enhance the relevance of the findings. Clarification is needed regarding the reported results on dataset subsets and their implications. The authors should also address the philosophical motivations behind using KBE models for tasks beyond link prediction and consider discussing potential solutions to the identified issues.
