Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework called Continual Learning in the Frequency Domain (CLFD), inspired by the human visual system (HVS), aimed at enhancing continual learning (CL) on edge devices. The framework employs wavelet transforms to map input images to the frequency domain, optimizing input feature maps and improving learning efficiency. The authors propose a feature extractor and a feature encoder to generate and select frequency-specific features for classification. Experiments are conducted on public datasets to compare the proposed method's performance against conventional methods. The authors conduct ablation experiments to analyze the impact of feature selection proportions on model performance, focusing on two methods: CLFD-ER and CLFD-ER-ACE. Results indicate that CLFD-ER exhibits high plasticity, while CLFD-ER-ACE shows greater stability. The authors clarify their framework's unique contribution to eliminating redundancy in the frequency domain compared to existing works like FSDR and Mgsvf.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method's inspiration from the HVS offers a novel approach to reducing visually redundant information in CL.
- CLFD improves performance and training efficiency on edge devices, achieving higher accuracy and reduced training times.
- The paper is structured to clearly address the problem of catastrophic forgetting in CL.
- The paper effectively addresses reviewer concerns and incorporates additional experiments, enhancing the understanding of the proposed methods.
- The framework demonstrates robustness across various hyperparameter selections, as shown in comprehensive ablation studies.

Weaknesses:
- The explanation of the proposed method lacks comprehensiveness, and the experiments do not sufficiently demonstrate its effectiveness.
- The introduction requires a clearer rationale for using frequency space in the context of continuous learning.
- Technical details, such as the meaning of symbols in figures and notations, are unclear.
- The paper does not evaluate larger datasets or provide comparisons for larger buffer sizes, limiting the generalizability of the results.
- The method's design appears ad hoc, with insufficient justification for certain algorithmic choices.
- The proposed framework overlaps with existing algorithms that utilize frequency domains in continual learning, necessitating clearer differentiation in the manuscript.
- Several grammatical and typographical errors detract from the paper's clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction by providing a logical structure that explains the necessity of utilizing frequency space for continuous learning on edge devices. Additionally, please clarify the meaning of terms in Table 1, such as class-IL and task-IL, and ensure that all symbols in figures are adequately explained. We suggest including experiments with larger datasets and buffer sizes to better assess the proposed method's effectiveness. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to conduct more ablation studies regarding hyperparameters and provide a deeper analysis of how feature selection proportions impact performance across different settings. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their framework's position relative to existing literature, particularly in Section 2.3, by explicitly discussing the differences between their approach and those of FSDR and Mgsvf. Lastly, please address the grammatical errors and improve the overall presentation of the paper.
