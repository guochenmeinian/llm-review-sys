Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CORE, a framework that integrates offline recommendation learning with online decision tree learning to facilitate conversational recommendations through a few interaction rounds. CORE aims to reduce uncertainty in user preferences by querying attributes and values, and it is evaluated across multiple datasets and validation settings, demonstrating improved recommendation success rates. The authors clarify the computation of expected certainty gain for querying items and attributes, asserting that their approach does not rely on handcrafted designs. They emphasize the use of all raw features as candidate attributes and note that discrete features often play a more significant role than continuous ones in their experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- CORE offers a novel framework for uncertainty reduction, enhancing recommender system performance by revealing user preferences.
- The authors provide detailed clarifications regarding the algorithm's design and its application in conversational recommender systems.
- The paper includes extensive experimental analysis across various datasets, showing that CORE outperforms existing methods in both hot-start and cold-start scenarios.
- They demonstrate the ability of CORE to handle both discrete and continuous features effectively, with new experimental results showing consistent trends.
- The methodology is organized intuitively, and the problem formulation is coherent.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on decision trees introduces significant design costs, lacks clear guidelines, and is not adequately discussed in relation to each dataset.
- The design and application of decision trees are domain-specific and lack clear guidelines, which the paper does not adequately address.
- The approach is overly simplistic, depending on metadata like price and location, and fails to incorporate finer item characteristics or language models to capture user expressions.
- There is an implicit assumption of a unique target item for each user, which raises concerns about the theoretical foundations of the algorithm.
- The representation of item characteristics is overly simplistic, failing to capture nuanced user preferences.
- The evaluation metrics are limited, focusing solely on item checking rather than actual reservations, which may inflate success rates. Additionally, there is insufficient comparison with other methods, and qualitative evaluations are lacking.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the design costs associated with decision trees and provide clearer guidelines for their implementation, addressing their relevance to each experimental dataset. It is crucial to incorporate finer item characteristics derived from user reviews and to utilize language models to enhance conversational interactions. Additionally, consider incorporating more intricate item characteristics derived from user evaluations, such as musical genre preferences and specific artists, to enhance the representation of user preferences. We also suggest expanding the evaluation metrics to include actual user actions, such as reservations, and conducting comparisons with contemporary conversational recommender systems like CPR and UNICORN. Finally, a more comprehensive analysis of the experimental results, including statistical significance and qualitative assessments, would strengthen the paper's contributions and decouple the theoretical assumptions underlying the algorithm from practical applications to bolster the overall framework.
