Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel task called Temporal Sentence Grounding with Relevance Feedback (TSG-RF), which addresses the limitations of traditional Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) by accounting for scenarios where relevant segments may be absent in videos. The authors propose the Relation-aware Temporal Sentence Grounding (RaTSG) network, which includes a multi-granularity relevance discriminator and a relation-aware segment grounding module to generate relevance feedback and segment boundaries. The effectiveness of RaTSG is validated through experiments on two reconstructed datasets, establishing a benchmark for TSG-RF.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The introduction of the TSG-RF task is significant, as it aligns better with practical applications by considering the absence of relevant segments.  
2. The RaTSG network demonstrates substantial performance improvements, achieving state-of-the-art results in the TSG-RF task.  
3. Experimental validation is comprehensive, with clear presentation of results that effectively demonstrate the RaTSG network's capabilities.  
4. The writing is accessible, and the source code and datasets are made available for further research.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The paper lacks sufficient baselines for comparison, particularly omitting Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that could provide a more robust evaluation of the RaTSG network.  
2. There is inadequate qualitative analysis; more examples of both successful and unsuccessful cases would enhance understanding of the RaTSG network's strengths and limitations.  
3. The method's complexity may increase due to the additional relevance feedback, which is not sufficiently discussed.  
4. The experiments utilize outdated datasets, and newer datasets like QV-Highlights should be considered for evaluation.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by incorporating additional baselines, particularly Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), to enhance the evaluation of the RaTSG network. Additionally, including more qualitative examples of both successful and unsuccessful cases would provide deeper insights into the method's performance. We also suggest discussing the potential increase in complexity due to the relevance feedback mechanism more thoroughly. Finally, we encourage the authors to consider utilizing newer datasets, such as QV-Highlights, for a more contemporary evaluation.
