Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel active learning method for 3D segmentation in medical images, utilizing a group-based contrastive loss derived from the NT-Xent loss to define sample similarity. The authors propose a loss formulation that incorporates hierarchical groupings for contrastive learning, differentiating their approach from existing global contrastive losses by allowing multiple types of groupings and effectively combining different losses. They evaluate their method on both weakly-supervised (scribble annotations) and fully-supervised tasks across three medical datasets and one video segmentation dataset, aiming to optimize data selection and model efficiency while addressing the challenges of annotation costs and data diversity in medical imaging. The authors clarify that the contrastive learning-based encoder was not used in downstream segmentation tasks due to architecture incompatibility, ensuring fair comparisons among methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, featuring a comprehensive review of related work and a clear motivation for improving medical image segmentation with limited annotations.
- The proposed method shows significant improvements in segmentation performance across multiple datasets, demonstrating its relevance to the medical imaging community.
- The experimental design is robust, providing detailed evaluations and ablation studies to support the claims made.
- The proposed method effectively combines hierarchical groupings, demonstrating its utility through ablation results.
- The authors provide comprehensive responses to reviewer concerns, enhancing the clarity of their contributions.
- Additional experiments with pre-trained models and the contrastive learning encoder indicate a commitment to addressing feedback.

Weaknesses:
- The focus on slice-based methods may mislead readers regarding their advantages over 3D models, which generally outperform 2D approaches in medical segmentation. A more honest discussion of this limitation is warranted.
- The ablation studies are limited to a single dataset, raising questions about the generalizability of the results, and there are concerns regarding the comparability of results due to varying training times based on the number of groupings.
- The authors do not clarify how they selected the weighting of each loss term, and the alignment of structures in the scribble-weighted distance remains unclear, with no significant improvements observed from the proposed adjustments.
- The paper lacks clarity in explaining the relationship between weakly-supervised and fully-supervised methods, particularly regarding the annotation volumes used in experiments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the limitations of slice-based methods, emphasizing this as a constraint rather than an advantage. Additionally, consider extending the work to include 3D segmentation and discussing potential adaptations of the group contrastive loss for this purpose. We suggest conducting ablation studies across multiple datasets to validate the robustness of the proposed method and clarifying the selection process for loss term weightings. Furthermore, enhancing the clarity of the annotated data volume explanation and ensuring consistent writing details throughout the paper would strengthen the overall presentation. We also recommend improving the clarity of the ablation study results by explicitly addressing the comparability issues related to different groupings and enhancing the explanation of the 'group' definition before detailing their algorithm. Lastly, we advise refining Figure 1 by removing empty space and emphasizing the details of their contrastive supervised learning approach tailored for 3D volumes.
