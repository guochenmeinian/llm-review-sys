### Key Points
This paper presents a study on political bias detection in news articles, proposing a model that integrates sentence-level semantics and document-level discourse structure. The authors compare their model's performance against BERT and conduct qualitative evaluations, finding that their model's predictions align with previous findings. Additionally, the authors explore document-level bias prediction based on the US political spectrum through a multi-stage model that captures semantic meaning and sentence types. The paper includes extensive experiments and statistical analyses.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed model for bias detection is novel and replicable, facilitating future research.  
- The experiments conducted are sound, with interesting qualitative evaluations and structural analyses.  
- The paper is well-written and presents thorough related work, making it easy to follow.  

Weaknesses:  
- The comparison with existing models is limited, primarily focusing on BERT, which is not state-of-the-art for this task.  
- The proposed model underperforms BERT in certain settings without adequate justification.  
- Some sections lack clarity, and specific terms need definitions to enhance understanding.  
- The validity of the k-means clustering analysis is questionable, and the paper lacks a discussion on ethical considerations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comprehensiveness of their comparisons by including more recent and powerful models beyond BERT, such as those cited in the reviews. Additionally, addressing the low performance of their model in specific settings with per-class classification scores would provide clarity. We suggest clarifying ambiguous sections, particularly in Section 4, and defining key terms to enhance readability. Furthermore, we advise the authors to conduct multiple runs of the k-means analysis to validate clustering results and to include a discussion on ethical considerations related to political bias detection.
