### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the convergence of gradient-based methods to local Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum differentiable games. The authors analyze the properties of the symmetric part of the Jacobian, denoted as S, and demonstrate that local convergence can occur even when S is non-zero but not strictly positive definite, referred to as partial curvature. The convergence rates are shown to depend on the average of the eigenvalues of S, contrasting with traditional minimization problems. The authors also illustrate their findings through the computation of mixed Nash equilibria in continuous games.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper provides novel insights into the convergence of minimax algorithms and extends traditional notions of regularization and partial curvature.
2. The analysis is detailed, mathematically rigorous, and well-organized, facilitating an intuitive understanding of complex concepts.
3. The findings have significant implications for game theory and optimization, particularly regarding the benefits of over-parameterization in Nash equilibria computations.

Weaknesses:
1. The writing and presentation could be improved, particularly in clarifying the connection between experimental results and theoretical findings.
2. Propositions 4.2 and 4.3 are based on a restrictive setting, and the applicability of results to non-square games (where $n \neq m$) is not addressed.
3. Some expressions are difficult to follow, and the experimental section appears overly technical and disconnected from the main arguments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing, particularly in the experimental section, to better connect it with the theoretical results. Additionally, the authors should explicitly address the applicability of their findings to non-square games and provide more detailed explanations of the Mirror Prox and Exponential Gradient methods in the context of over-parameterization. Including practical examples where the slight curvature condition holds would enhance the paper's impact. Finally, elaborating on the implications of average eigenvalues in different game settings would help clarify the relevance of the results.
