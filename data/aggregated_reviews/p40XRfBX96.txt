Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method called Self-Align for aligning a language model from scratch without prior RLHF training, utilizing fewer annotations. The authors propose generating example instructions/tasks from the language model conditioned on a human-written set of principles, followed by distillation into the model through fine-tuning. The approach aims to enhance performance and ratings across various benchmarks. Additionally, the paper discusses a new method for generating diversified, principle-guided synthetic data to alleviate the need for extensive annotated instruction-following data for supervised fine-tuning tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed methods are simple, clearly presented, and demonstrate strong performance compared to both open- and closed-source baselines.
- The combination of self-instruct and principle-driven prompting is insightful, potentially reducing the need for extensive human annotation.
- The detailed prompt design and systematic analyses contribute valuable insights into the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Weaknesses:
- The pretrained LLMs are not instruction fine-tuned, which may hinder the generation of clean topic-guided instructions and principle-following responses. The absence of a filtering step post-generation is not addressed.
- The evaluation lacks sufficient depth, with unclear data generation metrics and limited assessments on instruction-following datasets.
- The Self-Align methodology generally underperforms compared to Vicuna, raising questions about the necessity of building on the Dromedary model.
- The paper does not adequately explore the impact of various design choices on final model performance, particularly regarding sensitivity to self-instruct instructions and the role of few-shot examples.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the amount of data generated and used for fine-tuning, as well as the evaluation metrics employed. It would be beneficial to include a filtering step post-generation to enhance the quality of instructions and responses. Additionally, we suggest conducting more comprehensive evaluations on instruction-following datasets to validate the model's performance. The authors should also consider exploring the performance of the Self-Align methodology when applied to Vicuna as a base model. Lastly, providing more insights into the verbose cloning process and its impact on performance would strengthen the paper's contributions.
