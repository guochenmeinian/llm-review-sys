Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for Bayesian inference in linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and addresses the challenge of marginalizing random effects to enhance sampling efficiency. The authors propose an algorithm that leverages sparsity to integrate out random effects, achieving computational efficiency comparable to evaluating the likelihood without marginalization. The empirical results demonstrate improved performance of the HMC algorithm in terms of effective sample size and running time.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed marginalization approach significantly enhances the efficiency of the HMC algorithm without increasing computational complexity, making a valuable contribution to Bayesian modeling.
2. The presentation is clear, with sufficient empirical demonstration supporting the claims.
3. The problem addressed is of practical relevance, and the solution is straightforward, utilizing well-known techniques like the matrix inversion lemma.

Weaknesses:
1. The title and emphasis on HMC may mislead readers, as the marginalization technique is applicable to any MCMC algorithm, not just HMC.
2. The experiments lack sufficient detail regarding hyperparameters and evaluation metrics, limiting the robustness of the findings.
3. The scope of models studied is narrow, focusing only on Gaussian or log-Gaussian likelihoods, and comparisons with other automatic marginalization methods are absent.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the title to reflect the general applicability of the marginalization technique beyond HMC. Clarifying the terminology used in the paper, such as "recovery" and "ancestral sampling," would enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest providing more detailed experimental metrics, including hyperparameters and convergence diagnostics like trace plots, to substantiate claims of improved inference. Expanding the scope of models studied and comparing against alternative marginalization methods would strengthen the contribution. Finally, addressing the limitations of the approach, particularly regarding the constraint of analytical marginalization, would provide a more comprehensive view of its applicability.
