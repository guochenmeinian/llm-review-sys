Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a robust Gaussian process regression method that infers data-point-specific noise levels through a sequential selection procedure maximizing the log-marginal likelihood. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on various synthetic and real-world regression tasks, including Bayesian optimization. They provide a theoretical analysis indicating strong convexity of the negative log marginal likelihood function when reparametrizing the noise levels.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and clearly motivated, addressing a significant problem in robust regression within Gaussian processes.
- The authors contribute a novel approach to handling heteroscedastic noise, supported by a theoretical framework and relevant experiments.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical results may lack practical value if hyperparameters are optimized jointly, raising questions about the benefits of convexity in this context.
- The experimental section is limited, benchmarking against only two test functions, with a lack of discussion on the performance of the proposed method compared to existing approaches.
- The method's claim of "fast and robust inference" is contradicted by slower performance in certain cases, which warrants further discussion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including more standard benchmark datasets from the UCI repository to enhance the robustness of their findings. Additionally, it would be beneficial to conduct experiments comparing the non-convex parametrization to the convex one when all hyperparameters are optimized jointly. We suggest discussing the implications of the slower fitting times on Bayesian optimization results and clarifying the differences between RGP-RP and RGP-RP* in the experiments. Furthermore, addressing the missing citations and improving the readability of plots would enhance the presentation quality. Lastly, we encourage the authors to expand the related work section to include recent studies, such as Altamirano et al. (2024), and to provide a more comprehensive discussion of the limitations of their approach.
