Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to enhancing song visibility in music streaming platforms through strategic collective action by users. The authors propose two strategies that allow small groups of fans to reorder playlists, significantly amplifying the recommendation frequency of targeted songs. The evaluation demonstrates that this amplification can reach up to 25 times higher recommendation probability compared to average songs, while preserving the overall performance of the recommendation system.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The innovative approach provides a new method for promoting emerging artists in music streaming.
- Empirical validation using an open-source APC model on a widely used platform supports the findings.
- The research highlights the potential for small collectives to significantly impact song visibility without disrupting user experience.

Weaknesses:
- The scope is limited, as the strategies are tested solely within the context of automatic playlist continuation and may not generalize to other applications.
- The paper lacks technical novelty and depth, particularly in the clarity of the DirLof strategy and its rationale.
- Assumptions regarding user behavior based on song position in playlists may oversimplify complex user engagement dynamics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the DirLof strategy and its underlying rationale, particularly regarding the selection of anchor songs with low frequency. Additionally, we suggest including a broader range of APC models in the evaluation to assess the robustness of the proposed strategies across different contexts. The authors should also clarify the definitions and distributions used in the paper, particularly in Section 3.2, and consider testing simpler baseline strategies for comparison. Furthermore, addressing the ethical implications of the proposed method, particularly concerning fairness among artists and potential misuse, is crucial. We advise reframing the narrative to emphasize the need for caution in algorithmic collective action rather than presenting it solely as an opportunity for artists.
