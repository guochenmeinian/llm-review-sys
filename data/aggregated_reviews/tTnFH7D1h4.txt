Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an unsupervised anomaly detection method called DiffPath, which utilizes diffusion models to differentiate between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. The authors leverage the score function of a pre-trained diffusion model, specifically focusing on the L2 norm of the score function across time steps, to characterize the rate of change and curvature of diffusion trajectories. The evaluation of DiffPath includes unconventional experimental settings, such as comparisons between pixelated and non-pixelated images. The authors propose three types of comparisons: (1) Pixelated vs Pixelated, where baselines outperform DiffPath; (2) Pixelated vs Non-pixelated, where DiffPath achieves nearly 100% detection rates, raising concerns about the triviality of the task; and (3) Non-pixelated vs Non-pixelated, where baselines again outperform DiffPath. The approach is validated through experiments on various datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CelebA, and SVHN, demonstrating superior average AUC-ROC scores compared to existing methods, although the non-standard settings may yield overly optimistic results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant issue in anomaly detection by proposing a method that can generalize across datasets, which is valuable for the community.
- The novel use of diffusion trajectory properties, such as rate of change and curvature, is a noteworthy contribution.
- The writing is clear and well-organized, effectively guiding the reader through the problem, methodology, and results.
- DiffPath shows competitive performance in certain comparisons, particularly in near-OOD tasks on OpenOOD.
- Experimental results are robust, with strong performance and insightful ablation studies.

Weaknesses:
- The method's applicability to a broader range of problems is uncertain, particularly for domains outside of image data.
- The connection to optimal transport (OT) is questionable, as it may only hold under Gaussian assumptions, which does not align with the multi-modal nature of the datasets used.
- The utility of the 6D statistic introduced is unclear, as it is not a scalar value for direct comparison.
- The distinction between ID and OOD datasets is ambiguous, particularly in the context of the experiments conducted.
- The experimental setup includes unconventional comparisons that may mislead interpretations of performance, and results may not be directly comparable to existing literature due to differences in image resolution and the nature of pixelation.
- There is a lack of discussion on existing diffusion-based anomaly detection methods that utilize diffusion schedule properties.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the applicability of their method to non-image domains and provide a discussion on how to select a suitable base dataset for various applications. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the connection to OT, especially in light of the multi-modal distributions present in the datasets analyzed. It would be beneficial to elaborate on the use of the 6D statistic and how it aids in distinguishing samples. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to address the ambiguity surrounding ID and OOD dataset distinctions in their experiments. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their experimental comparisons by focusing solely on standardized settings that do not involve pixelated images, such as resizing standard 32x32 datasets to 64x64 resolution. This would facilitate a fairer comparison between DiffPath and existing methods. Lastly, while it is not necessary to outperform all baselines, demonstrating some improvements over the baseline in standardized evaluation settings would strengthen the paper's contributions.
