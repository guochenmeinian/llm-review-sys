### Key Points
This paper presents a zero-shot LLM agent designed for web interaction tasks, specifically utilizing the PaLM-2 model. The authors propose a structured reflection module and a staged action planner that allows the agent to generate actionable plans without requiring fine-tuning or in-context examples. The study evaluates the agent's performance on the MINIWOB++ benchmark, demonstrating high success rates on simpler tasks but revealing limitations in more complex scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The systems contribution is strong, with well-motivated components that enhance LLM agent planning.
- The paper is well-written and clear, effectively codifying prior work and indicating future research directions.
- The exploration of differences between interactive and staged planning is compelling.

Weaknesses:
- The rationale for using a staged planner could be better articulated, particularly in comparison to RL agents or classic planners.
- The contribution relies solely on a proprietary model, limiting reproducibility and generalizability.
- Some design decisions lack proper ablation studies, making it difficult to ascertain the impact of individual components.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the articulation of the rationale behind the staged planner, possibly by comparing it with RL agents or classic planners. Additionally, conducting ablation studies to assess the individual impacts of the Structured Thought Management and Constraining Action Space would strengthen the findings. Clarifying the methodology by separating previous work into a related work section and providing a more detailed introduction to key terms would enhance the paper's clarity. Finally, addressing the experimental controls for random noise and reporting standard deviations would bolster the robustness of the results.
