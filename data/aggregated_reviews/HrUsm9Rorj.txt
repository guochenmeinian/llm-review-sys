### Key Points
This paper presents a nonlinear solver acceleration for nonlinear PDEs based on online learning, specifically applied to multiphase porous media flow. The authors identify key dimensionless parameters and demonstrate a significant reduction in the number of nonlinear iterations in complex three-dimensional models. Furthermore, they integrate a machine learning model into an open-source multiphase flow simulator, achieving up to 85% reduction in computational time.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written, with clear and easy-to-follow presentation.  
- The approach effectively reduces the number of nonlinear iterations by dynamically adjusting a single global parameter and learning the characteristics of each numerical model.  

Weaknesses:  
- The method is evaluated solely on one system, raising concerns about its generalizability to other problems.  
- The limitations of the paper are not well discussed.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their approach by testing it on a broader range of PDEs. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more thorough discussion of the limitations of their work. Clarification on whether the proposed method is problem-specific or applicable to other contexts would also be beneficial.
