Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to synthesize spectrograms that resemble natural images and produce corresponding audio, termed "images that sound." The authors propose a zero-shot method utilizing pre-trained text-to-image and text-to-spectrogram diffusion models operating in a shared latent space, denoising noisy latents in parallel. The paper includes quantitative evaluations and perceptual studies, demonstrating that the method can generate spectrograms aligned with audio prompts while maintaining visual fidelity. Additionally, the authors evaluate artistic performance through human studies, arguing that this is the best approach for assessing such methods. They acknowledge the need to clarify that they are evaluating the best-case performance of all methods and will explain the rationale behind this choice.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The topic is intriguing and has potential applications in art and multimodal representation learning.
- The paper is well-written, with clear explanations and thorough evaluations, including both automatic and human assessments.
- The introduction of two meaningful baselines addresses the lack of existing methods for this task.
- The authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the importance of human studies in evaluating artistic methods.
- The proposed model's interpretability is enhanced through the incorporation of additional results and clarifications.

Weaknesses:
- The technical contribution is limited, primarily combining existing diffusion models without significant innovation, raising concerns about novelty.
- The model's performance is not competitive with state-of-the-art generators, showing a noticeable gap in audio and visual quality.
- The clarity and structure of the text could be improved, particularly regarding the rationale for shared latents and the selection of text prompts.
- The manuscript may still benefit from a more explicit discussion regarding the randomness of prompt and model input selection in human evaluations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the technical depth by providing a more thorough analysis of the shared latent space and its implications. Additionally, the authors should consider including more complex prompts in their evaluations to demonstrate the scalability of their method. Clarifying the rationale behind the choice of specific text prompts and the effects of style words would enhance the discussion. Furthermore, we advise that they make the rationale for evaluating best-case performance more explicit to enhance clarity for the readers. Finally, addressing the concerns regarding the clarity of quantitative metrics and the human study setup would strengthen the paper's overall presentation.
