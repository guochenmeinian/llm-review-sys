Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a multi-granularity contrastive learning method named COMET for medical time-series data, focusing on EEG and ECG signals. The authors propose building positive and negative pairs at various levels: patient, trial, sample, and observation. The method demonstrates competitive performance on two EEG datasets and one ECG dataset, outperforming several state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The hierarchical view of medical time series, particularly for ECG and EEG, captures unique characteristics effectively.
- The proposed contrastive learning approach is straightforward and reasonable, supported by comprehensive experiments.
- The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with informative figures.

Weaknesses:
- The title "multi-granularity representation learning" is misleading; "multi-level contrastive learning" would be more appropriate as representation learning occurs at the sample level without aggregation at higher levels.
- The evaluation is limited to a small number of datasets, primarily EEG-related, and the method shows modest performance on the ECG dataset. Broader empirical validation is needed.
- The ablation tests are conducted only on the AD dataset, necessitating more detailed analyses across other datasets.
- The novelty of the proposed method is questioned, as similar multi-granular contrastive learning models exist in the literature, making the contribution appear trivial.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the title to "Hierarchical Contrastive Learning for Medical Time-Series" to better reflect the methodology. Additionally, the authors should expand the evaluation to include more diverse datasets and conduct comprehensive ablation studies across these datasets. Clarifying the distinction between sample and trial levels, as well as providing a more detailed explanation of how time series features are processed within COMET, would enhance understanding. Finally, addressing the limitations regarding the generalizability of the method and comparing it with other ECG-specific contrastive methods would strengthen the paper.
