Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to safe Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) through the Multi-Agent First Order Constrained Optimization in Policy Space (MAFOCOPS) algorithm. The authors aim to maximize expected total rewards while ensuring safety constraints for each agent in a fully-cooperative environment. They demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness through experiments on Safe MAMuJoCo and Safe MAIG benchmarks, showing that MAFOCOPS outperforms MACPO. The paper emphasizes the algorithm's ease of implementation and provides an approximate upper bound for worst-case constraint violations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a unique perspective on MARL, considering the impact of an agent's actions on total costs, which reflects real-world interactions.
- It is well-structured, with clear explanations and a mathematical proof in the appendix, demonstrating rigor.
- The empirical results indicate significant performance improvements and computational efficiency compared to more complex methods.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation is limited as it does not assess the algorithm's performance across multiple costs, potentially masking limitations.
- Concerns arise regarding the correctness of the derivation, particularly the linearity assumptions in the optimization process.
- The method's sensitivity to hyperparameters, such as Lagrange multipliers, is not thoroughly analyzed, and implementation details are lacking.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by testing the algorithm across multiple costs to provide a more comprehensive assessment. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the derivation of the proposed method, particularly addressing the linearity of the equations involved. It would be beneficial to include a detailed analysis of hyperparameter sensitivity and provide specific implementation details to enhance practical feasibility. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the approximate upper bound for worst-case constraint violations and discuss potential issues with the two-step optimization process, such as local optima.
