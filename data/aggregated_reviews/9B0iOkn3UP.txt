Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of the Bayesian persuasion problem under the condition that the receiver may respond suboptimally, specifically through $\delta$-approximately best responses. The authors develop efficient algorithms for computing an optimal robust signaling scheme, demonstrating the failure of the revelation principle. They provide polynomial-time algorithms for small state or action spaces and a quasi-polynomial-time approximation scheme (QPTAS) for the general case, while also establishing NP-hardness for exact computation in larger cases.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant and realistic problem in Bayesian persuasion, extending the classical best-response model to include approximately best responses.
- The results are comprehensive, offering both positive and negative outcomes, and the authors make a noteworthy observation regarding the number of feasible tuples in the small-state-space case.
- The writing is clear, and the introduction effectively summarizes the technical contributions.

Weaknesses:
- There is a lack of clarity regarding the paper's distinction from the work by Gan et al. (2023), particularly concerning the technical contributions and similarities in results.
- Some results, such as Lemma 3.2, may not be viewed as novel, and the paper does not adequately explore the implications of these similarities.
- The presentation of key results, particularly the QPTAS and hardness result, lacks sufficient explanation and intuition.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the connections and differences between their work and the robust Stackelberg paper by Gan et al. (2023). It is crucial to clarify the unique contributions of this paper, especially in light of the similarities noted by reviewers. Additionally, we suggest providing more detailed explanations and intuitions for the QPTAS and hardness results to enhance the paper's clarity. Finally, addressing the minor typographical errors and explicitly stating $\sigma = (A, \tilde a)$ in the optimization problem would improve the overall presentation.
