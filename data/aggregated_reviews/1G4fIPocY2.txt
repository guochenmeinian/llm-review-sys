### Key Points
This paper presents an evaluation approach for synthesized 3D gesture motions using virtual reality (VR), aiming to provide a more immersive setup compared to traditional 2D settings. The authors investigate gesture synthesis results from the top three methods of the 2023 GENEA Challenge, revealing that gestures rated in VR receive higher scores than in 2D. However, the rankings among methods remain largely consistent across both settings, raising questions about the added value of the VR setup given its higher costs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The evaluation approach is well-motivated and presents an interesting observation regarding rating differences between 2D and VR settings.  
- The experimental design and implementation are detailed, promoting reproducibility.  
- The paper is well-written, with thorough and intuitive discussions of the experiments and results.

Weaknesses:  
- The reasons for higher VR scores are not fully convincing, lacking visual explanations and supplementary materials for clarity.  
- The pilot test details are unclear, and the rationale for the chosen office environment is not justified.  
- Important details about the test environment and participant checks are missing.  
- The study's findings do not provide significant new insights, as the VR setup does not yield substantial improvements in gesture quality evaluation.  
- Section 7 is redundant, repeating content from earlier sections.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the differences between 2D and VR settings by including visual explanations and supplementary materials. Additionally, the authors should clarify whether the pilot test was conducted for both settings and justify the choice of the office environment. Providing details about the test environment and participant attention checks is essential. We also suggest discussing the potential of using a desktop 3D viewer as a middle-ground evaluation method, which could offer a scalable solution while maintaining the benefits of 3D visualization. Lastly, we recommend revising Section 7 to eliminate redundancy with previous sections.
