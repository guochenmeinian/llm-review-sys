### Key Points
This paper presents an SO(3) equivariant network designed for b-tagging in high energy physics, utilizing permutation and SO(3) equivariance to handle sets of track particle features. The architecture is based on a particle flow network (PFN) that includes two SO(3)-equivariant subnetworks, permutation invariant pooling, and a final layer for scalar extraction. The network employs various SO(3)-equivariant mappings, including affine layers, gauge-equivariant linear layers, bilinear maps, and nonlinearities. The authors demonstrate significant improvements in b-tagging performance compared to non-equivariant baselines. Additionally, the authors propose that local breaking of SO(3) equivariance can enhance representations while maintaining global equivariance; however, this claim lacks sufficient proofs or analyses.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and generally easy to follow, with significant empirical improvements over the baseline model.
- The use of bilinear mappings is a notable strength, as most equivariant networks typically rely solely on linear maps.
- The incorporation of locally SO(2) gauge equivariant operations is innovative, effectively leveraging the geometric structure provided by the momentum axes.
- The paper is well-structured and clearly presented, making it easy to understand.

Weaknesses:
- The completeness of the linear layers is not demonstrated; the authors only show sufficiency regarding equivariance without addressing necessity.
- The transition from SO(3) to SO(2) features is insufficiently explained, and the overall network's SO(3) equivariance despite intermediate SO(2) operations lacks clarity.
- The claim of achieving global SO(3) equivariance while locally breaking it into SO(2)_j equivariance is unclear and lacks necessary proofs or analyses.
- The expressivity of the proposed algorithm is questionable, as it imposes restrictive conditions that may not be necessary for achieving equivariance.
- The paper's ablation studies are vague, relying on conclusive statements without presenting detailed results.
- The assertion that the models could be adapted for equivariant Graph and attention-based networks is overly ambitious given the generality of those architectures compared to Deep Sets.
- The experiments are limited, with a need for more thorough empirical analysis, including additional ablations and comparisons to standard methods in high energy physics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the completeness of their linear layers by providing a basis of the most general equivariant linear maps. It would be beneficial to switch to the irreducible representation basis for clarity and rigor. Additionally, we suggest explicitly discussing the completeness of intertwiner bases for each operation and proving the equivariance of nonlinearities like TReLU. Clarifying how the overall network maintains SO(3) equivariance despite intermediate SO(2) operations is crucial. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how global SO(3) equivariance can be maintained while locally breaking it into SO(2)_j equivariance by providing a detailed proof in the main paper. Furthermore, the authors should consider discussing the limitations of their approach in comparison to other methods for achieving equivariance, such as E(n)-equivariant Steerable CNNs. It would strengthen the paper to include detailed results from the ablation studies rather than relying on vague statements. Finally, we suggest that the authors clarify the introduction of key concepts, such as Equation 4, and ensure that all relevant references are included throughout the paper.
