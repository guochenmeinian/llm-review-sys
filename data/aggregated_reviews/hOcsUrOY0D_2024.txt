Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to calibrating noise in differential privacy mechanisms directly to membership inference attack success metrics, such as advantage and TPR at low FPR, rather than relying on traditional $(\epsilon, \delta)$-bounds. The authors develop algorithms for this direct calibration, demonstrating that it significantly reduces the required noise and improves machine learning accuracy. The paper includes empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of this method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper addresses a significant practical problem in privacy mechanisms with substantial theoretical contributions.  
2. It is well-organized and mostly easy to follow, effectively making the case for direct calibration to membership inference success metrics.  
3. The experimental results robustly support the framework's effectiveness, showing a notable increase in utility.

Weaknesses:  
1. Some proofs, particularly Theorem 3.4, lack clarity and detail, which may hinder their correctness.  
2. The notation is heavy and could be confusing; a notation table would enhance clarity.  
3. The problem statement in Section 2 is not clearly articulated, making it difficult to discern the main goal.  
4. The paper could benefit from including more downstream tasks and utility metrics to demonstrate the theoretical results' effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the proof for Theorem 3.4 by addressing specific questions regarding its reasoning and implications. Additionally, we suggest providing high-level intuitions for the variables in Theorem 3.4, such as $\alpha(\tau, \gamma)$ and $\beta(\tau, \gamma)$. Including a detailed algorithm in the appendix on how to use $\epsilon$, $\delta$, and $q$ to generate Advantage Calibrationâ€™s $X_\omega$, $Y_\omega$ would also enhance understanding. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the problem statement in Section 2 and consider adding uncertainty estimates to the results in Figure 1. Lastly, creating a table to summarize definitions and symbols would greatly aid reader comprehension.
