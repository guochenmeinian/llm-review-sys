### Key Points
This paper presents a new dataset, EntSumv2, for the task of entity-centric abstractive summarization, revising the existing ENTSUM dataset to include shorter, more abstractive summaries. The authors evaluate various summarization models and conduct a comprehensive multi-faceted human evaluation, providing valuable insights into model performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The EntSumv2 dataset is a significant contribution to the NLP community, addressing the lack of quality abstractive entity-centric summarization datasets.
2. The paper introduces a novel multi-faceted human evaluation setup, enhancing the understanding of model behavior.
3. It is well-written, with a sound experimental setup and thorough descriptions of experiments.
4. The results yield good insights into existing models.

Weaknesses:
1. The standard deviation values in Table 2 are missing.
2. Details regarding the training of annotators and the overall agreement during data creation are unclear.
3. There is insufficient analysis comparing the abstraction levels between the old and new datasets.
4. The choice of models for faceted human evaluation lacks clarity, particularly regarding the omission of T5-base.
5. Questions remain about the availability of code for reproducibility and the annotation process.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of annotation details, including the training process and quality control measures. Additionally, please provide a comparative analysis of abstraction levels between the ENTSUM and EntSumv2 datasets. We also suggest elaborating on the rationale behind the choice of models for evaluation, particularly addressing the omission of T5-base. Lastly, consider making the code available to facilitate reproducibility.
