Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SemCoder, a code LLM enhanced with code semantic-aware pre-training. The authors utilize OSS-instruct to create the synthetic PYX dataset for model training, alongside the PYX-R dataset for debugging and repair tasks. SemCoder is trained using NL to code, forward monologue, and backward monologue tasks, demonstrating superior performance in code generation and execution reasoning compared to several open-source LLMs and GPT-3.5, despite having fewer parameters. The methodology integrates high-level functional descriptions and execution effects, bridging static code text with dynamic execution states.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
+ The authors successfully trained a code LLM and proposed innovative methods for training data collection and task design.
+ The integration of code semantics into SemCoder is commendable and shows competitive performance.
+ The experiments effectively demonstrate the model's capabilities across various aspects.

Weaknesses:
- Some descriptions lack clarity, and there are no use cases demonstrating the model's usefulness.
- The approach appears limited to simple programs without external dependencies, raising questions about its applicability to real-world data.
- The monologue reasoning technique's impact on common coding tasks remains unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity in their descriptions and provide use cases to demonstrate the model's practical applications. Additionally, we suggest discussing how SemCoder can handle more complex programs with user-defined types and external dependencies. The authors should also elaborate on the fine-tuning process of the base models and provide metrics for evaluating input prediction. Including case studies to illustrate the effectiveness of the debugging and self-refining process would enhance the paper's insights. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore the potential of SemCoder in areas beyond code generation, such as code comment generation and program repair.
