Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents UrbanDataLayer (UDL), a standardized data structure and pipeline designed to address the fragmented nature of urban research caused by inconsistent data processing methods and multi-modal data disparities. UDL facilitates the integration of various urban data types, enabling the construction of large-scale benchmarks and the development of multi-modal urban foundation models. The authors validate UDL's effectiveness through four urban problem tasks: PM2.5 concentration prediction, built-up areas classification, identification of administrative boundaries, and El Nino anomaly detection.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- UDL introduces a novel and comprehensive pipeline for transforming raw urban data, enhancing reproducibility and benchmarking capabilities.
- The method's effectiveness is validated through practical case studies across different urban environments.
- The framework addresses critical challenges in urban computing, particularly the need for effective multi-modal data fusion methods.

Weaknesses:
- The narrative on granularity alignment in the supplementary material is overly generalized and lacks detail.
- The authors do not clearly explain UDL's ability to fuse multi-modal data or provide coding examples for practical applications.
- The four case studies are based on cosmopolitan cities, raising questions about UDL's performance in smaller areas with sparse or dirty data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the granularity alignment narrative in the supplementary material by providing specific details. Additionally, the authors should clearly articulate UDL's capabilities for fusing multi-modal data and include coding examples for practical tasks, such as built-up area prediction, in the main text. It would also be beneficial to clarify UDL's effectiveness in smaller urban areas with limited data and to benchmark UDL against existing global data layers like GHSL. Finally, the authors should consider incorporating more advanced data processing methods and widely used modalities, such as image and text data, to enhance the framework's comprehensiveness.
