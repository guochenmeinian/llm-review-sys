Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Amazon-M2 dataset, a large-scale multilingual and multi-locale shopping session dataset that addresses limitations in existing session datasets by providing comprehensive product attributes and user diversity. The dataset comprises anonymous user session data and product data collected from the Amazon platform, relying solely on user behavior without any human annotation. It introduces three novel tasks: next-product recommendation, next-product recommendation with domain shifts, and next-product title generation. The dataset enables advancements in recommendation systems and text generation tasks, with empirical insights gained through benchmarking various approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
1. The dataset is innovative, offering rich attributes and large-scale data across multiple locales and languages, filling a crucial gap in current research.
2. Comprehensive analyses and experiments reveal the dataset's potential for novel research directions, particularly in session recommendation and natural language processing.
3. The data collection process is well-documented, and ethical considerations regarding user privacy and potential biases are addressed.
4. The authors demonstrate responsiveness to feedback, acknowledging suggestions regarding font size in Figure 1 and correcting statistical typos.

**Weaknesses:**
1. The fontsize in Figure 1 is small and unclear.
2. The implementation details of the proposed algorithms, particularly hyperparameter setups, are insufficiently detailed, hindering reproducibility.
3. There is a lack of clarity regarding the construction of distribution shifts in task 2.
4. The initial discussion of the data collection process lacked detail.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors improve the fontsize in Figure 1 for better clarity.
2. We suggest that the authors provide more detailed implementation specifics, including hyperparameter setups, to enhance reproducibility.
3. We encourage the authors to clarify the methodology for constructing distribution shifts in task 2.
4. We recommend including additional state-of-the-art session-based recommendation methods, such as MGS and G3SR, and evaluating metrics like NDCG for a more comprehensive analysis.
5. We advise the authors to include more examples in Task 3 to illustrate the comparison between generated results and expected titles effectively.
6. We suggest providing a more detailed discussion on the data collection process to enhance understanding and address initial weaknesses.
