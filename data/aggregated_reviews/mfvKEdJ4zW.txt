Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to comparing neural representations through Latent Functional Maps (LFM), utilizing functional maps to model relationships between latent spaces of different neural architectures. The authors propose that the embedding space of a neural network lies on a low-dimensional manifold, and they demonstrate that using functional maps enhances representation transfer across various tasks. The experiments conducted show improvements over previous methods in similarity measures, stitching, and word retrieval.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces an innovative application of the functional map framework for neural representation transfer, showcasing clear writing and superior experimental results compared to existing methods.  
- The core idea of viewing latent spaces as Riemannian manifolds and leveraging spectral geometry is compelling, with experiments providing a solid proof of concept.

Weaknesses:  
- The rationale for using least squares in computing functional maps is unclear, as the correspondence is known by construction; an ablation study is needed to justify this choice.  
- The choice of descriptors lacks clarity regarding their consistency across latent spaces, necessitating further explanation and potential ablation studies.  
- The experimental evaluation is limited, primarily focusing on small datasets, and comparisons with more baselines are needed to strengthen claims.  
- The writing quality requires improvement, particularly in detailing experimental setups and clarifying related works.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and organization of the manuscript by providing more detailed descriptions of the experiments, including the goals, backbones, and optimizers used. Additionally, the authors should conduct an ablation study to justify the use of least squares for functional map computation and clarify the choice of descriptors. Expanding the experimental evaluation to include more datasets and comparisons with additional baselines would significantly enhance the paper's contributions. Finally, addressing the writing quality, particularly in sections discussing related works and experimental details, would improve the overall readability and impact of the paper.
