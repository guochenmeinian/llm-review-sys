Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a rigorous proof of the phenomenon known as "Gaussian mixture equivalence (GME)" in classification problems using generalized linear models. The authors demonstrate that under certain conditions, the performance metrics of models using non-Gaussian distributions align with those using Gaussian distributions that share the same first- and second-order moments. The results extend previous work by clarifying the sufficient conditions for GME and provide a mathematical foundation for analyzing complex machine learning models through simpler Gaussian mixtures.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The originality and significance of the work are high, as it clarifies the conditions under which GME occurs, providing a solid mathematical basis for understanding model behavior.
- The paper is generally well-written, with a clear motivation and structure, and the numerical experiments support the theoretical claims.

Weaknesses:  
- The clarity of the main text is compromised by the deferral of proof details to the appendix and the complexity of the statements, making it difficult to discern the relationships among theorems, assumptions, and implications.
- The reliance on previous work, particularly reference [17], raises concerns about the novelty of the technical contributions.
- Key assumptions, particularly Assumption 4, lack clear explanations regarding their validity and implications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the main text by integrating more intuitive explanations of the key assumptions, particularly Assumption 4, and by clearly distinguishing their contributions from previous studies. Additionally, we suggest revising the notation for consistency throughout the paper and providing immediate explanations for newly introduced terms. It would also be beneficial to discuss the limitations and potential failures of universality in more detail, including examples of structured data where the assumptions may not hold. Finally, consider addressing the questions raised regarding the extension of proofs to correlated data and the implications of the assumptions on the results.
