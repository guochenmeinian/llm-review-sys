### Key Points
This paper presents an applied model for predicting the onset of solar proton events (SPEs) using a dataset from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and a sliding time window of 20 hours to forecast events in the subsequent 10 hours. The authors utilize a Bayesian method (Monte Carlo dropout) but primarily provide qualitative analysis, lacking quantitative metrics for evaluation. The work is described as a proof of concept, yet it does not include aggregate results or a comprehensive analysis of multiple events.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors effectively present the full set of Monte Carlo roll-outs rather than just mean and variance.
- The problem addressed is of significant practical importance to space exploration.

Weaknesses:
- Only one model was tested, with no ablation studies or comparisons to other architectures provided.
- The analysis is limited to a single event from May 2024, raising questions about the overall performance across other dates.
- The claim that the model performs well in predicting radiation decay is contradicted by evidence from Figure 6, which shows the model lagging behind actual decay rates.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their methodology by specifying the native cadence of the SDOML, the downsampling method used, and the number of training epochs. Additionally, we suggest including results from an ablation study in the Appendix and providing quantitative metrics such as train/val/test MSE. To enhance the robustness of the analysis, we encourage the authors to explore multiple models and report aggregate results across various events rather than focusing solely on one instance. Finally, we advise addressing potential overconfidence in the model's predictions and clarifying the interpretation of Figure 2 regarding the model's predictive capabilities.
