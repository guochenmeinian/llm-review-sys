### Key Points
This paper presents a common framework for implementing various similarity metrics, using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) as a primary example. The authors demonstrate significant variability in similarity measures based on the choice of CKA variant, indicating that different variants capture distinct aspects of similarity between representations. Additionally, the authors introduce a Python package that consolidates numerous network representational similarity measures and establishes a useful naming convention for classifying these measures.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a critical challenge in representational alignment by providing a standardized repository for similarity measures, which is a valuable resource for the community.
- The methodology is rigorous, and the empirical results support the claims regarding incompatibilities among similarity measures.
- The work enhances reproducibility and efficiency in machine learning and neuroscience research, with a flexible framework for future developments.

Weaknesses:
- Technical details, particularly regarding naming conventions, may overwhelm readers unfamiliar with similarity measures, limiting accessibility.
- The paper lacks sufficient discussion on the theoretical underpinnings and guidance for selecting appropriate similarity measures.
- The significance of potential issues caused by different implementations of the same similarity measure is not thoroughly explained, and limitations of the work are not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve accessibility by simplifying sections dealing with technical details. Additionally, including theoretical explanations and guidance for selecting similarity measures would enhance the repository's utility. The authors should also discuss the importance of different implementations of the same similarity measure and address the limitations of their work more comprehensively. Finally, we suggest adding a citation to a related benchmark that recently appeared in the literature.
