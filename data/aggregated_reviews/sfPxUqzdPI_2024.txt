Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Hierarchical Sinkhorn Tree (HST) approach for point cloud registration, focusing on extracting correspondences consistent across multiple feature scales. It introduces an overlap-aware module to enhance correspondence localization in overlapping regions. The proposed methods demonstrate superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods on two benchmarks, achieving high success rates and registration accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The application of multi-scale consistency to point cloud registration extends previous methods, validating its effectiveness through experimental results.
2. The introduction of a coarse-level outlier removal method integrated with the GeoTransformer is intriguing, despite being incremental.
3. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with sufficient comparisons and ablation studies to support the proposed mechanism.

Weaknesses:
1. The terminology used in Eq1 is misleading, as it describes feature matching rather than "inlier correspondence."
2. The variable Tij in Eq5 is not adequately explained, which could benefit from further clarification.
3. The method appears to be an incremental enhancement, increasing model and time complexity without significantly outperforming existing methods.
4. The paper lacks an ablation study on parameter selection, which could provide insights into model sensitivity.
5. The proposed method may struggle with low overlap cases, and its performance under such conditions remains unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of terminology in Eq1 to accurately reflect the concept of feature matching. Additionally, providing a detailed explanation of the variable Tij in Eq5 would enhance understanding. It would be beneficial to illustrate the optimization of the proposed HST with a detailed figure or pseudo code in section 3.2.4. We also suggest conducting an ablation study on parameter selection for the top-q predicted scores and overlap points to better understand model sensitivity. Finally, exploring the performance of the proposed method in scenarios with less than 10% overlap would provide valuable insights into its robustness.
