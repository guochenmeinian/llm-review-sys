Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents robust Bayesian satisficing, a novel approach in Bayesian optimization (BO) that addresses distribution shifts by aiming for a satisfactory solution defined by a threshold $\tau$. The authors propose two new regret measures—lenient regret and robust satisficing regret—and introduce the Robust Bayesian Optimistic Satisficing (RoBOS) algorithm, which is theoretically guaranteed to achieve sublinear regret under certain conditions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate RoBOS's effectiveness against distributionally robust BO (DRBO) across synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of robust satisficing as a new optimization objective for BO is innovative, providing an alternative to traditional methods that rely on ambiguity sets.
- The new regret definitions are well-founded, and the proposed algorithm is backed by theoretical performance guarantees.
- Empirical results support the claims of RoBOS's superior performance compared to DRBO and other baselines.
- The paper is generally well-written and presents a relevant contribution to the field.

Weaknesses:
- The selection of the threshold $\tau$ remains unclear, particularly in real-world applications, as it is stated to be a percentage of the SO solution, which is unknown when $f$ is not defined.
- The empirical evaluation relies heavily on simple synthetic benchmarks, with a lack of comprehensive testing on real-world problems, particularly the insulin dose allocation benchmark, which is only mentioned in the appendix.
- Clarity issues exist in the presentation, including the definition of $\kappa_{\tau, t}$ and the need for colorbars in figures for interpretability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the selection of the threshold $\tau$, particularly addressing how it can be dynamically chosen without compromising the definition of regret. Additionally, we suggest including more extensive empirical evaluations on real-world benchmarks and ensuring that all relevant experiments are referenced in the main text. To enhance clarity, we advise revising the problematic definitions and ensuring that all figures are interpretable with appropriate legends. Finally, addressing the writing style and structure for better coherence would significantly strengthen the paper.
