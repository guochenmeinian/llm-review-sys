Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a pairwise dataset for phone-tablet GUI conversion and retrieval, detailing the dataset collection, statistics, and empirical experiments conducted. The dataset comprises over 10,000 GUI page pairs crawled from 5,600 Android applications, focusing on the novelty of pairing UI elements between devices. The authors discuss the data collection process, which involved a manual review by three specialists to ensure data integrity, leading to the removal of 2,296 erroneous pairs. The paper emphasizes the significance of the dataset for future research, particularly in GUI encoding, modeling UI relationships, and addressing content discrepancies between devices.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The dataset is a significant contribution, being the first to pair UIs between phone and tablet apps.
2. It is well-structured, large, and diverse, with a careful cleansing process to avoid errors.
3. The dataset's design and manual validation process enhance data quality.
4. The paper is clearly written and flows well, making it easy to follow.
5. Clear modifications to Figure 7 improve clarity.
6. The paper outlines significant research questions and potential avenues for future exploration.

Weaknesses:
1. The dataset is limited to Android applications, which may not generalize to iOS.
2. The size of the dataset, while over 10,000 pairs, is still considered small for broader impact.
3. The experimental findings lack depth, with insufficient analysis of model performance and the challenges of pairing dynamic UI components.
4. The methodology, while included in the main paper, lacks proper highlighting and references for future work.
5. The discussion on the dataset's applications is not sufficiently supported by citations, limiting its impact.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the dataset's applications in the introduction, emphasizing its relevance to cross-platform design and automated GUI development. The authors should also elaborate on the pairing process in the main text rather than supplementary materials, ensuring that the challenges faced during data collection are clearly articulated. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion on the quality of the apps in the dataset, potentially filtering for well-rated applications to enhance the dataset's utility. Furthermore, we recommend improving the visibility of new content by properly highlighting sections 3.1, 3.2, and Figure 2 in blue. Finally, clarifying the concept of "same view" in the main text and providing more detailed analysis of model performance, along with including relevant citations in the discussion of future work, would strengthen the paper significantly.
