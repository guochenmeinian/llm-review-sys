Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents algorithms for computing the geometric median with differential privacy (DP). It consists of two main parts: the first part estimates a quantile radius that encompasses a sufficient number of points, while the second part fine-tunes the geometric median using two methods: LocDPGD and a modified cutting plane method. The authors also introduce a pure DP algorithm and establish a lower bound on the sample complexity necessary for computing the geometric median under DP constraints.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a significant problem in the field of DP convex optimization, particularly in high-dimensional settings where traditional methods struggle with outliers.  
- The proposed algorithms improve the dependency of excess error on the effective radius of the dataset rather than the worst-case radius, which is beneficial in practical scenarios.  
- The techniques employed, such as the private estimation of the quantile radius and the innovative use of Gaussian noise in the cutting plane method, are noteworthy contributions.  
- The paper is well-organized, making it accessible for readers.

Weaknesses:  
- The dependency between parameters in Theorems 2.7, 3.1, and 3.4 is not clearly articulated, making them difficult to compare.  
- The writing could benefit from additional clarity, particularly in defining terms and concepts such as "excess error" and "effective diameter."  
- The pure DP algorithm is less compelling due to its reliance on an oracle for the exact geometric median, which raises questions about its practical applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Theorems 2.7, 3.1, and 3.4 to facilitate easier comparison and understanding of parameter dependencies. Additionally, we suggest expanding Section 1.1 to provide more intuition behind the proposed solutions and including a comparison of run-time and excess risk with previous methods. It would also be beneficial to clarify the definitions of terms like "excess error" and "effective diameter" throughout the paper. Finally, we encourage the authors to discuss the implications of using the quantile radius in the context of their pure DP algorithm and to address the concerns regarding the oracle requirement for the geometric median.
