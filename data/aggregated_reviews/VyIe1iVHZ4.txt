### Key Points
This paper presents a study on link prediction in temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) and proposes TR-Rules, a rule-based model designed to address temporal redundancy in existing methods. The authors introduce a window confidence algorithm that models both cyclic and acyclic rules. The paper includes extensive experiments demonstrating that TR-Rules achieves state-of-the-art performance while exploring acyclic rules through temporal random walks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The manuscript is well-written, with clear figures that enhance readability.
- The proposed method effectively addresses the temporal redundancy problem and is the first to extract acyclic rules from TKGs.
- The authors provide code for reproducibility, and the experimental results validate the proposed approach.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution is perceived as incremental, with the proposed strategy resembling an implementation skill rather than a novel method.
- Generalization ability and significance of improvements over TLogic are unclear, with some experimental results lacking sufficient statistical validation.
- Several sections contain errors, including missing labels in formulas, unclear figures, and grammatical mistakes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 5 by addressing the errors and providing a more thorough analysis of the acyclic rules. Additionally, conducting multiple experiments and averaging the results could strengthen the findings. We suggest including a brief introduction to the selected baselines to clarify their relevance. Finally, we encourage the authors to ensure all figures are clear and to seek proofreading assistance to enhance the overall presentation of the paper.
