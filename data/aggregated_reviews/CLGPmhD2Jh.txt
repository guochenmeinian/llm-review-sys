### Key Points
This paper presents a multi-hypergraph disentanglement method (MHD) for hyper-relational knowledge representation learning (HKRL), aiming to overcome limitations in existing methods by effectively mining relational similarity and attribute identity across multiple hypergraphs. The authors propose that their method enhances interpretability and performance on link prediction tasks, validated through extensive experiments on four datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The use of disentangled representation learning enhances interpretability by separating semantic from structural information.
- Comprehensive experimental evaluation across four datasets shows the proposed method's effectiveness against state-of-the-art baselines.
- The paper is well-organized, with clear explanations and extensive performance comparisons.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a deeper theoretical analysis of why the multi-hypergraph approach outperforms single-graph methods.
- There is insufficient exploration of how different types and numbers of qualifier attributes affect MHD performance.
- The discussion of results is limited, lacking depth in comparing model performance based on dataset characteristics.
- The computational cost and model complexity are not adequately addressed, raising concerns about efficiency.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis of the multi-hypergraph approach to clarify its advantages over single-graph methods. Conducting ablation studies to isolate the effects of the multi-hypergraph construction and disentangled learning components on performance would be beneficial. Additionally, measuring training time, memory usage, and scalability concerning the number of entities, relations, and hyper-relational facts should be included. We suggest enhancing the discussion of results by comparing performance based on dataset characteristics, such as sparsity. Finally, a dedicated section discussing the limitations of the approach would provide valuable context for future work.
