Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SimPO, an offline preference optimization method for LLM alignment that replaces the KL term in DPO with a length-regularized log-probability and introduces a margin value for regularization. SimPO demonstrates significant performance improvements over DPO and other variants in extensive chat benchmark experiments, attributed to better alignment between training and decoding objectives and reduced exploitation of lengthy responses. The authors emphasize the computational efficiency gained by eliminating the reference model.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with a clear motivation and understandable approach.
- Extensive and well-designed experiments provide valuable insights into generation lengths, log probabilities, and reward differences between DPO and SimPO models.
- The algorithm is intuitive and simple to implement, with solid empirical performance across diverse benchmarks.

Weaknesses:
- A theoretical understanding of SimPO is lacking, as its design is not grounded in established theory, raising questions about its optimization properties.
- The focus on helpfulness in experiments neglects safety and honesty considerations, which could pose potential risks.
- The introduction of the target reward margin requires tuning, and the lack of comparative analysis with "DPO with an offset" limits understanding of relative advantages.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical grounding of SimPO by providing clarity on the optimization problem it addresses and discussing its convexity properties. Additionally, we suggest including fine-grained case studies to illustrate differences in responses generated by DPO and SimPO. It would be beneficial to conduct comparative experiments with DPO with a target reward margin to elucidate the advantages of SimPO. Furthermore, exploring applications beyond chat, such as reasoning tasks, could broaden the paper's impact. Lastly, addressing safety, honesty, and the implications of removing KL regularization in practical scenarios would enhance the paper's robustness.
