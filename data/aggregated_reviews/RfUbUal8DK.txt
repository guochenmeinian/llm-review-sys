### Key Points
This paper presents a technically sound and innovative approach to dose-response prediction in cancer drug combinations using permutation-invariant multi-output Gaussian Processes (MOGPs). The authors propose a methodology that effectively combines Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) and Deep Generative Models (DGMs) to address limitations in previous works. Key innovations include the encoding of permutation invariance into the Gaussian process framework, improved scalability through SVI, and the incorporation of SELFIES molecular representation to enhance chemical embeddings in drug-response models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The methodology is mathematically rigorous and employs well-established Gaussian process frameworks like Linear Model of Coregionalization (LMC).  
- The paper introduces notable innovations, such as permutation invariance and improved scalability.  
- The results are well presented, and the writing is clear.  

Weaknesses:  
- The results section is relatively short and lacks detailed analysis and comparisons with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.  
- The complexity of the method and its limited generalizability may hinder understanding.  
- The intricacies of the generative model and its practical scalability are difficult to grasp.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the results section by providing a more detailed analysis and crucial comparisons with other SOTA methods. Clarifying the performance of the proposed method relative to others, including its benefits and potential strengths, would enhance the paper's impact. Additionally, simplifying the explanation of the generative model and addressing practical scalability challenges would aid in reader comprehension.
