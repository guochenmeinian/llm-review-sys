Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for unsupervised out-of-distribution (OoD) detection in image classification tasks, utilizing a diffusion model for semantic reconstruction of latent features at multiple layers. The authors propose that this feature-level approach enhances detection efficiency compared to pixel-level methods. The effectiveness of their method is demonstrated through experiments on various datasets, including CIFAR10, SVHN, and others, with performance metrics such as AUROC and FPR95.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach of modeling feature encodings for OoD detection is intuitive and innovative, marking a successful integration of generative modeling within this framework.
- The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the method's components and informative ablation studies.
- The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets and demonstrates significant speed advantages over other generative models.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the paper is limited, primarily appearing as a replacement of existing generative models with a diffusion model without substantial theoretical backing.
- Evaluation metrics may not adequately address the imbalanced nature of OoD datasets; additional metrics like AUPRC should be considered.
- The comparisons in experiments lack fairness, as different generative models are applied at varying input levels, and there is insufficient exploration of the speed gap between the proposed method and other approaches.
- The clarity of the OOD detection step and the selection of thresholds for metrics is lacking, and the paper does not adequately compare pixel-level and feature-level denoising.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis of their method to clarify the rationale behind its effectiveness. Additionally, the authors should extend their evaluation metrics to include those that capture the characteristics of imbalanced datasets, such as AUPRC. A fairer comparison of generative models should be conducted using the same input features. Furthermore, the authors need to provide clearer explanations of the OOD detection step and the selection process for threshold values. Finally, exploring the proposed method's performance in more complex scenarios beyond classification tasks would enhance its applicability and robustness.
