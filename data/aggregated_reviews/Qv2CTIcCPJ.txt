### Key Points
This paper presents an experimental investigation into how linguistic variations in prompts affect the performance of large language models (LLMs) on classification tasks, specifically using datasets from GLUE and SuperGLUE. The authors examine variations in grammatical properties (mood, tense, modality) and lexical properties (synonymy) and find that prompts exhibit instability and sensitivity to these variations, leading to significant performance discrepancies across datasets and models. The authors conclude with empirical suggestions for future research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a comprehensive and systematic empirical study of prompt instability, which could inform future research.
- It presents interesting conclusions, such as the correlation between LM perplexity of prompts and performance.

Weaknesses:
- The extensive experimental analysis does not yield clear patterns for optimal prompt formulation, and the focus is limited to classification tasks.
- Many conclusions appear to reiterate previous findings or common knowledge within the community, lacking deeper insights or analysis.
- The experimental setup is constrained, primarily involving only two model categories (vanilla LMs and instruction-tuned LMs), raising concerns about the generalizability of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by clearly outlining the study's focus on the effects of syntactic variations on semantically equivalent prompts. Additionally, we suggest rephrasing the opening sentence of paragraph starting with "To test ***this hypothesis***" for clarity. The authors should also consider expanding their experimental design to include a more challenging cross-task setting and provide explanations for their choice of linguistic variations. Furthermore, addressing the subjective nature of some viewpoints, such as the suggestion to include performance estimates based on a large set of prompts, would strengthen the paper. Lastly, clarifying the title of section 5.3 to enhance readability would be beneficial.
