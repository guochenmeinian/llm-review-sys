Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the concept of abnormal adversarial examples (AAEs) and their strong correlation with catastrophic overfitting in single-step adversarial training. The authors propose a new regularization method, abnormal adversarial examples regularization (AAER), to constrain the generation of AAEs, thereby addressing catastrophic overfitting. The effectiveness of AAER is demonstrated through experiments on various datasets, including CIFAR 10/100, SVHN, and TinyImageNet.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper provides a new perspective on catastrophic overfitting in single-step adversarial training.
2. The observations regarding AAEs are intriguing and may inspire future research.
3. The proposed method is concise, intuitive, and aligns well with the paper's motivation.
4. The presentation is clear, with figures effectively illustrating key ideas.

Weaknesses:
1. The experimental evaluation is insufficient, lacking comprehensive comparisons with existing robust single-step adversarial training methods.
2. The paper does not adequately explain the cause of the observed phenomena related to AAEs.
3. Claims made in the paper are debatable, and some experimental results may not reflect general findings in single-step adversarial training.
4. Insufficient ablation studies and comparisons with other regularization methods are presented.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental evaluation by conducting tests on larger datasets, such as ImageNet-100 and ImageNet, and by including additional baselines like GAT and FGSM-PGI. The authors should also extend the training duration beyond 30 epochs to better demonstrate the effectiveness of AAER in mitigating catastrophic overfitting. Furthermore, we suggest providing a clearer explanation of the relationship between AAEs and catastrophic overfitting, as well as conducting more comprehensive ablation studies to validate the proposed method's superiority over existing approaches.
