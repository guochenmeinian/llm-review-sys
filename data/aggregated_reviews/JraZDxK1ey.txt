### Key Points
This paper presents CLUE, a framework for the integration of curated knowledge bases (CKBs) and open knowledge bases (OKBs) through a unified embedding space. The authors propose a method that addresses OKB canonicalization and linking simultaneously, leveraging an expectation-maximization algorithm and curriculum learning. The experiments conducted demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The framework effectively encodes OKBs and CKBs into a shared embedding space, allowing for mutual reinforcement of canonicalization and linking tasks.
- Comprehensive experiments validate the proposed method's effectiveness against relevant baselines.
- The paper is well-organized and clearly written, providing detailed technical descriptions.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks state-of-the-art baselines for comparison, limiting the evaluation's depth.
- There is insufficient deep experimental analysis, particularly regarding the marginal performance improvements observed in some metrics.
- Presentation issues exist, such as unclear titles and terminology that could be more precise.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by adding citations for the "expectation maximization" algorithm and "curriculum learning" upon their first mention. Additionally, Figure 1 should have a more descriptive title to enhance clarity. The authors should also explicitly relate their approach to web technologies in the introduction to meet the relevance criteria of the Web Conference. Furthermore, a discussion on the complexity and training/inference costs of the proposed method would help users assess its cost/benefit compared to existing approaches. Finally, we suggest conducting more ablation studies to clarify the contributions of each component in the framework.
