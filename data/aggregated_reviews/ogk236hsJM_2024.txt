Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Score Implicit Matching (SIM), a distillation-based accelerated sampling method for score-based diffusion models, including EDM and Stable Diffusion. SIM compresses information from a diffusion-based teacher into single-step generator models and generalizes the design choice of the distance function. The authors propose a new objective function, Score-Based Divergence, which measures the distance between pre-trained score-based models and those learned by one-step generators. The method is applied to image generation tasks, demonstrating effectiveness on standard benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The application of SIM to text-to-image generators like Stable Diffusion validates the effectiveness of accelerated sampling algorithms.
2. The generalization of the distance function enhances SID, as shown in Table 4 of the Appendix.
3. The theoretical insight into transforming score-based divergences into tractable minimization problems is commendable.

Weaknesses:
1. The performance of SIM appears ineffective, and the authors should retrain experiments related to CIFAR10 to evaluate SIM's effectiveness against SID's official implementation.
2. The distinction between SIM and SID is not sufficiently emphasized, as both share similar logic, making the contribution of the "Score Implicit Matching" section questionable.
3. The paper lacks a broader comparison with other state-of-the-art distillation methods, limiting the evaluation of SIM's performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical evaluation by including comparisons with additional state-of-the-art distillation techniques and exploring diverse datasets beyond CIFAR-10. Additionally, we suggest providing empirical evidence to clarify why the Pseudo-Huber distance is superior to other choices and addressing the potential failure modes of SIM. Incorporating discussions on the benefits of data inclusion during distillation could also enhance the paper's depth. Lastly, we encourage the authors to refine the presentation by correcting typos and improving figure clarity.
