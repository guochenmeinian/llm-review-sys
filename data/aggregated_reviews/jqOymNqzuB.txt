### Key Points
This paper presents the MITweet dataset for the multifaceted ideology detection (MID) task, comprising 12,594 English Twitter posts annotated with Relevance and Ideology labels across twelve facets. The authors propose a new ideology identification schema that transcends traditional binary labels, offering a more nuanced understanding of ideologies. They also conduct experiments with various text encoders to establish baseline results for the dataset, which serves as a benchmark for future research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The novel approach to ideology detection through a multifaceted lens enhances comprehension of complex ideologies.
- The creation of a high-quality dataset fills a significant gap in existing research.
- The dataset is well-annotated, achieving an average Krippendorff's alpha of 83.1, and the experimental setup is valid, reporting both average and standard deviation of the F1 score.

Weaknesses:
- The new annotation schema lacks a discussion of its limitations, particularly regarding the overlap with topical identification, which may diminish its downstream relevance.
- The approach does not address how to manage ambiguity and overlap between different ideologies.
- There is no external measure to validate the detected ideologies, and a case study could enhance understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the limitations of the new annotation schema, particularly regarding its overlap with topical identification. Additionally, the authors should address how they plan to manage ambiguity and overlap between ideologies. Incorporating a case study on a specific topic could provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the ideology detection. Finally, we suggest including the responses to reviewer concerns in the paper to enhance clarity for readers.
