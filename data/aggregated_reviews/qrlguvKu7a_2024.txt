### Key Points
This paper presents Piecewise Rectified Flow (PeRFlow) as a method to accelerate pre-trained diffusion models by dividing the ODE trajectory into multiple time windows and applying a reflow operation to straighten the sampling trajectories. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of PeRFlow through experiments on various diffusion models for text-to-image and text-to-video generation, showing superior performance in few-step generation and fast training capabilities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant performance bottleneck in rectified flow related to synthetic data generation, allowing for more efficient training through online simulation of ODE trajectories.
- Extensive testing on multiple diffusion models yields impressive comparative results against state-of-the-art few-step diffusion baselines.
- The writing is clear and well-structured, with detailed mathematical formulations and effective visual representations.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution is diminished by similarities to Sequential Reflow, and the adaptation for different parameterization strategies appears incremental.
- The motivation for improving training efficiency is not adequately reflected in the experiments; a comprehensive comparison with rectified flow regarding performance and training computation tradeoff is needed.
- Claims regarding lower numerical error in PeRFlow require careful validation, including quantitative comparisons of straightness or curvature within time windows.
- There is a lack of ablation studies on design choices, particularly concerning the number of time windows and sampling steps, and the impact of adding an extra step in the sampling process is unclear.
- The evaluation metrics are limited to FID, and incorporating IS would provide insights into the diversity of generated images.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by providing a more comprehensive comparison with rectified flow, particularly regarding performance and training computation tradeoff. Additionally, the authors should validate claims about numerical error through quantitative comparisons and consider applying their method to commonly used datasets for better visualization. We suggest including ablation studies to analyze the sensitivity of PeRFlow's performance to the number of time windows and sampling steps. Furthermore, the authors should discuss the multi-step consistency model and other relevant distillation methods in their comparisons. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the evaluation metrics used and consider including IS to assess the diversity of generated images.
