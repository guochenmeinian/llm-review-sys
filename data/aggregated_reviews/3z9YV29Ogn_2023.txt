Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ClimateSet, a large-scale climate dataset designed for machine learning applications, encompassing model simulations from 36 climate models across various historical and future scenarios. The authors propose a dataset generation pipeline that facilitates the retrieval and preprocessing of climate model data, aiming to support the development of climate change scenario-specific ML models or a "super emulator." The rationale for using climate model data over observational or reanalysis data is clarified, emphasizing the need for predictions under future scenarios. The dataset's construction is highlighted as a significant advancement over previous datasets, particularly in its diversity and comprehensiveness. The authors address various technical aspects, including the handling of extreme events and the diversity of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) scenarios, and propose methods to mitigate the one-to-many problem in climate modeling, such as using sea-level pressure maps as additional inputs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset's breadth, incorporating outputs from multiple climate models, enhances its relevance for machine learning researchers in climate science.
- The ClimateSet data pipeline simplifies access and preprocessing, requiring minimal domain knowledge.
- The paper provides detailed explanations of the dataset generation process and demonstrates the dataset's utility through baseline ML model evaluations.
- The dataset is considered a significant contribution to both the machine learning and climate science communities, providing a practical resource for researchers.
- The authors have made substantial revisions based on reviewer feedback, enhancing clarity and accessibility for users with limited domain knowledge.
- The inclusion of figures illustrating the emulation task and the diversity of climate model projections strengthens the manuscript.

Weaknesses:
- The resolution of the dataset (100/250 km) may be insufficient for accurately predicting extreme climate events, and the temporal resolution (1 month) could limit the analysis of phenomena like heat waves.
- The rationale for selecting specific variables (e.g., CO2, CH4, SO2, BC) and the diversity of scenarios represented in the dataset are not adequately justified.
- The evaluation metric (RMSE) used may not effectively capture the multimodal nature of climate predictions, potentially leading to misleading assessments of model performance.
- Some sections, such as the benchmarking explanation, could still benefit from greater clarity and user-friendliness.
- The discussion on ethical and responsible use of the dataset remains somewhat unclear and may require further elaboration.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset's resolution to better accommodate the prediction of extreme events and consider incorporating additional prognostic variables beyond temperature and precipitation. It would be beneficial to provide a clearer justification for the choice of variables included in the core ClimateSet dataset and to demonstrate the diversity of scenarios quantitatively. Furthermore, we suggest revisiting the evaluation metrics employed, particularly considering the adoption of probabilistic approaches to better reflect the inherent uncertainties in climate modeling. Additionally, enhancing the clarity of the Input4MIPs section and providing a system diagram could improve user comprehension and accessibility. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the benchmarking process by providing more user-friendly documentation, such as Jupyter notebooks. Moreover, we suggest extending the discussion on ethical and responsible use by providing clearer guidelines on potential misuse of the dataset. Finally, consider including information about shared submodels of climate models as auxiliary inputs to enhance the understanding of model initialization in future work.
