### Key Points
This paper presents a novel task of tuple-level speculation detection, aiming to classify whether tuples extracted by an Open Information Extraction (OIE) system are speculative. The authors propose a model, SpecTup, which utilizes contextual semantic and dependency structure information to enhance detection accuracy. They also organize a dataset for this task and conduct experiments to validate their approach, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to keyword matching methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces an interesting and novel research problem that bridges speculation detection and information extraction.
- The proposed GNN baseline model shows significant improvement over naive baselines, providing a solid foundation for future research.
- Comprehensive experimental analysis supports the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments are insufficient; comparisons with state-of-the-art models for similar tasks are lacking.
- The direct derivation of speculation labels from modality labels is problematic, as it overlooks nuances in the relationship between modality and speculation.
- The complexity of the proposed baseline model may hinder understanding, and the dataset is limited.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including comparisons with commonly used state-of-the-art models for similar tasks. Additionally, we suggest explicitly labeling speculation information rather than relying solely on modal verb annotations to enhance the robustness of the classification. Clarifying the methodology and providing statistical evidence for the reliability of the speculation labels would strengthen the paper. Finally, simplifying the baseline model or providing clearer explanations could improve accessibility for readers.
