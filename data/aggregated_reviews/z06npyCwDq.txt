Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of normalization layers in Transformers, specifically LayerNorm and RMSNorm, and proposes a unified approach that allows LayerNorm to function like RMSNorm. The authors introduce C-RMSNorm, which reduces the model's hidden size by one dimension while maintaining performance. They claim that these modifications can lead to a 10% reduction in training and inference time, although they do not address potential impacts on performance or accuracy. Additionally, the paper includes a comparative analysis of different normalization techniques (Pre-LN, Pre-RMSNorm, Pre-CRMSNorm) applied to Vision Transformers (ViT) and GPT-2 Small models. The authors achieve similar accuracy across these variants on datasets like ImageNet-1k and wikitext-103-raw-v1, indicating that performance differences are primarily due to randomness and numerical issues. The authors plan to enhance discussions around reparameterization, noting similarities with RepVGG.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors provide a comprehensive comparison of LayerNorm and RMSNorm, highlighting their differences and relationships.
- The proposed methods can potentially reduce training and inference time, addressing a significant issue in model efficiency.
- The paper includes extensive mathematical proofs and clear presentation, making it accessible to readers.
- The authors present comprehensive experimental results, demonstrating the performance of various model configurations.
- The clarity in presenting training and evaluation metrics through tables enhances the understanding of the results.

Weaknesses:
- The soundness of claims regarding the equivalence of LayerNorm and RMSNorm is questionable, as the authors only demonstrate one direction of this equivalence.
- There is insufficient empirical evidence regarding the performance of the proposed methods, particularly concerning training stability and accuracy.
- The paper lacks clarity on the datasets used for experiments and the specific models referenced, particularly regarding the GPT-3 architecture.
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion on the implications of the reparameterization method, which could benefit from a clearer connection to existing work like RepVGG.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their claims regarding the equivalence of LayerNorm and RMSNorm by demonstrating both directions of this relationship. Additionally, it is crucial to provide more empirical results that assess the effectiveness of the proposed methods in terms of training performance and stability. We suggest including detailed evaluations on various datasets and clarifying the nature of the GPT-3 models used in experiments. Furthermore, addressing the potential training costs associated with the proposed methods and providing training and test curves would strengthen the paper's validity. Lastly, we recommend that the authors improve the discussion on reparameterization by explicitly linking their method to the RepVGG framework and ensuring that all additional details and experiments are included in the final paper to provide a complete picture of the research findings.
