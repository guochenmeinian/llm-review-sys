Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to role extraction in complex networks, distinguishing it from community detection. The authors propose a definition of node roles based on equitable partitions and introduce two optimization problems inspired by graph-isomorphism tests, specifically the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm. Theoretical guarantees are provided, and the method is validated through a "role-infused partition benchmark," which allows for stochastic role assignments in sampled networks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research topic of role discovery is significant and underexplored compared to community detection.
- The model design based on equitable partitions is technically sound and theoretically justified.
- Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness across various datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a detailed comparative analysis with existing node role extraction methods, such as graphlet-based and matrix-factorization-based approaches.
- There is insufficient explanation regarding the rationale for using equitable partitions for node role discovery.
- The selection and properties of the introduced cost functions are not thoroughly discussed.
- The experimental work is limited, with few datasets and a lack of evaluation on widely used downstream tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparative analysis by including performance metrics and evaluations against existing methods, such as MMSB and RIDRs. A more rigorous explanation of the motivation for using equitable partitions in node role discovery is essential. Additionally, we suggest providing a thorough discussion of the selection and properties of the cost functions introduced. Expanding the experimental work to include more widely used datasets and downstream tasks, such as node classification and link prediction, would enhance the paper's contributions. Lastly, clarifying how the ground truth for the sampled adjacency matrices is computed and addressing the efficiency of the proposed method would be beneficial.
