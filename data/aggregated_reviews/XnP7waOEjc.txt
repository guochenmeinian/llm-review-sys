### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to complex sequence count data through the introduction of MultiAddGP models within a Bayesian Multinomial Logistic-Normal (MLN) framework. The authors address challenges associated with the compositional and count-based nature of such data, which traditional models often mischaracterize by treating it as Gaussian. The proposed method allows for simultaneous consideration of both linear and non-linear effects, extending prior methodologies like generalized linear models and Gaussian process models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The CU sampler significantly accelerates inference, outperforming traditional methods like HMC and enhancing scalability for large datasets.
- The MultiAddGP model effectively captures both linear and non-linear effects, improving the accuracy of modeling complex microbiome and gene expression data.

Weaknesses:
- The model's dependence on the Laplace approximation may yield suboptimal performance in scenarios with low-sequencing depth, necessitating alternative approaches.
- While effective for microbiome and gene expression data, the model's emphasis on compositional count data may limit its applicability to simpler datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by addressing the anonymity issue linked to the reference of their previous work. Additionally, the authors should consider comparing their approach to mixed models, which also incorporate additive concepts and may offer simpler alternatives. Clarifying the generation of simulated data and its fairness would enhance the paper's credibility. Finally, we suggest that the authors provide more context regarding the observable variables in their algorithm, as this could impact its utility in biological applications where such information is often unavailable.
