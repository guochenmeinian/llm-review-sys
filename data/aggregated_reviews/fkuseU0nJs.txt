Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to active learning in simulation-based inference (SBI) through the ASNPE algorithm, which enhances sample efficiency in sequential neural posterior estimation. The authors apply this method to urban travel demand calibration, specifically focusing on the Origin-Destination Matrix estimation problem in traffic simulation. The integration of active learning allows for the selection of data points that maximize information gain, thereby improving the efficiency of parameter estimation in complex models. Additionally, the paper includes a comparative analysis of ASNPE and SNPE across various metrics, demonstrating that ASNPE generally outperforms SNPE, particularly on MMD and L2 metrics. The authors address the importance of clarity in notation and the need for additional benchmark tasks to contextualize their methodology, while acknowledging the limitations of the C2ST metric due to its near-unity values across settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The originality of introducing active learning in SBI is notable, with no similar approaches identified in the literature.
- The method effectively targets samples with high epistemic uncertainty, leading to a practical algorithm that reduces the number of required simulation samples.
- The paper is clearly written, with well-structured descriptions of the method and its application.
- The authors provide a thorough rebuttal addressing reviewer concerns, enhancing clarity and context for their methodology.
- The inclusion of additional benchmark tasks improves the paper's applicability and relevance to the community.
- The performance of ASNPE over SNPE is well-documented across various metrics, indicating the robustness of their approach.

Weaknesses:
- Equation 4 lacks proper motivation, as the rationale for simply multiplying terms from Equation 3 is unclear and appears arbitrary.
- The computational cost of optimizing Equation 4 is not adequately addressed, particularly regarding the evaluation of the Bayesian neural network.
- The use of RMNSE as a metric for posterior evaluation is questionable, especially for multimodal distributions.
- The empirical evaluation is limited to a single application, which restricts the generalizability of the method.
- The focus on a specific task may limit the generalizability of the findings, as noted by multiple reviewers.
- The C2ST metric's limited informative value due to its high values across settings raises questions about its utility in the analysis.
- Some notation inconsistencies and dense explanations may hinder reader comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for Equation 4 by providing a clearer rationale for the chosen formulation. Additionally, the paper should explicitly discuss the computational limitations associated with the acquisition function. We suggest exploring alternative evaluation metrics beyond RMNSE that are more suitable for multimodal posteriors. To enhance the generalizability of the findings, we encourage the authors to include experiments across a broader range of applications beyond urban travel demand calibration. We also recommend improving the consistency in notation throughout the paper, particularly by standardizing the use of $q_{\phi}(\theta | x)$ for clarity. Furthermore, we suggest expanding the exposition on the contexts in which their methodology is particularly beneficial or less effective, as this will help readers understand its applicability. Finally, we encourage the authors to conduct experiments with larger simulation budgets to better differentiate between SNPE and ASNPE regarding C2ST in the final version.
