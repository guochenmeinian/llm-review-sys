### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive study on prompt engineering for large language models (LLMs) in open-domain dialogue tasks, specifically focusing on the trade-off between model quality and inference cost. The authors introduce Usable Information Density (UID) as a metric to quantify this trade-off. They find that Semantic-1 yields the best UID, while using summaries improves UID compared to full dialog history. The study also reveals that few-shot accuracy performs worse than zero-shot accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study is thorough, examining a wide variety of parameters related to prompting methods for LLMs.
- It addresses the practical implications of prompt length on cost, providing valuable guidelines for model design.

Weaknesses:
- The UID metric's design may be flawed due to its linear assumption between model quality and length, which could misrepresent the trade-off.
- The conclusions drawn regarding the effectiveness of summarized dialogues lack significant impact and generalizability for future research.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the UID metric by considering a scale parameter, such as M^a / L, to better quantify the trade-off between quality and inference cost. Additionally, we suggest providing a more in-depth analysis of the experimental results in Section 5 to enhance the generalizability of the findings. Clarifying the definition of "efficiency" in the context of the study would also strengthen the paper.
