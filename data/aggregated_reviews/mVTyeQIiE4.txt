Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel probabilistic meta-learning algorithm called HTGM, which models the full hierarchical sampling procedure for few-shot classification, enabling both prediction and novel task detection. The authors employ the EM procedure alongside variational inference to learn parameters, demonstrating superior performance in few-shot classification and novel task detection compared to existing methods. Additionally, the paper explores task distribution modeling through a hierarchical Gaussian mixture approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The originality and significance of the proposed probabilistic model allow for adaptation and novelty detection in few-shot classification, and it can integrate with other metric-learning algorithms seamlessly.
- The quality of the probabilistic model is reasonable, with a thorough discussion of design choices and convincing experimental results.
- The paper is generally well-written and clear.

Weaknesses:
- The treatment of the partition function raises concerns; the authors need to clarify its implications on modeling and potential losses incurred by disregarding it.
- The model's probabilistic interpretation is weakened by various performance-enhancing tricks, which may obscure the correct probabilistic distribution.
- The use of non-standard datasets (Plain-Multi and Art-Multi) is a limitation; additional experiments on established benchmarks like the meta-dataset would enhance credibility.
- Several typographical errors are present throughout the manuscript.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the partition function's role and its potential limitations, particularly regarding overfitting. Additionally, clarifying the rationale behind tying parameters in the recognition network and providing empirical results on the behavior of $D_{hl}$ during training would strengthen the paper. The authors should also consider incorporating a probabilistic basis for the adaptation step to enhance interpretability. Expanding experimental validation to include standard datasets like the meta-dataset would provide a more robust assessment of the model's effectiveness. Lastly, addressing the identified typographical errors would improve the overall presentation.
