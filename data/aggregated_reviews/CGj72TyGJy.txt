Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents GoMARL, a novel learning framework that introduces automatic grouping to enhance team coordination efficiency in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). The authors propose a group-oriented factorization of joint action-values and a policy learning strategy that encourages specialization within groups while promoting diversity across them. The method is evaluated through extensive experiments in StarCraft II micromanagement tasks and Google Research Football, demonstrating its effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of grouping into multi-agent value function factorization is a novel concept executed well across challenging scenarios.
- Detailed case studies and ablation studies provide clear insights into the performance and contributions of the proposed solution.
- The paper is well-written, making complex ideas accessible.

Weaknesses:
- The implementation procedures are challenging to grasp, particularly the abstract nature of certain statements, such as the grouping criteria.
- Lack of theoretical analysis regarding the representation capacity of the proposed value decomposition weakens the paper's contribution.
- The limitations of the approach are not discussed, and the potential impact of grouping restrictions on policy space is not addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by rephrasing abstract statements and providing more straightforward explanations of the grouping criteria. Additionally, we suggest including a theoretical analysis of the value decomposition's representation capacity to strengthen the paper's contribution. It would also be beneficial to discuss the limitations of the proposed method and explore scenarios where grouping may be less effective. Finally, consider addressing the questions raised regarding the implications of grouping and the potential for inter-agent communication in heterogeneous teams.
