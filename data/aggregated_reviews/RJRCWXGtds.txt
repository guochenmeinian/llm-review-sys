### Key Points
This paper presents a study of regional semantic variation in Quebec English, particularly focusing on the influence of French on English in Montreal compared to Vancouver and Toronto. The authors propose a comparison of static and contextualized models for measuring semantic shifts, utilizing a dataset of 40 known semantic shifts and Twitter corpora. The study integrates sociolinguistic interviews to assess acceptability ratings of Montreal English variants, revealing that while some computational measures align with human judgments, discrepancies exist. The paper aims to provide insights into the validity of computational methodologies in sociolinguistic research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a novel application of language models to synchronic variation, contributing to underrepresented areas of research.
- It is well-grounded in regional variation literature and presents a carefully designed dataset of speaker judgments.
- The qualitative analysis complements computational findings, enhancing the study's robustness.

Weaknesses:
- The core reasoning behind the experiments and the expected outcomes from the models is unclear, making it difficult to follow the analysis.
- The small scale of the qualitative analysis, with only 15 participants from Montreal, limits the robustness of claims made.
- The use of Twitter data may confound semantic shifts with code-switching, potentially affecting the validity of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the core research questions and the expected outcomes from the models to enhance understanding. Additionally, expanding the qualitative analysis to include a larger and more diverse participant pool would strengthen the claims made. It would also be beneficial to address the potential confounding effects of using written text from Twitter, possibly by considering spoken language data. Finally, we suggest including examples of the 40 words analyzed and providing clearer definitions of "contact meanings" to enhance reader comprehension.
