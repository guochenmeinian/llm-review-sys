Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive approach to machine unlearning by unifying previous gradient-based methods through three components: weighted forgetting gradient ascent, remaining gradient descent, and a weight saliency matrix. The authors derive the steepest descent direction on a remain-preserved manifold and introduce a fast-slow weight method to approximate Hessian-modulated updates. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through experiments in both image classification and generation tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The problem addressed is crucial for enhancing the trustworthiness and privacy of machine learning models.
2. The paper provides a rigorous mathematical framework that integrates previous unlearning methods and details the proposed approach.
3. The innovative algorithm for overcoming the computational burden of inverse Hessian calculation is noteworthy.
4. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over existing baselines.
5. The paper is well-structured and accessible, with clear illustrative figures.

Weaknesses:
1. The focus is solely on computer vision (CV) unlearning, lacking results from other domains such as NLP or audio.
2. The proposed method does not perform optimally in aligning "forget" and "test" set results, particularly on TinyImageNet.
3. Limited experimentation with only ResNet18 for classification and DDPM for generation raises concerns about the generalizability of the claims.
4. The paper lacks sufficient ablation studies to clarify the impact of the proposed components on unlearning effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the scope of their experiments by including results from other tasks, such as NLP and audio, to support the claim of a unified approach for all CV unlearning tasks. Additionally, addressing the performance metric concerning the closeness of "forget" and "test" set results could enhance the evaluation of their method. We suggest incorporating more ablation studies to elucidate the effects of the steepest descent direction and fast-slow weight method on unlearning outcomes. Lastly, clarifying the applicability of their method to other modalities beyond images would broaden the impact of their work.
