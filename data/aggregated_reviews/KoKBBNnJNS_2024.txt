### Key Points
We note that the paper presents DOR3D-Net, a novel architecture for 3D hand pose estimation that utilizes dense ordinal regression and joint regression loss. It aims to reduce computational costs and inaccuracies associated with previous methods by employing binary classifiers for depth estimation. The extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets, including HANDS2017, MSRA, NYU, and ICVL.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- It introduces innovative methods, such as a novel DOR module for depth estimation and a combination of joint and ordinal regression losses, enhancing model performance.
- The experimental validation is thorough, showcasing improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods.

**Weaknesses:**
- The paper lacks recent state-of-the-art literature in its comparisons, particularly in Table 1.
- The novelty of the approach is somewhat diminished due to similarities with existing methods in related fields.
- Limitations regarding occlusions and rapid hand movements are not adequately addressed, which is critical for real-world applications.
- The improvements reported may be minor and could fall within noise, necessitating multiple seeded runs for validation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We suggest including recent literature in Table 1 for a more comprehensive comparison. The best values in Table 5 should be highlighted in bold for clarity. We recommend clarifying how the "hand center point" is obtained in Line 322, whether through the average location of ground truth joints or an estimated center point. Additionally, a deeper exploration of the method's limitations, particularly under challenging conditions, should be included. Testing the model in real-world scenarios and integrating it with real-time video input would enhance its practical applicability. Lastly, the discussion should address the relevance of the paper to the POETS workshop theme, potentially requiring resubmission to a more suitable venue.
