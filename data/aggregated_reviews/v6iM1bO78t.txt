Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the practices and experiences of annotation on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) through a critical literature review, public comments evaluation, and a large-scale survey. The authors address open questions regarding fair payment, worker privacy, data quality, and worker incentives, ultimately providing actionable recommendations for improving data collection practices. The findings are organized around five guiding themes: task clarity, payment, privacy, response quality, and sensitive content.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper consolidates useful practices that are often known only through informal channels, making them accessible in a unified resource.
- It reports significant insights that are surprising yet beneficial for practitioners, particularly regarding payment strategies.
- The authors provide a well-structured and clearly written manuscript that is easy to follow, even for those unfamiliar with the literature.
- The inclusion of diverse sources, such as Reddit comments, enhances the paper's relevance and depth.

Weaknesses:
- The focus on MTurk may limit the applicability of findings to other platforms, although this is not a major drawback given the thoroughness of the study.
- The sample size of 207 workers may not be representative, potentially affecting the generalizability of the results.
- The paper lacks a direct link to NLP tasks, which could be seen as a limitation given the conference context.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the representation of their findings by addressing the narrow selection of literature and considering additional related terms such as norms, beliefs, customs, behaviors, and ideologies. Furthermore, clarifying how to implement their recommendations for common terminology in future work would enhance the manuscript's impact. Including references to relevant works, such as "Ghost Work" by Suri and Grey and insights from Turkopticon, would further contextualize their claims and strengthen the paper.
