Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents BAMS, an architecture for learning agent behaviors by mapping observations to actions using two Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) that operate at different time scales. BAMS enhances short-term and long-term representations through self-supervised bootstrapping objectives and introduces a novel decoder that predicts histograms to capture action distributions, aiding in long-term forecasting. The method demonstrates strong empirical performance on mobile robotics and animal behavior datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on the MABe challenge.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Clear and coherent writing, ensuring an organized structure.
- Relevant to the research community, addressing multi-time scale behavior representation.
- Innovative approach using histograms for predictions, potentially improving multi-modal behavior capture.
- Strong empirical performance on challenging benchmarks, highlighting practical applicability.

Weaknesses:
- Design choices appear arbitrary, lacking a solid theoretical foundation, which raises reliability concerns.
- Limited applicability to general cases of long-term behavior prediction, necessitating more empirical evidence for broader generalization.
- Insufficient discussion of related works on hierarchical neural network architectures, hindering understanding of the method's positioning.
- Complexity due to multiple loss functions and architecture modifications may detract from practicality and efficiency.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical foundation of their design choices to enhance reliability. Additionally, the authors should conduct further empirical evaluations across diverse datasets to establish broader applicability. It would be beneficial to include a more comprehensive discussion of related works on hierarchical architectures to clarify the positioning of BAMS. Lastly, simplifying the architecture and loss functions could enhance the method's practicality and appeal.
