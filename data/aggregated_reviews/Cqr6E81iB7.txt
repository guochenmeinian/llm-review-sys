Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies online learning of concept classes under differential privacy (DP) constraints, making progress in understanding mistake bounds primarily in realizable cases. The authors propose that: 
1. If the adversary is oblivious, PAC pure DP learnability implies online pure DP learnability.
2. If the adversary is adaptive, PAC pure DP learnability does not imply online pure DP learnability.
3. Unlike the standard online learning model, for every non-trivial hypothesis class, the mistake bound depends on \( T \).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Assuming correctness, the paper significantly advances the understanding of mistake bounds in online learning under DP constraints.
- The questions and results are interesting and relevant to NeurIPS.
- Detailed explanations of proof techniques enhance clarity.

Weaknesses:
- The complexity of multiple settings (DP/non-DP, oblivious/adaptive, approximate/pure) makes it challenging to digest results and identify gaps; a figure/meta-theorem summarizing these relationships would improve presentation.
- Clarity on the tightness of results is lacking; it would be beneficial to state the best-known lower bound immediately after proving a lower bound.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors define \( \epsilon \) before line 84, where it is first mentioned.
2. If the intent of the sentence in line 190 is to convey that "our result reveals that, against oblivious adversaries, pure private online learnability is equivalent to pure private offline learnability in both realizable and agnostic settings," we suggest clarifying this statement.
3. The paragraph starting at line 192 is unclear; we recommend either removing it or relocating it to a more appropriate section.
4. It could be beneficial to include a figure illustrating the separations between the various settings discussed (DP/non-DP, oblivious/adaptive, approximate/pure).
5. We suggest addressing typos, such as changing "not known by" to "unknown to" (line 146), "an lower" to "a lower" (line 264), and correcting "inpupt" (line 272).
