### Key Points
This paper presents a new geometric problem dataset, formalgeo7k, which includes 7,000 annotated plane geometric problems. The dataset aims to serve as a benchmark for tasks such as geometric diagram parsing and geometric problem solving (GPS). The authors propose a new representation method that enhances readability and potentially creates a consistent solver reasoning process. The paper also provides detailed comparisons between various deductive methods on this dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is large and well-annotated, addressing gaps in existing datasets and providing a unified benchmark.
- The authors use FGPS to verify the correctness of the syntax.
- The paper includes a success rate analysis versus theorem sequence length, offering valuable insights.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset primarily consists of existing easy datasets, lacking more difficult and diverse geometry problems.
- Limited technical contributions are noted, with a need for novel proving methods rather than just evaluating existing deductive engines.
- Clarity regarding the metrics used for annotations and quality control measures is insufficient, and the dataset's accessibility is not addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the metrics used for annotations by specifying the criteria and inter-annotator agreement metrics. Additionally, providing information on quality control measures would enhance the dataset's credibility. The authors should also ensure that the dataset, the FormalGeo system, and the symbolic solver FGPS are publicly available to facilitate research. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors test various models on their dataset to better motivate their work and provide insights into the performance of human solutions against formalgeo7k. Lastly, evaluating tasks such as GPS, GDP, and GRE individually against formalgeo7k would demonstrate the dataset's effectiveness more clearly.
