Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Fantasy, a text-to-image (T2I) generation model that integrates a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) based on Phi-2 for text encoding and a masked image modeling (MIM) approach for image generation. The training occurs in two stages: a generic stage for aligning the generator with frozen Phi-2 features, followed by a fine-tuning stage. The authors claim that their method achieves competitive performance in human evaluations, although the FID results indicate less convincing image quality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The fine-tuning of the LLM in the second training stage is a novel approach.
- The two-stage pre-training is a standard practice that enhances accessibility.
- The model's size allows for reasonable training times.

Weaknesses:
- The FID scores are not competitive, and the generated images lack detail and realism, potentially affecting their ranking in visual appeal.
- The methodology lacks clarity in some aspects, and the overall coherence could be improved.
- The semantic accuracy of generated images is not fully demonstrated, particularly in handling complex prompts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology and enhance the demonstration of the model's semantic accuracy, particularly with prompts involving multiple entities or detailed descriptions. Additionally, we suggest providing a consistent benchmark for image quality in Figure 1 and including comparison experiments using CLIP or T5 to justify the use of Phi-2. Finally, addressing the limitations in image detail and exploring the scalability of the model would strengthen the paper's contributions.
