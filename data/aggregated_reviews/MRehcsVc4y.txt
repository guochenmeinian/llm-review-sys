Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents RSVP, a two-stage pretraining and fine-tuning framework aimed at enhancing intent detection in conversational systems by utilizing agent responses through response retrieval and response generation tasks. The authors propose that leveraging these tasks can improve the accuracy of intent recognition. Experimental results on the KKday and TwACS datasets indicate that RSVP outperforms baseline methods, although the improvements are described as marginal compared to existing works.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is intuitive and demonstrates solid performance, supported by comprehensive experiments and evaluations.
- The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, making it accessible to readers.
- It addresses a practical task in real-world conversational systems and reports state-of-the-art results.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the approach is limited, with contributions appearing incremental compared to previous studies.
- The reliance on only two datasets, particularly the small size of one, raises concerns about the robustness of the findings.
- The assumption that generating an accurate response equates to understanding intent is questioned, as it may not hold true in all customer service scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of the paper by addressing the incremental nature of their contributions and providing a more thorough discussion on the implications of their assumptions regarding intent detection. Additionally, we suggest incorporating results from more benchmark dialogue datasets, such as SGD and MultiWoZ, to strengthen the argument for the effectiveness of their approach. Furthermore, clarifying the use of pre-trained BERT as the decoder and providing more details on the KKday dataset would enhance the reproducibility of the results.
