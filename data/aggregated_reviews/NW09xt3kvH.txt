### Key Points
This paper presents HutCRS, a conversational recommender system that utilizes a hierarchical interest tree to model user preferences. The framework includes hierarchical user state tracking and hierarchical-interest policy learning, enhancing the system's ability to understand user needs through classified attribute-level feedback. The authors evaluate HutCRS through extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, demonstrating improvements over existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a hierarchical interest tree and the classification of attribute feedback as special positive/negative enhances the system's understanding of user preferences.
- The proposed method allows for multi-aspect feedback, making it more user-friendly compared to traditional systems.
- Extensive evaluations on multiple datasets provide compelling evidence of the framework's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- Concerns about the time complexity of constructing and pruning the hierarchical interest tree, necessitating a detailed analysis for efficiency validation.
- The empirical evaluations do not convincingly outperform baseline methods on certain datasets, raising questions about the proposed method's practicality.
- The necessity of certain components in the ablation study is not well justified, and the connection between the proposed method and challenges outlined in the introduction lacks clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including a detailed analysis of the time complexity of the hierarchical interest tree construction and pruning process. Additionally, the authors should emphasize the advancements of their approach over existing methods, particularly in relation to [1]. Providing success rate data at each conversation turn would enhance understanding of the framework's performance. Furthermore, conducting a t-test to verify the model's effectiveness and addressing the complexity of the method through open-source code would be beneficial. Lastly, efforts to build real datasets for evaluation would strengthen the research.
