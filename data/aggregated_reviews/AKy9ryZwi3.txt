### Key Points
This paper investigates the use of LLMs for automating spreadsheet manipulations, introducing SheetAgent, which comprises three collaborative modules: Planner, Informer, and Retriever. Additionally, the authors present SheetRM, a benchmark designed for complex spreadsheet manipulations. The experimental evaluation supports the claim that SheetAgent significantly improves upon state-of-the-art methods. The authors intend to make the dataset and source code publicly available.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposal of SheetAgent addresses a critical gap in automating complex spreadsheet tasks, representing a significant contribution to AI and information systems.
2. The work is highly relevant to professionals managing extensive data, indicating substantial practical impact.
3. The integration of the three modules within SheetAgent offers a promising technical solution to spreadsheet complexities.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a detailed discussion on the real-world deployment of SheetAgent, including limitations and scalability challenges.
2. The error analysis is superficial; a deeper examination of common error types and mitigation strategies is needed.
3. While the introduction of the SheetRM benchmark is notable, its comparison with existing benchmarks regarding complexity and coverage is unclear.
4. Ethical considerations related to job displacement and data privacy are not addressed, which would enhance the paper's comprehensiveness.
5. The paper does not discuss SheetAgent's performance in large-scale, long-term scenarios, which would be valuable for potential users.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on SheetAgent's real-world application, including limitations and scalability challenges. A more thorough error analysis should be included, focusing on common error types and potential mitigation strategies. We suggest providing a detailed comparative analysis of the SheetRM benchmark against existing benchmarks. Additionally, addressing ethical considerations related to job displacement and data privacy would enhance the paper's depth. Finally, insights into SheetAgent's long-term performance in large-scale scenarios would be beneficial for users considering its sustained adoption.
