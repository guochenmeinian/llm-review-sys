### Key Points
This paper presents a novel dialogue summarization dataset in French, focusing on political debates. The dataset includes human-transcribed dialogues segmented into sub-debates, annotated with both abstractive and extractive summaries, as well as alignment annotations termed "abstractive communities." The authors benchmark several summarization models against this dataset, providing a valuable resource for the research community.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The dataset is a significant contribution, offering human-annotated summaries that can enhance dialogue summarization research in French.  
- Baseline experiments demonstrate the capabilities of existing summarization models, providing insights into their performance on this dataset.  

Weaknesses:  
- The dataset's size is relatively small, consisting of only 18 debates and 138 sub-debates, which may limit its generalizability.  
- The annotation process lacks clarity, including details on the number of annotators and the criteria for scoring summaries, which raises concerns about potential biases.  
- The comparability of model performance is questionable due to varying truncation strategies in the input transcripts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the annotation process by detailing the number of annotators involved and the criteria used for scoring summaries. Additionally, it would be beneficial to address the ethical concerns regarding the content use-policies of the scraped data, explicitly stating the allowed usage of the dataset. We also suggest providing a discussion on the research gaps addressed by the dataset and clarifying the methodology behind the alignment annotations. Finally, including examples of hallucinations and ironies, along with their implications, could enhance the paper's impact.
