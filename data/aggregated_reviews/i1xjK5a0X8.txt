Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel self-supervised learning method called PCP-MAE for point cloud understanding, which emphasizes predicting the positional embeddings of masked regions' centers rather than directly providing their coordinates. The authors argue that this approach encourages richer semantic representation learning, leading to improved performance on downstream tasks like point cloud classification. The study highlights the introduction of the Point Center Masking (PCM) technique, asserting that PCP-MAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in certain benchmarks while being independent from pre-trained models and more efficient than existing methods like ReCon. The authors claim that their method is not merely an incremental improvement over Point-MAE but offers significant advantages, including scalability with single-modal data and reduced computational complexity. The paper also demonstrates a clear distinction between 2-D and 3-D data in mask-based autoencoding, contributing valuable knowledge to the field.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The observation regarding the significance of center predictions in point cloud reconstruction is insightful and well-motivated.
2. The authors provide a clear rationale for the PCP-MAE method, highlighting its novelty and potential impact on the field.
3. The proposed method is cost-effective and shows strong empirical performance across various benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results without relying on complex pre-trained models or paired data.
4. The authors have made their training logs available, promoting transparency and reproducibility.
5. The writing is generally clear, and the experiments are comprehensive.

Weaknesses:
1. The abstract lacks clarity and specificity regarding metrics, which could be improved for better logical flow.
2. Some reviewers express skepticism regarding the claimed improvements, suggesting that they may stem from augmentation tricks rather than the method itself.
3. Concerns arise regarding the actual effectiveness of the center point prediction method, as comparisons with previous methods may not be fair due to differing data augmentation strategies.
4. The performance of PCP-MAE on certain datasets, such as S3DIS, does not show significant improvement over existing methods, raising concerns about its generality.
5. The improvements over existing methods, particularly Point-FEMAE, appear marginal and may not meet the contribution standards for NeurIPS.
6. There are discrepancies in reported results, leading to questions about the reproducibility of the findings.
7. The paper lacks sufficient visualizations and explanations, particularly regarding the "stop gradient" operation and the relationship between the figures and equations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the abstract to enhance its clarity and specificity regarding performance metrics. Additionally, we encourage the authors to discuss the limitations of their approach more thoroughly. It would be beneficial to conduct a fair comparison of the center point prediction method against previous methods using identical data augmentation techniques. Furthermore, we suggest providing additional visualizations and detailed explanations, especially regarding the "stop gradient" operation and the methodology behind the results presented in the tables. We also recommend conducting additional experiments on diverse datasets, including ScanNet and S3DIS, to better demonstrate the generalizability of their approach. Additionally, rigorously analyzing the impact of their method in conjunction with other techniques would substantiate their claims of superiority over existing methods. Addressing the concerns regarding the reliance on augmentation tricks would further strengthen their argument for the effectiveness of PCP-MAE.
