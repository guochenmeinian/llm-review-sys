Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies the non-stationary multi-armed dueling bandit problem under the SST (strong stochastic transitivity) and STI (stochastic triangle inequality) conditions. The authors demonstrate that both SST and STI are necessary for achieving sub-linear regret, presenting a new adaptive algorithm that achieves a regret of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\tilde{L}KT})$, improving upon the previous bound of $\tilde{O}(K\sqrt{\tilde{L}T})$. The paper also discusses the implications of violating these conditions, showing that linear regret is unavoidable in such cases.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well-written and presents a novel algorithm that effectively addresses the non-stationary dueling bandits problem. The theoretical results, including the hardness of achieving dynamic regret without SST and STI, are significant contributions. The explanations of the algorithm's framework and the analysis of previous works are informative and enhance the understanding of the topic.

Weaknesses:  
The paper lacks clarity regarding the minimax lower bound under SST+STI conditions, leaving the optimality of the upper bound unsubstantiated. Additionally, it does not include empirical evaluations or experiments to validate the proposed methods, which would strengthen the findings. Some sections contain unclear explanations, particularly regarding the innovation in theoretical analysis compared to existing techniques.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the minimax lower bound under SST+STI conditions to support their claims about the optimality of the upper bound. Additionally, we suggest that the authors conduct empirical evaluations to validate the performance of their algorithms across various datasets and scenarios. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide a clearer explanation of the innovations in their theoretical analysis, particularly in relation to existing techniques.
