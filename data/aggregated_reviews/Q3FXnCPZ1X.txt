Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel spectral clustering algorithm that utilizes the power method to efficiently approximate a random projection of the spectral embedding, rather than computing the k leading eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. The authors demonstrate that this approach significantly reduces computational time, especially for large k, while providing theoretical guarantees on cluster recovery under balanced cluster settings. The algorithm is evaluated through experiments on synthetic data and medium-sized real-world datasets, showing improved speed compared to classical methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed algorithm is simple to understand and implement, with a solid theoretical foundation.
- The running time is significantly faster than previous methods, particularly for large datasets.
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it accessible.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental evaluation is limited, primarily comparing only to classical eigendecomposition-based methods, without considering a broader range of existing algorithms.
- The theoretical guarantees are restricted to balanced clusters, which may not hold in many practical applications.
- The paper lacks clarity in certain definitions and does not adequately address the limitations of the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including comparisons with a wider array of existing fast spectral clustering algorithms, such as those by Choromanska et al. and Yan et al. Additionally, we suggest that the authors address the balancedness assumption in their theoretical analysis and provide empirical results on unbalanced datasets to enhance the applicability of their method. Clarifying definitions, particularly regarding the inner product and the volume, is also essential for better understanding. Finally, a discussion on the limitations of the method should be included to provide a more comprehensive view of its applicability.
