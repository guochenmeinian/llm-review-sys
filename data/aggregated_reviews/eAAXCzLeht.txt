### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the Influence Maximization with Priority (IMP) problem, proposing two novel algorithms: the Select-And-Replace (SAR) framework for the non-adaptive setting and the Adaptive-Alternation-Selection (AAS) framework for the adaptive setting. The authors identify limitations in existing solutions and demonstrate that their frameworks achieve better approximation ratios and larger influence spreads on real-world datasets, supported by rigorous theoretical analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The algorithms set a new state-of-the-art for the IMP problem, addressing both non-adaptive and adaptive settings.
- Theoretical analyses are robust, providing strong support for the proposed approaches.
- Extensive experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of the methods across diverse datasets.
- The paper is well-structured and accessible.

Weaknesses:
- The IMP problem lacks novelty as it has been previously explored, leading to concerns about originality.
- The paper does not provide a comprehensive review of related work, particularly regarding the classification of non-adaptive and adaptive IM.
- Experimental validation is less convincing due to reliance on a single method for comparison.
- The relationships between the proposed frameworks and existing IM solutions require clearer explanation.
- Challenges in parameter selection for the AAS framework in adaptive settings are not adequately discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review to include a comprehensive overview of related work, particularly regarding the classification of non-adaptive and adaptive IM. Additionally, we suggest providing a clearer explanation of the necessity of the set \( R_2 \) and the reasoning behind processing seeds in reverse order. Clarifying whether \( k_1^b \) from SAR is consistently larger than \( k_b^a \) from IGS due to theoretical reasons or empirical observations would enhance understanding. Furthermore, discussing the limitations of the proposed frameworks and addressing the challenges in parameter selection for the AAS framework would strengthen the paper. Lastly, we encourage the authors to share their implementation and experimental scripts in a public repository to enhance reproducibility.
