Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the AdANNS framework, which utilizes Matryoshka Representations for approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS). The authors demonstrate how these representations can optimize indexing costs and enhance test-time inference for semantic search applications. The framework is instantiated using two main components: AdANNS-IVF and AdANNS-OPQ, achieving a state-of-the-art accuracy-compute trade-off through extensive experiments on datasets with up to 21 million items.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a clever application of Matryoshka Representations that allows for lower-dimensional representations without additional computation.
- Extensive experiments and analysis support the proposed approach, showcasing impressive results.
- The focus on end-to-end performance, particularly top-1 accuracy, is a notable contribution that could inspire further research in the field.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on a limited number of datasets (only ImagNet-1K and NQ) may restrict the generalizability of the findings.
- The paper lacks comprehensive theoretical analysis comparing AdANNS with its baseline counterparts and presents marginal gains in accuracy, which may not convincingly favor Matryoshka Representations.
- The presence of numerous hyper-parameters could hinder widespread adoption, and the adaptive methods are limited to Matryoshka Representations, potentially restricting their applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation to minimize the need for readers to oscillate between the appendix and the main text. Additionally, the authors should provide more details on hyper-parameter tuning, including a set of default hyper-parameters for new applications or datasets. It would also be beneficial to include a practical guide for selecting hyper-parameters to facilitate wider adoption of the proposed methods. Lastly, we suggest reconsidering the emphasis on web-scale applicability unless supported by larger-scale experiments.
