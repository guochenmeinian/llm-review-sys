### Key Points
This paper presents a straightforward method for attacking toxicity detection models by appending positive words or phrases to hateful messages. The authors propose that this approach can significantly challenge the effectiveness of neural network-based toxicity detectors, with experiments conducted across multiple languages. The findings indicate that most models can be fooled within nine words, and the method has implications for multilingual models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The proposed method is simple yet effective, demonstrating a potent attacking impact on toxicity detectors.  
2. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, making the content accessible.  
3. The introduction of the "To Each His Own" attack concept highlights the separation of messages intended for humans versus algorithms.

Weaknesses:  
1. The toxicity detectors used in the study are self-constructed and lack robustness, weakening the study's conclusions. Testing more established models like the Perspective API would enhance credibility.  
2. The observation that toxicity scores decrease with more appended positive words may not be novel and lacks deeper exploration.  
3. The proposed method does not convincingly demonstrate that multilingual models are more susceptible than monolingual models.  
4. The attack can be easily recognized by humans, limiting its practical application, and the defense strategy employed is standard and lacks novelty.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the robustness of their findings by testing established toxicity detectors instead of self-constructed models. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explore the implications of their findings in greater depth to clarify their novelty. It would also be beneficial to provide a more thorough justification of the attack model's effectiveness and consider incorporating additional attack models to enhance the study's contributions. Finally, addressing the ease with which the attack can be identified by humans would strengthen the practical relevance of the work.
