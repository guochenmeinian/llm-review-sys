Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents FilterNet, a novel neural network architecture for time series forecasting that utilizes learnable frequency filters inspired by signal processing techniques. The authors propose two types of filters: a plain shaping filter for signal filtering and temporal modeling, and a contextual shaping filter that assesses filtered frequencies for compatibility with input signals. Extensive experiments on eight benchmarks demonstrate that FilterNet effectively manages high-frequency noise and utilizes the full frequency spectrum, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper explores an innovative direction by integrating advanced signal processing techniques into time series forecasting, marking a novel contribution to the field.
2. The architecture is straightforward yet effective, with minimal redundancy compared to existing transformer models, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed filters.
3. The experiments are solid, with comprehensive evaluations across various datasets, including insightful analyses of synthetic signals.

Weaknesses:
1. The relationship and distinctions between the two filters are not clearly articulated, leaving questions about their comparative effectiveness.
2. The motivation for the chosen filters is inadequately explained, given the existence of numerous frequency filters in signal processing.
3. The performance of TexFilter on certain datasets does not rank among the best, raising concerns about its overall effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the connection and differences between the two filters to better inform readers about their respective advantages. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed motivation for the proposed filters, considering the variety of existing frequency filters. Furthermore, we suggest including a thorough analysis of TexFilter's performance in relation to other methods, particularly in cases where it does not perform well, to enhance the robustness of the findings.
