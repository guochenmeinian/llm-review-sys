Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SCAS (OOD State Correction and Action Suppression), a model-based regularization approach addressing out-of-distribution (OOD) states and actions in offline reinforcement learning (RL). The authors propose a method that aligns OOD states towards high-value in-distribution (ID) states, thereby mitigating the overestimation of OOD actions. The SCAS algorithm operates in two stages: training a transition model and training a policy with a model-based regularizer. Empirical results indicate that SCAS performs comparably on standard benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in refining offline RL algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper establishes a theoretical connection between OOD state correction and OOD action suppression, showing that correcting OOD states implicitly suppresses OOD actions.
- SCAS demonstrates robustness to hyperparameter variations, which is crucial in offline RL applications.
- The evaluation methodology includes rigorous testing on standard benchmarks, and implementation code is provided for reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- The authors did not cite relevant works from the DICE literature, which are closely related to the objectives of SCAS.
- The choice of $\exp(\alpha V(s))$ as the empirical normalizer appears arbitrary and lacks justification.
- The experimental analysis is limited to deterministic MuJoCo environments, raising concerns about performance in stochastic environments.
- The paper lacks comparisons with key recent advancements in offline RL, such as DW and EDAC, which could contextualize the contributions of SCAS.
- Several experimental details are missing, including the methodology for embedding functions and the rationale behind noise addition during testing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by incorporating relevant works from the DICE literature to provide a comprehensive context for SCAS. Additionally, providing a rationale for the choice of $\exp(\alpha V(s))$ would enhance the clarity of the methodology. The authors should consider evaluating SCAS in stochastic environments to assess its robustness further. We also suggest including comparisons with recent offline RL approaches like DW and EDAC to strengthen the manuscript's contributions. Finally, clarifying experimental details, such as the embedding function and noise addition methodology, would improve the paper's transparency and reproducibility.
