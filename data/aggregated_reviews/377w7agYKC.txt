### Key Points
This paper presents a method for coordination structure analysis based on BERT, formulating conjunct boundary detection as a sequence labeling problem. The authors propose a two-step solution for identifying conjunctive phrases, which includes a cascade of processes that outperform parsing-based baselines on multiple datasets, including OntoNotes and the GENIA biology dataset. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates efficiency in recognizing coordination structures, which is beneficial for downstream NLP tasks like Open Information Extraction.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Significant accuracy improvement on the GENIA dataset.
- Clear architecture and informative error analysis.
- The model avoids issues associated with existing parsers and achieves superior efficiency.

Weaknesses:
- The method's description lacks thoroughness, particularly regarding handling conjuncts of paired span coordinators and the "respectively" construction.
- The task definition is not straightforward, and the classification of "simple" and "complex" coordinators is unclear.
- Parameter settings are underspecified, and reproducibility may be challenging due to variations in interpretation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method's description, particularly in handling conjuncts and the "respectively" construction, to avoid reliance on the appendix. Additionally, the authors should provide a clearer definition of the coordination task and examples to illustrate it. We suggest elaborating on the runtimes reported in Table 1, specifying the measurement units, and ensuring that the notation in the technical core is introduced more gradually. Lastly, including more detailed results from the ablation study could clarify the advantages of the two-step model.
