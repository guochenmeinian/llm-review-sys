Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to enhance the robustness of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms against spurious correlations by introducing a robust-state confounded (RSC-) MDP framework. The authors aim to address the challenges posed by unobserved confounders that affect decision-making in RL, proposing a heuristic method to approximate the effects of these confounders through perturbations in state dimensions. Additionally, the authors introduce a causal graph model aimed at improving compositional generalization in RL, where the model's predictions for perturbed states rely on a sparsity-inducing bias. They provide empirical evidence of the model's performance across various environments, highlighting the role of sparsity in enhancing robustness against spurious correlations. The paper also introduces a new baseline, 'state dropout', which utilizes a dropping-out mechanism without the VQ-VAE component, demonstrating effectiveness in addressing distraction spurious correlations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with a clear motivation and organized problem setup.
- It provides a theoretical justification for the proposed robustness, which is claimed to be more accurate than traditional robust MDPs.
- The experimental design is novel, effectively assessing the impact of spurious correlations in RL.
- The addition of new baselines and clarifications has strengthened the paper's contributions and clarity.
- Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in addressing distraction spurious correlations.

Weaknesses:
- The connection between the MDP formulations and the empirical algorithm is unclear, suggesting they may have been developed independently.
- The term "semantic uncertainty" lacks precision and could be replaced with "uncertainty set" for clarity.
- The training environments appear to maintain perfect spurious correlations, raising questions about the causal model's ability to generate diverse state transitions.
- The lack of theoretical proof for the causal graph's ability to generalize predictions for perturbed states raises questions about its robustness.
- The relationship between sparsity and compositional generalization remains unclear, particularly regarding the role of spurious correlations.
- The related work section is limited, failing to adequately address broader literature on spurious correlations in RL.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the connection between the MDP formulations and the empirical algorithm to demonstrate how the algorithm addresses the robust SC-MDP. Additionally, we suggest removing or redefining "semantic uncertainty" to enhance precision. It would also be beneficial to clarify the training and testing environment distributions and the expected outcomes of the causal model. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to expand the related work section to include a broader range of literature addressing spurious correlations in RL. Lastly, we recommend that the authors improve the theoretical foundation of their model by providing empirical analyses that illustrate the causal graph's predictive accuracy compared to dense neural networks, and clarify the mechanism by which sparsity contributes to compositional generalization, potentially by exploring the adaptive nature of sparsity in their model. Including training curves for the results in Table 1 would also provide insights into the convergence behavior of the proposed method compared to others.
