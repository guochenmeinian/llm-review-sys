Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents **NCTM**, a novel transmission mechanism for short video streaming that utilizes XOR-coded data and client-side caching. The system is designed to efficiently encode multiple videos requested by users, leveraging cached videos to reduce bandwidth demand and rebuffering events. The authors introduce the Minimum Clique Coverage algorithm to optimize video encoding and a Recommendation Reorder algorithm to enhance transmission opportunities. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that **NCTM** outperforms traditional CDN and edge caching methods in various bandwidth conditions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and organized, contributing significant knowledge to the field.
- The innovative application of mathematical concepts to real-world video streaming challenges is commendable.
- The evaluation is thorough, utilizing appropriate metrics and datasets to support findings.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for using XOR codes in short video streaming is insufficiently addressed, particularly regarding the performance implications tied to video content characteristics.
- The system's reliance on synchronized user requests raises scalability concerns, as does the lack of clarity on multicast implementation.
- The evaluation primarily focuses on bandwidth reduction without adequately addressing hit rates or comparing against stronger caching baselines.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the research gap in the related works section to strengthen the motivation for their approach. Additionally, the paper should provide more information on the performance of XOR codes concerning video content characteristics. Clarifying how **NCTM** handles scenarios with new videos or first-time user requests is essential. We also suggest including a measurement study to demonstrate the feasibility of user synchronization and collaboration. Finally, the evaluation should compare **NCTM** against stronger caching algorithms and provide detailed insights into the memory overhead and computational complexity associated with the user cache table.
