Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a multimodal framework that infuses language guidance into knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA) models, leveraging rationales, image captions, and scene graphs. The authors propose that this language guidance enhances the performance of CLIP by 7.6% and BLIP-2 by 4.8% on the A-OKVQA dataset, demonstrating that VQA accuracy can improve with additional contextual information.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of language guidance as a means to enhance VQA performance is a convincing approach.
- Experimental results indicate that the additional context improves VQA accuracy, supported by thorough ablation studies.

Weaknesses:
- The technical novelty is unclear, as the approach appears to supplement existing techniques rather than introduce a fundamentally new concept.
- The experimental evaluation is limited to only two baselines (CLIP and BLIP-2) and does not compare with state-of-the-art models or include diverse datasets, restricting the generalizability of the findings.
- The reliance on rationale supervision raises concerns about scalability and applicability to other VQA datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the technical novelty by clarifying how their approach differs from existing methods. Additionally, expanding the experimental evaluation to include more baseline models (e.g., OFA, Flamingo) and datasets (e.g., Visual 7W) would strengthen the claims. Providing visualization results and qualitative analyses of the guidance generated by BLIP-2 would enhance the paper's depth. Furthermore, exploring the effectiveness of rationale generation without training on the OK-VQA dataset could yield valuable insights. Lastly, a more detailed discussion on the choice of CLIP for generating guidance and its limitations in capturing fine image details is necessary.
