### Key Points
This paper presents a self-consistency approach to guide LLMs decoding, demonstrating significant performance improvements across various language tasks. The authors propose enhancing this method's efficiency by introducing early stopping through dynamic voting, which generates subsamples and halts once a desired consistency level is achieved. They compare confidence-based and percentage-based stopping criteria, showing that their approach maintains performance while improving efficiency in the number of generations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach to improve efficiency is interesting and well-articulated.
- The paper is well-written with detailed explanations and comprehensive evaluations across multiple tasks.
- The innovative use of early exit strategies in Dynamic Voting is a valuable contribution to the field.

Weaknesses:
- The improvement over existing methods is minor, raising questions about the practical benefits in terms of time or memory consumption.
- Some methodological details are unclear, particularly regarding the generation of different paths and ensuring their diversity.
- The main experiment table is confusing, hindering the understanding of empirical performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity in the main experiment table by explicitly stating which specific baseline numbers are being compared and addressing the confusion regarding bolded and underlined numbers. Additionally, it would be beneficial to explore other stopping criteria beyond simple consistency-based voting. To enhance reproducibility, please consider using open-sourced LLMs and clarify which version of GPT-3.5 is utilized. It would also be interesting to compare the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 under the same budget constraints to assess the practical applicability of the proposed technique.
