Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel image protection approach called "Geometry Cloak" to prevent unauthorized 3D model generation from copyrighted images using single-view 3D reconstruction methods like Triplane Gaussian Splatting (TGS). The Geometry Cloak embeds invisible geometry perturbations into images, which are revealed as a customized message when TGS attempts 3D reconstructions, thus acting as a watermark for copyright assertion. The authors propose that their method can generalize to other 3D reconstruction techniques, although the current focus is primarily on TGS.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation of this paper is well-stated and significant, addressing the important issue of copyright protection in 3D reconstruction.
2. The paper is well-written and presents a novel concept of using geometric perturbations for image protection.
3. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across different datasets and perturbation strategies.

Weaknesses:
1. The scope of the work is limited to TGS-based reconstruction, raising concerns about its practical applicability to other reconstruction methods.
2. The paper lacks quantitative metrics comparing the similarity between protected and unprotected images, such as PSNR, which would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
3. The generalization capabilities of the method to other models like LRM and LGM are not sufficiently demonstrated, and the authors do not adequately discuss how the method can be adapted for these models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their method by conducting experiments on other single-image 3D reconstruction techniques, such as LRM and Gamba. Additionally, incorporating quantitative metrics like PSNR to evaluate the impact on image quality would enhance the paper's rigor. It would also be beneficial to explore the robustness of the proposed method against various attacks, such as Gaussian noise and JPEG compression. Finally, clarifying the optimization process for generating geometry cloaks and providing details on how to adapt the method for other 3D reconstruction models would strengthen the paper.
