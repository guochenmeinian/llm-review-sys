Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an algorithm for the LQG problem involving semi-adversarial perturbations, achieving optimal regret of $O(\sqrt{T})$, an improvement over the previous $O(T^{3/4})$ bound. The authors address both known and unknown system dynamics and propose a new scheme for bandit convex optimization with memory. The introduction is accessible to non-specialists, although the paper remains highly theoretical and specialized. Additionally, the authors provide a theoretical contribution aimed at closing a gap in the existing literature and have responded to reviewer concerns, although the inclusion of additional simulations is suggested to enhance the robustness of their findings. The authors reference Gradu et al. as a basis for their experimental suite, indicating a focus on practical applications of control.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper clearly identifies a gap in the literature and addresses an important problem in control and online learning.
- The algorithm's motivation and key steps are well explained, and the bounds presented are tight.
- The overall structure of the paper is organized, with a good literature review.
- The authors effectively addressed reviewer concerns in their response.
- The theoretical contribution is significant in closing a gap in the literature.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation lacks clarity, particularly in the algorithms, which are only provided as pseudo-code without sufficient explanation.
- The theoretical nature of the work limits its accessibility to a broader audience, and the relevance to mainstream AI research is not adequately discussed.
- The paper lacks detailed simulations and explanations for the results, making it difficult to verify the proposed improvements.
- The reliance on a single reference to support the relevance of results is insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation, especially in explaining Algorithms 1, 2, and 3, rather than just providing pseudo-code. Additionally, we suggest including a more organized simulation section in the main paper, detailing the simulation setups and results to enhance verification of the findings. It would also be beneficial to elaborate on the novelty of the exploration scheme enabled by the gradient estimator and provide more context for Assumption 3.3. Finally, addressing the relationship between semi-adversarial disturbances and control effectiveness could clarify the motivation for this approach. We also recommend incorporating additional simulations to elucidate further properties of their work and including the mentioned reference and its context in the paper revision to benefit readers.
