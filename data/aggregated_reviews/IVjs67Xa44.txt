Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the bandit learning problem in matching markets, emphasizing that regret minimization does not necessarily lead to market stability. The authors explore the sample complexity needed to achieve stable matchings and propose two algorithms: the Uniform Sampling DA algorithm and the Arm Elimination DA algorithm, providing guarantees based on envy-set size. The study also examines stability in matching problems with learned preferences, presenting bounds on the probability of unstable matchings and sample complexity results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a significant issue in bandit learning literature, highlighting the misalignment between regret minimization and stable matching objectives.
2. It delves into sample complexity, specifically analyzing envy-set size, enhancing understanding of the learning task's complexity.
3. The combination of online learning with stability in matchings is novel, and the bounds provided are relevant and intuitive.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a comparison with existing works on stable regret, making it challenging to assess improvements in sample complexity and stable matchings.
2. The technical novelty is limited, as the proposed algorithms are similar to established methods, with the Arm Elimination DA algorithm resembling the ODA algorithm in previous studies.
3. The motivation for the problem could be better developed, and the empirical results may not convincingly demonstrate the algorithm's superiority in practical applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison of their results with existing literature on stable regret to clarify their contributions to sample complexity and stable matchings. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the theoretical analysis by providing lower bounds to assess the tightness of their results. The authors should also consider expanding the motivation for their problem setting and include more diverse utility distributions in their simulations to strengthen the empirical findings. Finally, addressing the fairness aspects of the matching process and illustrating the benefits of their approach over traditional methods that elicit all preferences would be beneficial.
