Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new algorithm, Greedy Rejection Coding (GRC), for Relative Entropy Coding (REC), addressing challenges in existing REC algorithms such as slow runtimes and restrictive assumptions. The authors propose a method that generalizes to arbitrary probability spaces and partitioning schemes, demonstrating that GRC terminates almost surely and produces unbiased samples. The effectiveness of GRC is validated through experiments on the MNIST dataset, showing improvements in compression efficiency compared to previous methods like A* coding.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed methods achieve optimal runtime and expected codelength, verified through practical experiments.
- The paper effectively discusses comparisons to previous results, technical novelties, and limitations.
- The theoretical results indicate that GRC is accurate and terminates successfully under general assumptions.

Weaknesses:
- The lack of a sketch proof limits understanding of the proposed coding scheme's workings and assumptions.
- The dependency on the cumulative distribution function (CDF) may restrict practical applicability.
- The paper does not provide a detailed computational efficiency analysis, leaving unclear how the algorithm performs under varying computational resources.
- The empirical validation is limited to synthetic data and one real-world dataset, raising questions about generalizability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the differences between their algorithm and prior work on A* coding. Additionally, including a sketch proof would enhance understanding of the proposed method. The authors should also comment on the complexity of integrating equation (2) with distributions beyond the Gaussian. Furthermore, addressing the implications of assumptions 2 and 3 would clarify their significance. Finally, providing a detailed analysis of the wall-clock runtime of the proposed methods would be beneficial.
