### Key Points
This paper presents a Bayesian causal modeling framework to analyze factors influencing climate activism on Reddit, integrating social media activity, external media coverage, and inferred user demographics. The authors investigate the causal effects of socio-demographic characteristics, media coverage, and user interactions on climate activism, contributing valuable insights to the field of computational social science.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study addresses a critical issue in understanding online climate activism, relevant to computational social science and social media studies.
- The methodology employs Bayesian Networks and Stochastic Variational Inference, effectively modeling complex causal relationships and temporal dynamics.
- Temporal segmentation into long-term and short-term periods enhances the analysis of influences on activism.
- The paper validates social psychology constructs, such as sympathy and social influence, within online contexts.

Weaknesses:
- Demographic features are inferred indirectly from subreddit participation, potentially introducing bias due to misalignment with actual user traits.
- Ethical considerations regarding the use of Reddit data and inferred demographics are not discussed, including whether IRB approval was obtained.
- Keyword searches for “climate change” and “global warming” may overlook relevant discussions using alternative terms.
- Long-term media coverage effects are underexplored compared to short-term effects, leaving gaps in understanding sustained mobilization.
- The reliance on inferred variables raises concerns about the reliability of identified causal pathways without sufficient validation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and transparency regarding the assumptions underlying their causal claims, particularly concerning unmeasured confounders. Additionally, the authors should explicitly state the causal estimands they aim to estimate and ensure that the results section aligns with these goals. Performing sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of conclusions against violations of assumptions would enhance the paper's credibility. Furthermore, we suggest expanding the related works section to include recent studies on causal modeling in social media and providing a comparative analysis of parameter learning methods. Clarifying the motivations behind hyperparameter choices, such as window sizes, and including visual representations of causal relationships in the graph would improve interpretability.
