Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the SI2E framework, which utilizes structural mutual information to enhance exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) by defining state-action representations that capture intrinsic relationships between states and actions. The authors propose a novel intrinsic reward mechanism based on value-conditional structural entropy, aimed at improving state-action coverage in high-dimensional environments. They introduce a state-action distribution graph to define value-conditional structural entropy and an intrinsic reward mechanism that encourages exploration of more promising areas in the state-action space. Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness compared to existing benchmarks, including advanced methods like Leco and DEIR in various MiniGrid tasks. The paper also discusses the generation of optimal encoding trees for state-action pairs and the implications of structural entropy in guiding exploration strategies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-motivated and presents a novel approach to intrinsic rewards using structural information principles.
- The proposed method effectively enhances exploration performance by refining state-action representations based on SMI principles.
- The organization and clarity of the presentation facilitate understanding of complex concepts.
- Comprehensive experimental evaluations across various tasks validate the framework's effectiveness and robustness, demonstrating superior performance compared to advanced baselines.
- The paper provides a comprehensive theoretical foundation for the asymptotic consistency of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- Claims regarding performance improvements over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods lack sufficient baseline comparisons, particularly in the MiniGrid experiments, and some claims may be overstated, especially concerning comparisons with Leco.
- Certain technical aspects, such as the stretch operator and the HCSE algorithm, are inadequately explained, leading to confusion.
- The related work section is short and does not adequately differentiate SI2E from existing methodologies.
- The initial clarity of responses and formatting of mathematical formulas in the rebuttal could be improved, potentially hindering understanding.
- Some recent findings may not have been adequately referenced in the submitted version.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation, particularly in lines 31-38, by explicitly connecting intrinsic rewards to entropy maximization strategies. Additionally, the authors should provide more detailed explanations of the stretch operator and the HCSE algorithm in line 144. To strengthen claims of superiority, we suggest including more SOTA baselines in the experiments, especially for MiniGrid, and revising claims about the performance of SI2E relative to other methods, particularly Leco, to avoid overstating its advantages. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to enhance the related work section to clearly articulate how SI2E innovates upon previous research. We also recommend improving the clarity of the mathematical formulations in the paper to ensure they are easily readable and comprehensible. Lastly, integrating the clarifications provided in the rebuttal into the main text and explicitly referencing specific papers by name will enhance the overall readability and coherence of the paper.
