Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents algorithms, FedBiOAcc and FedBiOAcc-Local, for federated bilevel optimization problems, addressing non-convex upper-level and strongly convex lower-level losses. The authors reformulate hyper-gradient estimation as a quadratic federated optimization problem, achieving improved communication and computation complexity bounds. The paper validates theoretical results through two real-world tasks, including data cleaning and hyper-representation learning. Additionally, the authors propose a three-level federated optimization framework that allows for alternative updates of upper-level, lower-level, and hyper-gradient estimation variables without communication, significantly reducing communication costs compared to existing algorithms like FedNest.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The reformulation of hyper-gradient estimation into a quadratic optimization problem is novel and impactful.
2. The convergence analysis for both algorithms is rigorous and applicable to heterogeneous settings.
3. The proposed algorithm exhibits a notable reduction in communication costs while maintaining optimal convergence rates.
4. The motivation for Federated Data Cleaning is clearly articulated, emphasizing the constraints of insufficient local data and privacy concerns.
5. The introduction of local lower-level problems expands the applicability of the proposed methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The contribution may not be significant due to existing literature on federated bilevel optimization.
2. Numerical comparisons lack fairness, particularly regarding communication metrics and computation costs.
3. The motivation for federated bilevel optimization could be better articulated with practical examples.
4. The paper could benefit from a clearer emphasis on its unique contributions to avoid being perceived as a mere combination of existing techniques.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind solving bilevel problems in a federated manner, potentially by providing concrete real-life applications. Additionally, we suggest presenting results in terms of total communication bytes instead of communication rounds for a more equitable comparison. The authors should also address the initialization of $u_t$ and its impact on convergence, clarify the notation used in the paper, and ensure that all relevant literature is adequately discussed to highlight the novelty of their contributions. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to include a broader discussion on practical implementation strategies and hyper-parameter selection in the appendix, along with pseudo code to illustrate the algorithm's application scenarios more prominently.
