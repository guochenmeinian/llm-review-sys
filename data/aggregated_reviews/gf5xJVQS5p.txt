Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a machine learning approach to manage cut separators in Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solvers, specifically SCIP. The authors propose a data-driven method to optimize the selection of cutting planes, demonstrating significant improvements in solve times across various benchmark datasets. Notably, the authors report a 37.5% improvement on NNV and a 12.9% improvement on MIPLIB for cutting, along with superior results in branching compared to SCIP defaults on Ecole datasets. The methodology aims to replace fixed heuristic settings with learned policies, potentially enhancing the efficiency of solving larger problem instances. The authors contextualize their results by highlighting the challenges in direct comparisons due to differences in experimental setups and performance metrics used in related works.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The empirical results are impressive, showcasing substantial speed-ups over SCIP's default configurations.
- The paper provides substantial performance metrics demonstrating the effectiveness of L2Sep compared to existing methods.
- The theoretical justification for configuration pre-selection is well-articulated, and the paper is generally well-written and accessible.
- The authors acknowledge and address the challenges in making direct comparisons, which adds depth to their analysis.
- The study identifies the critical role of separator management in improving MILP solvers, contributing to the understanding of this complex area.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the methodology is questioned, as it primarily involves toggling cut families without deeper insights into their effectiveness for specific problem instances.
- The advantages of the proposed method over previous approaches are not sufficiently demonstrated, leading to a lower acceptance score.
- The paper lacks a comprehensive discussion on which cut families were most effective, leaving a significant question unaddressed.
- The presentation suffers from an over-reliance on supplementary material, which may hinder thorough review and understanding of the main findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by integrating more specific details about the selected cut families and their performance across different problem instances. This would address the most intriguing aspect of the research. Additionally, we suggest that the authors compare their method against state-of-the-art solvers like Gurobi or CPLEX to better contextualize their findings. Furthermore, providing a more detailed explanation of the challenges in direct comparisons could enhance the clarity of their findings and address reviewer concerns more effectively. Reducing the length of the supplementary material or ensuring that critical information is included in the main paper would enhance accessibility for reviewers and readers alike. Lastly, clarifying terminology and ensuring consistent language throughout the paper would aid in comprehension, especially for those less familiar with MILP.
