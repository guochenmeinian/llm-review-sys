### Key Points
This paper presents an online allocation problem with diseconomies of scale (OSDoS), focusing on maximizing social welfare through dynamic pricing for sequentially arriving buyers. The authors propose the r-Dynamic algorithm, which achieves a tighter lower bound on the competitive ratio compared to previous mechanisms. The paper's contributions include a theoretical analysis of the problem, the development of a randomized pricing mechanism, and empirical results demonstrating the algorithm's performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses an important problem in online resource allocation and provides valuable theoretical insights.
2. The proposed r-Dynamic algorithm is innovative and demonstrates improved performance over existing algorithms in both small and large inventory settings.
3. The paper is well-organized, with clear figures and a logical flow that enhances readability.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper contains excessive formulas, which may confuse readers, and some proofs, such as those in sections 3.3 and 4.3, may be unnecessary.
2. The experimental results rely on generated data rather than real-world datasets, which could weaken the persuasiveness of the findings.
3. The optimal algorithm lacks practicality due to the complexity of solving $\alpha^*_S(k)$ and lower $k$, which does not have a closed form.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by reducing the number of formulas and reconsidering the inclusion of certain proofs. Additionally, we suggest incorporating real-world data from cloud computing systems or other web applications to validate the performance of r-Dynamic. A more in-depth discussion on the practical challenges of implementing the r-Dynamic mechanism in real-world settings would also enhance the paper's relevance. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide a clearer definition of the competitive ratio and to include a more direct comparison with previous works to highlight their contributions effectively.
