Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a systematic evaluation of format transform as augmentations in discriminative self-supervised learning (SSL). The authors propose to utilize Fourier domain augmentations, specifically applying spectral augmentations to the FFT of images before reverting to the image domain. They demonstrate that these Fourier augmentations improve performance over standard baselines like SimCLR, MoCov2, BYOL, and SimSiam, particularly in transfer and few-shot learning scenarios. The authors conclude that format transform is beneficial for downstream performance, suggesting modifications to standard augmentation pipelines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The exploration of data augmentation in the Fourier domain is innovative and relevant.
- Results in Table 5 show a significant improvement from 1% to 17% when using both image and spectral views, indicating potential for further research in spectral representations in vision SSL.
- The paper is clearly written and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The depth of the work is limited, as the concept of domain transform augmentation is not novel, and the authors do not sufficiently explain the value of these transformations.
- Some sections contain common knowledge in machine learning, making parts of the paper feel less original.
- Improvements from the proposed techniques are modest, averaging around 1%.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the significance of Fourier domain augmentations and their contributions to the field. Clarifying the relationship between the presented method and the topics of the UniReps conference would enhance the relevance of the work. Additionally, we suggest that the authors investigate the use of both spectral views in a dual-encoder setup. It would also be beneficial to provide more substantial statistical analysis of the results, including mean and standard deviation, to strengthen the findings. Finally, addressing the clarity of certain figures and tables, such as ensuring that Table 1 accurately reflects the application of FDA and correcting the unconventional notation in Line 222, would improve the overall presentation.
