Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents WildPPG, a novel dataset of continuous reflective photoplethysmography (PPG) recordings from wearable sensors at four body locations during real-world activities. The dataset includes multi-modal signals such as accelerometer, temperature, altitude data, and synchronized Lead I-based electrocardiogram (ECG) for ground-truth heart rate (HR) references, comprising 216 hours of recordings from 16 participants. The authors propose a new HR estimation method, benchmarked against multiple existing methods, addressing the limitations of controlled datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Significant Contribution: The dataset addresses limitations of existing controlled datasets, providing a valuable resource for robust HR estimation algorithms.
2. Comprehensive Data Collection: Multi-modal signals from four body locations offer a thorough view of physiological parameters.
3. Method Comparison: The paper benchmarks six heuristic and five supervised baseline HR estimation algorithms, providing extensive comparisons.
4. Public Release: The open-source dataset and code enhance transparency and encourage further research.

Weaknesses:
1. Limited Dataset Size: The number of participants (16) is relatively small for a top conference, limiting the dataset's generalizability.
2. Clarity in Results: The presentation of results lacks clarity, particularly regarding the relevance of wild acquisition and data quality.
3. Methodology Explanation: The methods used for data analysis are not well articulated, and the results section could benefit from more metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors clarify Table 1, correcting the placement of the PPG sensor and the relationship between BIDMC and MIMIC.
2. We suggest enhancing documentation by sharing detailed processes of wearable device creation and including a test sample to improve usability.
3. We recommend including cross-dataset performance results to demonstrate the generalization capability of the algorithms.
4. We encourage the authors to incorporate additional PPG datasets without ECG ground truth and explore unsupervised HR estimation methods to enhance performance.
5. We recommend expanding the dataset size and diversity to strengthen its applicability and robustness.
6. We suggest validating the PPG signal acquired with the custom-made device in a controlled environment and improving the clarity of the results section by adding more metrics, such as HR prediction accuracy.
