### Key Points
This paper presents a critical examination of the current discourse on regulating large language models (LLMs) in NLP research. It highlights the polarization between industry and academia, exacerbated by social media, which risks regulatory capture. The authors advocate for integrating regulatory studies into NLP to systematically frame discussions on risks and governance. They propose establishing a new multidisciplinary area called "Regulation and NLP" (RegNLP) to assess risks and engage policymakers transparently.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses timely regulatory concerns regarding LLMs, making it relevant to the NLP community.
- It explores a novel intersection between NLP and regulatory studies, potentially fostering beneficial discussions.
- The authors provide a thorough overview of current regulatory efforts and their shortcomings, emphasizing the need for systematic methodologies in risk assessment.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks technical depth and concrete recommendations, which may limit its applicability.
- The "RegNLP" framework is loosely defined, raising questions about its operationalization.
- The hypothetical nature of the paper may render its ideas too abstract without empirical grounding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the technical depth of the paper by including more concrete recommendations for operationalizing the RegNLP framework. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the differences between governance and regulation and elaborate on the initial steps to realize the RegNLP vision, including potential "quick wins" to demonstrate value and build momentum. Finally, we encourage the inclusion of a section discussing how expert involvement could enhance NLP regulation, particularly in applied areas like healthcare and social media.
