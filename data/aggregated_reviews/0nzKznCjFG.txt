Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on personalized frequency estimation in federated learning, proposing both private and non-private algorithms that utilize clustering and Good-Turing estimators. The authors demonstrate promising empirical results on real-world datasets, indicating improvements over existing baselines like FedAvg and MAML.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem of data heterogeneity in federated learning is crucial and well-addressed.
- The proposed algorithms are practical for large-scale datasets.
- Empirical results show consistent improvement over established baselines.

Weaknesses:
- The cluster assumption necessitates a predetermined cluster number $K$, which lacks practical guidance.
- KL divergence may not effectively handle sparse distributions, leading to assumptions in Theorem 5.1 that could be restrictive.
- The privacy guarantee in Theorem 5.2 introduces a potentially large $\log n$ factor due to the choice of $\delta$.
- Experiments are limited to $\varepsilon=15$, and there is insufficient comparison with local training and other personalized estimation methods.
- The theoretical contributions are somewhat limited, relying heavily on previous work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 4 by restructuring it to better link theoretical motivations with algorithm design. Additionally, the authors should provide a discussion on how to choose the cluster number $K$ in practice. It would be beneficial to include comparisons with local-only training and other personalized estimation methods to strengthen the analysis. Furthermore, we suggest conducting ablation studies to clarify performance dependence on variables such as the number of clusters and data samples per client. Lastly, a conclusion summarizing key findings and future work would enhance the paper's structure.
