Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel methodology for evaluating biases in text-to-image (TTI) models, revealing that these systems often exacerbate societal biases against women and Black individuals, particularly Black women, in occupational imagery. The authors conduct a comparative analysis using two datasets—"Identities" and "Professions"—generated by three TTI models (Dall·E 2, Stable Diffusion v1.4, and v2). The analysis comprises three components: clustering of generated images, text-feature extraction, and visualization. The authors provide interactive tools for exploring these biases and propose a clustering and captioning/VQA method to analyze demographic representation in generated images. Quantitative results highlight biases related to gender and ethnicity, referencing US labor demographics, and the authors discuss limitations and future work.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
- The clustering analysis is a significant innovation, allowing for relative identity comparisons without messy aggregation.
- The study addresses a timely and complex issue, given the lack of meta-information on generated images.
- The interactive tools are well-constructed and practical for further research.
- The auditing framework's components are well-motivated and executed, and the use of two distinct text-marker tools yields coherent results, acknowledging their inherent biases.
- The results are socially significant and have clear applications, contributing significantly to the field, despite some aspects not being entirely novel.
- The paper is well-written and clear, with excellent figures summarizing methods.

**Weaknesses:**
- The paper underexplores the entanglement of biases in TTI models and captioning/VQA systems, which could misrepresent the results.
- The choice of 24 clusters lacks justification, and the implications of this choice are not adequately discussed.
- Figure and table descriptions lack clarity, making results difficult to interpret.
- Insufficient details on the clustering methodology and its implications.
- The authors do not sufficiently address the subjectivity of the labeling process, potentially misleading readers about the objectivity of their findings.
- Missing results from the visualization tools hinder assessment of their utility.
- The appendix, particularly Table 18, requires improved readability, and navigation of the provided URL documentation is challenging due to minimal descriptions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the interrogation of biases in both the TTI model and the captioning/VQA system to clarify the source of observed biases. Systematic validation of the labeling model through human evaluation or real faces with self-identified demographics could strengthen the findings. Additionally, the authors should compare their methods with alternative approaches to highlight their benefits and drawbacks. We suggest avoiding language that implies objectivity in the labeling process, as this could mislead readers about the nature of the results. Clarifying the rationale behind the choice of 24 clusters and discussing how results vary with different cluster sizes would enhance the paper. 

Furthermore, we recommend improving the clarity of figure and table captions to facilitate understanding, particularly regarding the entropy column in Table 3 and the "Ranks" in Figure 4. Providing more details on the clustering method and exploring how variations in embedding extractors affect insights is essential. Including results from the visualization tools described in Section 4.3 is necessary to assess their qualitative analysis. Improving the readability of the appendix tables, especially Table 18, is crucial. Lastly, enhancing the documentation and navigation of the provided URL would support the future use of the auditing framework.
