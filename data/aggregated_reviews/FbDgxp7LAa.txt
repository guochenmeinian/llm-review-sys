Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel task titled "Streaming Detection of Queried Event Start" (SDQES), which aims to identify the onset of complex events described by natural language queries within streaming video. The authors propose a new benchmark, EgoSDQES, leveraging the Ego4D dataset to facilitate the study of streaming multimodal detection. Additionally, they introduce an innovative data generation pipeline using Large Language Models (LLMs) for event extraction and query generation, ensuring the relevance of annotations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The introduction of the SDQES task addresses a significant gap in video understanding, particularly for real-time applications in fields like robotics and augmented reality.  
- The paper provides a comprehensive benchmark and metrics for evaluating performance in the SDQES task, along with a methodologically sound experimental evaluation.  
- The proposed adapter-based approach offers an efficient solution for online learning.

Weaknesses:  
- The reliance on the Ego4D dataset may introduce biases and limit the generalizability of findings to other video types.  
- The complexity of the task may hinder the capture of all nuances in spatio-temporal relationships, and the adapter-based approach may not fully address these complexities.  
- The paper does not sufficiently explore the adaptation of state-of-the-art (SoTA) models for offline natural language queries (NLQ) into the online setting.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the diversity of their dataset by incorporating additional video sources beyond Ego4D, such as HoloAssist and EgoExoLearn, to enhance demographic and camera setting representation. Furthermore, we suggest testing non-LLM specialized models, including online action detection and segmentation models, to better demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adapter scheme. Additionally, adapting SoTA offline NLQ models into the online context would provide a more robust evaluation of the proposed methods.
