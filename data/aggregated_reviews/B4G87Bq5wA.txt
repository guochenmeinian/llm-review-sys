Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an algorithm for constructing a sparse similarity graph from a set of points using a pairwise kernel and kernel density estimation (KDE). The proposed method aims to preserve spectral clustering properties while being efficient in terms of time and space. The authors claim that their approach is applicable to arbitrary kernels; however, this assertion is questioned in the reviews. Additionally, the authors introduce a sampling method applied to multiple vertices simultaneously, which they claim is novel, though reviewers note that it closely resembles prior work. The algorithm's performance is evaluated empirically, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to existing methods, with an additional experiment indicating a larger eigengap than the SZ algorithm, suggesting a potentially better sparsification result.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents convincing theoretical and empirical findings that contribute to the literature on graph clustering.
- The algorithm effectively utilizes recent advancements in efficient KDE, leading to practical applications in similarity graph construction.
- The implementation is reproducible, and the experimental results show significant speed improvements over existing methods like Scikit-learn and FAISS.
- The additional experiment in Table 1 demonstrates a larger eigengap than SZ, indicating a potentially better sparsification result.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the work is limited and somewhat overstated, particularly regarding the connection between KDE and similarity graphs, which has been previously explored in other works.
- The main sampling method appears to be similar to existing techniques without proper acknowledgment, raising concerns about the paper's claims of novelty and generality.
- The relationship between the proposed sampling method and prior work is not adequately discussed.
- Claims about the general applicability of the algorithm to arbitrary kernels are misleading, as the required black-box KDE instances are limited.
- The notation and presentation in some sections could be clearer, and certain theoretical aspects need better contextualization.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the notation in Section 2 to avoid confusion, possibly by defining all terms in terms of a weighted graph. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explicitly acknowledge the similarities of their sampling method to prior work [6] and address the substantial issues related to the claims of generality and novelty. It would be beneficial to include a comparison with the SZ algorithm in the experimental section to provide context for the proposed method's performance. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore and discuss the implications of their method in higher-dimensional settings, as current experiments are limited to low-dimensional datasets. Lastly, addressing the relationship between their sampling method and existing techniques would strengthen the paper's contribution.
