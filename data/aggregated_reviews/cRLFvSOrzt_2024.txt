Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on credit attribution and stable compression in machine learning, aiming to assign recognition to original content creators generated by models. The authors propose formal definitions for credit attribution, linking it to differential privacy (DP) and extending concepts of stability, including stable sample compression. The framework utilizes the PAC learning paradigm to explore the learnability of problems under counterfactual credit attribution (CCA) and stable sample compression.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces formal definitions for credit attribution.
2. It demonstrates that every PAC learnable class can be learned using a CCA learning rule.
3. It establishes connections between CCA, sample compression, and differential privacy.
4. The characterization of learning rules using the PAC framework is insightful.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation using generative models is not well-supported, as results focus solely on PAC learnable classes. Demonstrating credit attribution in generative models would enhance the paper.
2. The lack of examples for credit attribution in common tasks, such as image and text classification, limits the paper's impact.
3. The paper does not adequately connect its contributions to existing literature; a section on related work would provide valuable context.
4. The intuition behind semi-differentially private learning is unclear; a concrete example would improve understanding.
5. The relationship between the proposed definitions and existing copyright notions is not well-established, necessitating a solid mathematical connection or empirical studies.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the applicability of their framework by including clear examples demonstrating its relevance to generative models. Additionally, providing examples of credit attribution in common classification tasks would significantly enhance the paper's impact. We suggest adding a section on related work to better position the contributions within the broader literature. Clarifying the intuition behind semi-differentially private learning with concrete examples would also be beneficial. Lastly, establishing a solid mathematical relationship between the proposed definitions and existing copyright notions is essential for demonstrating the utility of the proposed framework.
