### Key Points
This paper presents a dynamic online advertising auction model where past ad quality influences future click-through rates (CTR). It involves repeated multi-unit auctions among myopic advertisers, with the CTR modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP). The authors characterize the optimal mechanism as a virtual surplus maximization mechanism and propose a sample-efficient algorithm for learning optimal mechanisms. Additionally, they introduce a simple mechanism that achieves a constant approximation of the optimal revenue.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper addresses an understudied phenomenon in online advertising, providing a comprehensive and technically interesting study. The model is well-motivated by real-world applications, and the results are inspiring, particularly the simple constant-approximation mechanism.

Weaknesses:  
Several results appear to derive from prior work in a straightforward manner. The proposed solution requires tracking individual users, which is computationally intensive and raises privacy concerns. The introductory sections lack clarity and do not adequately describe the problem. The model presentation is somewhat confusing, and the overall novelty of the analysis is limited, following standard approaches.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introductory sections to better describe the problem being studied. Additional paragraphs providing high-level ideas could enhance the model's presentation. It would also be beneficial to clarify the implications of assuming myopic advertisers and to address the computational and privacy challenges associated with tracking individual users. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors consider whether their results can be extended to scenarios where ad quality is private information.
