Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the impact of class distribution changes on comparative zero-sample learning by proposing a class distribution shifts parameter model. The authors find that loss minimization leads to poor representation performance under class distribution shifts. To address this, they employ hierarchical sub-sampling and out-of-distribution (OOD) environment balancing methods to achieve robust representations, which are experimentally validated. The proposed method aims to handle distribution shifts between seen and unseen classes effectively.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses the distribution bias problem in zero-shot learning, presenting an innovative solution that is significant for the field.
- The structure is clear, facilitating reader comprehension of the research ideas.
- Figures and tables are concise and effectively support the conclusions.
- Comprehensive comparison and ablation studies demonstrate the method's superiority through extensive experimentation.

Weaknesses:
- The authors should provide a detailed description of their proposed soft-AUC trends and analyze the penalty to clarify their role.
- In Experiment 1, the use of the attribute "blonde hair" to shift class distribution raises questions about the applicability of other attributes, such as gender.
- The language requires refinement, with attention to eliminating redundancy and correcting grammatical errors.
- Abbreviated terms should be defined upon first use, such as "OOD."
- The paper lacks experiments on popular zero-shot learning benchmarks and comparisons to state-of-the-art methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the soft-AUC trends and analyze the penalty's role in detail. Additionally, consider using gender as an attribute for shifting class distribution in Experiment 1. The authors should also refine the language throughout the paper, correcting grammatical errors and avoiding redundant phrases. It is essential to define abbreviations upon their first appearance. Furthermore, we suggest including experiments on established zero-shot learning benchmarks and comparing the proposed method with state-of-the-art approaches to enhance the paper's contribution.
