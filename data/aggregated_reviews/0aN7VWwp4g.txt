Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents novel loss functions—Fourier Amplitude Loss (FAL), Fourier Correlation Loss (FCL), and Regional Histogram Divergence (RHD)—aimed at enhancing the realism of precipitation nowcasting models without generative models. The authors demonstrate that these losses significantly improve the sharpness and realism of predictions compared to traditional MSE loss, evaluated across synthetic and radar echo datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of FAL and FCL shows promise in increasing prediction quality, particularly for longer lead times, without incurring additional time costs.
- RHD effectively replaces traditional thresholding in evaluating models, mitigating threshold-related biases.
- The paper clearly articulates the advantages of FAL and FCL over MSE, including translation invariance and global information provision.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation lacks comprehensiveness, with lower CSI metrics for EarthFormer compared to existing literature, and does not include comparisons with other notable methods like NowcastNet and DiffCast.
- Predictions for extreme values are insufficient, and the rationale behind FACL's connection to precipitation nowcasting is weak.
- Manual selection of coefficients for FAL and FCL may limit the applicability of FACL across different datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including comparisons with earlier loss functions developed for precipitation nowcasting to substantiate claims of state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, consider exploring the combination of FAL with MSE as a simpler alternative to FCL, and clarify the rationale behind the randomized use of FAL and FCL. Addressing the limitations regarding the inability to produce multiple outputs for stochastic predictions would enhance the model's applicability. Lastly, including a discussion on the application of FACL to SOTA models would provide valuable context for readers.
