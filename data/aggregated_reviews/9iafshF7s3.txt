Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Concept Curation (CoCu), a novel approach to address the semantic gap in language-supervised semantic segmentation methods. The authors identify issues in existing methods, such as semantic gap and bias, and propose strategies including Vision-driven Expansion, Text-to-Vision-Guided Ranking, and Cluster-guided Sampling to enhance data quality. Experimental results demonstrate that CoCu improves convergence rates and accuracy compared to the baseline GroupViT across multiple datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The semantic gap problem is significant and well-articulated.
2. CoCu shows potential in alleviating the semantic gap, with comprehensive experiments validating its effectiveness.
3. The method is well-motivated, addressing known issues with noisy image-text pairs and background segmentation.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks sufficient qualitative comparisons; more visualizations against GroupViT are needed to substantiate claims about mitigating semantic issues.
2. The complexity of the CoCu pipeline raises questions about its efficiency, particularly regarding whether it operates online or offline and the time required for processing.
3. The reliance on the CLIP model for data filtering may limit scalability; alternative self-supervised methods should be explored.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 2.3 by summarizing its purpose at the beginning or end to avoid reader confusion. Additionally, we suggest including more visualizations in the supplementary materials to enhance qualitative comparisons with GroupViT. A detailed ablation study table should also be added to elucidate the effects of different CoCu components. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore alternative models like DINO or MAE to replace the CLIP model in the pipeline and evaluate performance implications. Lastly, providing information on the processing time for dataset curation would benefit reproducibility.
