Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive taxonomy of various definitions of stability in learning theory, categorizing them into distribution-independent and distribution-dependent stability. The authors establish equivalences among these definitions and propose a stability-boosted interpolating learning rule that demonstrates logarithmic expansion of KL-stability concerning sample size. The paper aims to provide a unified view of stability concepts and includes significant theoretical contributions, particularly in Theorem 2.2.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors successfully establish equivalences between different definitions of stability, contributing to a clearer understanding of the relationships among these concepts.
2. The stability-boosted learning rule introduced in Section 2.2 is a notable novelty, showcasing the potential for improved stability and learning performance.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper suffers from poor writing and organization, lacking self-containment and clarity. For instance, the abbreviation "PAC" is used without initial definition, and the structure does not adequately emphasize the main contributions, particularly Theorems 2.1 and 2.2.
2. There is a significant overlap between the paper's contributions and existing literature, leading to questions about the novelty of some results, particularly those related to Theorem 2.1.
3. The absence of empirical evaluation for the weak learning rule $A$ and the stability-boosted rule $A^*$ raises concerns about the practical significance of the theoretical claims.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and organization of the paper, ensuring that key contributions are prominently highlighted. Specifically, the construction of $A^*$ in Theorem 2.2 should be emphasized in the main body to showcase its novelty. Additionally, we suggest incorporating empirical evaluations of both learning rules to substantiate their practical relevance. Finally, providing more background and intuition regarding the definitions of stability introduced in the paper would enhance its accessibility and impact.
