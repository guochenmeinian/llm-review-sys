Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the EpiCare benchmark, designed to replicate challenges in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to longitudinal healthcare settings, specifically addressing issues such as low data availability, short treatment episodes, sparse rewards, partial observations, and heterogeneous treatment effects. The authors evaluate the performance of various offline RL methods and off-policy evaluation (OPE) techniques, revealing that many commonly used OPE methods do not perform adequately under these simulated conditions. The benchmark aims to fill a critical gap in the evaluation of RL in healthcare, advancing the field by exposing the limitations of current methodologies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of the EpiCare benchmark effectively simulates healthcare challenges.
- The rigorous testing of advanced RL and OPE techniques ensures robust methodologies.
- The paper clearly presents results and limitations in healthcare RL, contributing to the advancement of medical RL by highlighting evaluation gaps.
- The simulation environment is compatible with most RL libraries and allows for customizable parameters.

Weaknesses:
- The focus on specific healthcare applications may limit generalizability across diverse settings.
- The simulator is abstract and may require significant effort for practical use, including data collection and parameter estimation.
- The state, action, and observation spaces are limited, potentially overlooking important patient-specific characteristics and broader health-related aspects.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the simulator's grounding in real patient data to enhance its applicability to real-world scenarios. Additionally, the authors should consider incorporating patient-specific characteristics into the environment and expanding the state space to include relevant health parameters beyond the current disease state. It would also be beneficial to provide a clearer analysis of how the benchmark's data and evaluation results can be utilized in real-world medical contexts, including sim2real experiments. Finally, we suggest addressing the questions raised regarding the choice of policies for data collection and the implications of the state space definitions.
