### Key Points
This paper presents a new rumor detection model called Crowd Intelligence and ChatGPT Assisted Network (CICAN), which aims to enhance rumor detection by leveraging both semantic content and structural information. The authors identify critical issues in rumor detection, such as entity bias and the challenge of extracting complex long-distance semantically dependent features. The proposed CI-CAN model combines crowd intelligence and external knowledge, applying large language models (LLM) for the first time in this context, specifically utilizing ChatGPT for text enhancement, entity linking, and text conceptualization. Experimental results demonstrate that the method outperforms baseline approaches, indicating its effectiveness in the task of rumor detection.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed method is innovative and effectively addresses the problem of rumor detection.  
- Extensive experiments on public datasets provide substantial evidence supporting the effectiveness of the proposed solution.  
- The paper is well-written, with clear presentation of details and strong methodological backing.  

Weaknesses:  
- The construction details of heterogeneous graphs are not provided, which limits understanding of the methodology.  
- The meaning of the horizontal and vertical coordinates in Figure 3 is unclear, and the image quality of Figure 4 is insufficient.  
- There is a lack of discussion regarding knowledge graphs in relation to rumor detection, and the study does not adequately compare ChatGPT-based methods with knowledge graph-based methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the construction details for heterogeneous graphs and provide explicit explanations for the coordinates in Figure 3. Additionally, enhancing the image quality of Figure 4 is necessary. We suggest that the authors include a more comprehensive discussion on knowledge graphs and their limitations in rumor detection, as well as a comparative analysis between knowledge graph-based methods and their proposed ChatGPT-based approach.
