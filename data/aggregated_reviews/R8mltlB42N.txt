### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of the lifespan of phishing websites, utilizing a dataset from APWG to explore their longevity, factors influencing their duration, and evasion techniques. The authors validate the effectiveness of Google Safe Browsing (GSB) and provide insights into the average lifespan of phishing sites and their takedown factors. While the findings are significant, some results are expected, such as the short lifespan of phishing sites, and others lack adequate explanation, particularly regarding GSB's low detection rate and the reasons behind phisher-initiated takedowns.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides interesting insights into various aspects of phishing websites.
- It offers a comprehensive analysis of phishing site lifespans and survival strategies.
- The research addresses a critical issue relevant to the field and the broader research community.

Weaknesses:
- Some results are relatively expected and do not add significant new information.
- The methodology may not accurately capture the true lifespan of phishing URLs.
- There is a lack of detailed explanations for certain findings, such as GSB's detection rates and the reasons for phisher-initiated takedowns.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the term "lifespan" to accurately reflect the time a phishing URL is responsive after detection by APWG. Additionally, the authors should incorporate publicly available datasets and explore machine learning and deep learning models alongside GSB to enrich the analysis. Further details on the methodology, particularly regarding the detection of DOM changes and the preprocessing of screenshots, should be provided. We also suggest addressing the questions raised about the impact of longer-lived phishing sites and the scalability of the proposed data collection framework. Lastly, clarifying how the lifespan is calculated and the number of URLs detected by GSB before APWG would enhance the paper's rigor.
