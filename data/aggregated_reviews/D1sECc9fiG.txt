Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel quantization method for diffusion models called Temporal Dynamic Quantization (TDQ), which dynamically adjusts the quantization interval based on the time step, significantly enhancing generation quality. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and LSUN Churches, showing superior performance compared to traditional methods. The TDQ module integrates seamlessly into existing static quantization activation algorithms without requiring modifications to the training pipeline, mirroring the baseline training setup with the same optimizer, learning rate, scheduler, and weight decay. The authors also explore the application of TDQ in text conditioning for diffusion models, reporting preliminary results that indicate minimal performance degradation when using the CLIP score for evaluation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The main idea is clearly articulated and easy to follow.
- The TDQ method is simple yet effective, reducing performance decline without additional inference costs.
- The framework integrates seamlessly with existing quantization algorithms and is well-structured with clear visualizations.
- The authors provide comprehensive implementation guidelines applicable across various datasets.
- Experimental results show that TDQ maintains performance with minimal degradation in text conditioning scenarios.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks critical comparisons with Q-diffusion, a key baseline in diffusion models.
- There is insufficient discussion on the impact of the number of layers in the generator module and the quantization of act-to-act matrix multiplications in attention layers.
- The evaluation of the TDQ module's performance is not comprehensive, and the paper contains several typographical errors.
- The results for text conditioning are preliminary and may require further validation.
- The lack of a dedicated smoothness regularizer could be seen as a limitation in controlling activation distribution.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparative analysis by including Q-diffusion as a baseline to validate the efficacy of their proposed method. Additionally, conducting more comprehensive ablation studies, particularly regarding the influence of the number of layers in the generator module and the quantization of attention layer computations, would enhance the depth of the analysis. We also suggest improving the clarity of their experimental results related to text conditioning by providing more extensive data and analysis in future work. Furthermore, exploring the incorporation of a dedicated smoothness regularizer to enhance control over activation distribution would be beneficial. Lastly, addressing the lack of citations for claims made in Section 3.3, clarifying the TDQ module's robustness to training, and performing thorough proofreading to correct typographical errors are advised.
