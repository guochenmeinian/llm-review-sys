Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of the interactive preference learning problem by leveraging human response times as additional information to enhance binary choice feedback. The authors propose a difference-based Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) with linear utility functions and introduce a computationally efficient linear utility estimator that incorporates response times. This estimator is integrated into the Generalized Successive Elimination (GME) algorithm for fixed-budget best arm identification. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The incorporation of human response times is a novel and compelling idea, with clear motivation and illustrative examples provided.
- The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow the background, methods, and experiments.
- The authors effectively discuss the effects of parameters and provide a thorough comparison of the estimator with and without response times.
- Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets are conducted, with detailed analyses of estimation and identification performance.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a theoretical analysis for the proposed algorithm, despite providing asymptotic analysis for the estimators.
- The authors do not address the practical implications of incorporating response times when the barrier parameter $a$ is small and unknown, which may hinder learners' decisions on estimator choice.
- All experiments utilize simulated response times, raising concerns about the real-world applicability of the method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm to provide a more comprehensive understanding of its performance. Additionally, a discussion on the practical choice of the estimator when the barrier parameter $a$ is small would enhance the paper's applicability. Incorporating real human response time data in experiments would provide valuable insights into the method's real-world performance. Lastly, we suggest clarifying the distinction between the paper's approach and EZ-Diffusion estimators in the main text, as well as addressing the asymptotic behavior of the choice-only strategy more explicitly.
