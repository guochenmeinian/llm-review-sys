Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a tree state space model (SSM) that integrates tree structures into SSMs, enabling hierarchical data processing and enhancing long-range dependencies. The authors propose a tree scanning algorithm that generates a minimum spanning tree, utilizing dynamic programming to optimize edge pruning from grid graphs. The resulting GrootVL model demonstrates superior performance in image classification, detection, segmentation, and language understanding tasks. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method across various applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of hierarchical structures into sequential models is an important and novel direction.
- The proposed algorithm for tree scanning is intuitive and effectively enhances long-range dependencies.
- Extensive experiments and ablation studies support the empirical performance of the method.
- The paper is well-structured, with a clear logical flow.

Weaknesses:
- The analysis of learned structures is insufficient; exploring interpretability and syntax structures would provide valuable insights.
- There is a lack of consistency in tree structures across layers, raising questions about the validity of the discovered structures.
- The related work section does not adequately compare with previous hierarchical structure approaches, which is critical for contextual understanding.
- Efficiency performance metrics, particularly regarding training efficiency and inference throughput, are missing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of learned structures to include insights on interpretability and syntax structures. Additionally, addressing the consistency of tree structures across layers is crucial; regularizing these structures could enhance their validity. The authors should also expand the related work section to include comparisons with classic recursive neural networks and modern Transformer architectures. Finally, we urge the authors to include efficiency performance metrics to demonstrate the training efficiency and inference throughput of Groot-V/L.
