Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of AlphaGo for solving games by providing game-theoretic values to all states. The authors propose a distributed game-solving approach that utilizes a self-play learning algorithm to enhance the estimation of the difficulty of solving new game states. The work distribution manager employs new heuristics to prioritize promising nodes, significantly reducing computation time in 7x7 Killall-Go to about one-fourth of a non-learning baseline. The paper includes thorough ablation studies demonstrating the effectiveness of the heuristics. Additionally, the authors provide a thorough examination of computational game theory, addressing various aspects of the field and proposing a framework that seeks to enhance understanding and application within this domain. The reviewers acknowledge the authors' efforts in responding to feedback and engaging in discussions, indicating a willingness to refine the work further.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The originality lies in the online learning application during distributed solving, maintaining useful state value estimates throughout the search.
- The results show substantial improvements over baselines, supported by thorough experimental evaluations.
- The clarity of presentation is commendable, with a well-introduced background and clear reasoning for heuristics.
- The authors demonstrate a commitment to addressing reviewer feedback and improving clarity, positively influencing some reviewers' perspectives.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution is modest, primarily building on established methods without demonstrating generalizability across multiple games.
- The lack of multi-game evaluation limits the assessment of the algorithm's generality.
- The paper does not adequately address limitations or potential negative societal impacts.
- There are concerns regarding nomenclature that may mislead readers familiar with computational game theory.
- The rebuttal concerning the generalization capabilities of the work does not fully resolve the issue, leaving some questions unanswered.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their results by including evaluations on alternative scenarios or games, such as Hex or Rubik's Cube, to demonstrate broader applicability. Additionally, addressing scalability concerns would enhance the paper's long-term relevance, particularly regarding compute and memory demands as the problem size or number of workers changes. We suggest providing direct evidence for the lifelong learning claim, specifically how the manager retains knowledge that the trainer forgets. Clarifying the role of the critical position prioritization and including all variants in the experimental results would also strengthen the paper. Lastly, we encourage the authors to improve the clarity of nomenclature to avoid potential misunderstandings among readers from the computational game theory literature and to tighten the presentation of experimental results for clarity.
