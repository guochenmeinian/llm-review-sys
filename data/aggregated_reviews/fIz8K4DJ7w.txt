Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Kernelized Negative Entropy-regularized Wasserstein Gradient Flow Imputation (KnewImp), a novel method for missing data imputation in numerical tabular datasets. The authors identify two main limitations in existing diffusion model-based imputation frameworks: a focus on sample diversification over accuracy and the complexity of training due to mask matrix design. KnewImp aims to address these issues by integrating a Wasserstein gradient flow framework with a negative entropy-regularized cost functional, thereby enhancing imputation accuracy and simplifying the training process. The authors propose a mean-field factorization of the joint distribution, $r(\boldsymbol{X}^{(joint)}) = p(\boldsymbol{X}^{(obs)})r(\boldsymbol{X}^{(miss)})$, and provide a detailed theoretical justification for this approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KnewImp outperforms several state-of-the-art imputation techniques and validate its effectiveness in downstream classification tasks, while also addressing its application to regression tasks and real-world datasets with inherent missing values.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a unique integration of diffusion models with the Wasserstein gradient flow framework, employing a novel negative entropy regularization to tackle specific challenges in missing data imputation.
- The theoretical foundations are solid, with comprehensive justifications, clear proofs, and propositions that validate the proposed approach.
- Extensive empirical validation on real-world datasets shows significant improvements in mean absolute error (MAE) and Wasserstein distance (Wass) metrics, enhancing the manuscript's robustness.
- The authors have shown responsiveness to reviewer feedback, incorporating suggestions and clarifications effectively.

Weaknesses:
- The choice of the radial basis function (RBF) kernel in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) is not justified, and the paper lacks an exploration of how different kernel choices affect performance.
- Some mathematical formulations may appear dense, potentially hindering readability, and the paper does not adequately address the performance on datasets with varying statistical properties.
- The theoretical foundations rely on assumptions about data distribution, such as smoothness, which are not thoroughly tested for robustness against violations.
- The manuscript could benefit from clearer explanations regarding the convergence properties of the proposed algorithms and the implications of certain assumptions. Additionally, the paper does not provide results on downstream tasks, leaving the practical effectiveness of KnewImp unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the choice of the RBF kernel by analyzing the effects of different kernel types on imputation quality and computational efficiency. Additionally, we suggest including experiments that assess the robustness of KnewImp against various data distributions, such as heavy-tailed or multimodal distributions. To enhance accessibility, simplifying the theoretical explanations or providing more intuitive descriptions would be beneficial. We also recommend improving the clarity of mathematical formulations by incorporating metaphors and intuitive explanations to enhance understanding. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors provide a more detailed discussion on the convergence properties of their algorithms, particularly for Algorithm 4, to address reviewer concerns comprehensively. Finally, we encourage the authors to present results on downstream tasks to demonstrate the practical applicability of KnewImp in real-world scenarios and ensure all typographical errors are corrected in the appendix to improve overall readability.
