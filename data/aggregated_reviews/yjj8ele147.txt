Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents PALOMA, a benchmark designed to evaluate language model (LM) fit across over 546 diverse language and code domains, moving beyond the traditional reliance on perplexity measured on single datasets. The authors argue for the necessity of evaluating LMs on varied domains and provide six baseline 1B parameter LMs along with controlled experimental guidelines. The work includes insightful case studies that reveal the impact of pretraining data diversity on LM performance. Additionally, the authors highlight that loss reduction is predominantly influenced by the top 5 percent of vocabulary and clarify the visualization in Figure 3, explaining that the x-axis represents the rank of evaluation domains ordered by median perplexity. They address anomalies in the redpajama model's perplexity, attributing them to training instability and the nature of the training data. The authors emphasize the need for a nuanced understanding of what models learn versus what they should learn, acknowledging the limitations of their focus on English and code data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- PALOMA's inclusion of 546 distinct domains allows for a nuanced understanding of LM performance, fostering targeted improvements.
- The paper provides a comprehensive and rigorous evaluation framework for perplexity, ensuring fair and reproducible comparisons.
- The analysis of perplexity and its implications for language modeling is thorough and insightful, with case studies highlighting the shortcomings of models pretrained on limited datasets.
- The standardized approach to decontamination of benchmark leakage is well-articulated, and the paper is clearly written and well-structured.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for why perplexity is a useful metric is insufficiently detailed, and the limitations of perplexity are not thoroughly discussed.
- The focus on English and code data limits the generalizability of the findings.
- High perplexity anomalies in certain models raise concerns about training stability and evaluation accuracy.
- The benchmarking process demands significant computational resources, which may not be accessible to all researchers.
- The paper could benefit from clearer explanations in some sections to avoid misunderstandings and a clearer connection between perplexity metrics and performance on downstream tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for perplexity as a metric by providing a clearer discussion of its limitations and opportunities. Additionally, we suggest emphasizing the importance of decontamination in training datasets more prominently and discussing findings from controlled ablations of decontamination techniques. To enhance the impact of the benchmark, we encourage the authors to conduct a correlation analysis between perplexity scores and downstream task performance, as this could provide valuable insights into the utility of their evaluation framework. We also recommend improving the clarity of Figure 3 by revising the x-axis label to “Rank of Evaluation Domain, as Ordered by Median Perplexity over Models.” Furthermore, we suggest including a stand-alone limitations section to consolidate discussions on the limitations of perplexity evaluations and simplifying the explanation regarding what models learn versus what they should learn. Lastly, we recommend including a more high-level comparison to non-perplexity benchmarks in the discussion of correlations to downstream tasks.
