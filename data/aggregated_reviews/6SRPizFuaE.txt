Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on federated learning under heterogeneous data domains, introducing a federated prototype learning strategy called FedPLVM. The authors propose a dual-level prototype generation method to address domain variance between hard and easy domains, thereby reducing communication burdens. Additionally, they introduce an \(\alpha\)-sparsity prototype loss to enhance the sparsity of prototype representations. Experimental results demonstrate the method's efficacy and the necessity of each proposed module.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
2. The authors effectively explain the varying performance of models across domains.
3. Experimental results indicate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of each module.

Weaknesses:
1. The dual-level clustering strategy resembles FPL, with the \(\alpha\)-sparsity loss being the primary innovation. 
2. The clustering results from FINCH can vary; clarification is needed on which step's results are utilized.
3. The impact of \(\alpha\) is only evaluated on small-scale datasets; its trend on larger datasets like DomainNet remains unexamined.
4. The claim regarding the evaluation protocol in FPL being unfair is questionable, as it is sensitive to both easy and hard datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the distinction between their dual-level clustering strategy and FPL, emphasizing the unique contributions of the \(\alpha\)-sparsity loss. Additionally, clarify which step's clustering results from FINCH are selected for use and evaluate the impact of \(\alpha\) on larger datasets. Address the concerns regarding the evaluation protocol's fairness and provide a more detailed analysis of the clustering method's effectiveness in addressing heterogeneous domain issues. Lastly, consider including a complexity analysis and efficiency-related experiments to discuss the proposed method's running efficiency.
