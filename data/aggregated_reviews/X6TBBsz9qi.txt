Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents EAC, which aligns the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) through a three-phase technique: (1) generating concepts with SAM; (2) training a surrogate model using the same fully connected layer to represent the target model; (3) calculating Shapley values based on the results from the first phase to obtain a masked image as a visual explanation. The authors evaluate EAC's performance in terms of faithfulness, understandability, and effectiveness, demonstrating its superiority over traditional methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- EAC is the first to utilize SAM for concept discovery in concept-based XAI.
- It shows strong performance in quantitative evaluations and user studies regarding faithfulness and interpretability.
- The paper is well-organized and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The significance of the work is unclear, particularly regarding the explanations provided, as illustrated by ambiguous cases in Figure 2.
- The method's reliance on a surrogate model raises questions about the consistency of outputs between the surrogate and target models.
- The selection of parameters influencing performance is not well-defined, and comparisons with more recent baseline methods are lacking.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the trade-offs discussed in Section 3.1 by providing concrete examples. Additionally, the authors should include cases where EAC is applied to misclassified samples to enhance understanding. It would be beneficial to clarify the necessity of the surrogate model and ensure that the explanation generated by the surrogate can reliably represent the target model's outputs. Finally, we suggest incorporating more recent baseline methods in comparisons to strengthen the technical novelty of the work.
