### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of tool-assisted generation strategies for LLMs, analyzing existing evaluation pitfalls and proposing a systematic evaluation scheme across multiple models and complex reasoning benchmarks. The empirical analysis reveals that current tool-usage integration approaches yield low and unstable improvements while incurring significant extra costs. The authors summarize evaluation pitfalls and provide guidelines for future assessments of tool-assisted strategies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a timely problem in the context of LLMs and offers valuable insights into existing evaluation setups.
2. It conducts a thorough assessment with a substantial number of experiments (324) across various models, datasets, and tools.
3. The literature review is comprehensive, and the paper is well-written and logically structured.

Weaknesses:
1. The organization and readability of the paper require improvement, with some experimental results presented in a messy manner that complicates interpretation.
2. The types of tools investigated are limited, raising questions about the generality of the conclusions.
3. Some findings contradict existing literature but lack detailed explanations or supportive analysis.
4. The measures of difficulty and definitions related to prompt processing costs are not sufficiently clear, undermining the arguments presented.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization and clarity of the paper, particularly in the presentation of experimental results, to enhance readability. The authors should consider expanding the range of tools investigated to strengthen the generality of their conclusions. Additionally, we suggest providing more detailed explanations for findings that contradict existing literature and clarifying the definitions of prompt processing costs in Section 5. For clearer comparisons, we recommend reorganizing tables and figures, possibly by adding horizontal lines or using multiple sub-tables to delineate comparisons more effectively.
