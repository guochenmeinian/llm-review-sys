Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection called Hyper-opinion Evidential Deep Learning (HEDL), which enhances traditional Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) by modeling evidence in a hyper-domain and incorporating vague evidence that supports multiple categories. The authors propose an opinion projection method to address the gradient vanishing problem inherent in EDL. The experiments demonstrate that HEDL achieves state-of-the-art performance in OOD detection while maintaining classification accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The manuscript introduces a solid theoretical foundation and clear motivation for the proposed method.
- HEDL achieves state-of-the-art results compared to existing methods without introducing additional computational complexity.

Weaknesses:
- The manuscript lacks clarity in the definitions and roles of certain parameters, such as $W_{prior}$, which is crucial for the effectiveness of the model.
- The theoretical proof regarding the vanishing gradient problem is insufficiently detailed, and the origin of sample uncertainty in the figures is not clearly defined.
- The equations presented are difficult to understand, and the paper could benefit from a wider analysis of other loss functions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definitions and roles of parameters like $W_{prior}$ and provide a detailed numerical definition. Additionally, we suggest including a theoretical proof of how HEDL addresses the vanishing gradient problem and clarifying the origin of sample uncertainty depicted in the figures. It would also be beneficial to enhance the comprehensibility of the equations and to conduct a wider analysis of the impact of other loss functions mentioned in EDL.
