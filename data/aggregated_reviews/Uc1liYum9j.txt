### Key Points
This paper presents a method that utilizes gaze data to detect key video frames and automatically extract liquid volume and object weight from a scale. The authors propose a dual segmentation approach, employing temporal segmentation to identify frames of interest and spatial segmentation to locate the object being observed. They recorded a dataset of 460 short video clips in a laboratory setting to develop their methodology. However, the general applicability of their method is questioned, as it relies on a highly controlled environment and numerous assumptions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The idea of combining gaze estimation with computer vision is imaginative and relevant.
- The authors collected a new dataset specifically for their approach, which adds value to their research.

Weaknesses:
- The method's contribution appears trivial, relying on a basic saliency map for fixation detection rather than established algorithms.
- The segmentation approach is simplistic, using an off-the-shelf model without robust validation.
- The method's robustness is compromised by excessive assumptions and hand-defined rules, which may not generalize to other settings.
- Clarity and grammatical issues throughout the manuscript hinder understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and grammar of the manuscript to enhance its overall value. Additionally, we suggest that the authors consider using an established fixation detection algorithm to strengthen their temporal segmentation method. It would be beneficial to address the limitations of their approach by exploring a more robust machine learning/computer vision framework that operates in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide a clearer rationale for their design choices, particularly regarding the selection of 16 frames and 4-second video clips. Lastly, we advise revisiting the necessity of certain figures and ensuring that all technical terms and processes, such as the Levenshtein similarity score, are adequately explained.
