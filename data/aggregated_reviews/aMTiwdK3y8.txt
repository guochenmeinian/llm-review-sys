Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents FourierHandFlow, a method for reconstructing 4D hand sequences from RGB video using Fourier Query Flow, which includes pose flow and shape flow. The approach transforms the 3D trajectory of hand points into Fourier series, ensuring smooth temporal dynamics and computational efficiency. Experimental results on InterHands2.6M demonstrate that the method outperforms existing techniques in quality and continuity of hand shape reconstruction.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The originality of using Fourier series for 3D flow representation is notable.
- High-quality results are achieved, particularly in preventing temporal jitters and abrupt motions.
- The paper is well-written, with a clear logical flow and effective presentation of results.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity on the exact form of the underlying representation and the ground truth used for pre-training.
- There are concerns regarding the potential for over-smoothing due to the low-dimensional nature of the Fourier representation.
- The evaluation does not include comparisons with parametric models like MANO, which raises questions about the method's advantages.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by explicitly defining the underlying representation and the ground truth used for training. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion on the potential Gibbs phenomenon due to the lack of high-frequency components and how the method performs in rapid movements. It would also be beneficial to provide examples demonstrating the method's effectiveness across various hand shapes. Finally, we encourage the authors to include comparisons with existing parametric models to strengthen the evaluation of their approach.
