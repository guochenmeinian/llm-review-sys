### Key Points
This paper presents a study on uncertainty quantification in node classification, focusing on the limitations of the uncertainty cross-entropy (UCE) loss within Graph Posterior Networks (GPNs). The authors propose a distance-based regularization technique to enhance representation learning for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and misclassification tasks. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper is well-motivated, discussing the limitations of the GPN model in semi-supervised node classification and providing a detailed theoretical analysis of these limitations.  
2. The introduction of a distance regularizer effectively addresses the identified limitations.  
3. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both OOD detection and misclassification detection.

Weaknesses:  
1. The writing lacks clarity, particularly in Section 4.1, where theorems are presented without summarizing the limitations of UCE, making it difficult to connect Sections 4.1 and 4.2.  
2. There are questions regarding the definitions of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in Equation 2, as well as the rationale behind these definitions.  
3. The results in Table 2 raise concerns, as the model improves AUPRC but has a lower AUROC, leading to confusion about the overall effectiveness of the model.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their writing, particularly by providing more context on claims and definitions. Additionally, it would be beneficial to clarify the results presented in Table 2, especially regarding the relationship between AUPRC and AUROC. Furthermore, a thorough description of the assumptions made for Theorem 1, including potential violations and illustrative examples, should be included to enhance understanding.
