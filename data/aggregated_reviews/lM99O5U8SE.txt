Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
We find that the authors present a compelling idea for the competition, supported by a thorough report. Key contributions include a detailed investigation of training data, an analysis of failure cases of MedSAM, an insightful approach for 3D image interpolation, and a well-structured presentation of results. The paper fulfills all workshop requirements.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths include the comprehensive analysis of dataset modalities and the effective integration of classical methods alongside deep learning approaches. The writing is clear and engaging, making it enjoyable to read. However, weaknesses include the lack of initial reference to LiteMedSAM, insufficient detail on classical methods that did not work, and the need for further exploration of specific techniques like connected component analysis in results. Additionally, the abstract and introduction may mislead readers regarding the nature of the submission.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We suggest updating the README in the provided code to reflect specific changes and contributions. It would be beneficial to add a paragraph discussing the motivations behind selecting classical methods for segmentation tasks and to include commentary on graph cut and active contours. We recommend reiterating the abstract and introduction to accurately represent the submission's focus and avoid overselling results. Highlighting the best metrics in tables and explaining the coloring coding for images with multiple instances would also enhance clarity.
