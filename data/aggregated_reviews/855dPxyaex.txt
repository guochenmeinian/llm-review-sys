### Key Points
This paper presents a novel dataset for detecting counter hate arguments, focusing on insults and hate speech directed at public figures. The authors introduce a collection of 250 hateful tweets targeting 50 individuals, along with 2,500 online articles labeled for counter hate content. They conduct classification experiments using finetuned transformers (RoBERTa and Longformer) to address paragraph-level and article-level counter hate detection. The study reveals that classifiers perform poorly when training and test data involve different individuals, highlighting the challenge of generalizing the approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with a clear structure and no significant grammatical errors.
- The dataset is carefully constructed, and the annotators are qualified, as evidenced by acceptable interannotation agreement.
- The linguistic analysis and classification results are plausible and well-discussed, particularly the insights from experiments on unseen individuals.

Weaknesses:
- The relevance of the task is questioned, as counter hate against public figures may not be as pressing as that against private individuals.
- The methodology for extracting hateful tweets and retrieving articles may introduce biases due to the reliance on simple surface patterns.
- Missing details about the annotation guidelines and the criteria for labeling counter hate arguments limit the study's transparency.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the relevance of counter hate detection for public figures versus private individuals, providing stronger justification for the task's importance. Additionally, we suggest including analyses of potential biases introduced by the data collection methods and expanding on the annotation guidelines to clarify the criteria for labeling counter hate arguments. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of the classifiers' effectiveness when applied to unseen individuals would enhance the paper's overall robustness. Lastly, we advise correcting the identified typos and improving the clarity of certain sentences to enhance readability.
