Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to understanding the emergence of place cells in the hippocampus by modeling the CA3 region as a recurrent autoencoder (RAE). The authors propose that place cells can develop from networks trained to recall temporally continuous sensory episodes without explicit spatial input. The model reproduces key aspects of hippocampal phenomenology, including remapping, orthogonality of spatial representations, and slow representational drift, while making several testable predictions about place field behavior.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces an intriguing hypothesis about place field emergence from temporally continuous sensory experiences.  
- The model effectively reproduces multiple key aspects of hippocampal function and is grounded in known anatomy and physiology.  
- The authors conduct thorough simulations and provide clear predictions that could guide future experimental work.  
- The paper is well-structured and presents effective explanations that enhance readability.  

Weaknesses:  
- There is limited quantitative comparison with actual neural data from rodent studies, which weakens the claims.  
- The reliance on simplifying assumptions about sensory input structure, specifically smooth Gaussian random fields, is a concern.  
- The exploration of network parameter dependencies is insufficient, and the absence of publicly available code limits verification and extension of the work.  
- The paper lacks a rigorous mathematical framework to explain the emergence of place fields, and the term "weakly spatially modulated" lacks a clear definition.  
- The section structure could be improved for clarity, particularly by separating methods from results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the quantitative comparison with experimental data to strengthen their claims, particularly regarding the correlation of population vectors in different environments. It would be beneficial to address the limitations of using smooth Gaussian random fields more explicitly and to explore the impact of varying model parameters on place field emergence. We suggest providing a clearer definition of "weakly spatially modulated" signals and considering a more rigorous theoretical analysis to explain the emergence of place fields. Additionally, restructuring the paper to separate methods from results would enhance clarity.
