Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents MSDZip, a deep learning-based lossless compression method designed to address the challenges of unsatisfactory compression ratios and low throughput in current learning-based compressors. The authors introduce a Local-Global-Deep Mixing block and a Stepwise-parallel multi-GPU-accelerated compression strategy, achieving significant improvements in both compression ratio and speed. Experimental results indicate that MSDZip outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- MSDZip shows superior performance in compression ratio and speed compared to baseline methods.
- The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation using 12 datasets, effectively demonstrating the advantages of the proposed method.
- The technical foundation of the paper is robust, with a clear description of the design principles.

Weaknesses:
- The descriptions of certain algorithms, such as the EntropyEncoder and Algorithm 1, lack clarity and detail.
- The ablation studies do not sufficiently illustrate the contributions of individual modules, particularly the FMM.
- There is insufficient analysis of the computational resource consumption when using multiple GPUs, and the effectiveness of the Stepwise-parallel strategy is not clearly demonstrated.
- The writing contains minor grammatical errors and inaccuracies, such as misreferencing figures.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the algorithm descriptions, particularly for the EntropyEncoder and Algorithm 1. Additionally, the authors should conduct more thorough ablation studies to clarify the contributions of each module, including the FMM. An analysis comparing the computational resource consumption of traditional and multi-GPU methods is necessary, along with a clearer explanation of how the use of multiple GPUs addresses the cold-start issue. Furthermore, we suggest correcting inaccuracies in figure references and addressing grammatical errors throughout the paper.
