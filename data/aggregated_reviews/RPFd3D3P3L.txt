Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel solution concept, Nash imitation gap (NIG), for imitation learning in mean-field games (MFG). The authors establish upper bounds for NIG in both population-independent and population-dependent dynamics, demonstrating that mean-field controlling adversarial imitation learning (MFC-ADV) outperforms vanilla adversarial imitation learning (vanilla-ADV) and behavioral cloning (BC). The paper also introduces a new adversarial algorithm to address the exponential dependency on the horizon when transition kernels depend on mean fields.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- Originality: The introduction of NIG generalizes the classic imitation gap and provides upper bounds for various settings.  
- Quality: The theoretical analysis is robust and well-supported.  
- Clarity: The paper is well-organized and clearly written, enhancing comprehension.  
- Significance: The findings suggest that adversarial imitation learning could effectively replace inner reinforcement learning with MFC.

Weaknesses:  
- The absence of a lower bound for NIG limits the ability to determine the best method among BC, vanilla-ADV, and MFC-ADV.  
- More justifications are needed for the l_1 norm-based algorithm, particularly in relation to traditional log-likelihood approaches.  
- The empirical verification of the exponential dependence on the horizon is insufficient.  
- Clarity is lacking regarding the calculation of $\rho^{(\pi)}$ and the conditions under which min and max can be exchanged in the algorithm reformulation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the l_1 norm-based algorithm by discussing its differences from log-likelihood approaches and addressing potential assumptions needed for deriving tighter analyses. Additionally, we suggest providing empirical verification of the exponential dependence on the horizon to strengthen the claims made. Clarification on how to calculate $\rho^{(\pi)}$ from the transition kernels should be included, along with a detailed explanation of the conditions required for the exchangeability of min and max in the algorithm reformulation. Lastly, we encourage the authors to include concrete examples of practical applications to enhance the relevance of their findings.
