Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents TURTLE, a truncated causal history model for video restoration tasks. The model comprises a State Align Block and a Frame History Router, where the former utilizes a similarity-based retrieval mechanism to account for inter-frame motion and alignment, while the latter generates output frames through cross-frame channel attention. The proposed method demonstrates promising results across various video restoration tasks, including deraining, desnowing, deblurring, and super-resolution.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method outperforms existing techniques in multiple video restoration benchmarks.
- The causal history model effectively captures spatio-temporal-channel correlations.
- The design enhances efficiency by processing single frames in the encoder and multiple frames in the decoder.

Weaknesses:
- The lack of an ablation study comparing the frame history router's impact limits the understanding of its contribution.
- There are no detailed comparisons of model architectures, parameters, or runtime with other methods.
- The organization of ablation studies is inappropriate, with key information missing, such as the effects of top-k selection versus softmax in the state align block.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and organization of the ablation studies, ensuring that all relevant comparisons are included in the main text rather than the appendix. Additionally, we suggest conducting a thorough ablation study to evaluate the impact of the frame history router and the top-k selection strategy. Providing detailed model architectures, parameter comparisons, and runtime evaluations against other methods would enhance the paper's rigor. Finally, addressing the temporal consistency and background flickering issues observed in the deraining task would strengthen the overall quality of the work.
