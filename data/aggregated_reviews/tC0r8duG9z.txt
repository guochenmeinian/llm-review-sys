Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical investigation of the vanilla-SVD algorithm's effectiveness in recovering clusters within the symmetric stochastic block model (SBM). The authors demonstrate that this algorithm can accurately identify all clusters in the balanced case, addressing an open question posed by Van Vu. The work introduces a novel "polynomial approximation + entrywise analysis" approach to simplify the analysis of eigenspace perturbation, enhancing robustness and requiring less structural assumptions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper effectively demonstrates the vanilla-SVD algorithm's capability to recover clusters in the symmetric SBM without pre-processing or post-processing steps, validating its practical applicability.
- It introduces a new method for analyzing matrix perturbation with random noise, contributing to the theoretical understanding of vanilla spectral algorithms.
- The authors provide detailed comparisons with existing analyses, highlighting the advantages of their approach.

Weaknesses:  
- The presentation could be improved; the analysis is not explicitly stated as being limited to the balanced case in the Abstract and Section 1. 
- There is a lack of experimental evaluation to support the theoretical claims, and the time and space complexity analysis is not compared with previous methods.
- The coherence in the Introduction is insufficient, focusing more on mathematical advancements than on practical applications.
- The paper omits some proofs, which could hinder understanding, and the readability is affected by the heavy use of formulas.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the Abstract and Section 1 by explicitly stating that the analysis is confined to the balanced case. Additionally, providing a comparison of conditions and bounds with [MZ22b] would enhance the completeness of the work. We suggest incorporating quantitative experimental analysis to complement the theoretical findings and demonstrate the practical implications of the vanilla-SVD algorithm. Furthermore, restructuring the analysis in Section 4 to precede Section 3.3 may improve the flow of the paper. Lastly, addressing the readability by reducing the number of formulas and including more background information would make the work more accessible to a broader audience.
