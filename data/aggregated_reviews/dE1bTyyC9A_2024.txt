Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents UniSeg3D, a unified framework for six 3D segmentation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The authors propose inter-task connections and employ techniques such as knowledge distillation and contrastive learning to enhance performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the model across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The novel architecture effectively integrates six segmentation tasks into a single model, showcasing flexibility for future task extensions.
2. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies validate the proposed method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. The writing requires improvement; some notations and flow are confusing, such as the unclear introduction of K_v and the multiplication in equation (3).
2. The marginal performance gain raises questions about the motivation for unification, particularly when additional tasks negatively impact performance.
3. The empirical findings regarding interactive segmentation lack sufficient analysis and supporting data.
4. The model's performance on generic segmentation tasks appears to be on par or worse than training alone.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing, particularly in notation and flow, to enhance reader comprehension. Additionally, further justification for the marginal performance gains and the impact of unifying tasks should be provided, including standard deviations of performance metrics. We suggest including more diverse datasets in experiments to validate the model's effectiveness across various contexts. Lastly, a deeper analysis of the benefits of inter-task associations and the reasons behind the performance of interactive segmentation should be included to strengthen the claims made in the paper.
