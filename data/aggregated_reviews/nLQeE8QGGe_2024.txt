### Key Points
This paper presents active learning techniques for designing photostimulation experiments combined with two-photon imaging to uncover a dynamical systems model of brain activity. The authors propose a low-rank matrix recovery framework and demonstrate its effectiveness using a dataset from the mouse motor cortex. They aim to optimize photostimulation patterns to study neural population dynamics while minimizing data collection.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Develops a low-rank matrix estimation framework for dynamical systems of neural activity upon photostimulation.
- Introduces an active learning approach to effectively identify system components.
- Demonstrates the approach's utility using simulated experimental settings with real data.
- The clarity of the paper is commendable, particularly in presenting complex mathematical derivations and theorems.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset lacks complexity and does not involve tasks that enrich neural dynamics, raising questions about the model's applicability to sensory modalities.
- Some figures are inadequately explained, and certain ranks are outdated (Figures 3 and 4).
- The exposition in Section 4 is overly technical, and the rationale behind certain equations could be better justified.
- Comparisons with more sophisticated methods for active design of experiments are lacking.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the exposition in Section 4 by providing a more intuitive narrative and justifying the rationale behind each equation. Additionally, expanding the dataset to include different modalities and more complex behavioral paradigms would help assess the model's applicability. We suggest including more recent literature on data-driven dynamical models to enhance the context of their work. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to visualize estimation errors in Figures 3 and 4 to indicate the effectiveness of their method. Lastly, addressing the limitations regarding the low-rank AR-k models' capacity to capture nonlinear dynamics and the need for real-time testing in closed-loop experiments would strengthen the paper.
