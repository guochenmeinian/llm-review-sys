### Key Points
This paper studies prior-free mechanism design aimed at maximizing revenue as a fraction of optimal welfare in worst-case scenarios. The authors propose mechanisms for three settings: (1) digital goods, (2) matroid settings, and (3) public goods, achieving tight approximation bounds for each. The mechanisms are designed based on single-buyer mechanisms and include a threshold mechanism for public goods. The authors analyze competitive ratios, demonstrating asymptotically optimal performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
The paper addresses a meaningful problem with complete and tight results. The mechanisms are simple, natural, and optimal, with clear and straightforward analyses. The proofs are well-written and easy to follow, contributing to the clarity of the work.

Weaknesses:
The paper lacks bounds for "revenue vs revenue," which would address other important aspects of these settings. The techniques used are not particularly novel, and the model's practical applicability is questioned, particularly regarding the estimate of optimal welfare without other statistics. The paper also does not explore cases where $\alpha > 1/2$ and lacks numerical examples to validate the mechanisms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper for non-experts by providing more detailed explanations of basic concepts, definitions, and terminologies. Additionally, we suggest including bounds for "revenue vs revenue" to capture more aspects of the problem. It would be beneficial to discuss challenges related to cases where $\alpha$ is large and to consider the implications of inaccurate hints on the robustness of the mechanisms. Finally, incorporating numerical examples or experiments could enhance the practical relevance of the findings.
