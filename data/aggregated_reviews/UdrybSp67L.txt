Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents theoretical results on estimating the integral of \( f^q \) and explores how regression-adjusted control variates can enhance Monte Carlo estimators. The authors study the theoretical properties of Monte Carlo estimators of the moments of a Sobolev function, demonstrating that under certain smoothness assumptions, the regression-adjusted rule achieves the minimax optimal rate. They also address scenarios with noisy observations and provide bounds for the estimator's absolute error.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The results are novel and contribute significantly to the literature on minimax-like results for Monte Carlo estimators.  
- The paper considers both high and low smoothness regimes, providing a comprehensive analysis.  
- The authors make an effort to present the notation and results in an accessible manner.  

Weaknesses:  
- The presentation limits accessibility for those unfamiliar with the theoretical background, particularly in explaining concepts like Sobolev spaces.  
- The paper lacks a cohesive narrative, with sections feeling disconnected and insufficiently motivated.  
- There is minimal discussion on practical applications and how the theoretical results relate to real-world scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the accessibility of the paper by providing an informal definition and intuition for Sobolev spaces. Additionally, we suggest including a simple and intuitive toy example to clarify the problem and proposed solutions. The authors should enhance the narrative flow between sections, particularly clarifying the motivation for transitioning from noiseless to noisy observations. We also encourage the authors to instantiate realistic problems with equations in an example paragraph to better connect theory to practice. Finally, the introduction should clearly define truncated Monte Carlo and elaborate on how the distribution of points affects the results.
