### Key Points
This paper presents a study on ethnic and gender biases in image search results from Google and Bing, utilizing real-world open-ended search queries. The authors analyze 54,070 unique queries from 643 US residents, focusing on the distribution of perceived gender, skin tone, and age in the results. The study is noted for its careful setup, including IRB approval and ethical considerations. However, the scale used for labeling skin color is questioned for its effectiveness, and the paper's claims about the number of queries evaluated are scrutinized, as the effective number is closer to 1,800.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research topic is meaningful and offers new insights into representation in image search engines.
- Ethical considerations are prioritized, with proper IRB approval and participant consent.
- The data collection and analysis processes are thorough and well-presented.

Weaknesses:
- The results lack novelty and are not surprising, suggesting a need for more real-world application discussions.
- The participant demographics are skewed, potentially introducing bias, as they are predominantly White and older than the general US population.
- The use of outdated CNN models for image detection raises concerns, and the paper lacks clarity on the number of MTurk workers involved.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the definition of "open-ended people queries" and provide a representative list of such queries to enhance understanding. Additionally, the authors should clarify the number of MTurk workers recruited and analyze potential biases introduced by labelers. It would be beneficial to apply more statistical methods, such as t-tests, to strengthen the analysis. Lastly, we suggest that the authors tone down claims regarding the evaluation of 54,000 queries, as the effective set is significantly smaller.
