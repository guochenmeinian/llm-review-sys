### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of user engagement dynamics in online communities for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), specifically focusing on the interactions within the TalkingPoint and ALZConnected platforms. The authors propose four hypotheses regarding the effects of topic initiator engagement (TIE), reciprocal interactions, thematic content, and linguistic features on community participation. The study employs traditional machine learning techniques, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Logistic Regression (LR), to derive actionable insights aimed at enhancing caregiver engagement.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with clear organization and methodology.
- It utilizes an interesting dataset and contributes valuable knowledge about ADRD community interactions, linking findings to sociological theories.
- The findings provide actionable recommendations for improving user engagement and retention in health-related online communities.

Weaknesses:
- The research scope is narrow, focusing primarily on ADRD, which limits broader applicability.
- The methodologies employed are traditional and lack innovation, with no significant advancements over existing techniques.
- Some hypotheses lack clear connections to the theoretical frameworks, and the practical significance of findings for informal caregivers is not well articulated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the scope of their research to include broader implications for online communities beyond ADRD. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the practical application value of the proposed hypotheses and their conclusions. The authors should consider utilizing more advanced machine learning methods, such as pre-trained models like BERT or large language models (LLMs), to enhance the technical depth of their analysis. Furthermore, we advise providing a more detailed presentation of the platforms studied, including their structural dynamics, and to rename topics in a more intuitive manner for clarity. Lastly, we recommend separating the "Discussion" and "Conclusion" sections for better clarity and conciseness.
