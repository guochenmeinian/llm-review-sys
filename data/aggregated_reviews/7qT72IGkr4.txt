Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for performative control in linear dynamical systems, where the chosen control policy influences system dynamics, resulting in policy-dependent changes in states. The authors define a performatively stable control (PSC) solution and derive conditions for its existence and uniqueness. They introduce a repeated stochastic gradient descent (RSGD) algorithm to achieve this solution, supported by theoretical convergence analysis and numerical experiments. Additionally, the paper introduces a novel approach to performative prediction (PP) by incorporating stateful distribution maps within a linear dynamical system framework. The authors provide a linear-system-dynamics-dependent strong convexity analysis, distinguishing their work from previous approaches that assume strong convexity without problem-specific analysis. This model enhances understanding of performative distributions by allowing for stateful performative transition maps that depend on the history of previously deployed policies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a gap in traditional control theory by introducing performative control.
- It provides a rigorous theoretical foundation with sufficient conditions for PSC solutions.
- The framework is illustrated with numerical examples, offering insights into system stability under varying conditions.
- The development of a custom RSGD algorithm tailored to the PSC framework is noteworthy.
- The unique strong convexity analysis tailored to linear dynamical systems effectively connects stateful distribution maps with linear dynamical systems, potentially enriching the field of performative prediction.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for how control policies influence dynamics is underdeveloped, particularly in the main body, with key examples relegated to the appendix.
- The paper's technical writing lacks clarity, with several quantities referenced without prior definition and some claims unsubstantiated.
- The reliance on numerical examples rather than extensive empirical data may limit the framework's applicability in real-world scenarios.
- Assumptions regarding measurable disturbances and perfect modeling are not adequately addressed, which may restrict the control policy's practical application.
- Some reviewers express concerns that the contributions may not be sufficient for acceptance at high-level conferences like NeurIPS.
- There is a need for clearer articulation of the technical assumptions and their implications, particularly regarding the performative nature of the B matrix and the stability claims made in the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for the influence of control policies on system dynamics by providing a more detailed exposition in the main body, rather than deferring it to the appendix. Additionally, please clarify the assumptions regarding the state matrix A and the nature of disturbances, particularly why they are assumed to be zero mean and uncorrelated. We suggest enhancing the clarity of technical writing by defining all referenced quantities and substantiating claims, especially regarding performative stability and optimality. We also recommend that the authors explicitly state that the assumption regarding the B matrix arises from technical necessity rather than modeling choice, and revise the claim in L182 to clarify that stability does not imply optimality. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to consider relaxing the assumptions on cost functions and to provide empirical results comparing the RSGD algorithm's convergence speed and efficiency against other optimization methods. Lastly, illustrating a precise connection between stateful performative prediction models and the linear dynamical system framework, potentially through Jacobian linearization, and validating theoretical contributions with empirical examples would strengthen the paper's practical relevance and impact.
