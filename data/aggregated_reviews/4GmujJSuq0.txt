### Key Points
This paper presents an approach to generate extractive summaries of obligations, entitlements, and prohibitions in tenancy agreements for both tenants and landlords, utilizing a two-staged method involving a content categorizer and an importance ranker. The authors introduce a new annotated dataset for summary generation, comprising 11 contracts with 3000 sentences annotated by legal experts. The paper also includes empirical and human evaluations to demonstrate the system's effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an important task in legal document summarization and proposes a novel application for tailored summaries.
- The annotated dataset is a valuable resource, as annotated data in this domain is scarce.
- The methodology for the summarization pipeline is well-described and could influence future research.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a discussion on the importance of information for the parties involved, which limits the effectiveness of party-specific summaries.
- The reliability of the annotation process is questioned, particularly regarding the mismatch between annotators' jurisdiction and the dataset.
- The chosen baselines may not adequately demonstrate the system's strength, as they are primarily unsupervised.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the value of party-specific summaries by addressing the implications of excluding sentences that do not explicitly mention the parties involved. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the relationship between legal importance and summary importance, potentially incorporating existing criteria such as lawfulness or risk. To enhance the reliability of the annotation process, a discussion on the implications of using annotators from a different jurisdiction should be included. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide more analysis or interpretation of the importance rankings beyond what is presented in Table 2, possibly including qualitative comments from annotators. Lastly, we recommend revising Section 4 for clarity and consistency, particularly regarding the use of algebraic notations and the explanation of the BWS scheme.
