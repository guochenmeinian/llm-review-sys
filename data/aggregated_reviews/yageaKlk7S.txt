Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on data augmentation (DA) and its effects on class-level accuracy, particularly focusing on random resized crop (RRC) augmentations in ImageNet. The authors propose a framework to understand how DA impacts class-level learning dynamics, revealing that most negatively affected classes are ambiguous, co-occurring, or involve fine-grained distinctions. The research demonstrates that class-conditional augmentation strategies can enhance performance on classes adversely impacted by DA.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study provides a thorough analysis of data augmentation bias, offering significant practical implications for real-world applications.
- It introduces a novel class-conditional data augmentation strategy that shows promise in mitigating data augmentation bias.
- The paper is well-written, with clear methodology and supportive evidence, making it easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The analysis is limited to a single augmentation method (random crop) and only CNN architectures (ResNet and EfficientNet).
- The findings need to be validated across a broader range of augmentation methods and model architectures, including Vision Transformers (ViT).
- The overall performance of the model does not improve despite the introduction of class-conditional augmentation, which warrants further investigation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the breadth of their analysis by extending it to include a wider range of augmentation methods, such as hyperparameters in RandAugment and Data MixUp. This could help ascertain whether the observations are generalizable across various data augmentation techniques. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments with ViT-based models to strengthen the findings and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the interaction between different model architectures and the described phenomena. Lastly, addressing the unexpected lack of overall performance improvement despite the proposed interventions would enhance the study's robustness.
