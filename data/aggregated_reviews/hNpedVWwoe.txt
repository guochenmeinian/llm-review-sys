Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for recovering a function from evaluations on the unit sphere, specifically focusing on the class of square-integrable functions \( L^2(\mathbb{S}^{d-1}) \). The authors propose an algorithm that demonstrates the sample complexity required for recovery is proportional to \( \beta_{q, d} \), the dimension of the space of degree \( q \) spherical harmonics, achieving optimality through lower bounds. Additionally, the paper explores the optimization problem related to spherical harmonics and their application in sampling methods, introducing a noise model that encompasses perturbations prior to the recovery process, aligning with adversarial noise models. A central contribution is the uniformity of leverage scores of the projection operator, which facilitates nearly optimal uniform sampling. The authors acknowledge the need for clearer citations and explanations, particularly regarding Lemmas and Theorems, and express intent to enhance the accessibility of their work through additional explanatory content in the appendix.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper provides a solid theoretical analysis and demonstrates a new approach to recovering spherical harmonic expansions, supported by theoretical guarantees and numerical experiments that validate the findings.
- The optimality of the sample complexity result enhances the mathematical strength of the paper.
- The paper is technically solid and clear, with a well-defined noise model that aligns with common assumptions in adversarial contexts.
- The authors demonstrate a strong understanding of the mathematical underpinnings of their work, particularly in relation to the optimization problem and the properties of spherical harmonics.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper is challenging to read due to its technical nature, which may limit its accessibility to a broader audience, particularly those outside the specific domain of spherical harmonics.
- There is insufficient connection to existing literature on deep learning and spherical harmonic transforms, which could enhance the relevance of the work.
- There is a lack of clarity regarding the non-uniqueness of solutions to the optimization problem, which remains inadequately addressed.
- The claim of robustness to external noise is questioned, as the noise model may not fit the traditional definition of "noise."
- The paper's fit for the NeurIPS venue is debated, with some reviewers expressing concerns about its appropriateness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors improve the readability of the paper by presenting specific cases of their statements, such as defining the sensitivities function and the leverage score function with references to established works.
2. We suggest that the authors situate their results more explicitly within the context of machine learning, potentially by discussing applications relevant to the field and citing recent literature.
3. We encourage the authors to clarify the main result, particularly regarding the sample complexity comparison with existing literature, to address potential confusion among readers.
4. We recommend that the authors improve clarity by explicitly addressing the non-uniqueness of solutions to the optimization problem in the revised paper.
5. The authors should discuss the technical difficulties encountered in establishing the robustness of their method to external noise and consider including experimental results demonstrating the effect of iid Gaussian noise on performance.
6. We also suggest that the authors provide a more detailed explanation of the computational requirements for linear regression, including the precise running time for computing lower degree basis functions, to better contextualize their method's efficiency compared to traditional approaches.
