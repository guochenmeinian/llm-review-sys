### Key Points
This paper presents TextReact, a retrieval-augmented approach for predicting solvents, reagents, and catalysts in chemical reactions by retrieving relevant text from a patent dataset. The authors formulate the task using a bi-encoder-based retrieval method, supported by a novel chemical retrieval benchmark. The proposed model demonstrates strong performance in reaction condition recommendation and one-step retrosynthesis tasks, outperforming existing baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with strong empirical results that validate the method.  
- The methodology is well-motivated, leveraging recent advances in NLP, and the experimental design is rigorous.  
- The proposed model shows significant improvements over existing methods, particularly in accuracy and utility of text augmentation.  

Weaknesses:  
- The effectiveness of the proposed model is not sufficiently demonstrated against state-of-the-art models, as essential baselines were overlooked in the experiments.  
- The study lacks exploration of additional methods beyond bi-encoders, such as integrating a cross-encoder or sparse retriever like BM25.  
- Retrieval metrics, such as recall@100, are missing, and the analysis of the influence of SMILES input versus retrieved text input is insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison of their model with state-of-the-art methods by including relevant baselines in their experiments. Additionally, integrating a cross-encoder or sparse retriever like BM25 could enhance the contribution of the work. We also suggest including retrieval metrics such as recall@100 and conducting a more thorough analysis of the model's performance in complex molecular reactions. Finally, a discussion on the practical utility of text augmentation in real-world applications would strengthen the paper.
