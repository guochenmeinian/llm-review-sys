Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the SafeZone problem for safe reinforcement learning (RL), focusing on finding a subset of states that minimizes escape probability while being policy-dependent. The authors propose a new algorithm utilizing rejection sampling to update safety estimations as new trajectories are added. The paper also discusses the NP-completeness of the SafeZone problem and provides theoretical analysis alongside empirical results, demonstrating the practicality of the proposed approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The work introduces a novel approach to safe RL, diverging from traditional constrained MDP formulations.
2. The formalization of the SafeZone problem is well-explained, aiding comprehension.
3. The combination of theoretical analysis and empirical evidence enhances the robustness of the findings.

Weaknesses:
1. The choice of baseline algorithms and experimental design raises concerns about the sufficiency of testing the proposed algorithm's advantages.
2. The paper lacks empirical evidence linking SafeZone quality to improved learning performance in safe RL tasks.
3. Clarity issues arise from the reliance on appendices for critical information and a lack of intuitive examples throughout the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by integrating intuitive examples throughout, particularly in sections following the introduction. Additionally, we suggest providing empirical evidence that demonstrates how a good SafeZone output enhances learning performance in safe RL tasks. It would also be beneficial to discuss the potential of the proposed method to outperform constrained MDP methods regarding learning efficiency. Finally, addressing the clarity of the algorithm descriptions and ensuring that all relevant information is included in the main text rather than relegated to appendices would enhance the paper's accessibility.
