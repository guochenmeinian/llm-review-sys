Aggregated Review:
**Key Points:**
We note that the paper presents the RepViT-MedSAM model, which enhances the efficiency of the MedSAM architecture through knowledge distillation. The results indicate improved inference speed and address the uneven distribution of multi-modal medical images. The manuscript includes detailed experimental information and is open-sourced.

**Strengths and Weaknesses:**
Strengths include the effective design improvements for handling multi-modal data distribution and the completeness of the article, which allows for reproducibility. However, we identify weaknesses such as the ambiguity in the efficiency description, insufficient discussion on data augmentation effects, and a lack of clarity regarding the adequacy of 9 epochs for distillation and training. Additionally, we observe formatting issues, such as wide paragraph spacing and missing vertical lines in tables.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
We suggest clarifying the efficiency description in the abstract and addressing the formatting issues, including adjusting paragraph widths and adding vertical lines to tables. We recommend providing more details on the unique sampling strategy and its impact on achieving balanced results, as well as discussing the rationale behind selected data enhancement strategies like Mixup and their expected improvements. Lastly, we believe that including a README file in the open-source project would facilitate easier reproduction of the work.
