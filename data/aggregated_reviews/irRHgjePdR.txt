Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an iterated learning method with simplicial embeddings (SEM-IL) aimed at enhancing systematic generalization in deep neural networks. The approach is inspired by cognitive science theories of iterated learning, which emphasize compressibility and expressivity in message transmission. Empirical results demonstrate improvements in vision tasks with known latent factors and molecular graph prediction tasks with unknown structures, suggesting that the combination of iterated learning and simplicial embeddings leads to better performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The analysis and experiments highlight the potential of the SEM-IL framework for systematic generalization.
- The motivation is grounded in cognitive science, providing a clear rationale for the proposed methods.
- The empirical performance shows a significant gap between the baseline and the proposed approach.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical justification for why SEM-IL enables systematic generalization remains unclear.
- The method section lacks clarity, particularly regarding the motivations for using iterated learning and simplicial embeddings.
- The primary experiments rely on synthetic datasets, and further exploration of real-world applications is needed.
- There is insufficient discussion on the connection between iterated learning and simplicial embeddings, raising questions about the necessity of their combination.
- The paper does not provide source codes, and limitations are mentioned but not explicitly detailed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method section by providing a more detailed explanation of the motivations for using iterated learning and simplicial embeddings. Additionally, we suggest conducting more comprehensive experiments, particularly on real-world datasets, to better assess the framework's effectiveness. It would be beneficial to clarify the theoretical underpinnings of SEM-IL and explicitly summarize what additional information it provides for identifying latent factors. Finally, we encourage the authors to include source codes and a dedicated section discussing the limitations and potential social impacts of their work.
