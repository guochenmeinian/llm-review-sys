Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method called Metric-from-Human (MfH) for monocular metric depth estimation without requiring metric depth annotations. The authors propose using humans as landmarks to extract scene-independent metric scale priors from generative painting models, addressing the limitations of existing Monocular Metric Depth Estimation (MMDE) approaches. The method employs a test-time adaptation framework that connects Monocular Relative Depth Estimation (MRDE) to MMDE through a generate-and-estimate pipeline. Additionally, a user study evaluates the robustness of the MfH method against recent advanced MMDE methods, revealing that MfH achieves the highest selection rate across all depth ranges, demonstrating its robustness compared to other methods. However, the study also highlights significant limitations, particularly in practical applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces an innovative approach to zero-shot monocular metric depth estimation, leveraging generative painting and Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) techniques.
- A clear motivation is provided, effectively articulating the limitations of current MMDE methods and the empirical support for the proposed solution.
- The MfH method demonstrates the highest selection rate in the user study, indicating its robustness across different depth ranges.
- The inclusion of qualitative comparisons alongside the user study provides a comprehensive evaluation of the method's effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
- The authors acknowledge the limitations of their approach and express a willingness to explore further improvements.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental results are suboptimal compared to existing methods, raising concerns about the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
- The reliance on user studies for comparison may not accurately reflect the performance of MMDE methods, as humans can struggle with estimating metric depths.
- The method's practicality is questionable due to its reliance on multiple models, resulting in significant computational complexity and latency.
- The performance is heavily dependent on the accuracy of the generative painting and human mesh recovery models, which could introduce biases and errors.
- The authors do not currently implement the proposed cropping of human bodies using masks in their study, which could enhance the method's robustness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the practicality of their method by exploring offline settings to generate pseudo metric ground truth for datasets lacking such data. Additionally, the authors should conduct more comprehensive evaluations, including direct comparisons with recent advanced metric depth prediction methods such as Metric3D and UniDepth, to better assess the advantages of their approach. We suggest that the authors implement the cropping of human bodies using masks in their analysis to exclude the influence of irrelevant pixels. Furthermore, conducting comparisons with ground truth datasets could validate the effectiveness of MfH more rigorously. Finally, exploring alternative routes for enhancing efficiency and reducing reliance on external models could strengthen the practical applicability of the proposed solution. A detailed analysis of failure cases and the impact of generative painting artifacts on depth predictions should also be included to enhance the robustness of the findings. Clarifying the inpainting technique used and optimizing the depth estimation model's performance over the entire image, rather than just the human areas, would further strengthen the overall contribution of the work.
