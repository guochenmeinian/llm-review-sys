Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents nonlinear spectral filters (NLSFs) aimed at enhancing graph neural networks (GNNs) through nonlinear functions, addressing the inadequacy of existing spectral GNNs in modeling graph equivariance. The authors investigate domain translation in graph space and propose NLSFs that are fully equivariant to graph functional shifts, demonstrating universal approximation capabilities. The experimental results indicate that NLSFs outperform standard convolutional GNNs in node and graph classification tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The research problem is valuable, and the ideas are novel, supported by rigorous theoretical analysis.
2. The mathematical foundation of NLSFs is solid, particularly regarding universal approximation and graph expressivity.
3. Notable experimental improvements in classification tasks validate the proposed theory.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks discussion of important spectral GNN models and equivariant GNNs, which could clarify the significance of the contributions.
2. The experiments are not comprehensive enough to demonstrate the enhanced equivariant learning, particularly in relation to graph isomorphism tests.
3. The reliance on eigenvalues necessitates eigendecomposition, which has high time complexity for large graphs, potentially limiting scalability.
4. The paper is dense with mathematical details, which may hinder accessibility for readers unfamiliar with graph signal processing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of existing spectral GNN models and equivariant GNNs to better position their work within the broader field. Additionally, we suggest adding experiments that specifically demonstrate how the improved performance is due to enhanced equivariant learning, such as graph isomorphism tests. To enhance accessibility, consider moving some theoretical material to the appendix and providing clearer explanations of key concepts, particularly regarding the rationale behind modeling graph translations. Finally, addressing the computational efficiency and scalability of the proposed models would be beneficial for practical applications.
