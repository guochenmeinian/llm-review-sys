Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the effectiveness of decomposition approaches for solving risk-averse Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) using Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), Expected Value-at-Risk (EVaR), and Value-at-Risk (VaR) objectives. The authors demonstrate that the decomposition methods for CVaR and EVaR are suboptimal, invalidating prior works, while establishing that the VaR decomposition is optimal for both policy evaluation and optimization. The findings call for increased scrutiny of traditional methods and suggest exploring alternative approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a rigorous analysis of the suboptimality of CVaR and EVaR decompositions, offering significant contributions to the field.
- The identification of the VaR decomposition as optimal enhances practical decision-making in risk-averse contexts.
- The clarity of presentation and methodology, along with well-structured proofs, aids in understanding complex concepts.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks empirical evidence to support the theoretical findings, particularly regarding the new method's effectiveness.
- It does not address the scalability of the proposed VaR decomposition or compare a broader range of state-of-the-art techniques.
- Much of the intuition is obscured in the proofs, and there is insufficient discussion on potential research avenues to address the identified issues.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including numerical experiments to validate the new method's effectiveness. Additionally, addressing the scalability of the VaR decomposition in relation to problem size and dimensionality would enhance its practical applicability. The authors should also consider discussing alternative state-of-the-art techniques in a related works section and clarify the rationale behind their selection of the three decomposition approaches. Expanding on the intuition behind the proofs, particularly regarding the saddle-point argument, would further enrich the reader's understanding. Lastly, exploring the implications of the risk level (alpha) on the performance of the VaR decomposition could provide valuable insights for practitioners.
