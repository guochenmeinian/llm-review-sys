Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SEEM, a promptable and interactive model designed for comprehensive image segmentation. SEEM aims to segment all objects in an image simultaneously, addressing various segmentation tasks through a novel decoding mechanism that allows for diverse prompting. The model incorporates a visual prompt that unifies different spatial queries, learns a joint visual-semantic space for dynamic prompt composition, and utilizes memory prompts to retain segmentation history. Empirical studies validate SEEM's effectiveness across multiple segmentation tasks, demonstrating competitive performance with minimal supervision.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- SEEM achieves competitive results across various segmentation tasks, showcasing superior performance and strong generalization capabilities.
- The model's versatility in handling multiple types of prompts enhances its applicability to diverse scenarios.
- The clear and concise presentation effectively communicates the innovative aspects of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
1. Some methodological aspects lack motivation and clarity, particularly regarding the attention mask and the matching of output embeddings to prompts.
2. The paper heavily derives from X-Decoder without adequately discussing its relationship, which may obscure the contributions of SEEM.
3. Performance on video object segmentation (VOS) is notably poor, indicating potential robustness issues with object appearance variations.
4. The paper does not report training and inference time or memory requirements, which are critical for evaluating practical applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method by providing a more detailed explanation of the attention mask and the process of matching output embeddings to prompts. Additionally, we suggest incorporating a "Preliminaries" section to discuss the relationship with X-Decoder, which would enhance the paper's readability and motivation. To address performance concerns, particularly in VOS, we encourage the authors to explore techniques such as data augmentation or sample weighting to mitigate dataset imbalance. Furthermore, we recommend reporting training and inference time and memory requirements to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's efficiency. Lastly, conducting ablation studies on the effectiveness of different prompt types would offer valuable insights into the model's performance.
