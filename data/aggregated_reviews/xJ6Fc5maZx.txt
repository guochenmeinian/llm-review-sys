### Key Points
This paper presents a graph contrastive learning method called CL-KDM, which aims to enhance social recommendation through robustness and generalization. The authors propose a novel hierarchical topology enhanced social relation modeling method and employ a HSIC-based kernel dependence maximization approach. The paper includes a comprehensive empirical study demonstrating the effectiveness of CL-KDM across multiple datasets, addressing challenges in existing methods such as L2 normalization issues and loss of structural information.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces innovative contributions, including a novel hierarchical topology enhanced social relation modeling method and HSIC-based kernel dependence maximization.
- A thorough theoretical analysis highlights the limitations of representation-level augmentations, emphasizing the need for structure-level augmentations.
- The empirical study is comprehensive, covering performance comparisons, module ablation, robustness, hyperparameter studies, and efficiency analysis.

Weaknesses:
- The motivations for the technical components, particularly HSIC and hierarchical social information modeling, are confusing and lack coherence.
- The definitions and construction of community nodes and the community graph are not clearly explained, hindering understanding of the social network modeling aspect.
- The related work section is incomplete, missing several relevant social recommendation approaches.
- The presentation contains grammatical errors and lacks clarity in certain sections, affecting readability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivations behind the technical components, ensuring coherence in their explanations. Additionally, please provide a detailed explanation of the community node construction process, including criteria and techniques for grouping nodes. To enhance the related work section, include discussions of relevant social recommendation approaches that were previously omitted. We also suggest optimizing the text expression for better readability and separating definitions and problem statements into distinct paragraphs. Furthermore, please discuss the performance trends related to parameter value changes and report the recommendation time cost.
