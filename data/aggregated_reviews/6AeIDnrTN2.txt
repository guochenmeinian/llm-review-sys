Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents LightGaussian, a three-stage technique for efficiently reducing the number of Gaussian primitives in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) models. The first stage involves pruning redundant Gaussian primitives based on a global significance score, rather than opacity. The second stage employs spherical harmonics (SH) distillation, utilizing data augmentation from synthesized pseudo views. The final stage implements vector quantization of the SH coefficients. LightGaussian achieves approximately 15x compression while maintaining competitive rendering quality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. LightGaussian introduces a novel pruning strategy based on global significance, alongside SH distillation and vector quantization techniques, effectively reducing both primitive and feature redundancy.
2. The method functions as a plugin, applicable to any GS representation model.
3. A comprehensive ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.
4. The approach significantly improves rendering speed while efficiently reducing the number of Gaussian primitives.
5. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
1. **Lack of necessary experimental analysis.** The authors do not provide adequate analysis in the experimental results section, particularly regarding comparisons with Compressed 3D-GS and Compact 3D-GS. The focus on NeRF is excessive, and visual quality performance distinctions are unclear in Table 1, where Compressed 3D-GS lacks qualitative FPS data.
2. **Lack of novelty.** The method appears to be a post-processing approach to 3D-GS, lacking essential characteristics compared to Scaffold-GS, which proposes a hierarchical representation. A comparison with Scaffold-GS and HAC in terms of experimental results and analysis would be beneficial.
3. **Poor layout formatting.** Figure 7 suffers from incorrect typesetting, compromising readability, and Figure 6's comparisons are not clearly distinguishable.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental analysis by providing a detailed comparison of compression GS methods, including Compressed 3D-GS and Compact 3D-GS, and include FPS and training time comparisons. Additionally, it would enhance the paper to compare LightGaussian with Scaffold-GS and HAC for a more comprehensive evaluation. We also suggest clarifying the motivation behind the three technical contributions to establish a coherent storyline. Furthermore, addressing the technical details, such as the design of Eq. (3) and the rationale behind the global significance score, would strengthen the manuscript. Lastly, we recommend correcting the layout issues in Figures 6 and 7 to improve clarity.
