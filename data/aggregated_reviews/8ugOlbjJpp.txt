### Key Points
This paper presents a study of private Stochastic Saddle Points (SSP) and Variational Inequalities (SVI) beyond Euclidean geometry, proving a near-optimal bound on the SP-gap for geometry between $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$. The authors propose a recursive regularization framework, providing convergence guarantees and sample complexity for convex-concave problems, and extend their results to SVI while incorporating differential privacy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The results represent a solid improvement over previous work, with a novel method for addressing generalization issues.  
- The proposed algorithm achieves optimal excess error measured by the strong SP-gap and recovers many existing optimal results using different proof techniques.  
- The work is the first to address SSPs and SVIs in general non-Euclidean settings, with nearly optimal rates.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks clarity in its presentation, making it difficult to parse many sections.  
- The subroutine $A_{emp}$ is not formally defined, leading to confusion regarding its role and implementation.  
- The boundedness assumption is restrictive, and some important assumptions in theorems are not fully rationalized.  
- The paper's flow and results are somewhat similar to [BGM23], raising concerns about incremental contributions.  
- Numerous typographical errors are present throughout the document.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation, particularly by explicitly defining the subroutine $A_{emp}$ and providing concrete examples as claimed in the text. Additionally, the authors should clarify the algorithmic novelty compared to previous work, especially in relation to [BGM23]. To enhance the motivation for considering non-Euclidean geometry, we suggest including practical examples that illustrate its necessity. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to ensure that the paper is self-contained by including more details in the supplementary materials and addressing the numerous typographical errors. Finally, we recommend conducting numerical experiments to demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed methods.
