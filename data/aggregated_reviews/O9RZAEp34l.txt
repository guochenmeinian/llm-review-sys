Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of Transformer models, specifically BERT, in the context of low-rank matrix completion framed as a masked language modeling (MLM) task. The authors observe a notable algorithmic shift during training, where the model transitions from copying input to accurately predicting masked entries. They conduct detailed experiments, including probing studies, to analyze the model's learning dynamics and internal representations, contributing to a mechanistic understanding of Transformer behavior.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper proposes an intriguing approach by linking low-rank matrix completion with MLM, potentially leveraging NLP techniques for this application.
2. The experiments are thorough, with clear descriptions of data preprocessing, training, and performance metrics.
3. The identification of an algorithmic shift during training is a significant observation, providing insights into the model's learning dynamics.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a deep theoretical analysis of the algorithmic shift and the model's learning mechanisms, particularly in the second stage.
2. The experimental setting is limited, focusing on small-scale matrices (up to 15x15) and using only uniform distribution for synthetic data generation, raising concerns about scalability and generalizability.
3. The contribution feels preliminary, with insufficient insights into how the Transformer performs mathematical tasks beyond the observed phenomena.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical discussion surrounding the algorithmic shift and provide a more detailed analysis of the internal mechanisms involved in matrix decomposition. Additionally, consider expanding the experimental framework to include various distributions and larger matrices to assess generalization capabilities. We also suggest conducting ablation studies to investigate the impact of model size and attention head configurations on convergence speed and performance. Finally, a deeper exploration of the implications of the findings for real-world tasks and connections to related works on the grokking phenomenon would enhance the paper's contribution.
