Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a pioneering investigation into the security vulnerabilities of cross-modality person re-identification (ReID) systems, specifically through the introduction of the Cross-Modality Perturbation Synergy (CMPS) attack. The authors propose a universal perturbation attack method that utilizes gradient information from both RGB and infrared images to generate effective perturbations across modalities. Experimental results on the RegDB and SYSU datasets demonstrate that the CMPS method significantly reduces the accuracy of ReID models, outperforming traditional attack methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper fills a critical gap by addressing security vulnerabilities in cross-modality ReID systems, marking it as the first study in this area.
2. The innovative CMPS attack leverages gradient information from multiple modalities, providing both theoretical originality and practical validation.
3. Comprehensive experimental results convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
4. The writing quality is high, with clear and concise explanations that enhance accessibility.

Weaknesses:
1. The use of random grayscale transformations raises questions about the nature of the grayscale images utilizedâ€”are they based on visible light, infrared, or both?
2. The intended meaning of the decision boundary in Figure 2 is unclear, and Figure 3 lacks clarity.
3. The method's validation on additional datasets, such as the LLCM dataset, is recommended for broader applicability.
4. The overall loss function and the relationship between the functions discussed in Sections 3.2 and 3.4 require clarification.
5. The experimental results in Table 1 need to specify which search mode was used.
6. The authors should consider a more diverse selection of baseline models to enhance the generalizability of their findings.
7. The integration of grayscale images in Algorithm 1 and the ablation experiments in Table 3 needs further explanation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Figures 2 and 3 to better convey their intended messages. Additionally, the authors should clarify the nature of the grayscale images used and the overall loss function, as well as the relationship between the functions in Sections 3.2 and 3.4. It would be beneficial to validate the method on a wider range of datasets, including the LLCM dataset, and to discuss the experimental results in Table 1 in relation to both all-search and indoor-search modes. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors select a more diverse array of baseline models to verify the generalizability of their method. Lastly, providing more explanatory text in complex sections, such as "3.2 Optimizing Loss Functions for Attacking," would enhance understanding for a broader audience.
