Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new postprocessing method, CSD-iPOT, for survival analysis that aims to achieve both marginal and conditional calibration using conformal prediction. The authors refine the Conformalized Survival Distribution (CSD) approach and evaluate CSD-iPOT on 15 datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving calibration without significantly affecting discriminative performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses the important problem of building well-calibrated survival analysis models, particularly focusing on conditional calibration.
- It is well-written and provides extensive experimental results across multiple datasets, showing promising improvements in calibration.
- The theoretical guarantees for marginal and conditional calibration, as well as the computational efficiency of CSD-iPOT, are notable contributions.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion on the hardness of achieving conditional calibration, which is critical given its complexity.
- The technical novelty compared to CSD is limited, as both methods utilize a similar post-processing approach.
- Some sections are difficult to follow, and the experimental results do not convincingly demonstrate the practical benefits of CSD-iPOT over CSD.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the challenges of achieving conditional calibration, citing relevant literature to enhance the theoretical foundation. Additionally, clarifying the differences between CSD and CSD-iPOT through intuitive visualizations would aid understanding. The authors should also ensure that all assumptions are clearly stated before proofs and address the discrepancies between the theoretical guarantees and experimental implementations, particularly regarding the impact of the parameter \( R \). Lastly, we encourage the authors to benchmark against competitive baseline models that directly model event times for a more comprehensive evaluation.
