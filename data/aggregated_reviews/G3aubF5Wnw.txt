Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new analysis of the GP-UCB algorithm, demonstrating that it achieves sub-linear regret, although not optimal, thereby partially addressing an open question in the field. The authors introduce a self-normalized martingale inequality for infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and improve regret bounds by tuning the regularization parameter according to kernel smoothness. The study reveals that GP-UCB, when properly regularized, can provide nearly optimal regret rates for kernels with polynomial eigendecay, including the Matern kernel. Additionally, the authors propose a novel contribution by effectively trading off regularization with effective dimension, asserting that their results are relevant to the NeurIPS community.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces a novel self-normalized concentration inequality and a technique for regularization that simplifies the analysis of GP-UCB.  
- The contribution is recognized as novel and technically sound, with neat and strong bounds derived.  
- The technique of tuning the regularization parameter based on kernel smoothness is innovative and has potential applications in other contexts.  
- The results are deemed relevant to the NeurIPS community, suggesting potential impact.

Weaknesses:  
- The claimed contribution regarding self-normalized concentration is not novel, as it has been established in prior work.  
- The presentation lacks clarity, making it less accessible to non-experts, and certain technical details, such as the derivation of Theorem 1, are inadequately addressed.  
- A major revision of the paper is recommended to enhance clarity and depth.  
- The paper does not fully resolve the open question posed by Vakili et al., and the authors' conjecture regarding the impossibility of closing the gap with existing bounds is not sufficiently explored.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation, particularly in Section 1, by providing more background on the Matern kernel and its trade-offs with other kernels. Additionally, we suggest including a comparison table of bounds with previous analyses to enhance accessibility. The authors should clarify the distinction between their contributions and existing results, particularly regarding the self-normalized concentration. Furthermore, a more rigorous treatment of the residual term in the analysis and a thorough discussion of the implications of varying the regularization parameter $\rho$ with respect to $T$ would strengthen the paper. Finally, conducting comprehensive experiments to support the theoretical findings would provide valuable insights into the practical implications of their results. We also recommend addressing the comments from Reviewer x2D4 and incorporating the suggested revisions to better serve both the authors and the community.
