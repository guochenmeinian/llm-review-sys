Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a unifying framework called reciprocal learning that generalizes various machine learning algorithms through iterative data and parameter learning. It provides convergence results under specific regularity conditions, detailing when and how quickly these algorithms converge to an approximately optimal model. The framework encompasses diverse learning scenarios, including active learning, bandits, and self-training, and offers generic results on convergence and non-convergence.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper rigorously defines conditions and results using proper notation, enhancing readability and reproducibility.  
2. The reciprocal learning framework is sufficiently general to include multiple ML algorithms, contributing significantly to the ML theory literature.  
3. It offers a novel perspective on convergence guarantees, potentially fostering new interactions among researchers across various areas.

Weaknesses:  
1. The paper lacks empirical studies to validate theoretical results, such as those in Section 5, which could be tested with examples from Section 3.  
2. The convergence results are limited to phenomena like Lipschitz continuity and strong convexity, failing to capture broader insights.  
3. The presentation is informal and rushed, making it difficult for researchers from different areas to engage with the content effectively.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical validation of their theoretical results by including examples, such as validating Theorem 3 through Thompson sampling bandits. Additionally, we suggest starting with a specific example, such as binary classification, before generalizing, to enhance clarity in the introduction. It would be beneficial to expand on how Theorem 1 can be generalized to multi-class classification in the Appendix. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to refine the presentation to ensure it is suitable for a diverse audience, providing clear definitions and context for terms and concepts introduced throughout the paper. Lastly, addressing the connections between their framework and algorithmic stability, as well as generalization guarantees, would strengthen the paper's relevance and applicability.
