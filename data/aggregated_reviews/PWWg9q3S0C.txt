### Key Points
This paper presents the first dataset for emotion recognition in code-mixed conversations, named E-MaSaC, and proposes COFFEE, a method for extracting commonsense knowledge from English knowledge graphs to integrate with dialogue context. The authors aim to advance research in emotion recognition in code-mixed settings, which has not been previously explored.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The creation of the E-MaSaC dataset is a significant contribution, facilitating future research on emotion recognition in code-mixed conversations.  
- COFFEE demonstrates a novel approach to leveraging commonsense knowledge in this context, validated through quantitative and qualitative analyses.  
- The paper is well-written and presents a relevant contribution to the fields of emotion recognition and code-mixing.

Weaknesses:  
- Some dataset details are lacking, which could hinder reproducibility.  
- The improvements from COFFEE over baseline models are relatively modest.  
- The section on ChatGPT appears disconnected from the main structure of the paper, and performance metrics are not clearly reported.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset description by providing additional details on the deep learning methods used for emotion recognition and clarifying the average lengths of conversations and utterances, including standard deviations. Additionally, we suggest incorporating the ChatGPT model earlier in the experimental section for better coherence. It would also be beneficial to include a table for annotator agreement on emotion labels and clarify how multiple applicable emotion labels were handled. Furthermore, addressing the performance of the commonsense extraction when only considering English words in conversation turns would enhance the analysis. Lastly, we advise rephrasing claims in the abstract to avoid confusion regarding the novelty of integrating commonsense knowledge with dialogue context.
