### Key Points
This paper presents a novel online aggregation algorithm for consolidating p-values, which is compelling for its intended use case. The authors also introduce advanced techniques for watermark detection, moving beyond simple text-level classification to effectively identify watermark segments within long, mixed-source texts. They utilize the geometric cover trick and the Alligator algorithm from online learning to achieve efficient and accurate detection and localization of watermark segments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The online aggregation algorithm is well-suited for the problem at hand.  
- The practical use cases for the proposed techniques are thoroughly discussed.  
- The authors demonstrate impressive results in watermark detection, showcasing advancements over existing methods.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper's readability is hindered by a significant amount of implementation details and theoretical complexity, which could be relegated to the appendix.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper's readability by moving some of the implementation details and theoretical complexity to the appendix. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the distinction between their method and existing watermark detection algorithms, such as KGW and Unigram, to better contextualize their contributions.
