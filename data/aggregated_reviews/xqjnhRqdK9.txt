### Key Points
This paper presents a federated graph anomaly detection method that utilizes disentangled representation learning to address challenges in cross-client anomaly detection tasks. The authors propose separating node features into intrinsic and subgraph-style components, employing a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to generate negative node pairs and enhance feature disentanglement. The method constructs a global shared node pool from local feature spaces to facilitate local model training while maintaining data privacy. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness, supported by a comprehensive time complexity analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a significant and timely issue in graph anomaly detection, contributing valuable insights to the field.
2. A thorough time complexity analysis is provided, demonstrating the method's efficiency.
3. The experimental results show robustness, with detailed reporting of results and standard deviations.

Weaknesses:
1. Presentation issues hinder clarity, including inconsistent notation, ambiguous symbols, and vague explanations that reduce readability.
2. The motivation for key design choices, such as disentangled representation learning and the use of autoencoders, is insufficiently justified.
3. Assumptions regarding pseudo-node selection lack practical support, raising concerns about their validity.
4. The experimental section is inadequately detailed, particularly regarding the anomaly injection method and comparisons with relevant baseline methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper's presentation by addressing the inconsistent notation and ambiguous symbols, possibly by including a table summarizing key symbols. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the motivation behind using disentangled representation learning for graph anomaly detection and provide a more robust justification for their design choices. To strengthen the assumptions regarding pseudo-node selection, we encourage the authors to provide additional evidence or analysis. Furthermore, a comprehensive description of the anomaly injection process and a comparison with recent relevant studies, such as the June 2024 TNNLS paper, would enhance the experimental validation. Lastly, we advise the authors to consider discussing the implications of overlapping nodes in practical applications and how the proposed method might adapt to such scenarios.
