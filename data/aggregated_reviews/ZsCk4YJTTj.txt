### Key Points
This paper presents the Unveils Discrete Clues (UDC) framework, which aims to enhance the semantic representation of rare diseases by integrating textual knowledge and collaborative (CO) signals into a unified semantic space through Discrete Representation Learning (DRL). The authors propose innovative methodologies such as condition-aware modeling, task-aware calibration, and co-teacher distillation, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness through comprehensive experiments on multiple medical datasets, including MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, and eICU.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The integration of DRL, textual knowledge, and CO signals provides a novel solution for rare disease representation.
2. The paper includes extensive experimental evaluations, including ablation studies and robustness tests, showcasing the model's efficacy.
3. The framework's adaptability across various predictive models and language models highlights its practical applicability.

Weaknesses:
1. Key concepts, such as "co-signal" and "Co-teacher Distillation," lack thorough explanations, which may hinder understanding.
2. The paper contains complex sentences that affect readability and clarity.
3. Some methodological components are not well-motivated, leaving questions about their necessity and design choices.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of key concepts, particularly "co-signal" in EHRs and the purpose of "Co-teacher Distillation," by providing detailed explanations in the methodology section. Additionally, we suggest supplementing the study with a temporal performance analysis to evaluate the efficiency of the relatively complex model. Simplifying lengthy sentences and enhancing the notation guide would also improve readability. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the design choices behind their methodologies to strengthen the paper's motivation and coherence.
