Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a pretraining framework for molecular conformations that incorporates both equilibrium and off-equilibrium data, defining pre-training objectives for force field learning. The authors propose a novel denoising term and demonstrate the effectiveness of their method through experimental results, which validate the use of additional off-equilibrium data. They also provide a diverse dataset of polymers for the community.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and organized, clearly presenting the significance of force-centric pretraining for molecular systems. The proposed framework yields impressive results in molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemistry property predictions.
2. The introduction of the de-noising equilibrium balance and off-equilibrium co-training method is innovative and necessary for advancing pre-training in 3D molecular property prediction.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the proposed method is limited, as similar denoised pretraining strategies have been previously published, making the contribution primarily about introducing additional data.
2. The experimental results do not convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, as it often does not outperform existing baseline methods.
3. The choice of a weak baseline model (TorchMDNet) raises concerns about the validity of the results, and the lack of an ablation study to isolate the contributions of the equilibrium and denoising objectives is a significant oversight.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their work by conducting a detailed ablation study on the de-noising equilibrium and force regularization tasks. Additionally, incorporating results from the PCQM4Mv2 homo-lumo prediction into the downstream analysis would provide a competitive benchmark for evaluating model performance. It is crucial to repeat experiments using a stronger baseline model, such as NequIP, to validate the proposed improvements. Finally, we suggest including partial charge prediction during the pretraining or downstream stages of the framework, as this could enhance the model's overall effectiveness and applicability.
