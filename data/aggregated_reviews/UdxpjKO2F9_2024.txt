Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method called GENIE for assessing novelty in unsupervised environment design (UED), which aims to enhance the training of reinforcement learning agents by prioritizing environments with high exploration potential. The authors utilize a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to quantify the novelty of state-action distributions from previously sampled levels, demonstrating improved empirical results across various domains compared to existing methods like PLR and ACCEL.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach effectively serves as an intrinsic reward, guiding the agent towards environments that yield higher information gain.
- Empirical results indicate significant improvements over baseline methods in three relevant domains.
- The evaluation protocol employed is robust and the ablation studies are clear and logical.

Weaknesses:
- The assumption of independent transitions may not hold in more complex environments where sequential actions are necessary.
- The name "GENIE" is already associated with other works, which could lead to confusion.
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion of how its novelty quantification relates to existing curiosity-driven approaches in reinforcement learning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by addressing the following points:
- Discuss how the proposed method integrates with existing curiosity-based approaches and clarify its contributions to this literature.
- Provide visual comparisons of generated levels across methods to illustrate the diversity and novelty achieved.
- Consider renaming GENIE to avoid confusion with other works.
- Include a more detailed exploration of the limitations, particularly regarding the independence of transitions and the potential for representational shifts in CNN preprocessing.
- Clarify the role of order and diversity in the context of the curriculum presented to the agent, ensuring that the discussion accurately reflects the intended meaning.
