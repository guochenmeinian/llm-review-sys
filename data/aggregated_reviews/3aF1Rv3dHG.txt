### Key Points
This paper presents a unified pretraining framework that models communities, users, and textual content through a ternary heterogeneous graph. It employs graph-based approaches and two self-supervised tasks—attribution generation and link generation—to pre-train the graph, demonstrating improved performance in 4 out of 5 downstream tasks related to social media. The experimental results indicate that the proposed framework effectively leverages structural and semantic information, particularly from Reddit data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- It provides practical value in online community modeling and demonstrates significant improvements over baselines on five real-world datasets.
- Extensive empirical analysis, including ablation studies, supports the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Weaknesses:
- The pretraining dataset is small, focusing only on the top 2% of subreddits, which may overlook less active communities.
- The framework's treatment of text as nodes may lead to a large number of nodes, limiting its utility, and the rationale for this choice is unclear.
- The pretraining tasks neglect community and user nodes, potentially undermining the model's comprehensiveness.
- The novelty is limited, as the framework builds on existing models like HGT and XLNet without clear differentiation.
- The generalizability of the model to datasets beyond Reddit is uncertain.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the pretraining dataset by including a broader range of subreddits to enhance community representation. Additionally, consider alternative approaches to modeling text, such as treating textual information as user node features. Clarifying the use of two matrices for each relation type in section 2.1.2 would strengthen the technical explanation. The authors should also address the lack of community and user node integration in the pretraining tasks. Lastly, providing a clearer distinction of the framework's novelty and its comparison to established methods like Deep Graph Infomax would enhance the paper's contribution.
