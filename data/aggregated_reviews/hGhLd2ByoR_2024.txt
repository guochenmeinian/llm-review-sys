Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a critical examination of existing unsupervised methods for discovering latent knowledge from large language model (LLM) activations, particularly focusing on Contrastive-Consistent Search (CCS). The authors demonstrate that CCS may not effectively uncover true knowledge, as it can fit arbitrary features that meet specific conditions. Through experiments, they reveal that CCS can be misled by random words and irrelevant texts, and is sensitive to prompt variations. The authors propose general principles for future research in unsupervised LLM task discovery but do not offer concrete solutions to the identified issues.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well-written and presents interesting observations about existing methods for knowledge discovery in LLMs. The theoretical analysis is robust and supported by extensive experiments, providing valuable insights for the research community.

Weaknesses:  
The paper lacks novelty and does not provide definitive solutions to the problems identified with existing unsupervised methods. The analysis primarily critiques CCS without offering a broader perspective on unsupervised learning. Additionally, the experiments lack variability and do not sufficiently explore the sensitivity of CCS to different prompts and algorithms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by conducting more experiments on various LLMs to validate their claims further. It would be beneficial to provide concrete solutions to address the limitations of existing unsupervised methods. Additionally, we suggest simplifying the mathematical notation in Section 3 and enhancing the analysis of CCS's sensitivity to prompts and algorithm design. Finally, addressing the questions raised regarding the performance of CCS on real datasets with multiple valid solutions would strengthen the paper's contributions.
