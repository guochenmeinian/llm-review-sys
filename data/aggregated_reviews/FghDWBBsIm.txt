### Key Points
This paper presents a novel data augmentation method for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE), focusing on a generator that generates new sentences based on labels and syntactic templates. The authors introduce fluency and alignment discriminators to optimize the generator through a reinforcement learning framework, demonstrating improved performance across various ASTE models through extensive experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper is clearly written and easy to follow.  
2. The experimental results are promising, showcasing the efficacy of the method across multiple ASTE models and data augmentation baselines.  
3. The idea of automatically training a generator for augmenting ASTE datasets is innovative and effective.  

Weaknesses:  
1. Limited benchmark datasets, as experiments are conducted on only two ASTE benchmarks; additional datasets like 15Rest and 16Rest of ASTE-Data-v2 could enhance validation.  
2. Unclear baseline selection for data augmentation comparisons; the authors should clarify the rationale behind their choices.  
3. Potential noise from the accuracy of pseudo labels and discriminators, which may affect performance; the authors need to address how to balance benefits and noise.  
4. The effectiveness of the PPO algorithm may be influenced by the performance of the discriminators, necessitating further clarification on achieving effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the diversity of benchmark datasets by including additional datasets such as 15Rest and 16Rest of ASTE-Data-v2. We also suggest clarifying the selection process for data augmentation baselines to enhance transparency. Additionally, addressing the potential noise introduced by pseudo labels and discriminators is crucial, and the authors should provide insights on how to mitigate these issues. Finally, it would be beneficial to elaborate on the parameters used in the PPO algorithm and how the performance of the discriminators impacts its effectiveness.
