### Key Points
This paper presents an approach for multilingual vision and language tasks by dividing the process into two stages: English caption generation and cross-lingual natural language understanding. The authors report state-of-the-art results on partial tasks of XVNLI and MaRVL, demonstrating the effectiveness of their method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed idea is straightforward and intuitive, achieving state-of-the-art results on certain tasks.  
- The paper is easy to follow and presents clear results that outperform existing strong baselines in multiple languages.  

Weaknesses:  
- The method's two-stage setup may limit generalizability beyond XNLI, and it does not consistently yield better average results for both XVNLI and MaRVL.  
- The paper lacks detailed implementation and experimental setup descriptions, making reproducibility challenging. Additionally, there is insufficient citation of related work, and baseline models are not well introduced.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental setup and provide more details on the implementation of the proposed method. Specifically, the authors should clarify how image captions are generated from OFA-large, detail the evaluation process in the zero-shot setting, and describe the training methodology for downstream tasks. Furthermore, we suggest including English translations for non-English captions in Figure 1 and redrawing Figure 3 for better clarity. Finally, addressing the performance discrepancies noted in the results would enhance the paper's robustness.
