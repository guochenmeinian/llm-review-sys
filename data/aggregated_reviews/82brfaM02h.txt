### Key Points
This paper presents a low/no-code package designed for training CNNs to decode EEG brain signals and visualize results through a GUI. The authors propose a structured decoding pipeline that includes data loading, preprocessing, training, and interpretation, utilizing saliency maps and confusion matrices as interpretative metrics. While the results align with empirical observations in neurology, the paper lacks a thorough discussion on the choice, accuracy, and evaluation of the three CNN models, particularly in comparison to more recent state-of-the-art methods. The visualization software platform is identified as the main contribution, but its unique functionality relative to existing tools like braindecode and EPViz remains unclear.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The package is well-designed and could be beneficial for EEG researchers.
- The automatic generation of auxiliary figures and latent feature analysis adds value.
- The authors provide a comprehensive overview of existing open-source EEG signal analysis tools.

Weaknesses:
- Limited novelty in the contribution to the field, as the models and interpretability metrics are largely derived from existing literature.
- Insufficient discussion on the evaluation and comparison of the CNN models with state-of-the-art methods.
- The additional functionality of the visualization tool compared to existing software is not clearly articulated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the choice, accuracy, and evaluation of the CNN models, particularly in relation to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the unique functionalities of their visualization tool compared to existing software like braindecode and EPViz. Expanding on these aspects would enhance the paper's contributions and provide clearer insights into its significance in the field.
