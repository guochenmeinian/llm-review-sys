### Key Points
This paper explores social dynamics and resilience by analyzing multimedia content from Hindi films and integrating it with community data from developed countries, utilizing Mathematical Artificial Intelligence (MAI) and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques. The authors propose a dataset of 100 songs related to social issues from Hindi films since 1951, analyzing audio, video, and lyrics, which provides valuable research data. The findings are significant for policymakers and practitioners, offering insights into societal behaviors and resilience.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Good mathematical and empirical observations.
- Comprehensive data collection from Hindi cinema and community datasets.
- Innovative integration of multimedia content analysis with AI techniques.
- Clear presentation of results with visual aids like SHAP values and performance metrics.
- Original approach combining cultural analysis with AI, providing significant implications for understanding societal dynamics.

Weaknesses:
- Shallow literature review and limited discussion on use case studies and future scope.
- Lack of punctuation in formulas and insufficient detail on AI model implementation.
- Cultural context limitations may restrict the applicability of findings to other regions.
- Omissions of significant factors in social systems, such as unique customs and religious influences, could impact research comprehensiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review to provide a more comprehensive context for their work. Additionally, expanding the dataset beyond Hindi cinema could enhance the generalizability of the findings. We suggest elaborating on the technical details of AI model implementation for better understanding and discussing the limitations and potential biases in data selection and analysis. Finally, considering the inclusion of other significant social factors could strengthen the comprehensiveness of the research findings.
