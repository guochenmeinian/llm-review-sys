Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new distribution of slices of the Sliced-Wasserstein distance, termed Energy-Based Sliced-Wasserstein (EBSW), within the energy-based model framework. The authors investigate the theoretical properties of EBSW and conduct numerical experiments, demonstrating its advantages over existing methods. The approach emphasizes non-uniform sampling of projections to enhance computational efficiency and accuracy in measuring distances between distributions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study is well-organized and clearly articulated, making it accessible.
- Theoretical insights are derived, contributing to the understanding of EBSW.
- Multiple sampling methods are proposed, showcasing the versatility of the approach.
- The experiments are well-motivated and demonstrate the efficacy of EBSW across various tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The method lacks comparison with the vanilla Distributional Sliced-Wasserstein method, which should serve as a baseline.
- The theoretical results could benefit from additional context regarding their implications for other Sliced-Wasserstein metrics.
- The experimental section is somewhat limited; a generative modeling experiment would enhance the application scope of EBSW.
- The role of the parameter $p$ is fixed across experiments, and further exploration of its impact is warranted.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison of EBSW with the vanilla Distributional Sliced-Wasserstein method to establish a clearer baseline. Additionally, providing a theorem on sample complexity would be beneficial for practical applications. We suggest elaborating on the theoretical results to highlight specific insights regarding EBSW compared to other Sliced-Wasserstein metrics. Including a generative modeling experiment would strengthen the empirical validation of the proposed method. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore varying the parameter $p$ in their experiments and discuss its implications on the performance of EBSW.
