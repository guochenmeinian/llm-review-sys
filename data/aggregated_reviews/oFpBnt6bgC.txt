Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Diff4Rec, an innovative learning-to-generate paradigm for sequential recommendation systems based on guided diffusion. The authors argue that traditional approaches, which rely on learning-to-classify with negative sampling, do not accurately reflect human behavior in identifying ideal items. Diff4Rec aims to generate these "oracle" items without a predefined candidate set, thereby discarding negative samples and directly modeling the data-generation process. The empirical results demonstrate that Diff4Rec outperforms existing models, suggesting a transformative methodology for recommendation systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors introduce a new learning-to-generate paradigm that utilizes a relatively novel diffusion model approach.
- The reproducibility of results is enhanced by the availability of code and hyperparameter settings.
- The methodology is clearly explained, particularly in the algorithms section.
- Significant improvements over baseline models are reported, although statistical significance analysis is lacking.

Weaknesses:
- A crucial step in the recommendation process—retrieving top nearest items to the generated oracle item—is not adequately discussed in the Method section, despite being mentioned in the Experiment section.
- The paper does not explicitly list the main contributions of the work.
- The use of footnotes is excessive; important information should be integrated into the main text.
- Table 1 lacks clarity regarding the presentation of percentages for HR@20 and NDCG@20.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the Method section by including a detailed discussion on how to retrieve top nearest items in the embedding space after generating the oracle item. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explicitly list the main contributions of their work to enhance clarity. To improve the readability of the paper, we advise integrating footnote content into the main text and ensuring that the presentation of results in Table 1 is unambiguous by adding (%) after HR@20 and NDCG@20. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to analyze the time and computational complexity of Diff4Rec and to consider including results from other diffusion model-based recommendation models as baselines to better illustrate the advantages of their approach.
