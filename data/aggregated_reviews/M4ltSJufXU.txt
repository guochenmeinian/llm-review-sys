### Key Points
This paper presents a novel technique for removing private information, specifically a person's name, from the CLIP text encoder using the concept of backdoor attacks. The authors propose injecting backdoors to unlearn specific human identities, demonstrated through experiments on OpenCLIP across multiple model architectures, including an ablation study of weight regularization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and easy to follow.
- Experimental studies encompass various model architectures and include an ablation study.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for the work is inadequately positioned, lacking a clear outline of flaws in existing methods for removing private information from the CLIP text encoder.
- There are potential typos in the equations that may cause confusion.
- The results presented in Fig 2 regarding the "Number of Removed Name" are not intuitive and require further explanation.
- The "Experimental Results" section is difficult to read and may benefit from reorganization.
- There is a need for additional ablation studies on different hyperparameter choices.
- The connection between the proposed technique and backdoor attacks is not clearly articulated, leading to confusion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the positioning of their motivation by clearly outlining the shortcomings of existing methods for removing private information. Additionally, please clarify the potential typos in the equations to avoid confusion. We suggest providing more intuitive explanations for the results in Fig 2 and reorganizing the "Experimental Results" paragraph for better readability. More ablation studies on different hyperparameter choices would enhance the robustness of the findings. Lastly, we encourage the authors to better describe the relationship between their technique and backdoor attacks, possibly by mapping concepts from their scenario to traditional backdoor scenarios.
