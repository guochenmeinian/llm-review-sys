### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for learning interpretable safety constraints from expert demonstrations using one-class decision trees. The authors propose this approach to improve the safety of reinforcement learning (RL) agents, which is a valuable yet under-explored area. The implementation steps are clearly outlined, and the test cases in autonomous driving simulations demonstrate the method's applicability to complex, safety-critical tasks. Additionally, transfer learning experiments provide some evidence of the generalizability of the learned constraints beyond isolated tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Clear explanations of the problem context, related work, and background.
- The interpretability of the learned logical constraints.
- Reduction in manual specification of constraints.
- Improved safety and performance over baselines in experiments.

Weaknesses:
- The quality of constraint learning heavily depends on the quality and size of expert demonstrations, risking overfitting and bias with the current dataset.
- More analysis is needed on the transferability of learned constraints, as performance may degrade across slightly different tasks.
- Lack of human evaluation or visual assessment to determine if learned constraints capture meaningful safe behavior.
- Evaluation is limited to simple simulation environments and one driving dataset.
- Absence of comparison with other constraint or rule inference methods limits the perceived benefits of the proposed approach.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the quality and size of expert demonstrations to mitigate overfitting and bias. Additionally, a more thorough investigation into the transferability of learned constraints across tasks is necessary. Incorporating human evaluation or visual assessments would enhance the validation of whether the learned constraints reflect meaningful safe behavior. Expanding the evaluation to include more diverse simulation environments and datasets would strengthen the findings. Finally, we suggest comparing the constraint quality with other constraint or rule inference methods to better highlight the advantages of the one-class decision tree approach.
