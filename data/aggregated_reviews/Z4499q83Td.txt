### Key Points
This paper presents a novel application of variational inference to Gaussian splatting for 3D scene reconstruction, contributing significantly to the field. The authors propose a closed-form update rule for the variational posterior, enabling continual learning without catastrophic forgetting and allowing updates from partial data with a single update step for each observation. The paper is well-structured, with detailed derivations and comprehensive comparisons to gradient-based methods, supported by thorough experimental results on Tiny ImageNet and the Blender dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The originality of applying variational inference to Gaussian splatting is a notable contribution.  
- The closed-form update rule facilitates continual learning and addresses limitations of traditional methods.  
- Clarity and structure of the paper are commendable, with detailed derivations and effective experimental validation.  

Weaknesses:  
- The computational cost of each update step in VBGS may become burdensome with very large datasets.  
- The deduction process regarding the number of components affecting model accuracy and stability requires further explanation.  
- The conclusion needs to strengthen the significance of results, incorporating quantitative reasoning and comparisons with appropriate benchmarks, particularly from previous work.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of how the number of components affects the accuracy and stability of the model. Additionally, please enhance the conclusion by summarizing the actions taken and results while emphasizing their significance through quantitative reasoning and comparisons with relevant benchmarks.
