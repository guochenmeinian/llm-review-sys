Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the ability of Transformers to learn representations that encode information about the transition dynamics and policies of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) by training them to predict the next state or action in Connect Four. The authors demonstrate that the models develop emergent representations of Q-values and MCTS values, evidenced by lower mean squared error (MSE) when predicting these values compared to a randomly initialized model.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is very clearly written, with a logical structure that is easy to follow.
- The experimental setup is simple yet effective, providing evidence for the main claim.
- The research question is well-defined, exploring whether language models can encode decision-making processes from game play history.
- The authors provide adequate background on MDPs, Q-learning, MCTS, and Connect Four, making the paper accessible to a broader audience.
- The experimental design is straightforward and reproducible.

Weaknesses:
- While the work is solid, it does not significantly advance understanding of neural network capabilities, as similar studies have been conducted with other games like Othello.
- The use of MSE as a primary evaluation metric lacks interpretability, and comparisons against a random baseline are limited, failing to demonstrate the depth of what the model has learned.
- The paper does not engage with existing debates regarding the validity of using probes to determine neural network representations, nor does it provide new insights into these discussions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the interpretability of the MSE metric and consider presenting more intuitive measures for action and state predictions. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons against more meaningful baselines to strengthen the evidence of the model's ability to learn underlying decision-making processes. Engaging with existing debates about neural network representation and providing insights into the limitations of using MSE would enhance the paper's contribution to the field.
