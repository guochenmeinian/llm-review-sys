Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of non-contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) methods, focusing on the differences between cosine and Euclidean loss functions. The authors investigate the learning dynamics using a linear network with Gaussian inputs, demonstrating that both loss functions exhibit implicit regularization effects. They propose a new isotropic loss to enhance convergence rates and performance. The analysis includes the roles of predictor and stop-grad operations, and the authors claim that their new loss function outperforms existing methods without requiring an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) target network.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The theoretical analysis is novel and enhances understanding of how loss functions and operations affect non-contrastive SSL performance.  
- The proposed isotropic loss shows potential for superior performance across various datasets, validating the theoretical insights.  
- The paper provides a solid discussion on learning dynamics, particularly regarding cosine similarity loss, which is often overlooked in existing literature.

Weaknesses:  
- The reliance on a linear network and iid Gaussian inputs raises concerns about the applicability of findings to real-world scenarios.  
- The paper lacks a clear introduction to key techniques, such as the neural tangent kernel (NTK), which may confuse readers.  
- The accuracy of the baseline model (BYOL) is lower than expected, which undermines the claims regarding the effectiveness of the isotropic loss.  
- The analysis of eigenvalues and their dynamics is insufficiently connected to the theoretical framework, leaving several questions unanswered.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction by providing a more detailed overview of the techniques used, particularly the NTK. Additionally, we suggest that the authors address the discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental results, especially regarding the convergence rates of eigenvalues. It would be beneficial to include a discussion on the implications of EMA and weight decay in the context of their findings. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the relationship between the proposed isotropic loss and existing theories, such as those presented by Zhuo et al., to enhance the theoretical grounding of their work. Lastly, we recommend revisiting the baseline model's performance to ensure that it accurately reflects the state-of-the-art results.
