Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework named TopoFR for face recognition (FR), addressing the challenges of preserving structural information in FR datasets. The authors identify three key observations: (i) the complexity of topological structure in pixel space increases with data volume; (ii) the structural difference between pixel and latent feature spaces grows with data size; and (iii) deeper network architectures reduce structural discrepancies between these spaces. To enhance generalization performance, TopoFR introduces a Perturbation-guided Topological Structure Alignment (PTSA) strategy, which encodes pixel space structure into latent space. It employs a hard sample mining strategy, SDE, to minimize the impact of difficult samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TopoFR outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is clearly written and well-motivated, presenting an innovative approach to leverage dataset structure for improved FR model generalization.
- The use of GUM statistical distribution in the hard sample mining strategy SDE is a novel perspective on outlier detection in FR.
- Experimental results indicate state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, including a strong ranking in the MFR competition.

Weaknesses:
- The applicability of the method to recent loss functions, such as AdaFace, is unclear; additional experiments are recommended to validate its universality.
- The paper lacks a comparison of the model's GFLOPs, which would provide a clearer understanding of computational costs.
- The performance improvements on certain benchmarks appear minor compared to prior methods, raising questions about the incremental nature of the approach.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Formula 7 and provide a more detailed explanation of H0 in Figure 1. Additionally, the authors should visualize feature distributions in the latent space using PCA or T-SNE to substantiate claims regarding the improvement of topological structures. Discussing the broader impact of the proposed method and including experiments to validate its applicability to AdaFace would enhance the paper's comprehensiveness. Lastly, we suggest including GFLOPs comparisons to better illustrate the model's computational efficiency.
