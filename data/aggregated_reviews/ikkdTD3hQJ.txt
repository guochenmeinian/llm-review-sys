Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel task called All-Inclusive Multi-Level Segmentation (AIMS), which segments images into three levels: part, entity, and relation. The authors propose a unified AIMS model that utilizes multi-dataset multi-task training, task complementarity, and a mask prompt encoder to tackle annotation inconsistency and task correlation challenges. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various segmentation tasks and datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The AIMS task is innovative, integrating several recent tasks and unifying multi-level segmentation using a transformer architecture.
- The Task Correlation Module and R-E Complementarity Module are effectively validated through experiments.
- The mask prompt design is intriguing for multi-dataset segmentation, addressing incomplete annotations across datasets.
- Comprehensive ablation studies show promising performance compared to recent methods like PanopticPartFormer++ and SAM.

Weaknesses:
- Presentation issues include missing citations and details, making it difficult to assess the benefits of certain components.
- Several relevant papers are not cited, particularly those related to part-whole modeling and multi-task query interaction.
- The teaser could be more engaging, highlighting differences from previous segmentation settings.
- A comprehensive ablation study is lacking, particularly regarding the impact of individual modules.
- Clarifications are needed on the prompt mask's acquisition and its implications during inference.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation by adding missing citations and clarifying the benefits of specific components. Additionally, please include discussions of relevant literature on part-whole modeling and multi-task query interaction in the related work section. We suggest enhancing the teaser to better illustrate the novelty of the AIMS task. A comprehensive ablation study should be conducted to evaluate the performance of individual modules. Lastly, clarifications on the prompt mask's usage and its impact on inference should be provided.
