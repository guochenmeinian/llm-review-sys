### Key Points
This paper presents an attempt to derive a symbolic expression to explain Type IIP supernova (SN) light curves using symbolic regression. The authors utilize a generated dataset sampled from a grid of possible values and employ PySR for their analysis. The study addresses a phenomenon that appears to be a hidden law rather than a known physics law, which adds to its interest, particularly for symbolic regression researchers without a physics background.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The exploration of symbolic regression to uncover hidden laws in astrophysics is innovative and relevant.  
- The practical implications for both the workshop and the symbolic regression community are significant, warranting acceptance.  

Weaknesses:  
- Key terms such as "IIP" and the distinction between "SN" and "SNe" are not defined.  
- The methodology, particularly the heuristic nature of selecting the "best" expression, lacks justification.  
- The clarity of the light curve units and the significance of the achieved MSE values are not adequately addressed.  
- The plots (Figs. 3 and 4) are excessively large and could be displayed horizontally.  
- There are minor grammatical issues, such as "35% of our light curve sample" needing correction to "35% of our light curve samples."  
- The interpretability of the resulting expression with estimated constants in Eq. (3) is questionable due to its complexity.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of key terms, specifically defining "IIP" and the difference between "SN" and "SNe." Additionally, we urge the authors to provide justification for the heuristic method used to select the "best" expression. It is essential to clarify the units of the light curve and the significance of the MSE values achieved. We suggest resizing the plots (Figs. 3 and 4) for better presentation and correcting the grammatical error regarding the light curve samples. Lastly, we recommend that the authors address the interpretability of the resulting expression in Eq. (3) to enhance its comprehensibility.
