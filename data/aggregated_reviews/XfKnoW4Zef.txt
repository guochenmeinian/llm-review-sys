Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents RoboSMPLX, a framework aimed at enhancing whole-body pose and shape estimation from monocular images, addressing the significant impact of bounding box quality on model performance. The authors propose three modules: a Localization Module for improved awareness of subject location and semantics, a Contrastive Feature Extraction Module utilizing contrastive loss for robustness against augmentations, and a Pixel Alignment Module to ensure accurate mesh reprojection. The effectiveness of RoboSMPLX is demonstrated through extensive experiments across various benchmarks. Additionally, the paper discusses a multi-stage pipeline for estimating body, hand, and face poses simultaneously, which includes a body subnetwork that reportedly enhances hand and face detection. However, the performance of the body subnetwork is questioned, as it does not compete well with state-of-the-art methods like HybrIK and CLIFF. The evaluation of the proposed method's robustness in real-world scenarios is also a concern, particularly regarding its performance on the AGORA dataset compared to OS-X and PyMAF-X.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and reader-friendly, with a compelling motivation that highlights the limitations of current methods.
- The proposed method is sound, supported by extensive experiments and a thorough ablation study, showcasing its robustness to variations in crop size and alignment.
- The empirical study on the impact of three modules is crucial for understanding the method's contributions.
- The authors demonstrate openness to feedback and willingness to incorporate additional comparisons, particularly with PyMAF-X.

Weaknesses:
- Claims regarding the novelty of contrastive learning in mesh recovery are inaccurate, as prior works have utilized similar approaches. The authors should moderate their claims and discuss related literature more thoroughly.
- The body subnetwork's performance is not competitive against leading methods, raising doubts about the source of performance gains.
- The evaluation lacks comprehensive comparisons, particularly with newer datasets like RICH and BEDLAM, which could enhance the robustness assessment.
- The contributions of two modules are seen as incremental, lacking significant innovation, and the benchmark comparisons are misleading due to a lack of comprehensive comparisons, particularly with the recent method PyMAF-X.
- Misstatements regarding dataset annotations and the nature of existing methods lead to confusion about the proposed method's standing in the field.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related work, particularly regarding the use of contrastive learning in mesh recovery, to provide a more balanced perspective. Additionally, the authors should include a more comprehensive evaluation of robustness in real-world scenarios and ensure that all relevant competitors are included in the experiments, particularly incorporating more diverse and accurate datasets such as RICH and BEDLAM. It would also be beneficial to report total parameters, FLOPs, and fps to address concerns about computational complexity. Furthermore, we suggest providing comprehensive results in Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, including comparisons with recent state-of-the-art methods, to clarify performance gaps and enhance the paper's rigor. Lastly, we encourage the authors to address the concerns regarding the classification of OpenPose keypoints as ground truth and to clarify the role of detection networks in their evaluations.
