### Key Points
This paper presents a novel pre-training method for implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR) that effectively leverages large amounts of explicit discourse data labeled with connectives. The authors propose a self-supervised learning objective based on mutual information maximization to capture global semantics. The approach includes a prompt-based Cloze-Prompt template, a Connectives Mask task, and a Global Logical Semantics Learning method, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets such as the Penn Discourse Treebank 2.0 and CoNLL-2016 Shared Task.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed mutual information-based loss for pre-training is novel and interesting.
- The experimental results convincingly support the claims made in the paper, demonstrating significant performance improvements.
- The paper is well-structured and presents a comprehensive experimental design, including ablation studies and data scale analysis.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a comprehensive comparison with a broader range of existing state-of-the-art methods, which could strengthen the claims of superiority.
- There are insufficient details provided for reproducibility, as some critical parameters and settings are not clearly specified.
- The paper does not adequately address potential ethical implications related to the use of discourse data that may contain elements of bias or offensiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with a wider variety of existing methods to convincingly demonstrate the superiority of their approach. Additionally, providing more detailed implementation specifics would enhance reproducibility. We suggest that the authors address potential ethical concerns related to the data used in their research, ensuring a thorough assessment of any implications. Lastly, refining the language and presentation to eliminate grammatical errors and awkward structures would improve clarity and readability.
