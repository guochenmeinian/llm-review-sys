Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a neurosymbolic framework for generating mathematical training data through a three-step process: formalization, mutation, and reformalization. The authors propose mutation operations—simplification and complication—applied to formalized problems in SMT-Lib format, using symbolic solvers to ensure the validity and diversity of generated datasets. The experiments indicate that this method produces higher quality data compared to existing approaches, enhancing the performance of open-source models in mathematical reasoning tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The methodology employs formal specifications and symbolic solvers, contributing to the generation of higher quality training datasets.
- The evaluations show that the proposed data generation process yields superior results compared to other synthetic data generation methods, indicating its significance for the research community.
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it accessible.

Weaknesses:
- The claim of a zero false positive rate lacks numerical evidence, and the consistency check methodology is unclear.
- The projected MCMC method is mentioned in the abstract but not adequately discussed in the main content, necessitating a more detailed explanation.
- The applicability of the method is limited by the inability of symbolic solvers to handle certain problems in the MATH dataset, raising concerns about scalability.
- The experimental comparisons are not fully fair, as baseline models are trained on significantly less data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the consistency check methodology, providing numerical results to support claims of a zero false positive rate. Additionally, a more comprehensive discussion of the projected MCMC method should be included in the paper. To address scalability concerns, the authors should explore solutions for the problems in the MATH dataset that cannot be formalized. Furthermore, we suggest conducting experiments using the same data amount as the best-performing baselines for a fairer comparison. Lastly, including pseudocode for the mutation process and a clearer definition of validity and diversity would enhance the rigor of the framework.
