### Key Points
This paper investigates a two-stage auction design in online advertising, addressing the challenge of computing click-through rates (CTRs) for numerous advertisers. The authors propose a method that utilizes a coarse model in the first stage to select a smaller set of features for CTR calculation, followed by a refined model in the second stage. The paper introduces two new ad-wise selection metrics—Max-Wel and Max-Rev—focused on welfare and revenue maximization, respectively. Experimental results indicate minor improvements in welfare and revenue, with the contribution deemed moderate.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper presents a well-structured approach to the two-stage auction design, with rigorous theoretical analysis and guarantees for the proposed metrics.
2. The authors effectively address both welfare and revenue optimization, marking a significant advancement over existing literature that primarily emphasizes welfare.
3. The methodology and experimental evaluation are clearly articulated, making the paper easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
1. The theoretical results regarding the necessary size of the smaller problem are questionable, particularly concerning the bounds on the number of advertisers needed for effective welfare maximization.
2. The paper makes simplifying assumptions that may not hold in real-world scenarios, such as the independence of bids and partial features.
3. The motivation for the two-stage approach is not fully explored, particularly regarding the computational cost of calculating CTRs for all advertisers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the first-stage auction mechanism by providing pseudocode to enhance reader understanding. Additionally, we suggest that the authors incorporate computational cost as a metric in their optimization objectives to strengthen their contribution. It would also be beneficial to benchmark against more recent state-of-the-art approaches and clarify the relationship between predicting CTR and selecting ads based on welfare and revenue. Finally, addressing the questions regarding the theoretical bounds and assumptions made in the paper would enhance its robustness.
