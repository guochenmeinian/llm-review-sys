### Key Points
This paper presents HawkRAG, a novel framework designed for long-context processing that utilizes a global memory-enhanced retrieval augmentation system. It features a dual-system architecture that efficiently manages long contexts and generates useful clues for tasks. The authors claim that HawkRAG outperforms baseline methods in processing long-context tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The framework effectively addresses the limitations of traditional RAG methods in handling long contexts.
2. The experimental evaluation is robust, demonstrating performance improvements over standard RAG methods and long LLMs across multiple tasks.
3. The paper is well-written and easy to understand.

Weaknesses:
1. The innovation appears limited, as many components build on existing techniques, and the modifications to the RAG system seem incremental.
2. The experimental analysis is incomplete; key components such as the impact of draft answers on retrieval results are not adequately tested.
3. The baselines used in the experiments do not include the latest strong models, which undermines the conclusions drawn about HawkRAG's effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the abstract by concisely stating the problem, methodology, and key findings. Additionally, we suggest modifying Figure 2 to enhance reader understanding by supplementing explanations of special symbols. The manuscript should be polished for grammar, punctuation, and style, and the references should be updated for consistency in citation formats. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include a section discussing the strengths and weaknesses of existing RAG methods and clarify how HawkRAG builds upon or differs from these approaches. Finally, we advise incorporating stronger baselines, particularly context-compression based RAG methods, to convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of HawkRAG.
