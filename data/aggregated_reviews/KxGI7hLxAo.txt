### Key Points
This paper presents a novel dataset called GapChat, designed for multi-session dialogues that incorporates time-related information, such as the intervals between sessions and the progression of speaker-related events. The authors aim to investigate how generation models can be made time-aware, extending the existing MSC dataset by focusing on long-term gaps and the relationship between topic events and gap durations. The paper also introduces a time-aware dialogue model, TA-RAG, and demonstrates through experiments that time-aware systems generally outperform time-unaware counterparts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of GapChat addresses a novel and challenging task of time-aware multi-session chat, filling a gap in existing research.
- The construction process of the GapChat dataset is meticulously detailed, providing a high-quality resource for future research.
- The proposed TA-RAG model effectively leverages GapChat to generate more relevant and informative responses.
- Extensive experiments validate the superiority of GapChat and TA-RAG over existing datasets and models.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks crucial details necessary for reproducing results, particularly regarding dataset implementation and model specifics.
- Some formulas in the task definition appear to be incorrectly formulated, leading to potential confusion.
- The reliance on ChatGPT for event extraction and duration estimation raises questions about the model's novelty and empirical validation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and completeness of the dataset and model implementation details to facilitate reproducibility. Specifically, please address the following questions: 
- Clarify whether past real-world events were ordered chronologically or shuffled.
- Provide justification for the living wage standards used in recruitment.
- Explain how updates for ongoing events were determined.
- Detail the methodology for the train/val/test split, including considerations for overlapping conversations.
- Distinguish between ground truths and estimates in the formulas.
- Elaborate on the performance calculation for the prompt with the highest extraction performance.
- Clarify how long dialogue histories are managed when they exceed model capacity.
- Provide more details on the fine-tuning process and the workings of the MSC-RAG model.
- Ensure thorough proofreading to eliminate any typos and enhance overall presentation.
