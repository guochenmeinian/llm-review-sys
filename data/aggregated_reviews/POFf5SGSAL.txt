Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents WikiES, a benchmark for entity summarization that includes a dataset generator capable of operating across various areas of a knowledge graph. The authors propose a method for automatically creating summaries based on human-written summaries and info boxes from Wikipedia, addressing scalability and generalizability issues in current datasets. The work is significant as it provides a larger dataset and an automated process for creating new datasets, particularly for non-English applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a novel and valuable task for knowledge graph domains, supported by a comprehensive dataset and empirical evaluation.
- The dataset is based on human annotations, making it relatively reliable, and is implemented in code for high scalability.
- The paper is well-structured and easy to understand, facilitating the dissemination of complex concepts.

Weaknesses:
- The lack of verification of the automated process with human annotators weakens the argument for its effectiveness.
- There is insufficient discussion on potential biases and impacts of relying on human-written summaries from Wikipedia.
- The clarity of the paper suffers from unexplained terminology and vague metrics, making it difficult to compare datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the verification of their automated process by incorporating human annotators to review a subset of the generated data. Additionally, a discussion on potential biases and impacts of using Wikipedia summaries should be included to strengthen the paper's argument. 

We suggest clarifying the definitions and examples of metrics used in the paper, particularly in Table 1, to enhance understanding. The authors should also consider expanding the discussion on practical applications of the task and updating baseline methods to reflect more recent studies for a robust comparison.

Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore the inclusion of annotations from different languages and the use of links between articles as alternative graphs to enhance the dataset. The organization of the paper could be improved by using more tables and enumerated text for better readability. Lastly, addressing the potential negative social impacts and privacy issues related to the dataset construction would be beneficial.
