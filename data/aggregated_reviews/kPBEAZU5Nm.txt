Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper evaluates the effectiveness of Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting on reasoning problems within the Blocksworld domain, revealing that performance gains from CoT are limited and heavily reliant on problem-specific prompts, with diminishing returns as problem complexity increases. The authors argue that CoT does not enable large language models (LLMs) to learn general algorithmic procedures, but rather that improvements stem from pattern matching. The study provides a comprehensive analysis across various tasks, demonstrating that CoT prompts yield meaningful improvements only when examples are highly specific to the problem class.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study employs a well-defined case study within the Blocksworld domain, providing a concrete context for evaluating CoT prompting.
- It offers a thorough analysis of CoT's performance across different problem complexities, contributing valuable insights into its limitations.
- The paper critically examines the assumptions behind CoT prompting, challenging the belief that it facilitates general reasoning strategies.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks detailed experimental descriptions, including parameters like temperature, which affects reproducibility.
- There is a lack of clarity regarding the core argument, particularly in exaggerating the failures of CoT-style demonstrations.
- The title "Chain of Thoughtlessness" does not accurately reflect the content or findings of the paper.
- The conclusions drawn are not well-supported by the results, particularly regarding the effectiveness of CoT prompts.
- The paper does not adequately address the human labor cost associated with CoT prompts or provide comparative analyses.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their core arguments and ensure that the title accurately reflects the findings. Additionally, we suggest including detailed descriptions of experimental parameters to enhance reproducibility. The authors should also consider integrating background information into the related work section for better coherence. To strengthen the conclusions, we advise providing a more thorough discussion of the results, particularly regarding the performance improvements observed with CoT prompts. Lastly, including specific examples in the main text rather than relegating them to the appendix would enhance the paper's impact.
