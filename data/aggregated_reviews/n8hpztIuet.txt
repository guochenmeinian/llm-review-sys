Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of 3D pose estimation through the SMPLer-X model, which integrates 4.5 million instances from 32 datasets into a universal framework. The authors benchmark existing datasets for Enhanced Human Pose and Shape (EHPS) and propose a ViT-based baseline, demonstrating the superiority of their dataset for expressive human pose and shape reconstruction. While the work aligns with the NeurIPS Dataset and Benchmark Track's focus on dataset audits, it primarily benchmarks existing datasets rather than introducing novel algorithms. The authors provide runtime performance metrics, indicating that smaller versions of the SMPLer-X model achieve real-time performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
1. The design of SMPLer-X showcases the potential of large models combined with extensive datasets.
2. The extensive research and analysis of various datasets contribute valuable insights for future dataset collections.
3. The paper is well-written, and the experimental evidence supports the claims made.
4. There is a well-justified motivation for the research, and comprehensive investigations yield deep insights, with significant performance improvements noted for pre-trained models.

**Weaknesses:**
1. The paper lacks sufficient motivation and innovation, as the proposed model appears to be an incremental improvement based on ViT.
2. The integration of datasets does not adequately address redundancy or merging strategies, diminishing the paper's novelty.
3. The technical contribution is limited, focusing primarily on benchmarking rather than presenting new datasets or algorithms.
4. The discussion on the model's runtime speed is insufficient, which is crucial for real-time applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation and innovation aspects of the paper by exploring more novel merging strategies for the datasets to eliminate redundancy. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the discussion on the model's runtime speed by detailing frames per second (FPS) for real-time pose estimation. Including runtime speed metrics in the final version would address performance considerations more effectively. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include further experiments and explore more CNN-based models to enhance the technical contribution of the paper. Lastly, enhancing the clarity of the experimental section and including visual representations of hands and face motion spaces would better illustrate the dataset's diversity, while correcting typos and providing more examples would strengthen the overall presentation of the work.
