Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a semidefinite programming (SDP) based relaxation of the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) problem, which is a non-convex quadratic program (QP). The authors propose tightening the standard SDP relaxation through additional constraints motivated by the GW problem. They claim to achieve global optimality through a tractable approach that certifies this optimality in many instances. The authors acknowledge that their specific SDP formulation is a minor variation of an existing SDP relaxation for the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP), but emphasize its importance in certifying global optimality. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution in terms of quality and runtime efficiency, although the runtime is significantly higher than existing methods. Numerical experiments conducted on instances of size 30 points are reported as promising, despite being considered small for broader applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed SDP relaxation for the GW problem is a novel approach that has not been previously explored, providing an optimality certificate for non-convex problems.
- The method offers a tractable solution for certifying global optimality in many instances of the GW problem.
- The authors provide a clear rationale for their SDP formulation and its relevance to the problem at hand.
- The paper is well-written, clearly explaining the underlying concepts and related works.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the approach is limited as it is a variant of existing methods for QPs and the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP).
- The computational complexity is high, with runtimes for larger problems being impractical for real-world applications.
- The empirical evaluation is restricted to small-scale synthetic datasets, which may not adequately demonstrate the method's effectiveness.
- The discussion on sparsity is deemed insignificant and potentially confusing, suggesting a need for clarity.
- Concerns regarding the novelty of the approach and the quantification of global optimality claims remain unresolved.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical evaluation by including larger and more diverse datasets to better assess the practical applicability of their method. Additionally, addressing the high computational complexity is crucial; exploring first-order methods or other optimizations could enhance runtime efficiency. We suggest clarifying the role and positioning of the heuristic solver in Section 5 to strengthen the paper's contributions. Furthermore, we recommend improving the discussion on sparsity by either removing it or providing a more detailed explanation of its intent. Lastly, we suggest that the authors clarify their claims regarding global optimality, ensuring that the conditions under which these claims hold are explicitly stated in both the manuscript and rebuttal.
