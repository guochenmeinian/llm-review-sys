### Key Points
This paper presents the CMMA dataset, a multi-modal resource containing 3,000 multi-party conversations and 21,795 multi-modal utterances from Chinese TV series, annotated for various affective dimensions including emotion, sentiment, sarcasm, and humor. The dataset aims to serve as a benchmark for studying cross-affection correlations, showcasing the potential for understanding one affection type to aid in the detection of others. The authors propose a multi-task learning model that incorporates relevance-aware mechanisms to capture interactions between different affective aspects, enhancing affection detection. The dataset's average of three turns per conversation is argued to be within a reasonable range compared to existing dialogue datasets, despite its exclusive availability in Chinese.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
- The dataset is comprehensive, covering a wide range of affective aspects, and is meticulously annotated with high inter-annotator agreement.
- The methodology for data collection and processing is well-documented, ensuring data quality.
- The innovative relevance-aware multi-task learning approach explicitly models interactions between affects, distinguishing it from traditional methods.
- The initial experiments demonstrate the dataset's applicability and the effectiveness of Multi-Task Learning (MTL) for affective extraction.

**Weaknesses:**
- The dataset's exclusive availability in Chinese limits its applicability for non-Chinese-speaking researchers.
- The model relies solely on multi-task learning without exploring additional interactions between different affective aspects, potentially underutilizing the dataset's capabilities.
- The average number of turns per conversation is low, which may not adequately represent real conversational dynamics.
- Figures in the paper are small and unclear, and some terminology, such as ‘forward’ and ‘backward’ correlations, is underexplained.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset's accessibility by considering translations or adaptations for non-Chinese contexts to broaden its applicability. Additionally, the authors should enhance the model by incorporating statistical co-occurrence of labels to better reflect the interrelations between different affective aspects. We suggest refining the modeling of multi-affect interactions as indicated in their response. Expanding the dataset to include more conversational turns would also provide a richer context for analysis. Furthermore, we recommend revising the figures to ensure clarity and legibility, and providing a more thorough explanation of the terminology used, particularly regarding correlation types. Lastly, addressing potential biases and limitations in greater detail would strengthen the paper's contributions.
