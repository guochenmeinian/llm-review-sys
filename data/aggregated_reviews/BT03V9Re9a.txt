Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents EmbedDistill, a distillation technique for Information Retrieval (IR) that aligns pooled representations of various IR models through two paradigms: DE-to-DE and CE-to-DE distillation. The authors conduct a theoretical analysis of the teacher-student generalization gap, advocating for embedding alignment and the use of asymmetric encoders. The method aims to effectively distill knowledge from larger models to smaller ones while maintaining performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a practical embedding matching method for distillation, contributing to the body of knowledge in IR.
- The theoretical analysis supports the importance of embedding alignment and shows that it can close the teacher-student generalization gap.
- Experimental results demonstrate positive outcomes, achieving competitive results on benchmark datasets like Natural Questions and MS MARCO.

Weaknesses:
- The concept of embedding matching lacks novelty, having been extensively explored in prior studies, and the theoretical proof does not significantly enhance understanding of the proposed method.
- Empirical results for CE-to-DE distillation are underwhelming, raising doubts about its effectiveness, as it only marginally improves upon existing methods.
- There are errors and inconsistencies in the mathematical formulations presented, and the writing quality, particularly in Section 5, requires improvement.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their approach by addressing the limitations of embedding matching and providing clearer theoretical contributions specific to IR. Additionally, the authors should enhance the empirical results for CE-to-DE distillation and clarify the mathematical formulations to eliminate errors. Improving the writing quality, especially in Section 5, will also aid in conveying the findings more effectively.
