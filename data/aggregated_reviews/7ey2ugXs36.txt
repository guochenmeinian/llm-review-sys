Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents *CleanDiffusers*, an open-source Python library aimed at decision-making algorithms using diffusion models. The authors demonstrate the library's usability through benchmarks of various algorithms. The library aims to unify existing approaches and facilitate fair benchmarking, which is crucial for advancing research in this area.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The contribution of an open-source library for decision-making algorithms is significant, as it allows for controlled comparisons and method maintenance over time.  
- The library features a modular testing environment that supports various algorithms and facilitates easy switching of components, such as diffusion backbones.  
- The writing is clear, and the library is well-coded, providing a solid foundation for future research.

Weaknesses:  
- The entry barrier for using the library may be high due to insufficient documentation and the complexity of creating pipelines.  
- The absence of unit tests raises concerns about the reliability of the code as new features are added.  
- The library's name, *CleanDiffuser*, may cause confusion due to its similarity to the Hugging Face Diffusers library.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the documentation by including more detailed tutorials and ensuring that all elements are covered. Additionally, we advise the authors to integrate unit testing into the framework to enhance reliability. Clarifying the rationale behind certain design choices, such as implementing noise/data prediction as a switch, would also be beneficial. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors consider an ablation study on guidance techniques in decision-making scenarios to provide new insights. Lastly, addressing the naming issue of the library could help avoid confusion with existing libraries.
