### Key Points
This paper presents an Anti-Noise Network (AN-Net) for anonymous traffic classification, focusing on constructing robust short-term representations to mitigate the effects of irrelevant packet noise and per-packet attribute noise. The authors evaluate AN-Net on two anonymous traffic datasets and one VPN traffic dataset, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and robustness against injected noise packet attacks. The paper includes extensive experiments and ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of its components.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a novel problem in anonymous traffic classification and proposes an effective method that achieves state-of-the-art performance.
2. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed method's superiority and robustness against noise across multiple datasets.
3. The writing is clear and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks clarity on the motivation behind classifying anonymous traffic and the challenges posed by encryption mechanisms.
2. Some symbols are used without adequate explanation, and the rationale behind the model design, particularly regarding multi-modal representation fusion, is insufficiently detailed.
3. The objective function for model training is missing, and more details about the training process are needed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for anonymous traffic classification and elaborate on the challenges posed by encryption. Additionally, please clarify the rationale behind the model design, especially regarding the benefits of multi-modal representation fusion. It is essential to include the objective function for model training and provide more details about the training process. Furthermore, we suggest adding theoretical analysis to justify the proposed methods, comparing AN-Net with other state-of-the-art methods for encrypted traffic classification, and discussing potential limitations and risks associated with the proposed approach.
