Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for extending Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) to irregular geometries through the use of an indicator function that represents the shape of the geometric area. The authors propose a convolution integral kernel that incorporates a smoothed characteristic function, allowing the method to generalize to new geometries while maintaining computational efficiency via the fast Fourier transform (FFT). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Domain Agnostic Fourier Neural Operator (DAFNO) outperforms several baselines on benchmark datasets and effectively handles evolving topologies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The innovative use of indicator functions in neural operators to manage irregular geometries is a significant contribution.  
- The methodology is clear and well-justified, with strong experimental results across multiple datasets, including real-world applications.  
- The approach effectively addresses the problem of topology changes, which is crucial for applications in material modeling and fracture prediction.  

Weaknesses:  
- The review of related work is insufficient, lacking references to recent methods like transformers and the Factorized FNO, which also address irregular geometries.  
- The architecture struggles with non-uniformly meshed grids, potentially leading to computational inefficiencies.  
- The paper could benefit from a more equitable comparison of model sizes and additional baselines in the field of neural operators.  
- The experimental results do not encompass more complex scenarios, such as 3D fluid dynamics, and the absence of source code limits reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by including key references, particularly those related to transformers and the Factorized FNO. Additionally, the authors should address the technical concerns regarding the handling of non-uniformly meshed grids to avoid computational waste. We suggest that the authors streamline the dataset descriptions, focusing on attributes and challenges rather than detailed generation principles. Lastly, expanding the experimental comparisons to include more baselines and complex scenarios, such as 3D problems, would enhance the evaluation of DAFNO's performance.
