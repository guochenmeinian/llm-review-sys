### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of three types of domain shift in chemical reaction modeling: structure, condition, and mechanism shift. While these concepts are familiar to chemists, they are often overlooked by machine learning practitioners, making this work a valuable contribution to the community. The authors introduce a new suite of datasets and benchmarks for reaction modeling under domain shift, which is an important direction for the field.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well written and provides sufficient benchmarks. It addresses a relevant gap in the intersection of chemistry and machine learning by highlighting domain shifts that are often neglected.

Weaknesses:  
There are conceptual questions regarding the relationship between condition and mechanism shift that remain unaddressed. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a brief description of the out-of-distribution (OOD) correction methods used, especially given space constraints.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the relationship between condition and mechanism shift, possibly providing examples to illustrate this connection. Furthermore, we suggest including a brief description of each of the OOD correction methods used in an extended version of the paper.
