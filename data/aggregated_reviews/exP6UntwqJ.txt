### Key Points
This paper presents the implementation of a JAX package named SBMLtoODEjax, designed to facilitate work with biological network models in JAX. The primary aim is to enable users to import networks written in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) from databases like the BioModels Database, supporting resource-efficient optimization and simulation based on these models. The authors propose that this tool has potential and should interest a segment of the workshop audience.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Supports research advancements by developing tools for efficient data analysis.
- Extended and comprehensible manual and tutorials.
- The JAX implementation significantly accelerates computation time compared to similar tools in Python.
- Clear and well-written documentation.

Weaknesses:
- The acceptance of JAX within the broader ML community, particularly in bioinformatics, is limited, which may hinder the package's usage.
- The authors should consider reviewing the SBML2HYB Python package released in 2023, which allows ML methods on SBML models.
- The documentation exceeds the paper in detail; expanding the paper with more examples for the camera-ready submission would be beneficial.
- Benchmarking the tool on multiple models, rather than just the Kholodenko 2000 model, would enhance the paper by showcasing diverse characteristics.
- The package currently does not support importing all SBML models, with only 20% of models from the BioModels Database being usable for simulations, which may limit its applicability.
- There is no example provided for integrating an ML pipeline with their tool.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including more examples for the camera-ready submission. Additionally, benchmarking the tool on multiple models would provide a broader evaluation of its capabilities. The authors should also address the limitations regarding SBML model imports and consider including an example of integrating an ML pipeline with their tool. Furthermore, correcting minor typographical errors and ensuring proper citation of figures would enhance the overall quality of the paper.
