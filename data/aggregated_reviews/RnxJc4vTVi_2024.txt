Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Skill Chaining via Dual Regularization (SCaR) framework, which enhances skill chaining for long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks by applying dual regularization techniques. The authors propose a dual regularization method that includes an Adaptive Equilibrium Scheduling (AES) strategy for intra-skill learning and a bi-directional adversarial regularization for inter-skill consistency. The framework is evaluated on two long-horizon robotic manipulation benchmarks and real-world tasks, demonstrating improved success rates and robustness compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dual regularization approach is a significant innovation that stabilizes skill execution by balancing intra-skill coherence and inter-skill alignment.
- Extensive experimental results, including simulations and real-world tasks, thoroughly demonstrate the effectiveness of SCaR compared to baseline methods.
- The application to real-world tasks like furniture assembly showcases the practical relevance of SCaR in improving robotic automation efficiency.

Weaknesses:
- Real-world evaluation is limited to a desktop pick-and-place task, which is well-studied and may not require the proposed dependencies.
- The AES component appears convoluted and unrelated to skill chaining, raising questions about its necessity.
- The writing and presentation of the paper can be improved, particularly the clarity of figures and the method section.
- The success of SCaR heavily relies on precise sub-task definitions, which may not be straightforward in dynamic environments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method section to enhance reader understanding. Additionally, we suggest refining the figures, particularly by increasing their visibility and labeling sub-task names. The authors should also consider evaluating the method on more complex real-world tasks to better demonstrate its applicability and robustness. Furthermore, addressing the scalability of the method to longer-horizon tasks and the computational overhead introduced by dual regularization would strengthen the paper.
