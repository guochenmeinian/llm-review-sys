Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an iterative self-training framework designed to enhance hallucination detection in large language models (LLMs) by augmenting the hallucination annotation dataset and improving annotator performance. The authors utilize the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to iteratively annotate a growing dataset and train a more accurate annotator, demonstrating significant improvements over GPT-4 in hallucination detection benchmarks like HaluEval and HalluQA.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and easy to read, with clear connections between sections and minimal redundancy. 
- The theoretical explanation of practical work using mathematical equations enhances clarity and soundness.
- The self-training approach introduces significant novelty compared to the original ANAH model, effectively addressing the challenges of hallucination annotation.
- Extensive experiments validate the model's impressive performance in hallucination detection.

Weaknesses:
- The model's reliance on sequential steps—Factual Existence Judgment, Reference Information Extraction, and Hallucination-Type Judgment—raises concerns about stability, as limitations in earlier steps can affect subsequent judgments. 
- The hallucination mitigation strategy is weak, primarily generating multiple responses and selecting the one with the least hallucination sentences, without comparing alternative mitigation methods.
- The rationale for using the EM algorithm and ensuring its convergence is not clearly articulated, leaving questions about its appropriateness and effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the rationale behind using the EM algorithm, including considerations that led to this choice and how convergence is ensured through iterations. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the literature review by incorporating relevant works on data annotation to provide a broader context. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore and compare alternative methods for hallucination mitigation beyond the current approach.
