### Key Points
This paper presents an approach for stance detection in social media posts, utilizing Chain-of-Thought (COT) embeddings alongside traditional classifiers like BERT and RoBERTa. The authors propose a two-step method where the language model (LM) output serves as an additional feature rather than directly extracting labels. Experiments demonstrate improvements over simpler baselines in political stance detection of English tweets. However, the datasets used for evaluation are relatively small, and the reproducibility of results is questioned due to reliance on ChatGPT.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The two-step approach is simple and likely novel, relevant for various text classification tasks.
- The incorporation of COT reasoning texts improves stance classification results.

Weaknesses:
- Limited reproducibility due to the use of ChatGPT, with no indication of sharing LM outputs.
- The experimental comparison is constrained, lacking analysis on more recent models and datasets.
- Certain details, such as data distribution and clarity on model inputs, are insufficiently addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the reproducibility of their results by providing access to the LM outputs collected. Additionally, we suggest expanding the experimental analysis to include more datasets and recent models, as well as clarifying details regarding prompting, data distribution, and the nature of pair-wise inputs. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to analyze the generated COT reasonings to substantiate their claims about injecting world knowledge and address potential data leakage concerns.
