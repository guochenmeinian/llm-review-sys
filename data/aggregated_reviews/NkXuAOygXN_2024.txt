Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for dynamically adjusting fusion weights for image pixels based on their relative dominability, calculated through pixel-wise reconstruction losses. The authors propose a theoretical justification for image fusion from a generalization perspective, aiming to reduce the upper bound of generalization error by decomposing the fused image into components corresponding to its source data. A new test-time dynamic image fusion paradigm (TTD) is introduced, emphasizing the negative correlation between fusion weights and uni-source reconstruction loss as crucial for minimizing generalization loss. Extensive experiments validate the proposed framework across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The presentation of the method is simple and clear.  
- The proposed method is effective, with competitive experimental results across multiple tasks.  
- The theoretical justification for dynamic image fusion is meaningful and well-supported by experiments.  
- The paper is well written and evaluated on four different tasks.

Weaknesses:  
- The claim that relative dominability (RD) accurately captures dominant regions lacks empirical justification across various scenarios, particularly under different noise conditions.  
- The normalization of fusion weights in Eq. (4) is not clearly defined.  
- There is insufficient discussion on the initialization of $w^{(m)}$ in Eq. (8) and its impact on convergence and stability.  
- The details of the test-time adaptation method are unclear, and the mathematical formulas in Appendix A.1 need more clarity.  
- The adaptation method's reliance on the baseline model's performance may lead to ineffectiveness if the baseline is poor, and the improvement over non-adaptive baselines appears minor.  
- Inconsistencies in Tables I and II, particularly regarding TDD and "Ours," detract from clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical justification for RD's effectiveness across various scenarios, particularly under different noise conditions. Additionally, we suggest providing a clear definition for normalizing fusion weights in Eq. (4) and discussing the initialization of $w^{(m)}$ in Eq. (8) to clarify its effects on convergence and stability. The authors should enhance the clarity of the test-time adaptation method and mathematical formulas in Appendix A.1 by using more parentheses for better scope presentation. Furthermore, we advise comparing specific methods for particular fusion tasks rather than generalized methods, and addressing the inconsistencies in Tables I and II to improve overall presentation.
