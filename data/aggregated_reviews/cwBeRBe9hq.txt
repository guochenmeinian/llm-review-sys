Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical exploration of the learnability of multilabel ranking problems, establishing that multilabel ranking learnability is equivalent to the learnability of a family of binary classification problems. The authors define two families of ranking loss functions that encompass most commonly used losses and demonstrate that the multilabel ranking hypothesis class is PAC learnable in both batch and online settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant and previously unanswered question regarding the learnability of multilabel ranking.
- The theoretical contributions are rigorous, with solid proofs and concise results.
- The authors provide sufficient conditions for the agnostic Probably Approximately Correct learnability of score-based ranking hypothesis classes.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks experimental validation for the proposed theories and algorithms.
- The main proofs are only briefly outlined in the main text, necessitating a switch to the appendix for detailed understanding, which disrupts the flow.
- The problem setup is somewhat confusing, and the paper lacks a discussion on related work, limiting contextual understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the problem setup by distinguishing between multilabel ranking and label ranking. Additionally, a more comprehensive discussion of related work should be included to contextualize the findings. The authors should also consider providing detailed proof sketches in the main text to enhance understanding without requiring constant reference to the appendix. Furthermore, addressing the notation density by adding full-sentence explanations in Sections 2 and 3 would aid reader comprehension. Lastly, we suggest revising the statement regarding the coverage of ranking losses to avoid overstating the comprehensiveness of the defined families.
