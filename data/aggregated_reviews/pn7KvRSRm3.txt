### Key Points
This paper presents a critical examination of current methods for assessing similarity between representations in artificial and biological neural networks. The authors argue that traditional representational similarity analysis, which emphasizes population-level statistical properties, fails to capture true functional similarities. They propose a shift towards understanding representations in terms of their functional roles in downstream processes. The paper also introduces the concept of causal perturbations to measure functional similarity, illustrated through an experiment comparing AlexNet representations with fMRI responses in the fusiform face area.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents ideas clearly, making it accessible.
- It effectively critiques existing representational similarity methods and justifies the need for a functional perspective on representations.
- The causal perturbation approach is innovative and provides a novel way to assess functional similarity.

Weaknesses:
- While the authors raise valid criticisms, they do not offer actionable methods to implement their insights in practice.
- The paper overlooks existing functional representation analysis methods, such as those discussed by Cohen et al. (2020).
- The positivity constraint in regression modeling may not be as significant as suggested, given common practices in the field.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding whether the linear regression models were re-trained after lesioning units in the deep network. Additionally, we suggest that the authors address existing alternative methods for studying representations in a functionally relevant manner. It would also be beneficial to consider how the sparsity of mappings relates to physiological correspondence and to comment on the implications of varying measurement resolutions in neural responses. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore the potential of repeating artificial lesioning experiments in model-to-model comparisons to further validate their claims about sparse regressions capturing functional similarity.
