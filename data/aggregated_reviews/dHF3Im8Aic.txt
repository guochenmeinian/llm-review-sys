Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for open-set object recognition that utilizes multiple large models, including ChatGPT, DALL-E, CLIP, and DINO, to address the challenge of spurious-discriminative features. The authors propose a two-stage process: first, generating virtual open-set classes and their corresponding images through ChatGPT and DALL-E, followed by inference using CLIP and DINO to classify images based on these generated classes. The method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks without requiring fine-tuning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The problem of open-set object recognition is both interesting and challenging.
2. The approach of leveraging generative models to improve recognition performance is reasonable and innovative.
3. The method shows favorable performance on public benchmarks without fine-tuning.
4. Comprehensive ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of design choices, indicating that improvements are not solely due to category overlap.

Weaknesses:
1. The technical contribution is somewhat limited, as the performance improvements over the baseline are not surprising given the reliance on established foundation models.
2. There is a lack of quantitative evaluation regarding the mitigation of spurious correlations, which would strengthen the claims made.
3. The framework does not explore cross-dataset evaluations or larger-scale datasets, limiting its applicability.
4. The reliance on large models as black boxes may hinder future research directions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including cross-dataset comparisons and testing on larger-scale datasets, such as CUB and FGVC-Aircraft. Additionally, providing quantitative evidence of spurious correlation mitigation would enhance the robustness of the claims. It would also be beneficial to discuss the efficiency of the proposed framework in detail, particularly regarding the computational costs associated with the pre-processing and inference stages. Lastly, consider incorporating other image generative methods for comparison to strengthen the contribution of the proposed framework.
