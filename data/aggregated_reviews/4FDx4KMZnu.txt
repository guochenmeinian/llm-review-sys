### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach, Mixture of Soft Prompts (MSP), for controllable data generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-attribute natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. The authors propose leveraging LLMs as data augmentation tools rather than direct predictors, enhancing the training of smaller, domain-specific models. The effectiveness of the MSP approach is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments, showing improvements over various baselines and achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and presents an interesting premise, utilizing LLMs for data augmentation, which offers advantages such as interpretability and efficiency.  
- The MSP approach is novel and allows for efficient control over synthesized data characteristics, validated through extensive empirical studies across diverse NLU tasks.  
- The experiments are well-structured, demonstrating the proposed method's effectiveness and highlighting its practical significance in green NLP.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper does not adequately address the potential of larger models, which may not require MSP for multi-attribute predictions, nor does it provide evidence of limitations in these models.  
- There is a lack of comparison with established prompt engineering strategies, such as chain-of-thought prompting, which could enhance the analysis of MSP's effectiveness.  
- Certain methodological choices lack detailed justification, raising concerns about the rigor of the study.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the necessity of MSP by providing evidence of limitations in larger LLMs for multi-attribute predictions. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with prompt engineering strategies like simple chain-of-thought prompting or prompt-chaining to strengthen the analysis. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify their methodological choices, particularly regarding the selection of instruction prefixes and the advantages of their approach over other PETL methods.
