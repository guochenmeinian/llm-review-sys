### Key Points
This paper presents an approach for identifying shared properties among concepts in a large vocabulary using a bi-encoder for property retrieval and a joint encoder (fine-tuned DeBERTa) for property satisfaction determination. The authors compute performance on the "McRae" dataset and apply their method to ultra-fine entity typing. The work aims to associate concepts with properties and evaluates concept embeddings through intrinsic and extrinsic methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses an interesting and relevant problem, offering a unique perspective on concepts and properties.  
- It includes solid experiments and reports state-of-the-art results.  
- The idea is timely and aligns with recent advancements in NLP.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks self-containment, with important information relegated to appendices, making it harder to follow.  
- The choice of datasets and the consistency of embeddings used across experiments are unclear.  
- The introduction does not adequately outline the paper's structure or research questions, and the abstract is overly high-level.  
- There are concerns regarding the reliability of ChatGPT in generating concept properties due to potential hallucination issues.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of dataset selection and the consistency of embeddings used across experiments. It would be beneficial to explicitly state whether concept embeddings can be computed for any model and clarify the relationship between the bi-encoder and joint encoder in the context of entity typing. We suggest including a list of contributions in the introduction and computing standard deviation for the Entity Typing experiments to better convey the significance of results. Additionally, we advise that the authors address the potential weaknesses of using ChatGPT for property generation and ensure that the ultra-fine entity tagging task is properly introduced. Lastly, we encourage the authors to consider incorporating crucial points currently in appendices into the main body of the paper.
