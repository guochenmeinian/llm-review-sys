Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel algorithm, the Bootstrapped Training of Score-Conditioned Generator (BOOTGEN), aimed at optimizing biological sequence design. BOOTGEN addresses the challenges of high-cost evaluations and extensive search spaces by utilizing a score-based generator trained with rank-based weights and a bootstrapping process. The algorithm is enhanced by self-generated data labeled through a proxy score function, leading to diverse and accurate biological sequence designs. The authors demonstrate BOOTGEN's efficacy through extensive experiments across six offline biological design tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Additionally, the authors show a strong commitment to improving the manuscript based on invaluable feedback and ongoing discussions, incorporating insights from these discussions into their revision process, which has positively influenced the review outcome.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well-structured and clearly presented, making the BOOTGEN algorithm accessible even to non-specialists. The experimental results are detailed and effectively illustrate the algorithm's performance, highlighting its potential value for both academic and industrial applications. The authors demonstrate a strong commitment to improving the manuscript based on feedback, and the inclusion of additional experiments has strengthened the paper.

Weaknesses:  
1. The authors fail to acknowledge significant literature, specifically "Deep Extrapolation for Attribute-Enhanced Generation," which also explores protein sequence design using a generator/scorer framework, necessitating a comparative analysis.
2. The title's first word should be capitalized, and this correction is also needed in Section 4.2.
3. The claim regarding the significance of ranking-based weighting over value-based weighting lacks novelty and may not justify its inclusion as a key contribution.
4. The differentiation of BOOTGEN from "Conditioning by adaptive sampling for robust design" remains unclear.
5. The paper appears to aggregate various methods rather than presenting a singular, strong contribution that enhances understanding of MBO.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by incorporating and comparing their work with "Deep Extrapolation for Attribute-Enhanced Generation" and other relevant studies like CbAS and AdaLead. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the novelty of their contributions, particularly regarding the ranking-based weighting and the differentiation from existing methods. The authors should also ensure that the title and relevant sections are properly formatted. Furthermore, we encourage the inclusion of a more thorough evaluation of diversity and novelty across all baselines, not just GFN-AL, to strengthen their claims. Lastly, addressing the concerns about the fairness of comparisons and the number of model evaluations would enhance the rigor of their findings.
