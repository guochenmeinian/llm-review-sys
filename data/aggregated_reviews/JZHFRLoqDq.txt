Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a methodology for estimating Wasserstein barycenters in the continuous case using samples from unknown probability distributions. The authors propose maximizing a loss function derived from a dual problem of an entropy-regularized optimal transport (OT) formulation, utilizing neural networks to parameterize potential functions. The approach allows for the handling of general cost functions and demonstrates theoretical results regarding statistical consistency and error bounds. The methodology is validated through experiments on toy and image datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-suited for NeurIPS, addressing a relevant problem in the ML community with a clear methodology and reasonable theoretical backing.
- It effectively handles general cost functions, which is demonstrated in experiments that allow for barycenter parametrization in latent spaces.
- The theoretical analysis is solid, providing insights into sample complexity and generalization.

Weaknesses:
- A significant challenge is the difficulty in evaluating the method due to the unknown true barycenter and loss values, complicating the monitoring of algorithm performance.
- The clarity of the experimental section is lacking, particularly regarding the definitions of "$\ell^2$-barycenters" and their relation to Wasserstein barycenters.
- The originality of the work is somewhat diminished by its reliance on existing ideas, particularly from previous literature, which should be more thoroughly discussed in the main text.
- The potential convergence issues of the Langevin sampling scheme, given the non-convex nature of neural networks, require more extensive discussion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental section by explicitly defining terms like "$\ell^2$-barycenters" and clarifying their relationship to the proposed methodology.
- We suggest that the authors expand the discussion on the originality of their work by detailing the theoretical and practical challenges encountered in adapting ideas from previous literature.
- We encourage the authors to address the convergence concerns related to the Langevin sampling scheme more thoroughly, including any observations made during experiments.
- We recommend including robustness tests regarding the sensitivity of the entropic regularizer's weight and its impact on high-dimensional applications in the experimental results.
- We suggest that the authors consider applying their method to practical tasks, such as point cloud clustering, to demonstrate its applicability.
