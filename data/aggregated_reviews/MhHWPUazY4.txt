### Key Points
This paper presents a deep learning framework that integrates spatial knowledge and employs an iterative training approach with labels from a multi-resolution hierarchy, addressing uncertainty. The authors demonstrate the model's effectiveness using real hurricane and hydrological datasets, marking a significant contribution to the geospatial research community.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The framework is well-organized and effectively demonstrates its applicability to real-world datasets, making it a valuable addition to the workshop and the geospatial research community.

Weaknesses:  
There are several points of clarification needed, such as the difference between SKI-HL-Base and SKI-HL in Table 2, the unit of measurement for horizontal resolution in Figure 3, and whether the choice of base model, specifically the U-net, affects the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by explicitly stating the difference between SKI-HL-Base and SKI-HL in Table 2. Additionally, please specify the unit for horizontal resolution in Figure 3. Lastly, we suggest exploring whether the results would vary with the selection of a different base model.
