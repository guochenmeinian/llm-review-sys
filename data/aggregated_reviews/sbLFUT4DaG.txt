### Key Points
This paper presents a methodology for knowledge graph enhancement (KGE) aimed at improving coverage and precision of multilingual entity information across ten languages. The authors introduce the WikiKGE-10 dataset, comprising approximately 35,000 human-verified multilingual names, and propose the M-NTA (Multi-source Naturalization, Translation, and Alignment) method, which integrates machine translation, web search, and large language models. They demonstrate that their approach enhances downstream tasks such as multilingual entity linking and knowledge graph completion, reporting improvements in coverage and precision.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The human-verified dataset is a valuable resource that supplements existing multilingual datasets, introducing new entities for evaluation.  
- The paper is well-written, clearly articulating the motivations and limitations of the study.  
- The proposed M-NTA method shows thorough experimental validation and significant improvements in multilingual knowledge graph tasks.  
- The exploratory analysis of disparities in knowledge graphs across languages is robust, and the appendix provides comprehensive details that enhance the main paper.  

Weaknesses:  
- Claims in the abstract, introduction, and conclusion do not fully align with the experimental results, raising concerns about the clarity of coverage and precision computations.  
- Some methodological details, such as the annotation process and validation of added names, require further clarification.  
- The paper could benefit from a more precise title that reflects the specific task investigated, as well as clearer terminology to distinguish between entity name generation and description tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the alignment between claims in the abstract and the experimental work presented. Clarifying how coverage and precision scores were computed, particularly in Table 2, would enhance transparency. Additionally, providing details on the annotation platform and inter-annotator agreement calculations would strengthen the methodology section. We suggest specifying the version of ChatGPT used in the experiments and considering alternative text sources for the method, as reliance on Wikidata descriptions may limit applicability. Lastly, refining the terminology used throughout the paper to clearly differentiate between entity name generation and description tasks would improve reader comprehension.
