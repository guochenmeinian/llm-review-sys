### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method, the Speech Embedding Association Test (SpEAT), to measure biases related to demographics in pretrained speech models like WavLM, wav2vec 2.0, and HuBERT. The authors demonstrate that these models exhibit biases comparable to human biases and that such biases propagate to downstream tasks, particularly in Speech Emotion Recognition (SER). The research addresses an under-explored area and raises ethical considerations regarding the development of unbiased speech models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles a significant research question regarding bias in speech models.
- It includes a comprehensive set of experiments across various pretrained models and types of biases.
- The methodology is well-structured, and the results contribute to understanding social biases in speech technology.

Weaknesses:
- The paper does not clarify whether multiple seeds were used in the fine-tuning process, which could limit reproducibility.
- The relationship between the proposed method and existing Embedding Association Tests (EAT) is not fully articulated.
- Some technical aspects, such as the method of generating embeddings and the statistical significance of results, require further clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their operationalized definition of bias and provide a conceptual description of its computation. Additionally, addressing the relationship between "valence" and "pleasantness" more cogently would enhance understanding. The authors should also clarify the use of multiple seeds in the fine-tuning process and consider the implications of using small sample sizes in SpEAT evaluations. Furthermore, simplifying the introduction for non-expert readers could improve accessibility. Lastly, we suggest correcting typographical errors and ensuring proper citation formatting throughout the paper.
