### Key Points
This paper presents Ctrl-X, a training-free and guidance-free method for controllable image and video generation that allows for structure and appearance control. The authors propose injecting structural and appearance features directly into noised samples via cross-attention, achieving good alignment and presentation compared to training-based and guidance-based methods. The experiments demonstrate promising results, showing that Ctrl-X can perform similarly to more complex alternatives without additional training or inference time costs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The method is novel, with a clear motivation and practical insights.  
2. The writing is clear and easy to follow.  
3. The evaluations on benchmarks provide evidence of effectiveness, and the training-free nature offers flexibility in generating images with various controls.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The generated images/videos exhibit a painting style, likely due to the direct injection of structural features without training or fine-tuning.  
2. The performance of Ctrl-X is concerning, as it shows poor results in quantitative evaluations and qualitative comparisons against stronger training-based baselines.  
3. The methodology lacks flexibility for handling multiple objects and higher-level constraints like pose or bounding boxes.  
4. There is insufficient exploration of the impact of structure-only generation and the influence of structure images on quality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparative analysis by including stronger training-based baselines, such as ControlNet and T2I-Adapter, to better assess structural preservation and appearance control capabilities. Additionally, we suggest conducting user studies to provide qualitative insights into the generated outputs. The authors should also explore the ability of the methodology to handle multiple object generation and higher-level constraints, and consider adding a comparison of computing resources and inference latency to substantiate claims regarding efficiency. Expanding the ablation studies to investigate the effects of structure-only generation would also enhance the understanding of the methodology's limitations.
