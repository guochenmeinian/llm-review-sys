Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents BLEEP, a bi-modal embedding framework designed to generate spatially resolved gene expression profiles from whole-slide H&E stained histology images. The authors propose a contrastive learning approach that aligns gene expressions with histological data, demonstrating improved correlations in gene expression predictions compared to existing methods like HisToGene and ST-Net. The study highlights the significance of this approach in addressing the challenges of gene expression profiling, particularly in the context of expensive sequencing techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors introduce a novel method for predicting gene expression from histology, addressing an important research area in multimodal analysis.
2. BLEEP appears to be the first application of a CLIP-like joint embedding objective for this task, with a well-motivated choice of alignment-based methods.
3. The results indicate significant improvements in predictive performance and retention of gene expression heterogeneity.

Weaknesses:
1. The evaluation is limited to a single dataset, and there are no metrics to assess spatial resolution in predictions.
2. The novelty of the contrastive learning framework is diminished by its prior use in other contexts, making the contribution primarily an application of existing techniques.
3. Key methodological choices, such as the use of smooth contrastive loss and k-nearest neighbor selection, lack empirical justification through ablation studies.
4. The paper does not adequately address the implications of using fixed versus variable scales for predictions, nor does it clarify the selection process for pairs with similar morphological features.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the validation of their method by including additional datasets from diverse organ systems and disease contexts to demonstrate generalizability. It would be beneficial to provide a clearer explanation of the query-reference imputation process, including the number of samples used and the method of aggregation. Additionally, we suggest that the authors conduct comparisons using the typical CLIP loss to substantiate the necessity of their proposed loss function. Finally, a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential future directions of the research would enhance the paper's impact.
