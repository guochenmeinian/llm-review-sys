Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for synthesizing and verifying Neural Control Barrier Functions (NCBFs) for continuous-time dynamical systems. The authors define a system as safe if a control output can prevent reaching unsafe regions. They build on the characterization of ReLU Barrier Certificates and propose techniques to minimize the number of linearly constrained regions at the boundary of the safety domain while optimizing verification processes. The efficacy of their approach is validated through experiments, demonstrating improved performance compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors' approach enhances the applicability of prior work, as demonstrated by improved performance metrics.
- The paper is well-written, particularly in Sections 2 and 3, which are clear and easy to follow.
- The training procedure incorporates insightful regularization techniques that limit the number of boundary hyperplanes, contributing to the novelty of the work.

Weaknesses:
- The paper's contributions may be seen as incremental compared to previous work, particularly regarding the verification-in-the-loop training concept, which is not new.
- Some sections, particularly Section 4, lack clarity and organization, making it difficult to grasp the high-level ideas without additional illustrations.
- The notation and definitions used in the paper can be confusing, particularly the overloading of symbols and unclear problem statements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their notation and explicitly define terms such as "complete" in Proposition 1. Additionally, a conceptual comparison with existing branch-and-bound verification methods could enhance understanding for the neural network verification community. It would be beneficial to include a discussion on how NCBFs can be applied in practice to control dynamical systems. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors provide a sensitivity analysis for the regularization parameters in the training loss and include a limitation section to address scalability issues and the applicability to non-ReLU networks. Lastly, incorporating a detailed breakdown of computational times for the nonlinear programs would help clarify the challenges in their proposed method.
