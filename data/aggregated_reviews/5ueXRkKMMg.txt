### Key Points
This paper presents a significant exploration of inverse design, particularly through the introduction of the Compositional Inverse Design with Diffusion Models (CinDM) method. The authors propose using compositional generative models to address inverse design problems, aiming to mitigate the over-optimization issues found in current surrogate models. The method's capability to generalize beyond training data and tackle out-of-distribution challenges is highlighted as a potential advancement in the field. Additionally, the use of energy modeling to navigate adversarial pitfalls during optimization is noted as a promising innovation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a critical area in inverse design relevant to various engineering applications.  
- The introduction of the CinDM method is commendable for its potential to enhance robustness in inverse design solutions.  
- The manuscript is well-written, with clear language that facilitates understanding.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper overlooks crucial related works that could enhance its comprehensiveness and relevance, specifically the works by Trabucco et al. (2022) and Chen et al. (2022).  
- The absence of these references limits the paper's ability to provide a holistic view of the current state of the art.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comprehensiveness of the paper by including and analyzing the related works by Trabucco et al. (2022) and Chen et al. (2022). This inclusion would strengthen the paper's position within the field of inverse design.
