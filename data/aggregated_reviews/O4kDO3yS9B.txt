Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a systematic examination of ChatGPT's capabilities for conversational recommendation on large-scale datasets, highlighting its limitations under traditional evaluation protocols. The authors propose a new interactive evaluation approach, iEvaLM, which utilizes LLM-based user simulators to assess conversational recommender systems (CRSs). Experiments on two public CRS datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of this evaluation method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors conduct a thorough analysis of current challenges and propose a novel approach to address them.
2. The paper is well-written, organized, and provides detailed validation through experiments and case studies.
3. The introduction of LLMs as user simulators for evaluating CRSs is a significant contribution.

Weaknesses:
1. The proposed iEvaLM may be biased towards the LLM used during evaluation, raising concerns about its objectivity.
2. The paper lacks sufficient evidence to support claims regarding ChatGPT's poor performance in conversational recommendation tasks.
3. Some experimental designs are confusing, and the reproducibility of results is questionable due to reliance on a closed API.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their experimental designs and provide additional evidence to substantiate claims about ChatGPT's performance. It would be beneficial to explore the performance of other open-source large language models in conversational recommendation settings. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion of the potential risks associated with using iEvaLM, as well as providing use hints or guides for practitioners. Finally, we encourage the authors to include all results mentioned in their rebuttal if the paper is accepted.
