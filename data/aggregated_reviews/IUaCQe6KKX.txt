### Key Points
This paper presents the idea that additional information is essential for completing syllogistic reasoning, which should be obtained through knowledge discovery. The authors follow an early method of verbal analysis, distinguishing between "a man" and "all men." They argue that to deduce "Socrates has a feature," one must first establish that "Socrates is a man." The authors propose the necessity of discovering a predicate that applies to instances within a set. In their analysis of the Barbara syllogism, they suggest that "all B" leads to "B" and "all B are A" leads to "B be A," but this interpretation is flawed.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces a novel perspective on the necessity of additional information in syllogistic reasoning.  
- The distinction made between "a man" and "all men" is a valuable analytical approach.

Weaknesses:  
- The authors did not provide any references to support their claims.  
- The analysis of the Barbara syllogism is incorrect, conflating set-theoretic concepts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve their analysis of the Barbara syllogism to accurately reflect set-theoretic principles. Additionally, we suggest that the authors include relevant references to strengthen their arguments and provide a more robust theoretical foundation for their claims.
