### Key Points
This paper presents the "Communicative Math Hypothesis," arguing that mathematical reasoning involves not just symbolic manipulation but also communicative aspects inherent in human interaction. The authors explore this hypothesis through two case studies focused on equation asymmetry and proof ordering, suggesting that large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 exhibit preferences for certain mathematical structures. The findings imply that LLMs can reflect communicative nuances in mathematics, which could inform future AI system designs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper offers a novel perspective on the intersection of AI, cognitive science, and mathematics, bridging these fields effectively.  
- The interdisciplinary nature enhances its contribution to education and theorem proving.

Weaknesses:  
- The literature survey is insufficient, lacking references to existing work on LLMs' sensitivity to symmetry and the reversal curse.  
- The case studies are limited in scope, with small sample sizes and a lack of robustness.  
- The paper does not adequately address counterarguments regarding the importance of precision in high-level mathematics.  
- Practical implications of the findings are unclear, and the paper lacks concrete examples of how LLMs could assist in real-world mathematical contexts.  
- Experiment designs are criticized for lacking novelty and rigor, particularly in the second case study.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by including relevant studies on the reversal curse and LLMs' sensitivity to symmetry. Additionally, expanding the case studies to include a larger and more diverse dataset, as well as different types of equations, would enhance the robustness of the findings. A more detailed error analysis, particularly regarding biases in LLMs, should be included. We suggest that the authors address potential counterarguments more thoroughly, discussing when precision may take precedence over communicative flexibility. Furthermore, providing concrete examples of how LLMs could improve collaboration with human mathematicians or students would illustrate the real-world impact of their approach. Lastly, clarifying the counterfactual possible orders in Figure 2 and discussing the practical implications of their findings would strengthen the paper's relevance and significance.
