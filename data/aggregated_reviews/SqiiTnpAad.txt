### Key Points
This paper presents the use of uncertainty as an evaluation criterion for the Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) in deep learning models for autonomous driving. The authors clarify aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, proposing Deep Deterministic Uncertainty (DDU) for quantifying uncertainty in trajectory prediction tasks using CARLA simulator data. They argue that high epistemic uncertainty can reveal functional deficiencies in unknown driving scenarios, which can be addressed through additional training.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and clearly articulates its motivation and experimental workflows, enhancing readability.
- It addresses a critical aspect of autonomous vehicle safety, aligning with the ISO 21448 standard, and proposes a novel method for real-time safety assessments through uncertainty quantification.
- Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed uncertainty criterion in identifying functional insufficiencies and suggest corrective measures.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments lack depth; a comparative analysis of uncertainty across different trajectory prediction algorithms is needed to validate the proposed metric's effectiveness.
- The integration of ISO 21448 into the methodology is insufficient, and practical implementation within the SOTIF framework is not demonstrated.
- There is a lack of detail regarding model architecture, training procedures, hyperparameters, and uncertainty quantification implementation, as well as no quantitative metrics to support claims.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the depth of their experimental analysis by including comparative experiments assessing uncertainty across various trajectory prediction algorithms. Additionally, we suggest providing more detailed integration of ISO 21448 into the methodology and demonstrating practical implementation within the SOTIF framework. The authors should also include comprehensive details about model architecture, training procedures, and hyperparameters, along with quantitative metrics to substantiate their claims regarding prediction accuracy and uncertainty calibration.
