### Key Points
This paper presents CrossLink, a framework for cross-domain link prediction over dynamic graphs, integrating evolution process modeling into a transformer architecture to enhance prediction performance. The authors propose a time augmentation strategy to reduce disparity in cross-domain learning. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capability of CrossLink, achieving state-of-the-art performance with an average improvement of 11.40% in Average Precision compared to advanced baseline models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of time augmentation is crucial for cross-domain link prediction, and the proposed strategy is effective.
- The significant improvement in performance validates the proposed method.
- The paper provides valuable insights based on experimental observations, enhancing clarity.

Weaknesses:
- Claims of efficient inference lack experimental support, and the role of K-V caching in inference is not adequately explained.
- The sampling method for node pairs may overlook significant information, and the domains used in experiments are isolated, lacking similarities.
- The paper's organization could be improved to fit within the 8-page limit, as many results are relegated to the appendix, necessitating frequent cross-referencing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the inference process, including providing an inference time comparison. Clarifying the processing order of different datasets and the influence of dataset order on results is essential. Additionally, please provide detailed parameter settings for CrossLink and clarify whether GraphMixer functions as the graph encoder within the CrossLink framework. Addressing the layout errors and correcting spelling mistakes in the text will enhance the overall presentation.
