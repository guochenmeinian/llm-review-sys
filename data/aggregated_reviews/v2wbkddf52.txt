### Key Points
This paper presents a study on mitigating over-correction in Automatic Post-Editing (APE) systems by leveraging Word-level Quality Estimation (QE) systems. The authors propose a joint training framework using Nash-Multitask Learning, demonstrating significant improvements in translation quality for English-to-Marathi and English-to-German language pairs. The research explores various strategies for integrating APE and QE, revealing that tighter coupling enhances performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and clearly articulates the motivation for combining APE and QE tasks.  
- It includes multiple ablation studies and shows significant improvements in translation quality across the tested language pairs.  
- The proposed multi-task learning approach is novel and effectively demonstrates the benefits of joint training.

Weaknesses:  
- The scientific novelty is perceived as low, as the work primarily extends existing methods without introducing fundamentally new concepts.  
- The evaluation is limited to only two language pairs, raising questions about the generalizability of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding the shared parameters in their model, particularly in Figure 1, to enhance understanding. Additionally, consider expanding the evaluation to include more language pairs to validate the robustness of the findings. It would also be beneficial to include Comet scores alongside BLEU to provide a more comprehensive assessment of translation quality. Lastly, addressing the questions regarding the impact of different integration strategies on efficiency and the nature of edits in system variants would strengthen the paper.
