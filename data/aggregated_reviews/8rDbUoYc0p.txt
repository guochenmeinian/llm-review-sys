### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of individual preference stability (IP stability) in clustering, extending the work of Ahmadi et al. (2022). The authors define a k-clustering as 1-IP stable if each point's average distance to its cluster is less than or equal to its average distance to other clusters. They introduce the concept of \(\alpha\)-IP stability, where a clustering is \(\alpha\)-IP stable if the average distance to another cluster is at most \(\alpha\) times that to its own cluster. The authors demonstrate that an \(O(1)\)-IP stable clustering always exists and provide an efficient algorithm to compute it, which also serves as a constant factor approximation for the k-center problem. Additionally, they explore Min-IP and Max-IP stability, showing that the Single Link algorithm achieves optimal clustering for Min-IP and that a 3-approximation for Max-IP is possible using the greedy k-center algorithm.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work effectively closes the gap between upper and lower bounds for IP stability, establishing the existence of constant-stable clusterings and efficient computation methods.
- The algorithm's dual role as an approximation for k-center adds significant value, demonstrating meaningful clustering beyond mere stability.
- The repurposing of existing algorithms to guarantee Min- and Max-IP stability highlights the relationship between stability and other clustering objectives.

Weaknesses:
- While the algorithms are clearly described, they lack sufficient motivation or intuition, particularly regarding the nuances of the Ball-Carving algorithm.
- A clearer discussion on how the proposed algorithms differ from or build upon those of Ahmadi et al. would enhance the novelty of the contributions.
- The description of the parameter \(r\) in lines 66-70 may lead to misinterpretation regarding the conditions for achieving k clusters.
- Algorithm 3, which implements Single Link clustering, should be explicitly labeled and cited.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation and intuition behind Algorithms 1 and 2, perhaps by providing examples that illustrate the necessity of the nuances in the Ball-Carving algorithm. Additionally, a discussion contrasting their algorithms with those of Ahmadi et al. would clarify the novelty of their contributions. We suggest revising the wording in lines 66-70 to prevent misinterpretation regarding the parameter \(r\). Lastly, we advise explicitly labeling and citing Algorithm 3 as the well-known Single Link clustering algorithm.
