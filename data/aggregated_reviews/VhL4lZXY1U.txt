### Key Points
This paper presents a dialogue adaptation method that utilizes persona and knowledge concepts to generate responses from fragmentary information. The authors propose a model that extends semantic-level conditional text generation and aims to operate without pre-defined persona or knowledge candidates. The methodology addresses candidate-free scenarios, allowing for the retrieval of knowledge sentences and generation of personas based solely on titles and concepts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The method is simple, flexible, and effective, with a strong motivation for reducing reliance on pre-defined candidates.  
- Extensive experiments are conducted, and the evaluation metrics are deemed sufficient.  
- The study provides adequate support for its claims and contributes to understanding the research direction.

Weaknesses:  
- The method is considered somewhat ordinary and lacks impressively innovative aspects.  
- The performance of the retriever is not evaluated, and the clarity of the persona generator's operation is questioned.  
- The sample size for human evaluation (25 dialogs) is deemed too small, and key baseline models are missing from this evaluation.  
- There are minor issues with grammar, formatting, and the definition of key terms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the persona generator's functionality and explicitly define what constitutes a knowledge/persona concept versus a candidate. Additionally, we suggest increasing the sample size for human evaluation and including the strongest baseline model in this assessment. Addressing the minor formatting issues and ensuring the reproducibility of results by providing clearer parameter settings would also enhance the paper's quality.
