### Key Points
This paper presents an approach for automatic interlinear morphological glossing (IMG) that utilizes both the morpheme sequence of a low-resource language and its translation into a high-resource language. The authors propose a latent variable Conditional Random Field (CRF) model, addressing the open vocabulary problem and conducting experiments on five low-resource languages. The work includes ablation studies and aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a less-studied problem and shows the utility of the proposed approach in low-resource scenarios.
- A well-designed experiment supports the claims, and the authors provide a detailed set of ablation experiments.
- The paper is generally well-written, with consistent experiments aligned with research objectives.

Weaknesses:
- Technical issues are not well presented, and the choice of a CRF model over neural models like LSTM or transformers is not justified.
- Some sections are difficult to understand, hindering the overall clarity of the paper.
- The multilingual aspect lacks clarity, and the drop in performance for BERT compared to CRF needs further explanation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for using a CRF model instead of comparing it with neural models. Clarifying the terminology around the "open vocabulary problem" and providing more explicit definitions for terms like "lexical glosses" and the labels GRAM and LEX would enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest rewriting unclear sections for better clarity, particularly the explanation of the model's mechanics. Addressing the reproducibility concerns by providing more detailed parameter settings and data availability would also strengthen the paper.
