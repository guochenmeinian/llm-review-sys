Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents GADBench, a benchmark for supervised graph anomaly detection at the node level on static attributed graphs, evaluating 23 models across 10 diverse real-world datasets. The authors propose a novel combination of neighborhood aggregation and tree ensemble methods, demonstrating effective results in their experiments. The paper also provides insightful visualizations of decision boundaries and discusses the effectiveness of tree ensembles. Additionally, the authors address various aspects of graph anomaly detection (GAD), including the limitations of classical methods, the performance of different models in inductive settings, and the distinctions between heterophily and camouflage in graph anomalies. The revised paper includes additional experiments on heterogeneous graphs and inductive settings, as well as clarifications on dataset selection criteria.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-organized and easy to follow.  
- It offers a comprehensive evaluation of 23 methods across 10 datasets, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners.  
- The combination of tree ensembles and neighborhood aggregation is effectively demonstrated.  
- Section 4.2 includes insightful visualizations of decision boundaries.  
- The authors have incorporated feedback effectively, enhancing the paper's depth and clarity.  
- New baselines and experiments have been added, broadening the scope of GADBench.  
- The distinctions between heterophily and camouflage are clearly articulated, improving conceptual understanding.

Weaknesses:  
- The benchmark lacks classical graph methods, which could enhance the evaluation.  
- The authors do not explore tree ensembles with parametric GNNs, limiting the analysis of potential performance improvements.  
- The task definition in Section 2 could be more general, and the paper does not address inductive settings.  
- The performance of tree ensembles with neighbor aggregation appears inconsistent across datasets, raising questions about their stability.  
- There are issues with the correctness of results in Table 9, and some results have been flagged for potential inaccuracies, which could undermine confidence in the findings.  
- The memory plot in Figure 1 presents counterintuitive findings, and the explanation of heterophily and camouflage is unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the benchmark by including at least one or two classical graph methods to provide a fairer comparison. Additionally, exploring the performance of tree ensembles with parametric GNNs could yield interesting insights. The authors should also clarify the task definition in Section 2 to encompass weighted adjacency matrices and inductive settings. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors improve the stability of tree ensemble methods by exploring additional parameter tuning or alternative aggregation techniques. It is crucial to ensure that the results in Table 9 are accurately represented and clarify any discrepancies in the average calculations. Additionally, we encourage the authors to report the experimental results of "RF-Graph/XGB-Graph + NA" to assess the significance of improvements gained through neighbor aggregation. Lastly, a clearer distinction between heterophily and camouflage is needed for better clarity, and a thorough review of the revised manuscript should be conducted to ensure consistency in the changes made.
