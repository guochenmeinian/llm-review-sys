Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the refusal behavior of LLMs, focusing on the Llama 2 13B and Vicuna 13B models. The authors explore methods such as prompting, contrastive activation addition (CAA), and user personas to understand their impact on model refusal. The findings indicate that harmful information can be decoded from early layers even when a model refuses to answer, and that certain user personas can influence the likelihood of response refusal. The study aims to enhance LLM safety by examining how user personas affect model behavior.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Originality: The investigation into prompting, CAA, and personas is well-motivated and presents significant initial results.
- Quality: Claims are well-supported by solid results, demonstrating in-depth analysis.
- Clarity: The paper is well-organized and clearly written.
- Significance: The results are relevant to the LLM safety community, particularly regarding refusal behavior.

Weaknesses:
- Quality: Minor concerns exist regarding the models used and the selection of personas.
- Technical Advancement: The paper emphasizes analysis over technical innovation, and the generalizability of results to other LLMs is unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of terms such as "baseline" in line 95, and reposition Table 1 closer to the related results. Additionally, please provide justification for the choice of models, such as text-unicorn@001, and explain the representativeness of the selected personas. It is crucial to include evidence for the effectiveness of identity statements in influencing LLM responses. We suggest adding more context in the introduction regarding problematic prompts and definitions of safety. Finally, consider moving the limitations discussed in the appendix to the main body for better visibility.
