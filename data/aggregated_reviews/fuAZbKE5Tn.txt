### Key Points
This paper presents the Symbolic Graph Ranker (SGR), which integrates symbolic graph representation with large language models (LLMs) to enhance session search. The authors conduct extensive experiments on large-scale datasets, including AOL and Tiangong-ST, comparing SGR against various ad-hoc and context-aware ranking methods. The paper also explores the effects of different components of SGR through ablation studies and assesses the impact of session lengths and training data scales on model performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The integration of symbolic graph representation with LLMs is a novel contribution that addresses context-aware document ranking challenges in session searches.
2. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and comparisons with various baseline models demonstrate SGR's effectiveness.
3. The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the contributions of different components of the SGR model.

Weaknesses:
1. The contribution of merging semantic meaning with structural information may not be unique, as similar approaches exist in references [26] and [43].
2. The complexity introduced by combining symbolic graph representation with LLMs could hinder practical adoption, where simplicity is often prioritized.
3. The paper does not adequately address the issue of overly long sequences resulting from extensive user interactions, which may exceed LLM processing limits.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of SGR's unique contributions compared to existing methods. Additionally, addressing the complexity of the dual nature of symbolic graph representation and LLMs could enhance practical applicability. It would also be beneficial to explore the performance of SGR with different LLM backbones and provide insights on specific search queries or sessions where SGR may underperform. Finally, we suggest including a comparison of the computational complexity of SGR with baseline models, particularly in real-time search environments, to fully assess the benefits of using LLMs for this task.
