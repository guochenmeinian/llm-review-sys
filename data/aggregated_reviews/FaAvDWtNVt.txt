### Key Points
This paper presents a non-uniform quantization method for deep neural networks by introducing layer-wise parameters \( r \in \mathbb{R}^N \) and an offset \( c \) to model \( N \)-bit quantization. The authors demonstrate the method's applicability across various neural networks (ResNet18, VGG11, ResNet19) and datasets (CIFAR10, ImageNet, CIFAR10 DVS, N-Caltech101) at 4- and 3-bit precision. However, questions arise regarding the practical implementation of the real-valued parameters \( r \) in hardware and their quantization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The method's broad applicability for both artificial neural networks (ANNs) and spiking neural networks (SNNs) is a significant advantage, as many quantization methods do not cater to both.  
- The submission aligns well with the goals of the MLNCP workshop.

Weaknesses:  
- The narrative lacks coherence, jumping between topics such as ANNs, SNNs, and hardware faults without clear transitions.  
- There is insufficient comparison with existing quantization methods, with only results tables referencing other approaches.  
- Manuscript formatting issues exist, including unclear figure captions and subtle use of bold in tables.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the narrative by providing smoother transitions between discussions of ANNs, SNNs, and hardware faults. Additionally, the authors should include a more thorough comparison of their method with existing quantization techniques in the literature. For manuscript formatting, we suggest enhancing figure captions for clarity and improving the presentation of tables, such as making the best performance values more prominent and clarifying abbreviations like W and A. Further explanation of the red plot in Figure 1b is also necessary to aid reader understanding.
