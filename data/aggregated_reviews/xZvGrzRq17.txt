Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm called TD7, which builds upon TD3 by incorporating four additional techniques: (1) state-action learned embeddings (SALE), (2) LAP prioritized replay, (3) a behavior cloning term in the learning objective, and (4) checkpoints, specifically for offline RL. The authors demonstrate that TD7 significantly outperforms existing continuous control algorithms on the D4RL benchmark and MuJoCo tasks, supported by extensive empirical evaluations and ablation studies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and organized, facilitating reader comprehension.
- It includes comprehensive experiments and ablation studies that effectively evaluate the proposed methods.
- The introduction of SALE and its integration into TD3 is original and shows strong empirical performance improvements.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution of SALE is questioned, particularly regarding its applicability to existing RL baselines, with concerns about the general superiority of the proposed embedding.
- The evaluation of TD7 could be expanded to include additional benchmarks beyond MuJoCo and D4RL to better understand its performance and limitations.
- Some proposed improvements are seen as incremental rather than groundbreaking, and intuitive explanations for certain design choices are lacking.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by reorganizing sections to enhance the flow, particularly by placing the ablation study after core empirical results. Additionally, we suggest providing more evidence to demonstrate SALE's applicability to other RL methods and addressing the limitations explicitly within the paper. Expanding the evaluation to include diverse benchmarks like Procgen or Brax would offer a more comprehensive understanding of TD7's performance. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the normalization step's role in preventing mode collapse and to provide a theoretical basis for their claims regarding its effectiveness.
