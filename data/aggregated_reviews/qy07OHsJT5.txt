Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new framework for a probabilistic model called Diffusion Schrödinger Bridge Matching (DSBM) and introduces an iterative algorithm known as Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF). The authors propose a relationship between established generative models (score matching and flow matching) through DSBM. IMF is highlighted as potentially more suitable for neural network training compared to traditional algorithms like IPF. The authors utilize a Brownian bridge structure to maintain key properties, such as the densities of marginal distributions at the start and end of the process. Empirical results indicate that the proposed algorithm often yields superior generation outcomes in specific tasks, such as image transfer.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and presents complex concepts clearly, with most arguments appearing theoretically sound.
2. The IMF approach effectively addresses numerical errors and computational complexity, demonstrating good scalability in empirical results.
3. The paper offers a novel perspective on the diffusion bridge problem and presents promising results with the DSBM-IMF algorithm.

Weaknesses:
1. The significance of DSBM-IMF compared to DSMB-IPF is not clearly demonstrated in the experiments, particularly in Tables 2, 3, and Figure 10. More empirical evidence is needed to substantiate claims of performance improvement and scalability in challenging settings.
2. The algorithm's reliance on the Brownian bridge limits its applicability to general optimal transport problems. More analysis on different classes of $\mathbb{Q}$ or clear justification for the chosen classes in experiments is recommended.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical evidence supporting the significance of DSBM-IMF by including performance comparisons in more challenging or large-scale settings. Additionally, the authors should analyze a broader range of classes of $\mathbb{Q}$ in their experiments or provide a clear justification for the selected classes. Clarifying the differences between IPF and IMF, particularly regarding the benefits of simulating $\Pi_{0, t}$, would enhance understanding. Furthermore, providing more details in Algorithm 1, especially regarding the learning of $\upsilon_{\phi^{\star}}$, would clarify implementation concerns. Lastly, a discussion on the scalability of IMF and DSBM in terms of computational resources and dataset sizes is essential for real-world applicability.
