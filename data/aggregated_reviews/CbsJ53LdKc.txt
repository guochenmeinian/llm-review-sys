Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of how large language models (LLMs) can engage in roleplay and the influence of such prompts on their outputs. The authors investigate the ability of LLMs to impersonate individuals of varying ages and expertise levels across different tasks, including multi-armed bandit, reasoning, and visual category description. The findings suggest that while impersonation can enhance model performance, it also reveals inherent biases within the models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an intriguing and novel topic regarding the impact of role-playing on LLM performance, contributing valuable insights into biases.
- It effectively tests hypotheses across multiple domains and employs persona-specific prompts tailored to each task.
- Results are well-presented and the writing is generally clear and compelling.

Weaknesses:
- The paper makes several overstated claims regarding its results and their alignment with existing literature, particularly concerning developmental psychology.
- There is a lack of robustness in results due to the sensitivity of LLMs to prompt variations, raising questions about the stability of conclusions.
- The exploration of biases is limited, focusing primarily on age while neglecting a broader examination of gender and race biases, which are only superficially addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and accuracy of their claims, particularly in relation to the existing psychology literature, by providing more precise citations and avoiding overgeneralizations. Additionally, we suggest expanding the range of age groups studied to include a more comprehensive analysis of age-related biases. To enhance the robustness of their findings, the authors should investigate the effects of prompt variations and include results from a wider array of model families. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to conduct systematic studies on biases related to gender and race, as well as to explore the impact of impersonation on non-deterministic tasks, such as social opinions or moral judgments. Lastly, we advise the authors to clearly address the ethical implications of exploiting stereotypes to improve model performance in their discussion.
