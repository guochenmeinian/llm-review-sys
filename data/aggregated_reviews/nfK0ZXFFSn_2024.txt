Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to fact verification by harnessing unlabeled LLM generation as a training set. The authors propose that "LLM generates factually correct statements more than hallucinogenic statements," allowing for the identification of a clear subspace between hallucinated and truthful statements. Singular decomposition is employed to project LLM embeddings, with the distance from the origin indicating "abnormality." Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
* The idea of utilizing unlabeled LLM generation is innovative and demonstrates potential advantages over existing methods.
* The paper is well-written and addresses a significant challenge in distinguishing hallucinations from truthful statements.
* The ablation studies provide valuable insights into key components of the method.

Weaknesses:
* The study is limited by its reliance on a small training set from a few datasets, which may not fully showcase the potential of the proposed method. The classification performance is notably lower compared to labeled sets.
* The claim of increased robustness needs clarification, as the method still depends on training with specific data, raising questions about generalizability across domains.
* There is insufficient explanation regarding the hyperparameter $T$ used to split LLM generations, and the justification for using BLUERT for ground truth evaluation is lacking.
* The method's applicability to tasks beyond question-answering is not explored, and access to the internals of proprietary LLMs may limit its practical use.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the training set by incorporating more unlabeled LLM generations to demonstrate the framework's potential. Additionally, please clarify the robustness claims by explaining the data distribution and domain differences between datasets used. We suggest providing a detailed explanation of the hyperparameter $T$ and justifying the use of the BLUERT score for evaluation. Furthermore, consider exploring the method's effectiveness on various language generation tasks and provide qualitative analysis through visualization of the projected embedding space.
