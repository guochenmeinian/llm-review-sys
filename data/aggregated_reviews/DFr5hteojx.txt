### Key Points
This paper presents the PRISM dataset, which encompasses fine-grained feedback from 8,000 conversations with 21 language models, emphasizing diverse geographic and demographic participation in human feedback for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The authors propose that the dataset captures varied perspectives on value-laden and controversial issues, supported by three case studies addressing key research questions about discussion initiation, preferences for aligned LLMs, and the impact of sampling decisions on welfare outcomes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset incorporates stated and contextual preferences from diverse identity groups, providing crucial insights for personalized and AI alignment.
- The survey design and motivation are well documented, with comprehensive ethical considerations and guidelines.
- The detailed mapping of stated preferences and contextual feedback is a significant contribution, with extensive analyses and visualizations that enhance understanding.

Weaknesses:
- Some figures, particularly Figures 3 and 4, are overly complex and difficult to interpret, which detracts from their effectiveness.
- The term "participatory" is used in a limited context, lacking a more nuanced discussion in the introduction regarding its implications for agency and reciprocity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of complex figures by providing additional explanatory text in the subtitles or by separating them into subplots. Specifically, for Figure 4, consider using a color-blind friendly palette and enlarging the figure for better readability. Additionally, we suggest including a more thorough discussion in the main text regarding the experiment on semantically-identical prompts across diverse groups and exploring how stated preferences evolve after interactions with LLMs. Lastly, we encourage the authors to address the nuances of the term "participatory" in the introduction to better contextualize its use in the dataset.
