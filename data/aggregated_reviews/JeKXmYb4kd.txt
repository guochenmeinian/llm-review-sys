### Key Points
This paper presents a study on location estimation, proposing two minimax optimal algorithms for estimating an unknown shift from samples of a known distribution. The focus is on small sample sizes, contrasting with the asymptotic optimality of maximum likelihood estimators for large samples. The authors aim to minimize estimation error and the length of confidence intervals, demonstrating the effectiveness of their methods through empirical evaluations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper provides optimal results on a fundamental problem in location estimation, utilizing non-trivial techniques effectively.  
- It is well-written, with a solid motivation for the proposed methods, particularly in Section 1.1.  

Weaknesses:  
- The significance of the problem in parametric statistics is not clearly articulated, leaving readers uncertain about the importance of improved methods.  
- The paper lacks discussion on running times and does not adequately compare the proposed algorithms with existing methods like smoothed MLE.  
- The empirical evaluation is limited, with only one example provided, making it unclear under what conditions the proposed estimators excel or falter.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for their algorithms, particularly Algorithm 1, by providing examples similar to those discussed in the introduction. Additionally, the authors should clarify the significance of their work in the context of parametric statistics. A more comprehensive empirical evaluation across various datasets and conditions would enhance the paper's contributions. Furthermore, addressing the running time of the algorithms and comparing them with existing methods like smoothed MLE would strengthen the analysis. Lastly, we suggest placing Figure 2 after Section 5 for better flow.
