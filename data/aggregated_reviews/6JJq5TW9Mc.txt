Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework called IFactor for modeling latent state variables in reinforcement learning (RL) systems, categorizing these variables into four types based on their interactions with actions and rewards. The authors propose a method that separates latent states into blocks, allowing for block-wise identifiability, which enhances the stability and compactness of representations. The paper includes extensive experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework on benchmark tasks, highlighting the importance of reward-relevant states in policy learning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The idea of block-level disentanglement is well-motivated and effectively relaxes model assumptions.
2. The theoretical justification for block-wise identifiability is robust, providing a clear framework for understanding latent variable interactions.
3. The experiments and ablation studies are thorough, convincingly supporting the claims regarding the framework's efficacy.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a discussion of related work, particularly regarding previous methods that have explored controllable and uncontrollable components, such as InfoPower and Iso-Dream.
2. The absence of error bars in baseline comparisons and the inclusion of somewhat outdated methods limit the robustness of the experimental results.
3. Some sections, particularly the theoretical propositions, could benefit from clearer writing and more intuitive explanations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section by including discussions on methods like InfoPower and Iso-Dream, clarifying how IFactor differs from these approaches. Additionally, including error bars for baseline comparisons and updating the baseline methods to more recent approaches would strengthen the experimental validation. We suggest revising sections 2 and 3 for clarity, potentially consolidating propositions and providing more intuitive explanations to enhance reader understanding. Finally, addressing the limitations regarding the adaptability of the method to non-stationary rewards would provide a more comprehensive view of its applicability.
