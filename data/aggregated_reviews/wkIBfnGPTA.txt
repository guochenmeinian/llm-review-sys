Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a unified backdoor attack framework, VillanDiffusion, aimed at enhancing the analysis of backdoor attacks on deep models (DMs). The framework encompasses both unconditional and conditional DMs, including denoising-based and score-based models, as well as various training-free samplers, facilitating comprehensive evaluations. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of VillanDiffusion through extensive experiments, particularly highlighting its application to caption-based backdoor attacks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it accessible to a broad audience.
- It provides a thorough analysis of backdoor attacks on DMs and proposes a unified approach that is technically sound.
- The experimental results are comprehensive and validate the effectiveness of the VillanDiffusion framework across diverse DM configurations.

Weaknesses:
- The framework's effectiveness is questionable, particularly as it requires a poison ratio of up to 20%, which is higher than typical in other tasks, raising concerns about its practicality.
- There is insufficient detail regarding the sampling process, and the order of formulas 8-12 lacks clarity; a clearer presentation following the sequence of forward process → backward process → sampling process is recommended.
- The paper does not adequately differentiate its contributions from prior works, particularly BadDiffusion, and lacks comparisons with existing methods, limiting the assessment of improvements in backdoor attack efficacy.
- Several typographical errors and unclear statements need correction, such as "Praobility" in the title and the last term in Eq. 4.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the sampling process by providing detailed descriptions and reorganizing the presentation of formulas 8-12. Additionally, the authors should address the limitations of their framework, particularly the practical challenges of executing backdoor attacks, and emphasize the societal impacts of their work. A more thorough comparison with existing methods, including a discussion on the differences between their approach and BadDiffusion, would enhance the paper's contribution. Finally, correcting typographical errors and providing further analysis on the robustness of DMs against backdoor attacks would strengthen the overall evaluation.
