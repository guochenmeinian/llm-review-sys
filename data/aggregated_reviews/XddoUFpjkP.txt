Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a generalization of Besov processes to higher dimensions, introducing the Q-exponential (Q-EP) process that satisfies stochastic process constraints unmet by previous works. The authors develop a corresponding probability distribution, the q-exponential distribution (q-ED), facilitating sampling and Bayesian modeling. They demonstrate the efficacy of their method through experiments in functional data analysis, image reconstruction, and inverse problems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed Q-EP process offers a compelling family of stochastic processes with various applications.
- The experimental results convincingly showcase the method's efficacy.
- The derivation of Q-EP appears solid, providing a probabilistic description that corresponds to \(\ell_q\)-regularization and allows easy computation of posterior predictive distributions.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental results are based on small images, raising questions about scalability to larger images and high-dimensional domains.
- The paper lacks sufficient background information, making it challenging for readers unfamiliar with the field to grasp the concepts.
- The theoretical discussion does not clarify in which non-parametric problems the developed priors may outperform Gaussian process priors.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by providing more background on the problem setting and Besov processes to enhance accessibility for readers. Additionally, the authors should address how to choose \(q\) and whether \(q=1\) should be the default starting point. It would also be beneficial to discuss the conditions under which the Q-EP process offers better rates of posterior contraction compared to Gaussian process priors. Furthermore, we suggest validating the experimental settings in subsection 4.1 to ensure fairness in comparisons with the Besov process. Lastly, clarifying the relationship between Q-EP and \(L_p\) regularization would strengthen the paper's contributions.
