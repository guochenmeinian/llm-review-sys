Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DiffCSP, a diffusion model aimed at crystal structure prediction, generating stable crystal structures based on given compositions. The model incorporates both lattice matrix and fractional coordinates in its diffusion process. Experimental results indicate that DiffCSP outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets while also addressing periodicity constraints effectively.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method demonstrates superior performance compared to previous approaches in crystal structure prediction.
- The problem setting is novel and engaging for the machine learning community.
- The writing is clear, supported by informative figures, formulas, and proofs.
- Comprehensive experiments include adjustments to adapt the framework to a generative model setting, with thorough ablation studies.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the method is limited, as it closely resembles existing diffusion techniques for molecular conformer generation and CDVAE.
- The model does not consider other distribution invariant constraints, such as the need for SO(3) invariance for chiral crystals and periodic invariance in lattice transformations.
- The comparison of DiffCSP with CDVAE may not be entirely fair due to differences in model adaptation.
- The authors do not report any new crystal structures, which could enhance the paper's impact.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their approach by clearly articulating the unique contributions of their diffusion model compared to existing methods.
- Consider addressing the limitations regarding distribution invariance, specifically the need for SO(3) invariance and periodicity in lattice transformations.
- We suggest including a discussion on the rationale behind using Gaussian diffusion for lattice parameters and whether it is the most suitable choice.
- It would be beneficial to clarify the differences between E(3) and SE(3) equivariance and their implications for the model.
- We recommend that the authors include training time in the main text to provide practical insights for users.
- Listing novel crystal structures with lower energies than those in existing databases could significantly enhance the paper's impact.
