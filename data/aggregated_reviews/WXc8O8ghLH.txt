Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an optimization-theoretic characterization of the softmax attention model \( f(X) = v^{\top}X^{\top}\text{softmax}(XW^{\top}p) \), linking it to max-margin problems. The authors establish the convergence of gradient descent on \( p \) for a fixed \( v \) and explore the joint convergence of \( (v,p) \) through regularization path analysis. They extend the max-margin selection idea to a general nonlinear model, supported by numerical studies. Additionally, the paper introduces a novel attention model that modifies the conventional attention mechanism by incorporating a tunable prompt, motivated by prompt-tuning and the '[CLS]' token. The authors argue that their model recovers self-attention in specific scenarios and connects to matrix factorization, providing a fundamental perspective on learning. The findings suggest that the implicit bias of self-attention can be predicted through adjustments to their proposed ATT-SVM framework, emphasizing the dynamics of attention weights during training.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers an interesting and important result, enhancing the theoretical understanding of attention mechanisms, which is crucial for large language models.
- It presents a clear exposition with adequate explanations, contributing to the literature on implicit bias and optimization dynamics.
- The paper introduces new techniques for analyzing maximum margin implicit bias in nonlinear models, contributing valuable insights into attention dynamics.
- The experimental results support the theoretical claims, demonstrating alignment between the model's predictions and observed behaviors in attention mechanisms.

Weaknesses:
- Some assumptions, particularly in Assumption B regarding equal scores for non-optimal tokens, are strong and may not hold in practice.
- The paper lacks convergence results for the joint optimization of \( (v,p) \).
- The simplification of the attention model may render the findings less relevant to standard attention mechanisms, raising concerns about the applicability of the results.
- The model's departure from traditional attention mechanisms raises concerns about its practical applicability, as it is described as "attention-like" and may not be commonly encountered in practice.
- Some reviewers expressed confusion regarding the motivations for the model's design and its differences from existing literature.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the robustness of their assumptions, particularly by addressing the implications of Assumption B. Additionally, the authors should provide convergence results for the joint optimization of \( (v,p) \). To enhance the relevance of their findings, we suggest including more complex models that closely resemble standard attention mechanisms. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the motivation behind their model simplifications and to provide more concrete examples illustrating the application of their findings in real-world scenarios. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their exposition by starting with the conventional $(W_K, W_Q)$ before transitioning to $W_{\text{prod}}$. Lastly, addressing the questions regarding the training dynamics of standard attention models and the differences in proof techniques compared to linear models would strengthen the paper.
