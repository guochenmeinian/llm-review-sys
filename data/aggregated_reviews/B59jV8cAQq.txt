### Key Points
This paper presents DIET, a simplified self-supervised learning (SSL) method that focuses on instance recognition and claims to recover recognizable cluster-based latent representations. The authors provide theoretical guarantees on the identifiability of features learned through DIET, supported by empirical verification under various conditions. The work emphasizes the development of cluster-based latent representations when instance augmentations and intra-class samples are drawn from von Mises-Fisher distributions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper offers theoretical guarantees on feature identifiability using DIET, with interesting theoretical results empirically verified under both conforming and violating conditions.  
- The assumptions are clearly articulated, and the problem statement, approach, and results are presented with clarity.  

Weaknesses:  
- The problem setup may be oversimplified for theoretical analysis, and there are missing discussions that could enhance understanding of the intuitions and results.  
- The reliance on the von Mises-Fisher distribution as the data-generating process may oversimplify the scenario, potentially trivializing results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the theoretical guarantees, particularly addressing the comparison with Zimmerman et al., 2021, regarding post-training representations. Additionally, clarifying the motivation for the cluster-centric approach and the implications of Assumption 1 (i) would enhance the paper's depth. We suggest providing further explanations on why identifiability suffers with fewer clusters and a more detailed analysis of architectural choices and parameters in the evaluation. Lastly, addressing the clarity of the main body in relation to the appendix would improve the paper's accessibility.
