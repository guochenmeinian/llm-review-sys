Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents HYDRA, a learning-based model factorization framework aimed at personalizing black-box large language models (LLMs) by integrating user-specific and shared behavior patterns. The framework employs a reranker to prioritize relevant historical records and an adapter to align outputs with individual preferences, thus avoiding the need for direct access to model parameters. Experimental results indicate that HYDRA achieves an average relative improvement of 9.01% over existing state-of-the-art prompt-based methods across five diverse personalization tasks in the LaMP benchmark.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a novel method for personalizing black-box LLMs by combining user-specific behavior with shared knowledge, addressing limitations of prior approaches.
2. Experimental results demonstrate that HYDRA outperforms existing methods, achieving a 9.01% improvement across multiple tasks.
3. The authors plan to release the code repository and model checkpoints, enhancing transparency and reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks an analysis of HYDRA's efficiency despite requiring multiple training stages, as indicated in Appendix C.
2. The description of the user-specific head is limited to a single layer of a feed-forward network, lacking details about the base model.
3. The HYDRA-Adapter Inference method increases inference time significantly by generating multiple candidates and selecting the highest score.
4. The scalability of user-specific heads raises concerns about computational expenses and storage as user numbers increase.
5. The effectiveness of HYDRA is heavily reliant on the quality and relevance of historical data, which may not always be available.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by providing a detailed analysis of HYDRA's efficiency, including time complexity and training runtime. Additionally, a more comprehensive introduction of the base model is necessary. The authors should clarify the fairness of the HYDRA-Adapter Inference method in comparison to baselines, considering the randomness in LLM generation. Furthermore, addressing how HYDRA performs with varying user behavior histories and providing more detailed analyses on the tasks benefiting from shared versus individual preferences would strengthen the paper. Finally, releasing the source code and including a README file upon release would enhance reproducibility.
