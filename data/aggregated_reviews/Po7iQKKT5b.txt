Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the generalization of motion segmentation models to random dot kinematograms, comparing various learning-based motion estimation models against a classical motion energy model. The authors explore the performance of these models in relation to human perception, providing a human performance upper bound. The study is the first to apply a motion energy model to the motion segmentation task specifically with random dot scenes. Additionally, the paper explores inductive biases in human perception, particularly in relation to random dot stimuli, proposing that while retinal waves before birth may not fully account for observed differences, architectural biases likely play a significant role. The work includes a substantial set of experiments that reviewers believe will contribute valuably to the field, and the authors acknowledge the importance of further investigating the origins of these inductive biases.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work contributes novel insights into the generalization of motion segmentation methods to random dot kinematograms.
- The experimental analysis includes supportive psychophysical experiments on humans, serving as an upper bound for model performance.
- A comprehensive evaluation of 28 optical flow models is presented.
- The paper provides a comprehensive set of experiments and contributions deemed valuable to the field.
- The authors effectively addressed reviewer concerns, leading to a clearer understanding of the issues raised.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks discussion of relevant related work that utilized classical spatiotemporal oriented energy models for dynamic texture recognition.
- The training data for motion segmentation is weak, raising questions about the conclusions drawn. The inclusion of larger, diversified datasets like DAVIS or YouTube-VOS could enhance the study's robustness.
- The comparison of model performance to human responses is ambiguous, and the online experiment yielded unexpectedly low-quality outcomes, suggesting potential issues with participant interpretation or individual differences.
- There is currently no evidence supporting the specific factors that cause the identified inductive biases.
- The scope of expanding to general-purpose benchmarks may be beyond the current focus of the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by incorporating discussions on related works, particularly those that have utilized classical models for dynamic texture recognition. Additionally, the authors should consider using more robust training datasets, such as DAVIS or YouTube-VOS, to validate their findings. Clarifying the differences between their proposed model and the SOENet model, as well as addressing the ambiguous performance comparisons with human responses, would strengthen the paper. Furthermore, we suggest conducting ablation studies to better understand the components of the motion energy model and its implications for generalization. We also recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the specific factors contributing to inductive biases by integrating evidence to support their claims. Finally, clarifying the limitations regarding the scope of their work in relation to general-purpose benchmarks would enhance the overall relevance of the study.
