Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents techniques for solving linear systems in Gaussian process (GP) hyperparameter optimization, focusing on a "pathwise estimator" for log determinant gradient estimation and warm starting linear solvers. The authors claim that the pathwise estimator improves convergence by making all-zero initialization closer to the solution and allows for reuse of linear system solutions during prediction. Additionally, the paper discusses the effectiveness of warm starts combined with the pathwise estimator, proposing that both techniques reduce the number of required iterations by minimizing the distance the solver must travel in the optimization landscape. Empirical results demonstrate significant speed-ups across various datasets, particularly for solvers like CG and AP in ill-conditioned problems, with extensive evaluations supporting the proposed methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The writing is clear, and the paper effectively combines multiple techniques to achieve substantial speed-ups across diverse datasets.
- The empirical evaluations are thorough, covering datasets from 10,000 to 1.8 million data points, providing valuable insights for practitioners.
- The authors provide a detailed explanation of the efficacy of warm starts and pathwise estimators across different solvers.
- Empirical results demonstrate the performance gains achieved through these methods, particularly in ill-conditioned problems.
- The proposed methods can be easily integrated into existing GP regression frameworks.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the techniques is limited, as similar concepts exist in prior work, such as the pathwise estimator in Gardner et al. (2018) and warm starting in Artemev et al. (2021) and Antoran et al. (2023).
- Theoretical analysis is lacking, particularly regarding the combination of techniques and their implications for solver performance.
- The paper does not compare its results to a reliable exact method, making it difficult to assess the predictive performance of the proposed approaches.
- Concerns are raised regarding the experimental setup, specifically the reliance on approximations without clear comparisons to state-of-the-art methods.
- Important baseline experiments were conducted during the rebuttal phase, leading to potential inaccuracies and a lack of thoroughness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis of the introduced techniques, particularly the combination of the pathwise estimator and warm start, to clarify their effectiveness. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons to exact methods, such as Cholesky factorization with BFGS optimization, to provide a ground-truth evaluation of the proposed methods. Improving the experimental design by including comparisons to stronger baseline methods would also validate the performance of their approximations. Furthermore, we recommend ensuring that all critical baseline experiments are completed prior to the rebuttal phase to avoid rushed results that may contain errors. Clarifying the generation and computational cost of the $\xi$ in equation (11) relative to the system solves would enhance the paper's clarity. Finally, consider renaming the "pathwise estimator" to avoid confusion with established terminology and ensure that all relevant results, especially for large datasets, are included in the tables for comprehensive evaluation.
