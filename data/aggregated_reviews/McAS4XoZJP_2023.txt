Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a platform called "Alexa Arena," designed for simulating embodied AI interactions through gamified tasks, enabling users to engage in collaborative instruction-following scenarios. The platform facilitates the collection of a substantial dataset comprising over 9,000 dialogue sessions and 46,000 human-annotated instructions, aimed at enhancing the development of assistive conversational agents. The authors propose a unique evaluation protocol that allows for both real-time observation and offline assessment of AI performance. Additionally, the paper introduces a framework for simulating object interactions in a game-like environment, emphasizing the configuration of game missions through challenge definition format (CDF) files. However, the platform is closed-source and governed by a restrictive license that transfers all intellectual property to Amazon, limiting its utility for other researchers.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The platform offers a user-friendly and engaging environment, promoting effective data collection.  
- It includes a rich dataset and an interactive evaluation protocol, supporting robust research in embodied AI.  
- The gamification aspect enhances user experience and encourages participation in data collection.  
- The authors are actively working on securing a permissive license, which is crucial for community access.  
- The framework allows for flexible configuration of game missions without modifying the underlying simulator.  

Weaknesses:  
- Concerns regarding the authenticity of the robot's dialogue responses and the clarity of the platform's functionalities.  
- The closed-source nature of the platform and the extreme licensing terms render it practically unusable for most researchers, as it prevents modification, distribution, or derivative work.  
- Some details about user interactions, mission design, and evaluation metrics are insufficiently explained.  
- The dialogue annotation process appears somewhat unnatural, potentially affecting the evaluation of the system's behavior.  
- Object properties and interactions within the platform appear arbitrary and poorly defined, limiting the dataset's applicability.  
- The tasks presented are overly simplistic, lacking the complexity that could be achieved in a rich game-like environment.  
- The benchmark is criticized for its limited scope, primarily focusing on object retrieval tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the platform's capabilities by providing detailed descriptions of its functionalities. Specifically, please clarify how the robot generates dialogue responses and whether user-generated dialogue is necessary. Additionally, we suggest including screenshots or videos demonstrating the data creation process and the various dialogue settings available in the platform. 

Further, please address the low mission success rate for "color&deliver" in Table 3, and provide a comprehensive comparison of existing EAI benchmarks, particularly with META's Habitat and AI2-THOR. We urge the authors to improve the transparency of the licensing terms in the publication to clearly communicate the closed-source nature of the platform and its implications for potential users. We also encourage the authors to consider making the platform open-source under a more permissive license to enhance its utility for the research community. 

Lastly, we suggest that the authors expedite the resolution of licensing issues to allow reviewers to test the environment and provide informed feedback. Additionally, please expand the complexity of the tasks and object interactions to better reflect real-world scenarios and allow for more nuanced research applications.
