Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into graph learning from stationary signals, introducing the LogSpecT algorithm to address limitations of existing methods reliant on spectral templates. The authors propose a novel formulation that incorporates a log barrier term, ensuring feasibility in graph learning scenarios previously deemed infeasible. They establish theoretical recovery guarantees and develop an efficient algorithm based on linearized ADMM. Empirical results indicate that LogSpecT outperforms prior methods, including rSpecT, in recovering underlying graphs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The problem setting is relevant and well-motivated within graph signal processing, with practical applications.
2. The introduction of the log barrier in the objective function is a significant technical contribution, enabling solutions to previously infeasible scenarios.
3. The paper is well-written, with clear technical content and strong empirical results demonstrating the method's superiority.

Weaknesses:
1. The technical contributions may be narrowly focused on overcoming the limitations of spectral templates.
2. Experimental descriptions lack detail regarding the number and nature of observations, as well as the representation of edges in networks.
3. The absence of error bars in results limits the ability to assess the methods' performance comprehensively.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by providing more details on the number of observations and the nature of these observations, as well as clarifying what the edges represent. Additionally, commentary on the F-measure not reaching 1 in certain scenarios should be included to address potential concerns. Including error bars and a table summarizing all measurements, such as precision and recall, would enhance the clarity of results. Finally, an exploration of the computational complexity and time until convergence for the methods should be added, along with a definition of the step size tau.
