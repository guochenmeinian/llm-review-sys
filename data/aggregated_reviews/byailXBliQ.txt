### Key Points
This paper presents a detailed study on the interplay between conformational and structural diversity, data size, and model generalization in machine learning for drug discovery. The authors isolate structural and conformational diversity to assess their impact on training sets for machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIP). The findings regarding the threshold number of conformations needed for adequate coverage of chemical space are significant, although the novelty of this result is limited.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The writing is excellent, with a clearly defined motivation, problem setup, and well-presented results and discussions.
- The study effectively identifies the threshold number of conformations necessary for different systems, which is a valuable contribution.

Weaknesses:
- The conclusions regarding the threshold number of conformations may lack generalizability across different chemical systems due to varying complexities.
- The representation of structural diversity solely by the number of structures is insufficient; the diversity of these structures should also be evaluated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve Figure 1 by explicitly drawing the spectrum to enhance reader understanding. Additionally, we suggest discussing the generalizability of the conclusions made in this work, particularly regarding the threshold number of conformations for different chemical systems. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to incorporate measures of similarity, such as Tanimoto similarity or latent space distances, to better assess structural diversity. Lastly, exploring the impact of conformational diversity on different molecule classes, particularly larger and peptide-like biological molecules, would enrich the study.
