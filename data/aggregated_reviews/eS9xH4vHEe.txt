### Key Points
This paper presents the "Two Students" (2S) approach to uncertainty quantification (UQ) in federated learning (FL), distilling a Bayesian model ensemble (BME) into two student models: one for accurate predictions and another for UQ. The method employs credible intervals to filter unreliable models and is validated through regression tasks, showcasing its scalability and effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Innovative approach combining ensemble learning with uncertainty quantification in federated learning.
- Novel use of credible intervals to filter drifted models, enhancing robustness in non-i.i.d. data environments.
- Efficient and scalable solution enabling cost-effective UQ on client devices with minimal computational overhead.
- Well-organized manuscript that clearly articulates the motivation and methodology of the 2S approach.

Weaknesses:
- Lack of a clear strategy for determining the optimal truncation filter threshold (γ) and its activation during training.
- Experiments are limited to a simplified regression problem, which may not fully capture real-world complexities, particularly in dynamic and high-dimensional datasets.
- Limited discussion of potential communication overhead in real-world FL settings, where client-server exchanges can be a bottleneck.
- The method's focus on a specific form of UQ raises questions about its generalizability to other machine learning tasks beyond regression.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the strategy for determining the optimal truncation filter threshold (γ) and specify when to activate the filter during training. Additionally, conducting experiments on more complex datasets would enhance the study's relevance to real-world applications. A broader comparison to other recent methods in FL would also strengthen the manuscript. Finally, addressing potential communication overhead in practical FL scenarios is essential for a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method.
