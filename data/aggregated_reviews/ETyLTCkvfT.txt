### Key Points
This paper presents a systematic investigation of the impact of jailbreak defenses on the performance of large language models (LLMs). The authors propose USEBench, a benchmarking dataset, and USEIndex, a new metric for evaluating utility, safety, and usability. The study reveals significant trade-offs, indicating that while jailbreak defenses improve safety, they often lead to substantial utility degradation, with some models experiencing up to a 29% decrease in performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction clearly outlines the research gap and contributions, making the paper accessible even to non-experts.
- The comprehensive evaluation framework considers multiple dimensions of LLM performance, including accuracy, compliance, safety, and usability.
- The experiments are well-structured, involving various LLMs and defense strategies, contributing to a deeper understanding of the topic.
- The insights regarding SafeUnlearn's effectiveness in balancing utility and safety are thought-provoking.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation lacks in-depth analysis and actionable conclusions for model safety researchers and developers, particularly regarding the mechanisms behind the effectiveness of SafeUnlearn compared to other defenses.
- The definitions of key terms such as "utility degradation" and "safety elevation" are dense and require further clarification to enhance readability.
- The paper does not thoroughly compare the evaluated defense strategies with state-of-the-art techniques, limiting its contribution to the field.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the depth of their analysis by exploring the underlying mechanisms of the defense strategies, particularly why SafeUnlearn is more effective than its counterparts. Additionally, the authors should clarify the definitions of key terms and provide a more detailed comparison with existing state-of-the-art methods. It would also be beneficial to include a comprehensive evaluation of fine-tuning-based methods across a wider range of models. Finally, we suggest addressing the omission of multi-model defense strategies to enhance the scope and relevance of the research.
