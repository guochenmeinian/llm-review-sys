Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CreDes, a framework aimed at enhancing long-range reasoning in large language models (LLMs) through two main components: Causal Relationship Enhancement (CRE) and Dual-End Searching (DES). CRE focuses on reducing causal hallucinations by optimizing the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) during training, while DES improves efficiency by searching from both initial and goal states on a causal probability tree. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of CreDes through experiments on datasets like Blocksworld, GSM8K, and Hanoi Tower, showing improvements in accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, the authors argue that their approach can improve collaboration between human operators and algorithm engineers in real-world scenarios, such as logistics and warehouse item arrangement. They acknowledge the need for further validation with real-world data and emphasize the alignment of their experimental paradigm with established methodologies in the field.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a novel approach that addresses significant limitations in LLMs' reasoning capabilities from a causal perspective.
2. Comprehensive evaluation across multiple datasets demonstrates improvements over existing methods.
3. The use of causal modeling concepts like ATE provides a solid theoretical foundation.
4. The authors provide a clear rationale for the applicability of their method to real-world scenarios.
5. They demonstrate a robust experimental design that aligns with existing literature, particularly in the context of Blocksworld scenarios.
6. The authors provide a comprehensive response to reviewer feedback, demonstrating a commitment to refining their work.

Weaknesses:
1. The generalizability and scalability of the method are questionable, as it primarily tests on structured tasks, with performance dropping significantly in longer reasoning scenarios.
2. The clarity of the DES section is insufficient, and the paper lacks detailed discussions on the differences between correlation and causation.
3. The theoretical analysis lacks depth and clarity, particularly regarding the relationship between causality, ATE, and the implications of result stability.
4. The writing style and presentation require improvement to enhance clarity and engagement.
5. There is a lack of comparison with more recent state-of-the-art methods, limiting the clarity of the technical contribution.
6. Concerns remain regarding the scalability of the model and the clarity of the theoretical analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the DES section by providing more detailed explanations regarding the ATE's role in the loss function and the process of counterfactual assessments. Additionally, the authors should clarify the assumptions made in estimating ATE and discuss the implications if these assumptions are violated. We suggest including a more comprehensive analysis of the method's scalability to larger models and its applicability to less structured reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors enhance the theoretical analysis by providing clearer explanations of the concepts of causality and ATE, including relevant equations and references to support their claims. It is crucial to enhance the writing style and presentation to make the paper more accessible, addressing typos and improving diagram clarity. Finally, we encourage the authors to include more detailed error analysis and statistical significance in the revised paper, and ensure that all reviewers actively participate in the discussion phase to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the work.
