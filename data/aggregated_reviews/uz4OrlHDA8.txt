### Key Points
This paper investigates temporal data distribution shifts in financial sentiment analysis, identifying performance degradation in fine-tuned models under such shifts. The authors propose a novel method that combines out-of-distribution detection with time series modeling to enhance adaptability in volatile financial markets. The study provides empirical evidence of the impact of these shifts and offers insights into improving sentiment analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-structured and addresses a significant problem in financial sentiment analysis.  
- It utilizes a real-world financial social media dataset spanning three years, ensuring the findings are grounded in applicable data.  
- The proposed method effectively combines out-of-distribution detection with autoregressive time series modeling, contributing valuable insights into model performance under temporal shifts.  

Weaknesses:  
- There is a lack of innovation in the modeling approach, appearing as a stacking and permutation of existing models.  
- The authors do not sufficiently justify why semantic features corresponding to sentiment at different times are significantly different.  
- The paper lacks emphasis on designing models or specific fine-tuning methods to address the volatility of financial sentiment data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the differences in semantic features corresponding to sentiment over time. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the novelty of the modeling approach to avoid perceptions of incremental work. Finally, we encourage the authors to emphasize the design of models or specific fine-tuning methods that address the volatility of financial sentiment data.
