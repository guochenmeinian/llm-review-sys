Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel quasi-Bayesian method, QB-Vine, which applies vine copulas to recursive Bayesian predictive distributions, aiming to bypass expensive posterior integration. The authors propose a two-part method involving independent recursion of marginals via bivariate Gaussian copulas and the estimation of a simplified vine copula to capture data dependence, thus relaxing the kernel assumption for Dirichlet Process Mixture Models (DPMM). The paper provides error bounds for both distribution functions and copulas, supported by numerical examples in density estimation and regression/classification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel Bayesian method for predictive distribution computation, demonstrating numerical advantages over existing alternatives.
- Theoretic characterizations of errors are provided, enhancing the method's credibility.
- The authors effectively break down the estimation problem into manageable sub-tasks, offering tangible contributions and convergence results.

Weaknesses:
- The dimension of the problems addressed is relatively low (up to 64), raising concerns about scalability.
- The clarity of technical derivations and notation could be improved, as some aspects may confuse readers familiar with traditional Bayesian methods.
- The contribution and novelty of the work are questioned, particularly regarding the significance of certain equations and the limited scope of empirical results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction by properly defining key terms such as "vine copulas" and ensuring consistent notation throughout the paper. Additionally, we suggest providing a more formal introduction to vine copulas in a dedicated subsection, separate from their application to quasi-Bayes. The authors should also include pseudocode summarizing their methodology and discuss the computational costs associated with each step, particularly in relation to scalability. Furthermore, we advise addressing the limitations of the empirical results by exploring additional metrics beyond the log-predictive metric to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of performance.
