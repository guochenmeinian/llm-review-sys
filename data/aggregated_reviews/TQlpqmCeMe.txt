### Key Points
This paper presents a study on moment-injective functions defined by neural networks, particularly focusing on their application to injective multiset functions. The authors propose that depth-1 neural networks with width at least \(2nd + 1\) and analytic non-polynomial activation functions can define moment-injective embeddings for almost all weight choices. The paper extends prior work by demonstrating that these results can be generalized to deeper networks, emphasizing the significance of the depth-1 case due to its minimal parameter requirements. The findings are motivated by recent advancements in Graph neural networks and Message-Passing Neural networks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper provides a theoretical basis for the effectiveness of neural networks in defining injective multiset functions, building on the foundational work of the Deep-Sets paper. The main result, Theorem 3.3, establishes that depth-1 networks achieve the best-known embedding dimension for injective multiset functions. The rigorous proofs and clear structure enhance the paper's quality, and the comparison to prior work is well-articulated.

Weaknesses:  
The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the applications of injective multiset functions, particularly in the introduction. While some examples are provided in Section 6, a broader context would enhance understanding. Additionally, the implications of using polynomial activations, as opposed to piecewise-linear ones, are not addressed. There are also minor typographical errors and clarity issues in the presentation of certain concepts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by including a more comprehensive discussion of the applications of injective multiset functions. Additionally, addressing the implications of polynomial activations in comparison to piecewise-linear activations would strengthen the paper. We suggest replacing "up to a multiplicative factor of 2" with "up to a multiplicative factor of 2+o(1)" for mathematical precision. Furthermore, enhancing the explanation of the finite witness theorem in the main text, particularly around Theorem 3.3, would improve readability and context. Lastly, we encourage the authors to correct the identified typographical errors to enhance the overall quality of the paper.
