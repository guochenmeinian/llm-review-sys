### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for analyzing content creators' behaviors on online platforms, focusing on engagement-based optimization. The authors explore the trade-off between enhancing content quality and employing gaming tactics, establishing a symmetric mixed Nash equilibrium that reveals a positive correlation between quality and gaming. The study assesses the implications of engagement optimization on user consumption and welfare.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses significant issues in online content platforms, examining the motivations and incentives of content creators.
- The theoretical results are sound and provide valuable insights, particularly the correlation between content quality and gaming strategies.
- The problem formulation is well-explained and rooted in game theory, with clear and interesting insights drawn from the mathematical model.

Weaknesses:
- The findings rely on a simplified model with only two dimensions: gaming and quality. Generalization to scenarios with multiple dimensions is questionable.
- The uniqueness of the symmetric mixed Nash equilibrium characterized in Theorem 1 is unclear; if not unique, how can all possible equilibria be characterized?
- The assumption of homogeneous content creators sharing identical cost functions seems unrealistic; the analysis could benefit from accommodating heterogeneity among creators.
- The model's simplification regarding user choice being noiseless raises concerns about its applicability in scenarios with irrational user behavior or changing preferences.
- Minor typographical errors need correction, including "observe observe" in Line 287.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the model by considering scenarios with multiple dimensions related to gaming and quality to enhance generalizability. Additionally, the authors should clarify the uniqueness of the symmetric mixed Nash equilibrium and explore the extension to asymmetric mixed Nash equilibria. Justifying the assumption of homogeneous content creators and discussing potential adaptations for heterogeneity would strengthen the analysis. Furthermore, addressing the implications of user choice being noiseless and how the model accounts for the exponential discounting of lower-ranked items in user feeds would enhance the robustness of the findings. Lastly, we suggest correcting the identified typographical errors.
