Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for providing counterfactual explanations in time-series forecasting models, focusing on detecting salient timesteps critical to future events. The method is based on bottom-up preattentive saliency and is evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its ability to localize salient time steps. The authors aim to link saliency-based explanations with counterfactual reasoning, leveraging information-theoretic saliency grounded in human visual cognition.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The project addresses a relevant and underexplored issue in explaining time-series forecasting models, motivated by psychology and cognitive science.  
- The formulation is elegant, and results from both synthetic and real-world experiments are strong, particularly in the vehicle trajectory analysis.  
- The key idea linking counterfactual reasoning with saliency-based explanations is well-motivated and explained.

Weaknesses:  
- The explanation of salient timesteps as counterfactuals is unclear, as the method functions more as a "critical event detector" rather than providing true explanations.  
- The experimental settings lack clarity, resembling critical event detection rather than an explanation task, necessitating a reconsideration of tasks to generate counterfactual explanations.  
- The novelty of the method is questionable, as it builds on prior work without adequately highlighting its contributions.  
- Some methodological aspects, particularly in Section 4.3, are difficult to follow, and additional baselines beyond DeepShap are needed for comparison.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how salient timesteps serve as counterfactual explanations and address the distinction between critical event detection and model explanations. The authors should reconsider the experimental design to include tasks that generate and compare counterfactual explanations. Additionally, we suggest including a running example throughout the methodology to enhance understanding and expanding the discussion of real-world examples with quantitative metrics. Finally, the authors should clarify the novelty of their approach and ensure that the causal graph adheres to established standards in causal reasoning.
