Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method to enhance the hardware resiliency of image classifiers by utilizing CLIP embeddings to initialize the last classification layer. The authors demonstrate that this approach significantly improves misclassification rates under random-bit flipping, achieving up to a 14x increase in reliability compared to traditional methods. The study evaluates the method on VGG and ResNet architectures using metrics such as Top2Diff and $\Delta$ Loss.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is simple and effective, leading to significant improvements in hardware reliability.
- The reduction in parameters due to lower embedding dimensions is a beneficial side effect.
- The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations and comprehensive ablation studies.

Weaknesses:
- The paper's positioning is somewhat unclear, as it implies a novel approach while building on existing methods of finetuning CLIP models.
- The evaluation is limited to older architectures like VGG and ResNet, lacking exploration of more recent models such as BEiT and Swin Transformer.
- Some metrics, particularly Top2Diff, are not clearly defined or correctly applied, leading to potential confusion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper's positioning by explicitly stating how their work builds on existing methods rather than presenting it as entirely novel. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the definition and application of the Top2Diff metric to avoid confusion regarding its usage in the context of model deployment. It would also be beneficial to include experiments with more recent architectures to strengthen the contribution and relevance of the findings. Finally, addressing the questions regarding the clarity of metrics and the experimental setup would enhance the paper's comprehensibility.
