Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel backdoor attack method named WaveAttack, which utilizes Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to generate highly stealthy backdoor triggers. The authors propose an asymmetric frequency obfuscation technique that enhances the effectiveness of these triggers during both training and inference stages, achieving high fidelity in poisoned samples.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The proposal to use DWT for creating stealthy backdoor triggers is well-reasoned and validated through numerous image fidelity metrics.  
2. The paper is well-structured and includes extensive experiments that demonstrate the surprising performance of the attack.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The novelty of the work is limited, as it builds on existing frequency-based backdoor attacks without sufficiently differentiating its contributions.  
2. The paper only experiments with the "Haar" wavelet, neglecting other wavelet variations that could enhance the attack's effectiveness.  
3. The threat model is unclear, particularly regarding the assumption that the attacker fully controls the training process.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their work by exploring additional wavelet transforms beyond the "Haar" wavelet and conducting experiments to assess their impact on the attack's effectiveness and stealthiness. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the threat model in Section 3.1 and providing more comprehensive comparisons with other backdoor attack methods, such as LIRA. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to introduce and describe asymmetric frequency obfuscation earlier in the paper, and ensure consistent terminology throughout, particularly regarding "encoder," "decoder," and "generator."
