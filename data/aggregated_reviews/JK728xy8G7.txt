Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SEG, a novel training- and condition-free guidance method for enhancing image generation with diffusion models. The method leverages an energy-based perspective of the self-attention mechanism and introduces a technique to reduce the curvature of the energy landscape of attention, thereby improving the quality of generated images. SEG controls the guidance scale by adjusting a Gaussian kernel parameter, offering a flexible and theoretically grounded approach to both unconditional and conditional image generation. The authors validate SEG's effectiveness through extensive experiments, including comparisons with ControlNet, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods like SAG and PAG. However, the authors clarify that they did not compare their method with text-based image editing approaches like LEdit++ because these do not align with their research goals.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper proposes a simple yet effective procedure to improve unconditional sampling in diffusion models.
- It presents an interesting way to use the unconditional prediction of the network for guidance generation.
- The quality of the images generated is validated through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, showcasing improvements over competitors.
- The inclusion of experiments with ControlNet provides a solid basis for comparison with state-of-the-art methods.

Weaknesses:
- The method relies heavily on the quality of the baseline model, which may amplify biases in existing data.
- There is insufficient discussion on how the Gaussian kernel parameter significantly affects image saturation and quality.
- The paper limits its exploration by not providing comparisons with other diffusion models, raising questions about generalization capability.
- The lack of perceptual metrics for the Vanilla SDXL restricts validation to a few examples.
- The decision not to compare with text-based image editing methods may limit the contextual understanding of the proposed approach's effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their claims, particularly regarding Gaussian curvature attenuation and the linear mapping property in blurring queries. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include a detailed discussion on how to determine the value of Ïƒ and its relationship with gamma to avoid over-saturated images. We suggest expanding the quantitative comparisons to include more baseline methods and metrics, such as LEdit++ and ControlNet, to better contextualize the contributions of SEG. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the computational cost implications of their method, especially in comparison to unconditional generation. Lastly, we recommend that the authors provide a clearer rationale for excluding comparisons with text-based image editing methods, potentially addressing how this decision impacts the perceived relevance of their contributions.
