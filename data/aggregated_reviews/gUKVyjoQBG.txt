### Key Points
This paper presents a novel benchmark, COHESENTIA, for assessing coherence in automatically generated texts. The authors introduce a two-fold labeling schema: a holistic setting, where texts receive a global coherence score (0-100), and an incremental setting, where each sentence is scored individually with reasons for incoherence provided. The benchmark consists of 500 texts annotated by humans via Amazon Mechanical Turk. The authors evaluate various language models, including encoder models (BERT and DeBERTa) and generative models (Flan T5 and GPT-3), finding that results in the incremental setting are superior to those in the holistic setting, and that larger models show only marginal improvements over smaller ones.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The topic is relevant and interesting, contributing to the understanding of coherence in NLP.
- The paper is well-written, self-contained, and presents a sound methodology.
- The novel benchmark can be integrated into frameworks assessing large language models, providing insights into text coherence.

Weaknesses:
- The accuracy of the language models in detecting coherence is not fully satisfying, indicating limitations in their ability to comprehend coherence.
- The rationale for not employing tenfold cross-validation in experiments is unclear and should be addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the dataset's availability and provide a rationale for the chosen data split method. Additionally, we suggest elaborating on how language models can generalize to unseen stories and their role in higher-order tasks related to coherence. Lastly, we encourage the authors to address minor typographical and formatting issues, such as correcting references and ensuring figures are legible.
