### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the last-iterate convergence properties of learning algorithms in zero-sum games, specifically focusing on the limitations of the optimistic multiplicative weights update (OMWU) algorithm. The authors demonstrate that OMWU exhibits slow last-iterate convergence due to a fundamental lack of "forgetfulness," which is contrasted with the more favorable convergence rates of the online gradient descent ascent (OGDA). The paper also discusses the implications of these findings on the broader understanding of learning dynamics in zero-sum matrix games.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper addresses a significant problem in the learning in games community, providing rigorous analysis and valuable insights into the convergence dynamics of OMWU and OGDA. The graphical illustrations enhance understanding, and the discussion of related works is thorough. The elegant takeaway regarding the importance of forgetting may inspire future algorithm design.

Weaknesses:  
The presentation could be improved, as some analyses are complex and may benefit from being less quantitative in the main text, with detailed discussions relegated to the appendix. The concept of a "forgetful algorithm" lacks a clear definition, which could enhance clarity. Additionally, the formulation of some theorems, particularly Theorem 2, could be simplified for better comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the concept of a "forgetful algorithm" by providing an explicit definition. Additionally, we suggest simplifying the formulation of theorems, particularly Theorem 2, to enhance understanding. It may also be beneficial to reduce the quantitative nature of certain analyses in the main paper and move complex discussions to the appendix. Lastly, consider discussing the potential impact of using time-dependent learning rates on the last-iterate convergence of OMWU, as this could address some of the limitations noted in the analysis.
