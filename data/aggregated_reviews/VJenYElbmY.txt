### Key Points
This paper presents a genre analysis of abstracts from research articles in the NLP field, offering insights into linguistic variations based on authors' nationalities. The authors explore four dimensions: lexical, morphological, syntactic, and cohesive perspectives, revealing findings such as lower lexical diversity in authors from China, India, and Japan compared to those from the US and Germany, and differences in the use of first-person verbs and discourse connectors. The authors recommend that ACL's guidelines include useful expressions for non-native writers. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper provides comprehensive analyses from multiple linguistic perspectives, contributing valuable insights into English usage in ACL abstracts.  
- The methodologies employed, including lexical bundle extraction and POS tagging, are robust and well-documented.  
- The topic of linguistic bias in academic writing is significant and timely, addressing important issues faced by non-native English speakers.

Weaknesses:  
- The rationale for focusing exclusively on the NLP domain lacks clarity, and comparisons with previous findings are insufficient.  
- The analysis is limited to abstracts, which may not fully represent the authors' writing capabilities.  
- The statistical significance of the findings is not addressed, raising concerns about the robustness of the results.  
- Recommendations for non-native writers may be perceived as discriminatory and could undermine the focus on technical contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of terms like "native speakers" and "non-native speakers" to avoid ambiguity and potential offense. It is essential to specify whether these terms refer to English as a first language or any non-native language. Additionally, we suggest that the authors conduct statistical significance testing for their findings to enhance the credibility of their results. The authors should also consider expanding their analysis beyond abstracts to include full-text papers, which would provide a more comprehensive view of writing practices. Lastly, we advise revising the recommendations in Section 5 to focus on the contributions of research rather than prescribing specific writing patterns, thereby promoting inclusivity for non-native authors.
