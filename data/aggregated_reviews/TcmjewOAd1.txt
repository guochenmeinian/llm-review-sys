Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a model that adapts pretrained Stable Diffusion for language-conditioned colorization, introducing a luminance encoder to produce latents \(y_{lum}\) that condition the compression decoder and denoiser. The authors utilize a "Channel Extended Convolution block" for denoiser conditioning and employ gradients from a semantic segmentation model during sampling for instance differentiation. The method outperforms several baselines on two datasets, demonstrating superior quantitative metrics and qualitative results in colorizing multi-level descriptions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed approach yields strong results, showcasing a novel adaptation of Stable Diffusion for language-conditioned colorization.
- Extensive experiments validate the method's effectiveness, with convincing qualitative results and adequate background information provided.

Weaknesses:
- Some novelty claims appear overstated, and simpler baselines lack ablation studies.
- The method's complexity may hinder readability, particularly in sections discussing luminance-guided image compression and the Channel-Extended Convolution.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by:
- Briefly explaining the architecture of the compression encoder and decoder, and detailing how the luminance encoder features condition the compression decoder.
- Ablating the discriminator loss introduced in Section 3.2 and clarifying its role.
- Describing the "semantic-aligned" latent representation more accurately, avoiding overclaims about its novelty.
- Comparing their method against a baseline that concatenates \(y_{lum}\) with \(z_t\) during downsampling.
- Providing more detailed intuitions in Section 3.2 regarding luminance-guided image compression and its role in preserving local structural semantics.
- Reporting quantitative results for the three levels of colorization descriptions and including failure cases in the results section.
- Separating the training and sampling loops in Figure 2 for better clarity and labeling where the loss is applicable.
