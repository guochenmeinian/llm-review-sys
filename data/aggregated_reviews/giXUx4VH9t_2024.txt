Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the impact of test-time adaptation (TTA) on accuracy-on-the-line (ACL) and agreement-on-the-line (AGL), demonstrating that TTA methods significantly enhance these metrics, thereby improving out-of-distribution (OOD) performance estimation. The authors tackle three bottlenecks: performance evaluation without labeled data, distribution shifts, and hyperparameter selection for TTA methods. Extensive experiments validate their findings across various tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. TTA is a crucial topic, and this work provides a relevant and timely contribution.
2. The experiments are extensive, covering various tasks convincingly.
3. The presentation is clear, with well-articulated motivation and experimental details.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty is limited; the work primarily applies findings from Baek et al. (2022) and Miller et al. (2019) to the TTA context.
2. The paper lacks a comprehensive comparison with existing model selection methods under distribution shifts.
3. The theoretical foundation regarding how TTA methods satisfy the conditions in Theorem 1 is insufficiently addressed.
4. The experimental settings are idealized, neglecting scenarios where TTA may fail, such as with small batch sizes or significant distribution shifts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical discussion surrounding the conditions in Theorem 1 to provide a clearer understanding of how TTA methods achieve their results. Additionally, the authors should include a comprehensive comparison with existing model selection methods and explore the practical implications of TTA in more complex tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation. Addressing the limitations of TTA under continuously changing distributions and discussing the computational feasibility of their methods in real-world applications would also enhance the paper's contribution.
