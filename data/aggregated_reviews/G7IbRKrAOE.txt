### Key Points
This paper presents a dataset designed to demonstrate the use of a calculator tool in mathematical reasoning chains, leveraging four existing datasets: GSM8K, Ape-210K, AQuA-RAT, and MathQA. The authors introduce a unified HTML/XML format, termed Calc-X, for encoding these datasets, which facilitates processing with existing libraries. Fine-tuning T5 models on this format results in improved accuracy for arithmetic problems, although no improvement is observed for AQuA-RAT. The authors have made the dataset and model available on Huggingface, along with clear documentation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The unified format for arithmetic tool use is valuable, showing clear improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of language models.  
- The authors provide accessible resources, including the dataset and fine-tuned model, which can facilitate further research.  
- Comprehensive documentation of the data creation process enhances reproducibility.

Weaknesses:  
- The experimental results are not easily reproducible, with some comparisons being nonsensical due to dropped examples during conversion.  
- The novelty of the findings is questionable, as prior works have demonstrated the benefits of calculator use in large language models.  
- The proposed data format conversion strategy may have limited applicability, particularly for datasets with complex arithmetic operations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by providing more detailed information on the parameter settings and ensuring that all examples are accounted for in the comparisons. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the novelty of their contributions in light of existing literature on calculator use in language models. Finally, addressing the limitations of the data format conversion strategy, particularly regarding its applicability to more complex datasets, would strengthen the paper.
