### Key Points
This paper presents FairWISA, a fairness-aware framework for Cognitive Diagnosis (CD) models that operates without relying on sensitive attribute information. The authors propose a fairness objective function, Lfair, to quantify unfairness levels in CD modeling. FairWISA first pre-trains an unfair CD model, groups learners to derive pseudo-labels for sensitive information, and subsequently trains a fair CD model by minimizing a combined loss of cross-entropy loss (Lcd) and Lfair.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant limitation in current fairness-aware CD models that often depend on sensitive data, which may be unavailable.
- The technical details of FairWISA are well-explained, and the theoretical analysis is robust.
- Experimental results indicate significant improvements over existing approaches.

Weaknesses:
- Some sections of the paper could benefit from improved flow, with repetitions noted in Sections 3.3 and 3.4.
- The relationship between observations in Figures 1 and 3 is unclear, as the insights from Figure 3 seem redundant.
- Equation 9 is unnecessary, as Lfair's computation is already clear from Equation 3.
- The abbreviation CD is only defined in the abstract and should be redefined in the main text.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and flow of the paper by addressing the repetitions in Sections 3.3 and 3.4. Additionally, the authors should clarify the distinctions between the insights from Figures 1 and 3 to enhance understanding. It would be beneficial to remove Equation 9, as it does not add new information. Finally, we suggest redefining the abbreviation CD in the main text for better accessibility.
