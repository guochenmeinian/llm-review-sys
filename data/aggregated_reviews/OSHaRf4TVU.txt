Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for training transformer-based policies in multi-task meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) settings, addressing the challenge of imbalanced rewards across tasks without relying on explicit task labels. The authors propose converting actor and critic objectives into classification terms, effectively decoupling optimization from return scales. The effectiveness of this approach is validated through extensive experiments on benchmarks such as Meta-World ML45, Multi-Game Procgen, and Multi-Task POPGym, demonstrating significant improvements in task adaptation and memory issues.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is clearly described and well-motivated, effectively addressing the critical issue of imbalanced training losses in multi-task RL.
- Strong empirical results are presented, showcasing the method's performance across diverse environments.
- The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations and effective use of figures and tables to illustrate results.

Weaknesses:
- The framing of the problem could be improved; the paper does not sufficiently delineate the subproblem it tackles within the broader context of meta-RL.
- There is a lack of theoretical analysis supporting the proposed method, which could enhance its credibility.
- The generalization capabilities of the method are not thoroughly explored, and the paper does not adequately address extreme variations in return scales.
- Comparisons with a broader range of baseline methods are limited, and the technical contribution may be seen as incremental relative to existing literature.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the framing of their problem by clearly stating the limitations regarding non-parametric task generalization early in the paper. Additionally, a more thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed method's advantages over existing approaches would strengthen the paper. We suggest including additional experiments on diverse datasets to assess generalization capabilities more comprehensively. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to compare the proposed method against a wider array of baseline methods to clearly highlight its contributions. Lastly, the authors should ensure that a discussion of limitations is included in the paper, as this is currently lacking.
