### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to non-compositional expression generation, focusing on idioms and metaphors. The authors propose a dynamic curriculum learning framework that organizes task samples by difficulty, addressing the challenges of non-compositionality and limited data. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting, they introduce a continual learning strategy inspired by GEM. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of their method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. This is the first study addressing non-compositional expression generation, which is of interest to the research community.
2. The proposed framework shows improved performance on the task.
3. Extensive experiments are conducted, comparing the proposed method with existing continual learning approaches.

Weaknesses:
1. The method lacks novelty as curriculum learning and continual learning are established techniques; a task-specific approach may be more beneficial.
2. Insufficient implementation details hinder reproducibility, with only minimal information provided in the appendix.
3. The experimental setup relies solely on the BART base model, limiting insights into performance variations with different model sizes or architectures.
4. The task is framed as mask prediction rather than autoregressive generation, which introduces limitations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the implementation detail section to enhance reproducibility and clarity. Additionally, consider providing a more comprehensive evaluation using various model sizes and architectures to assess the robustness of the proposed method. Address the concerns regarding the limitations of framing the task as mask prediction and clarify the implications of catastrophic forgetting in non-compositional expression generation compared to other tasks.
