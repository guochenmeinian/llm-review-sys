Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) into sequential recommendation systems (SRS) to address long-tail challenges. The authors propose a dual-view modeling approach that combines semantic embeddings from LLMs with collaborative signals, alongside a retrieval-augmented self-distillation method to enhance user preference representation. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The integration of LLMs with SRS to tackle long-tail challenges is a novel approach that leverages semantic understanding while maintaining low inference costs.  
2. The dual-view modeling framework effectively combines semantic and collaborative signals, enhancing SRS comprehensively.  
3. The extensive experimental evaluation, including comparisons with multiple baselines and ablation studies, strengthens the validity of the findings.  
4. The methodology is detailed, including mathematical formulations and algorithmic steps, facilitating reproducibility.  

Weaknesses:  
1. There is a risk of overfitting with semantic embeddings, particularly if textual descriptions lack diversity.  
2. The framework's performance may be sensitive to hyper-parameter choices, which are not thoroughly explored.  
3. The proposed methods add complexity to SRS, potentially complicating practical implementation.  
4. The impact on recommendations for popular items is not adequately addressed, and the assumption of user interaction similarity may not hold for diverse user bases.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on mitigating overfitting risks associated with semantic embeddings, especially in scenarios with limited textual data. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on the hyper-parameter tuning process and its impact on performance. Addressing practical implementation challenges and how to manage highly diverse user interactions would enhance the paper's applicability. Finally, we suggest discussing potential negative societal impacts, such as biases introduced by semantic embeddings, to provide a more comprehensive view of the framework's implications.
