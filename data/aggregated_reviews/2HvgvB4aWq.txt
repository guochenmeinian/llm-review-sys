Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to learning task graphs from procedural activities observed in egocentric videos, aiming to enhance intelligent systems' ability to assist users by automatically learning flexible and accurate task graph representations. The authors propose two primary methods: Direct Optimization (DO) and Task Graph Transformer (TGT), which utilize maximum likelihood optimization of edge weights for gradient-based learning. The study demonstrates significant improvements in task graph prediction accuracy and online mistake detection using datasets such as CaptainCook4D, Assembly 101, and EPIC-Tent.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a new error detection approach via learning task graphs, enabling gradient-based task graph learning applicable to mistake detection in programs.
2. The proposed methods achieve superior performance in task graph generation and mistake detection compared to existing methods.
3. Code availability enhances the study's transparency and usability.

Weaknesses:
1. The method relies on action recognition models or Ground-truth Key-Step Labels, which may introduce performance overhead and noise, affecting mistake detection results. More discussion on these issues is needed.
2. The approach requires retraining for each new sequence of actions, limiting versatility and scalability, particularly for order-unrelated mistakes.
3. The paper lacks sufficient qualitative analysis of generated task graphs for mistake detection, with only one qualitative result provided. Discussions on challenging corner cases would benefit the error detection community.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the limitations related to the dependence on labeled key-step sequences and the potential noise introduced by action recognition models. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed qualitative analysis of the generated task graphs, particularly in the context of mistake detection. Addressing these concerns could enhance the paper's impact and clarity.
