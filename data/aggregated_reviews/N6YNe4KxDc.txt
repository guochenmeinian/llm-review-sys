Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies online convex optimization under slowly changing constraints, proposing an algorithm that achieves a $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound. The authors introduce a method called "Constraint Violation Velocity Projection" (CVV-Pro) that constructs a velocity polytope at each time step, leading to a convergence rate of $O(1/\sqrt{T}$) to the feasible set. The paper also discusses applications in two-player zero-sum games with shared resources.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The problem addressed is novel and challenging, particularly regarding limited information and time-varying constraints.  
- The theoretical analyses are well-articulated and may interest the NeurIPS audience.  
- The proposed algorithm does not require prior knowledge of the horizon length $T$ and bounds a new notion of constraint violation.

Weaknesses:  
- The presentation is often unclear, making it difficult to follow key concepts and definitions.  
- Several assumptions lack justification, such as the rationale for allowing constraint violations and the nature of the constraints' time-varying behavior.  
- The experimental results are limited and do not provide a robust comparison with existing methods, particularly with pure gradient descent approaches.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by systematically introducing variables and concepts. It would be beneficial to provide a clearer motivation for the assumptions made, particularly regarding the constraints and their applicability to real-world scenarios. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with simpler baselines, such as adding constraint gradient losses to gradient descent, to better illustrate the advantages of the proposed method. Finally, enhancing the experimental section with more diverse applications and clearer figures would strengthen the paper's impact.
