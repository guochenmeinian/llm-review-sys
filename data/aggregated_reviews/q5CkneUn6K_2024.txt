Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method called context structurization to enhance the cognitive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by organizing input context into a hierarchical structure. The authors propose transforming unordered contextual sentences into a three-layer structure of Scope, Aspects, and Descriptions, which allows LLMs to process complex information more effectively. The effectiveness of this method is validated through evaluations on various NLP tasks, including context-based question-answering and hallucination evaluation, and introduces StruXGPT-7B, a distilled model designed for efficient structurization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study covers a wide range of tasks, providing a comprehensive assessment of the method's effectiveness.
- The development of StruXGPT, a smaller model for structurization, demonstrates practical applicability.
- The paper includes strong evaluations and detailed experiments that show consistent performance gains.

Weaknesses:
- The performance improvements are heavily reliant on the quality of the structurization process, which may lead to suboptimal outcomes if poorly executed.
- The approach lacks novelty, as it does not introduce fundamentally new concepts and resembles methodologies from previous studies.
- The experiments are not sufficiently comprehensive, lacking comparisons with other advanced prompt engineering methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their approach by discussing how it differs from existing methodologies. Additionally, we suggest conducting more experiments with diverse datasets to better understand the limitations of the prompt transformation process. It would also be beneficial to include a parameter-efficiency analysis to clarify the impact of model size on the structurization process. Lastly, we encourage the authors to validate the effectiveness of StruXGPT on state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 to assess its generalizability.
