### Key Points
We recognize that the authors propose an innovative approach by integrating individual and interaction datasets to enhance motion generation control. The paper introduces several novel components, including a diffusion model architecture that generates motions based on both individual and interaction prompts, a technique for guiding generation via multiple CFG, and a motion composition technique called DualMDM. While the quantitative and qualitative results show significant improvements over current methods, the paper lacks comprehensive explanations regarding the workings of these innovations and their impact on the results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of individual and interaction datasets represents a significant advancement in motion generation.
- The novel diffusion model architecture allows for greater diversity in character behavior.
- The quantitative and qualitative results outperform current state-of-the-art methods.

Weaknesses:
- The articulation of the paper fluctuates between clarity and ambiguity, particularly in methodological explanations.
- Certain equations appear to lack coherent integration, leading to confusion.
- The experimental results do not adequately address the anticipated improvements from additional data sources.
- Missing details regarding model architecture and inference latency raise concerns about resource requirements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We suggest improving the clarity of the methodological framework, particularly the relationship between equation (1) and equation (3). Further experiments should be conducted to clarify the implications of the identical figures in Tables 1 and 2. We recommend addressing the discrepancies in expected results with additional data and refining the logical flow in the manuscript, especially in the section spanning lines 342 to 369. Additionally, we urge the authors to provide a detailed explanation of the information flow between the two models during generation and to quantify the contribution of DualMDM in Table 1. Finally, we recommend making the new dataset publicly available and specifying the limitations regarding the decomposition of textual descriptions during training.
