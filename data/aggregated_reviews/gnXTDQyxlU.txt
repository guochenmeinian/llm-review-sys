Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents PIVOT-R, a primitive-driven waypoint-aware model for robotic manipulation tasks, designed to handle complex language-instructed commands through a hierarchical approach. The model decomposes language instructions into sub-steps using a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and predicts corresponding waypoints through image prediction. It disentangles the dependency between language and actions, enhancing action prediction through cross-trajectory waypoint transition knowledge. An Asynchronous Hierarchical Executor (AHE) is introduced to improve execution efficiency by applying varying execution frequencies to different modules. The authors conduct comparative experiments on the SeaWave benchmark, analyzing the model's generalization ability in unseen scenarios and its learning capability from human videos. They argue that evaluating generalization should focus on absolute performance rather than percentage drops, as demonstrated by PIVOT-R's superior performance in unseen scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The figures and tables are clear and well-organized, facilitating understanding.
- The experimental section reproduces several renowned studies and tests them on a new benchmark, providing a thorough evaluation.
- The hierarchical approach effectively improves action prediction accuracy by decoupling language-action interdependencies.
- Automatic waypoint generation enhances the model's efficiency and fairness in experimental comparisons.
- The authors provide a thorough discussion of related works, highlighting PIVOT-R's unique contributions to modeling physical world dynamics.

Weaknesses:
- The introduction contains misleading information regarding the model's relation to a "world model," with limited novelty in the proposed methods.
- The initial use of the term "world model" may understate the complexity of the contributions.
- The experimental results are not convincing, as the method has only been verified on a limited benchmark and relies on additional annotations that may not be utilized in baseline comparisons.
- The paper lacks clarity in articulating the specific problem addressed and the contributions made, particularly in distinguishing itself from prior work.
- Some sections of the manuscript may benefit from clearer definitions and more concise descriptions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction by succinctly defining the problem and motivation for waypoint prediction. Additionally, a more explicit delineation of the contributions of this paper is necessary, particularly regarding the term "world model." We suggest conducting experiments on more well-known benchmarks to better contextualize performance improvements. The authors should provide a detailed discussion of the relationship between their method and prior works, particularly those involving waypoints and action primitives. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the definition of execution frequency and the implications of the AHE, while downplaying its emphasis as a key contribution. Enhancing the clarity of Sections 4.5 and 4.6, particularly in the definitions and discussions, would strengthen the paper. We also suggest incorporating clearer definitions of terms and more concise, formulaic descriptions, particularly in Section 4.6.1, and discussing advanced tokenization techniques like Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) to enhance understanding of their approach. Lastly, we advise reducing the emphasis on the Asynchronous Hierarchical Executor while providing more implementation details in the experimental settings.
