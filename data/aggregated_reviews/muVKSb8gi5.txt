Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for off-policy learning of continuous dosage combinations in personalized medical decision-making, utilizing a causal inference framework. The authors propose a dosage combination network (DCNet) that employs a tensor product basis to estimate smooth interaction effects in the dose-response surface, incorporating all dosages simultaneously. The method is structured in three stages: learning the dose-response function, identifying the logging policy, and optimizing a reliable policy through constrained optimization. The approach addresses the challenge of limited overlap in treatment data and is evaluated on real healthcare datasets, demonstrating reduced regret and improved stability compared to ablated versions. The authors clarify that their training objective differentiates between dosage combinations and incorporates all dosages to capture interactions effectively. They provide evidence of DCNet's superiority over VCNet through ablation studies and performance metrics, including the standard deviation of the mean inner squared error (SD-ISE), demonstrating its ability to model subtle effects and interactions. The authors also plan to include a complexity analysis and additional experiments in the revised paper.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel method for off-policy learning tailored to continuous dosage combinations.
- It presents a well-structured approach to constrained policy optimization, effectively addressing drug-drug interactions.
- The authors effectively differentiate dosage combinations in their training objective, enhancing the model's ability to capture drug-drug interactions.
- Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate DCNet's superiority over VCNet, particularly in modeling subtle effects and interactions.
- The paper is technically sound and offers practical value in personalized medicine.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental dosage dimensionality is limited to 2 or 3, raising concerns about generalizability to higher dimensions or multi-disease treatments.
- The individualized weights in DCNet are trained unsupervised, lacking differentiation between dosages in the training objective.
- The method does not account for the ignorability assumption, which may lead to biased estimates in the presence of unobserved confounders.
- The application is limited to static treatment settings, potentially overlooking the complexities of time-series data in clinical applications.
- Figures contain illegible fonts, hindering clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their results by testing on higher-dimensional dosage combinations and treatments for various diseases. Additionally, we suggest incorporating a supervised training objective that reflects individual dosages in DCNet. To enhance clarity, please address the font legibility in figures. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide a detailed discussion on the implications of assuming independent dosage dimensions and to clarify the potential limitations of the proposed method in real-world applications. We also recommend improving the clarity of their writing, particularly regarding the differentiation of dosage combinations in the training objective. Additionally, we suggest incorporating a comparison of treatment combinations between discrete and continuous treatments in the revised paper. To enhance the robustness of their findings, the authors should consider extending their method to handle additional sources of bias and more complex data settings. Lastly, we advise simplifying the presentation of standard deviation metrics in Table 3 to improve clarity for readers.
