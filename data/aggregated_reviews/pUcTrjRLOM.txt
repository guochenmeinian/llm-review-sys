### Key Points
This paper presents the UltraMedical collections, a comprehensive dataset suite designed to enhance fine-tuning in the biomedicine domain. The authors propose a combination of manually curated and synthetic datasets with preference annotations, addressing the scarcity of medical domain-specific data. They demonstrate impressive performance across various medical benchmarks by fine-tuning specialized medical models based on the Llama-3 series, indicating that open-source models can achieve results comparable to proprietary models like GPT-4 and MedPaLM. The paper includes thorough ablation studies and case studies, providing insights into the method's performance and applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The UltraMedical collections represent a valuable contribution to the biomedical AI field, effectively addressing the need for specialized datasets.  
- The methodology is rigorous, combining manual and synthetic data to enhance model training, leading to competitive performance with proprietary models.  
- The development of a medical reward model and iterative preference learning strengthens the contributions of the paper.  
- The authors provide a detailed account of dataset construction, model training procedures, and evaluation processes, promoting transparency and reproducibility.  

Weaknesses:  
- The comparison appears biased in favor of the proposed method, utilizing numerous task-specific labels while many baselines rely on few-shot or zero demonstrations.  
- The rationale for selecting the backbone model is not discussed, raising questions about the potential benefits of using a biomedical pretrained model.  
- The curation process of the reward benchmark lacks detail, particularly regarding the level of agreement among labelers and the quality assurance of evaluation data.  
- The cost associated with creating the benchmark is not mentioned.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the selection of the backbone model and consider exploring the use of a biomedical pretrained model for potentially better results. Additionally, we suggest elaborating on the human annotation process, including the number of annotators and their expertise in the biomedical field, to enhance the reliability of the results. Including more visual aids or diagrams to illustrate complex processes like iterative preference learning could also improve clarity. Finally, addressing the cost of creating the benchmark would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the project's scope.
