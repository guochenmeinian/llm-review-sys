Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new thresholding methodology for Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) called InstanT, which utilizes instance-dependent thresholds for assigning pseudo-labels to unlabeled data. The authors propose that this approach improves the quality of pseudo-labels by adjusting thresholds based on instance-level ambiguity and error rates. The paper includes extensive experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of InstanT across multiple semi-supervised benchmark datasets, showing significant improvements in accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, well-motivated, and easy to follow.
- It addresses a significant problem in SSL by proposing a dynamic and adaptive thresholding method.
- The theoretical analysis supports the proposed method, providing a probabilistic guarantee for pseudo-label correctness.
- Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of InstanT, particularly in low-labeled data scenarios.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation is limited to small datasets (CIFAR10/CIFAR100/STL-10), raising concerns about robustness on larger datasets like ImageNet.
- The theoretical foundations, particularly Theorem 2 and Assumption 2, may contain inaccuracies that undermine the paper's credibility.
- There is insufficient discussion on the limitations of the proposed method and its performance in the presence of class imbalance.
- Comparisons with recent state-of-the-art methods are lacking, and the paper does not report results on fully labeled datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis, particularly regarding Theorem 2 and Assumption 2, to ensure the validity of their claims. Additionally, the authors should expand their experimental evaluation to include larger datasets such as ImageNet and provide a comprehensive discussion of the limitations and potential drawbacks of their method. It would also be beneficial to include comparisons with recent state-of-the-art methods and to clarify the relationship between the Quality-Quantity Trade-off and the effective dynamic value in their proposed method.
