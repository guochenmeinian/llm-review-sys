### Key Points
This paper proposes a framework that identifies which T2I generator created a particular image and investigates key hyperparameters used during the inference stage. By leveraging both high-frequency and mid-level image representations, the proposed model achieves high accuracy in distinguishing images generated by 12 different diffusion models. The exploration beyond RGB enhances attribution performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, offering a holistic view of how different visual traces can be leveraged for attribution. The exploration beyond RGB provides new perspectives on distinguishing synthetic from real images.  
2. The investigation into hyperparameter variations yields valuable insights.

Weaknesses:  
1. The introduction could be improved by systematically comparing existing attribution techniques, particularly for diffusion models, and explicitly discussing how this paperâ€™s contributions surpass previous GAN-based image attribution studies.  
2. The contribution is not clearly presented, particularly in Section 3, where the detection of the original attribute in RGB is unclear.  
3. The rationale behind the choice of hyperparameters is not thoroughly explained, and Table 2 lacks detailed analysis of results, such as the near 100% accuracy achieved with seed variation.  
4. The study's practical impact is limited, as it does not fully address more complex real-world transformations like style transfer or aggressive upscaling.  
5. There are formatting issues with references, particularly references 6-8, which lack publication details, and incorrect formatting of quotation marks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by systematically comparing existing attribution techniques and clarifying how their contributions exceed those of previous studies. Additionally, the authors should provide a clearer explanation of the detection process in Section 3 and elaborate on the rationale behind hyperparameter choices. A detailed analysis of the results in Table 2 is necessary, particularly regarding the accuracy of seed variation. We also suggest addressing the limitations of the study by considering more complex real-world transformations. Finally, the authors should correct the formatting issues in the references and ensure proper quotation mark usage throughout the paper.
