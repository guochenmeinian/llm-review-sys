### Key Points
This paper presents a study on generative domain adaptation (GDA) using the StyleGAN2 architecture, introducing a method called DoRM (Domain-Adaptive Mapping and Affine Modules). The authors claim to explore memory and domain association, proposing that DoRM can integrate multiple learned domains and synthesize hybrid domains. The method involves learning new mapping networks and affine transformations for each domain, generating hybrid domains by interpolating style codes. The paper also introduces a consistency loss based on CLIP image features to maintain domain-sharing attributes. DoRM excels in producing high-quality, diverse, and consistent cross-domain images while encompassing all five desired properties of GDA. The authors meticulously evaluate the quantitative experiments within the Domain Expansion framework using a cosine similarity metric termed "domain similarity" based on the CLIP image encoder, illustrating DoRM's remarkable performance in both single-domain and hybrid-domain generation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper is clearly written and presents its concepts in an understandable manner.  
2. The tasks addressed are relevant, and the proposed method is intuitive and novel, showing effectiveness in domain adaptation.  
3. The exploration of domain association is innovative and represents an exciting avenue for further research.  
4. DoRM's innovative architecture effectively addresses few-shot generative domain adaptation.  
5. The integration of memory and domain association capabilities is relatively unexplored and adds significant value.  
6. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the proposed method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.  
7. The quantitative evaluation using cosine similarity provides a robust assessment of hybrid domains.

Weaknesses:  
1. The claimed contributions are incorrect, as they overlook significant prior works like HyperDomainNet, DynaGAN, and Domain Expansion, which cover similar aspects of domain adaptation.  
2. The evaluation is lacking, with no comparisons made to these relevant methods, undermining the paper's claims.  
3. The comparison with HyperDomainNet is complicated due to distinct latent spaces and the lack of inversion code.  
4. Achieving high-quality sketches with 10-shot training images remains challenging, indicating potential trade-offs in the Domain Expansion framework.  
5. The authors acknowledge that integrating CDC into the expansion framework presents considerable challenges and may not yield significant improvements.  
6. The paper does not adequately address potential issues of unrealistic results due to domain association.  
7. The proposed method's generalization is limited to the StyleGAN2 architecture, restricting its applicability to other architectures.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related works, particularly addressing the similarities and differences with HyperDomainNet, DynaGAN, and Domain Expansion. A thorough comparative analysis should be included to clarify the novelty of the proposed method. Additionally, we urge the authors to conduct experiments comparing DoRM with these relevant methods, as well as to explore the potential issues of unrealistic results due to domain association. Expanding the list of baselines in Table 1 to include additional approaches such as MineGAN and EWC would also strengthen the evaluation. We suggest that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology used for generating results in Figure 6, particularly regarding the application of CLIP and its implications for comparison. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to consider implementing CDC within the expansion framework, despite the coding challenges, to provide a more comprehensive baseline for comparison. Lastly, we suggest ensuring that qualitative evaluations are included alongside quantitative results to enhance the overall assessment of hybrid-domain generation.
