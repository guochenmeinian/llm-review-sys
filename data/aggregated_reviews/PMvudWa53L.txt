Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates adaptive experimental design with a focus on fairness, defined as ensuring treatment assignment probabilities do not significantly differ across groups. The authors propose a fair adaptive experimental design that enhances data efficiency, guarantees “envy-free” treatment assignment, and improves participant welfare. The manuscript includes theoretical analyses validating the method's asymptotic consistency and empirical studies demonstrating its competitive statistical efficiency while upholding fairness. Furthermore, the authors clarify that their goal is not to create a complex optimization algorithm, as randomized field experiments are costly and practitioners prefer transparent procedures. They assert that the "no unmeasured confounders" assumption holds by construction in randomized experiments, making explicit proof unnecessary.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The investigation of fairness in adaptive experimental design is timely and relevant.
- The proposed method emphasizes fairness and welfare concerns.
- The technical sections (Sections 2 and 3) are well-organized and clearly presented.
- The approach avoids complex numerical optimization, enhancing transparency.
- The authors provide both simulation studies and a case study based on real data, demonstrating the proposed method's effectiveness.
- The authors provide a solid statistical foundation for their design.

Weaknesses:
- The definition of fairness may not be convincing in clinical trials, where treatment effects can vary significantly across groups. Motivating examples in the introduction would enhance clarity.
- The relevance of welfare to fairness is unclear; further elaboration on the implications of removing the welfare constraint in Problem A is needed.
- Concerns about the feasibility of Problems A and B arise, particularly under specific parameter conditions. Clarification on whether infeasibility was encountered in simulations is warranted.
- The selection of the first stage length ($n_1$) requires more discussion, including its influence on results and supporting evidence for claims made about the methodology.
- The terminology "consistency of the proposed randomized experimental design" is not standard in the literature, leading to potential misunderstandings.
- The claim that the optimization problem lacks notable technical challenges may misrepresent the complexity of the design.
- The trade-offs among improving fairness, enhancing welfare, and gaining efficiency need clearer articulation to deepen understanding of the proposed strategy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the definition of fairness by providing motivating examples relevant to clinical trials in the introduction. Additionally, further elaboration on the relationship between welfare and fairness, particularly regarding the implications of removing the welfare constraint in Problem A, would clarify this aspect. The authors should address the feasibility concerns of Problems A and B, especially under specific parameter conditions, and clarify whether these issues were encountered in their studies. More detailed comments on selecting $n_1$ and its impact on results would enhance understanding. We also suggest that the authors clarify the terminology used in the paper, particularly regarding "consistency of the proposed randomized experimental design," to align with standard literature. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide insights into the trade-offs among the objectives of fairness, welfare, and efficiency to strengthen the paper's argument.
