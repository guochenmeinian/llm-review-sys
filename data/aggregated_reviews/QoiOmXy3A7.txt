### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into class-level grounding for neural image captioning, focusing on the interaction between a generator (GEN) for class description generation and an interpreter (IPT) for class predictions. The authors highlight discrepancies between traditional NLG metrics and zero-shot results, raising concerns about grounding class-level information. The study proposes a new discriminativity metric and analyzes the impact of different sampling strategies on classification performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The topic is highly relevant and addresses an understudied problem in vision-language research.
- The manuscript is generally clear and engaging, with well-discussed results and insightful limitations.
- The proposed evaluation setup allows for a fine-grained analysis of class description generation and interpretation.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental section is limited, lacking sufficient evidence to support the main claims.
- The paper is difficult to read in parts, particularly the methods and evaluation sections, which could benefit from clearer organization.
- There is a lack of comparison with prior zero-shot learning works and insufficient evaluation of alternative baselines.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methods and evaluation sections by providing a higher-level overview of the model before delving into specifics. Additionally, consider including more experimental evidence, such as testing on additional datasets and implementing ablation studies to demonstrate the importance of various components. We also suggest comparing the proposed method with established zero-shot models like CLIP and using more recent pre-trained models for better baseline comparisons. Lastly, clarifying the paper's contributions in relation to existing tasks in the introduction would enhance understanding.
