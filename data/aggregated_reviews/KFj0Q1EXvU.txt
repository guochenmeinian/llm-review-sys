Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a hybrid model-free and model-based policy improvement method, termed h-GPI, aimed at zero-shot policy generalization using successor features. The authors derive a multi-step extension of the generalized policy improvement (GPI) framework, allowing agents to leverage approximate models for action selection while providing theoretical bounds on improvement related to model approximation error. The experimental results demonstrate consistent enhancements over standard GPI across various reinforcement learning benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively extends the GPI framework to utilize approximate models, facilitating long-horizon planning in action selection.
- The authors provide a theoretical bound on the improvement of their method concerning model approximation error.
- A comprehensive experimental section showcases consistent improvements over standard GPI across multiple benchmarks.

Weaknesses:
- The practical application of the method is unclear, particularly regarding how to estimate model error when adapting to new tasks. The significance of the h-step parameter in this context is not well-defined.
- Some theoretical claims, such as the relationship between planning horizon and error relevance, require clarification.
- The paper lacks a thorough comparative analysis with other model-based or model-free solutions under similar learning environments, and the motivation for the proposed method's efficiency is insufficiently justified.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the practical application of their method, specifically addressing how to estimate model error when adapting to new tasks. Additionally, we suggest revising the theoretical claims regarding the planning horizon to clarify the relationship between increasing h and error relevance. It would also be beneficial to include a more detailed comparative analysis with other methods and to strengthen the justification for the efficiency of the proposed approach. Finally, expanding the limitations section to provide a more comprehensive discussion would enhance the overall presentation.
