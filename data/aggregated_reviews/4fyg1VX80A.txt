### Key Points
This paper presents scBiGNN, a cell typing method that infers single-cell transcriptomic embeddings using a gene-level GNN, constructing a graph of all cells for robust cell-type classification. The authors propose that leveraging both cell-cell and gene-gene relationships enhances accuracy by allowing these elements to reinforce each other. The manuscript emphasizes the biological significance of complementary training in both Cell-level GNN and Gene-level GNN.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is elegantly formulated, improving representation robustness by including a contextual neighborhood of cells with similar latent states, as justified by Figure 1.
- Strong performance is indicated through comparisons on several canonical datasets.
- Results are presented clearly, and the manuscript is well written.

Weaknesses:
- The baselines are not comprehensive, with significant omissions of state-of-the-art methods such as Seurat, scVI, SciBet, CellID, scGPT, and scBERT, which may exceed the reported results for scBiGNN.
- The necessity of transforming scalar gene expression values into a d-dimensional embedding is questioned.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comprehensiveness of baseline comparisons by including state-of-the-art methods that are currently omitted. Additionally, conducting more rigorous ablation studies to investigate the effects of using only cell-level or gene-level graphs would substantiate the advantages of the proposed dual perspective.
