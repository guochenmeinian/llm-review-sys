### Key Points
This paper presents a method called PsyCoT, which utilizes chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to enhance personality detection capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through item-based psychological questionnaires. The authors aim to predict an author's personality traits based on text using a multi-turn dialogue format, leveraging established psychological frameworks like MBTI and Big 5. The paper evaluates the effectiveness of this approach against traditional single-turn prompting and conducts a formative evaluation comparing various methodologies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a reproducible and interesting approach to predicting personality traits from text.
- It validates the method through a feasible evaluation, including an ablation study that demonstrates the effectiveness of the multi-turn approach.
- The methodology is clear and provides insights into the correlation between personality traits and LLM behavior.

Weaknesses:
- The results section lacks completeness, as it does not present the best-performing approaches for the Essays dataset.
- There is insufficient discussion of limitations, particularly regarding language applicability and dataset characteristics.
- The paper does not adequately contextualize its results against existing models, missing critical comparisons and statistical significance tests.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the results section by including the performance of TrigNet and DDGCN for the Essays dataset. Additionally, a more thorough discussion of limitations, including the application to a single language and the nature of the datasets, should be included. The authors should also provide more detailed descriptions of the datasets, such as the mean length of texts. Furthermore, we suggest incorporating comparisons with other strong models like those by Park et al. and Lynn et al., and conducting statistical significance tests between the proposed method and baseline models. Lastly, addressing the framing of the task as CoT reasoning and clarifying the dimensionality of the Big 5 traits would enhance the paper's clarity and rigor.
