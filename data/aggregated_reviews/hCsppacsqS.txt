Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new benchmark dataset for multimodal classification based on game data, incorporating tabular, textual, and visual modalities from four different video games across eight classification tasks. The authors propose a novel multimodal classification approach, MugNet, which utilizes graph neural networks (GNNs) to model sample similarity in multimodal data. The paper includes comprehensive analyses and benchmarks various unimodal and multimodal models, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of a valuable new dataset for multimodal classification, with a commitment to public availability.
2. The uniqueness of a multimodal dataset derived from video games enhances its significance for the research community.
3. The innovative approach using within-modality GNNs to model sample similarity and aggregate modality-specific representations.
4. Comprehensive analyses illustrating the necessity of all modalities for task completion.
5. Benchmarking against established models, facilitating thorough evaluations of multimodal classification performance.
6. Experimental results provide insights for guiding future research.

Weaknesses:
1. The dataset lacks clear motivation, and critical details for understanding the datasets and tasks are missing.
2. The proposed approach is evaluated only on the new dataset, leaving its effectiveness on existing tasks and baselines unclear.
3. Some tasks can be nearly perfectly solved by benchmarked models, reducing their challenge and value.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and motivation of the dataset by providing additional details about the tasks and target classes, including qualitative examples. It would be beneficial to discuss the significance of a game-based dataset compared to others, such as those derived from Wikipedia. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors evaluate the proposed approach against existing benchmark datasets to demonstrate its generalizability. Additionally, we encourage the authors to clarify the rationale behind grouping classes with small representations and consider the implications of this choice. Lastly, please address the identified typos and ensure that critical details are included in the main paper rather than relegated to the appendix.
