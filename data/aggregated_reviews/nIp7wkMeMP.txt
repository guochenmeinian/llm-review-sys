### Key Points
This paper presents a method for few-shot fine-grained entity typing by leveraging coarse-grained datasets to enhance performance. The authors propose a framework that explicitly models coarse-to-fine relations, integrating training on both coarse- and fine-grained data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, providing insights into the coarse-to-fine correlations and inconsistency filtering.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively utilizes coarse-grained labeled data to assist fine-grained typing, achieving strong performance compared to baseline methods.
- The methodology is well-designed, addressing the low-resource problem in fine-grained NER through a mapping matrix and filtering of inconsistent labels.
- The writing is clear, and the figures and tables are easy to understand.

Weaknesses:
- The hierarchical structure between coarse- and fine-grained types is not well-described, appearing as a direct mapping rather than a true hierarchy.
- There are questions regarding the evaluation methods and the rationale behind the loss back-propagation strategy, which may hinder model learning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the description of the hierarchical structure to clarify its nature. Additionally, addressing the questions regarding the evaluation process and the rationale for only back-propagating loss for consistent labels would strengthen the paper. Providing details on the specific settings used in Few NERD and clarifying the types omitted from OntoNotes would enhance transparency. Finally, making the code available could significantly benefit the research community.
