Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Latent Prompt Transformer (LPT), a novel transformer model for conditional molecule sequence design and generation. LPT generates latent vectors from a learnable prior distribution and autoregressively produces molecule sequences based on these vectors. The authors demonstrate that LPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks in molecule, protein, and DNA design. The methodology includes a three-step approach: learning a prior distribution, generating molecules, and predicting properties.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed LPT model and framework effectively address property-conditioned generation of molecule sequences.
- Comprehensive and convincing experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets.
- The paper is well-organized, clear, and presents high-quality figures and tables.

Weaknesses:
- The validity rate of generated SMILES strings is not reported, despite the inherent grammar constraints of SMILES.
- The dimension/size of the latent vectors is not discussed, and its impact on performance is unclear; an ablation study is suggested.
- The motivation for using Langevin dynamics over a VAE framework is not adequately justified.
- The lack of reconstruction loss raises concerns about the dependence between molecules and properties.
- Clarity issues exist, particularly regarding the training and optimization process, and some formulas lack derivations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by adding illustrations or diagrams of the training and optimization process. Additionally, please report the validity rate of the generated SMILES strings and conduct an ablation study to discuss the impact of latent vector dimensions on performance. It would also be beneficial to clarify the motivation for using Langevin dynamics instead of a VAE framework and to address the potential impact of MCMC sampling on model practicality. Finally, we suggest measuring the chemical diversity of generated molecules and reporting QED and SA scores across all generated candidates to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
