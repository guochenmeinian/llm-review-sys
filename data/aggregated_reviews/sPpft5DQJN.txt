### Key Points
This paper presents a method for projecting text representations from a deep language model into a "concept" space to enhance interpretability. The authors evaluate their approach using Wikipedia categories, tailoring the concept space based on the required granularity, and assess its effectiveness across seven datasets through both human and automatic evaluations. The proposed algorithm aims to make embedding spaces more comprehensible, addressing issues like debugging and bias detection in language models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The method is simple yet effective and well-motivated, contributing significantly to the understanding of embedding spaces.  
- The evaluation is comprehensive, utilizing both human and LLM judgments, and the adaptability of the concept space to various applications is a notable advantage.  
- The paper is well-structured and written, with a strong focus on interpretability.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks comparisons with existing methods, particularly those mentioned in the related work section.  
- The evaluation results, especially regarding classification performance, are not entirely convincing, with noticeable drops in accuracy when using transformed representations.  
- The representations are not contextualized, and the impact of chosen concepts on performance requires further analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with competitive approaches, particularly supervised topic modeling, to clarify their method's advantages. Additionally, the authors should conduct a thorough analysis of the impact of concept selection on performance and address the limitations of using random forest classifiers for evaluation. Clarifying the method's nuances, particularly regarding the contextualization of concept representations and the granularity of the concept space, would enhance the paper's clarity. Lastly, we suggest expanding the automated evaluation to include more documents to strengthen the findings.
