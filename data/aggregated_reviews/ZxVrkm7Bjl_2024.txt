Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel application of the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture within Universal Transformers (UT) to address the inefficiency in parameter-computation ratios. The authors propose the MoEUT model, which integrates MoE in both attention and feed-forward layers, along with innovations such as layer grouping and a new layer normalization scheme termed "peri-layernorm." The results indicate that MoEUT achieves competitive performance in language modeling tasks while incurring lower compute and memory costs compared to standard dense transformers.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of MoE into a shared-layer Transformer network shows potential for improved performance.
- The paper provides sound explanations for the design choices of layer grouping and peri-layernorm, supported by relevant literature.
- Comprehensive evaluation and analysis of the proposed model, including zero-shot downstream task evaluation.

Weaknesses:
- The relationship between the MoE architecture, layer grouping, and peri-layernorm is not clearly defined, which could hinder understanding of their combined impact.
- Claims regarding the instability of the σ-MoE model during training lack empirical support.
- The ablation study does not sufficiently demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed enhancements, necessitating broader comparative analyses.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the synergy between the MoE architecture, layer grouping, and peri-layernorm to enhance understanding of their collective impact on performance. Additionally, we suggest providing empirical evidence to substantiate claims of training instability in the σ-MoE model. Expanding the ablation study to include a wider range of experiments and comparative analyses would also strengthen the evaluation of the proposed method. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to explore the performance of MoEUT without peri-layernorm and vice versa to better understand their individual contributions.
