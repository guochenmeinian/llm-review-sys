Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on adaptive Neyman allocation, proposing an algorithm that achieves expected Neyman regret $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$. The authors define new performance measures, namely Neyman ratio and Neyman regret, and introduce the Clip-OGD algorithm, which provides asymptotically valid confidence intervals for experiments. The work emphasizes the importance of adaptive experimental design, particularly in minimizing variance while maintaining feasibility.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The writing and analyses are rigorous and precise, making the paper well-organized and clear.
- The proposed metrics, Neyman ratio and Neyman regret, are well-motivated and convincingly presented.
- Clip-OGD is intuitive and does not require hyper-parameter tuning, which is advantageous for online algorithms.

Weaknesses:
- The distinction between existing results and new contributions is unclear, particularly before the algorithm is introduced.
- Assumption 1 lacks clarity regarding its motivation and potential scenarios where it may not hold.
- The paper could benefit from additional simulations and a broader empirical evaluation, including comparisons with existing adaptive designs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the distinction between existing and new results, particularly in the introductory sections. Additionally, we suggest elaborating on Assumption 1 to clarify its motivation and potential limitations. Consider combining CLIP-OGD with an outcome model to achieve a doubly-robust estimator. We also encourage the authors to include more simulations and comparisons with multi-armed bandit baselines to strengthen empirical evaluations. Lastly, a broader discussion on the motivation for focusing on medical applications would enhance the paper's relevance.
