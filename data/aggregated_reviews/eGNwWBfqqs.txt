### Key Points
This paper presents an improved speech-text translation system through a framework called Content-Centric Speech Representation Disentanglement (CCSRD). The authors propose a method to disentangle linguistic content from non-linguistic factors, achieving an average improvement of +0.9 BLEU across five translation directions. The framework does not require transcription data, making it applicable in scenarios lacking such data. However, the focus remains solely on speech-to-text translation, leaving the non-content representation untested during inference.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed framework achieves superior performance compared to baselines, verified through ablation studies.  
- The method effectively disentangles linguistic content from non-linguistic speech factors, enhancing translation quality.  
- The approach is applicable in transcription-less scenarios, broadening its potential use cases.  

Weaknesses:  
- There is a lack of detailed analysis regarding the disentanglement module and its impact on translation quality.  
- Comparisons with other disentanglement methods are absent, limiting the demonstration of the module's effectiveness.  
- The non-content representation is not utilized during inference, rendering the work somewhat incomplete.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the disentanglement module to clarify its effects on speech translation quality. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with other disentanglement methods to strengthen the claims regarding the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore the application of the non-content representation during inference, as this could enhance the completeness of the work. Lastly, please clarify the meaning of "MTL" in the paper and provide a more comprehensive analysis of the noise sources in the experiments, incorporating various types of noise.
