Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to the object goal navigation problem through T-Diff, a trajectory diffusion model that enhances waypoint prediction and path planning by integrating historical trajectories and semantic maps. The authors argue that T-Diff improves upon existing end-to-end methods and modular approaches by exhibiting greater temporal consistency and reducing redundant exploration. They validate their model through an ablation study and provide statistical analyses demonstrating that T-Diff outperforms previous single-step decision-making algorithms, showing significant performance improvements across multiple benchmarks, including the Gibson and MP3D datasets. The authors also clarify differences in waypoint prediction accuracy between T-Diff and other modular methods, noting that end-to-end methods exhibit more frequent goal switching.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, clearly articulating its contributions and situating itself within relevant literature.
- The use of diffusion models to enhance temporal consistency in navigation is innovative and addresses a common issue in existing methods.
- T-Diff effectively integrates gradual goal learning and temporal consistency, improving waypoint prediction and path planning reliability.
- Extensive empirical studies show strong performance and generalizability across domains, supported by comprehensive statistical analyses and comparisons with existing methods.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the proposed method is limited, as similar approaches using diffusion models have been previously documented.
- The manuscript suffers from poor quality, including multiple typos and grammatical errors that detract from readability.
- The necessity of using diffusion models for waypoint prediction is not convincingly justified, and comparisons with simpler models are lacking.
- Some reviewers express skepticism regarding the necessity of the diffusion model and question whether similar performance could be achieved with modular methods predicting multiple gradual goals.
- The motivation for using T-Diff, particularly the claim that implicit memory leads to redundant exploration, lacks sufficient evidence and clarity.
- Experiments are conducted solely in simulation, with no real-world validation, limiting practical applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for using diffusion models by providing comparisons with simpler models, such as standard decoders for waypoint prediction. Additionally, addressing the manuscript's quality by correcting typos and grammatical errors is essential for enhancing readability. We suggest conducting real-world experiments to validate the proposed approach's practicality and exploring performance with minimal trajectory lengths to provide insights into the importance of multi-step planning. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the motivation behind their method by providing more concrete evidence supporting the claim that implicit memory leads to redundant exploration. Lastly, addressing the necessity of the diffusion model more thoroughly, perhaps through further ablation studies, would strengthen the argument for T-Diff's design and clarify the comparative advantages of T-Diff over modular methods.
