Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Equivariant Neural Diffusion (END), a novel diffusion model for 3D molecule generation that incorporates a learnable forward process based on neural flow diffusion models. The authors claim that this approach allows for better adaptation to the underlying data distribution, enhancing the model's ability to generate complex molecular structures. Experimental results indicate that END achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets, including QM9 and GEOM-DRUGS, for both conditional and unconditional generation tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The incorporation of a learnable forward diffusion process enhances flexibility and adaptability in 3D molecule generation.
- The model demonstrates improved performance in generating stable and unique molecules, particularly on the GEOM-DRUGS dataset.
- The paper is generally well-organized and presents a clear exposition of the methodology.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the END method is limited, primarily combining existing techniques from EDM and neural flow diffusion models without a thorough analysis of the advantages of the learnable forward process.
- Performance inconsistencies are noted, with traditional models sometimes outperforming END in metrics such as validity and uniqueness.
- The paper lacks comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the contributions of its components, and important baselines like GeoBFN are missing from comparisons.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion and analysis of the learnable forward diffusion process, explicitly detailing its benefits for 3D molecule generation. Additionally, the authors should include comparisons with advanced baselines, such as GeoBFN, to strengthen their claims of performance advantages. A more thorough ablation study should be conducted to evaluate the utility of the model's components across different scenarios. Finally, providing training times for the benchmarked methods would offer valuable insights into the model's efficiency and resource requirements.
