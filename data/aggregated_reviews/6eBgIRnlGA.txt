### Key Points
This paper presents a method to address temporal misalignment in question answering (QA) systems by proposing a "fact duration prediction" task. The authors demonstrate that models can predict the lifespan of facts, which can then be utilized to improve the calibration of QA models when handling temporally-sensitive queries. By assessing the temporal validity of facts, the proposed approach allows for adjustments in model confidence and the selection between closed-book and open-book QA strategies. The results indicate that this method effectively enhances model calibration.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem of temporal misalignment is highly relevant and the proposed task is well-defined and feasible.
- The submission is well-written and easy to understand, with solid proof-of-concept experiments.
- The exploration of temporal degradation in relation to QA model calibration is commendable, and the proposed solution enhances the robustness of QA systems.

Weaknesses:
- The scope of the problem is somewhat limited, as LLMs may already abstain from answers with potential temporal misalignment.
- Experiments could benefit from including more models to strengthen the case for the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve Table 5 by including scores for systems without adaptive inference to enhance clarity. Additionally, it would be beneficial to explore whether LLMs have resolved the calibration issue or are merely abstaining from answers. We also suggest clarifying the relationship between the fact duration prediction task and mathematical reasoning, potentially including results with math QA models. Lastly, addressing the clarity of certain tables and ensuring all necessary information is present would enhance the overall presentation.
