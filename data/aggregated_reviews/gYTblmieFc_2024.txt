### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to relative representations (RR) using Riemannian geodesic distances, which is proposed as a more natural metric than cosine similarity. The authors demonstrate that this method enhances the accuracy of stitching together CIFAR-10 classifiers and allows for linear transformations of latent spaces. The empirical results indicate significant improvements in RR, assessed through Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) metrics and autoencoder reconstructions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The use of geodesics for distance measurement is a compelling idea.  
- The approach allows for connecting representations through linear transformations.  
- The averaging over multiple anchor choices in experiments accounts for variability.  
- The structured presentation in section 3, with clear headings for "Experimental setting," "Analysis of results," and "Takeaway," is commendable.  

Weaknesses:  
- The construction of the distance measure lacks clarity.  
- The description of experiment 3.1 is unclear, particularly regarding the recovery of full correspondence.  
- Limitations of the proposed method are not adequately discussed.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the distance measure construction, particularly in relation to the terms "energy" and "length." Additionally, please clarify the experimental procedure in section 3.1, specifically the meaning of "recover" and the relevance measure used for ranking items. We suggest introducing the term "relative geodesics" in the introduction to avoid confusion. Furthermore, please provide a discussion on the runtime complexity of the implementation and consider including code to facilitate reproducibility. Lastly, increase the font size on all figures, add titles for Fig.3, and use a different color scale for better readability.
