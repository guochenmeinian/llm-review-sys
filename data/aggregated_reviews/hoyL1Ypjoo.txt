Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new black-box optimization framework, WireMask-BBO, for macro placement in electronic design automation (EDA). The framework utilizes wire masks to optimize placement solutions, aiming to minimize the half-perimeter wirelength (HPWL). Experimental results indicate that WireMask-BBO achieves improvements over previous methods, demonstrating its potential for enhancing existing solutions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The framework offers a novel approach to the macro placement problem, providing new insights for the research community.
2. The post-processing technique is effective and versatile, allowing integration with other placement methods.
3. The paper is well-written and presents the problem and proposed work clearly.

Weaknesses:
1. The scalability of the method is questionable, as Bayesian optimization and evolutionary algorithms may not be suitable for large-scale problems.
2. Experimental results are insufficient, lacking comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and runtime analyses.
3. The framework is limited to macro placement and does not address standard cell placement, which restricts its applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including comparisons with state-of-the-art macro placement methods and analyzing the runtime of the proposed method against other techniques. Additionally, the authors should clarify the necessity of extensive hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal results. It would also be beneficial to discuss how the framework could be adapted for standard cell placement, potentially by integrating it with existing methods like DREAMPlace.
