Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a cross-moment approach for estimating the average causal effect in linear structural causal models (SCM) with latent confounders, utilizing a single observable proxy variable. The authors demonstrate that the causal effect can be identified through cross moments between the treatment, outcome, and proxy variable, circumventing the stringent assumptions required by traditional methods like difference-in-difference. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of simple arithmetic operations on cross moments to estimate causal effects addresses a significant challenge in the field, particularly in solving the OICA problem and mitigating biased estimation in difference-in-difference approaches.
2. The method is technically sound, with a clear and concise description of the underlying ideas.
3. The approach holds practical significance given the prevalence of the studied problem.

Weaknesses:
1. The evaluation is a major concern, as the included baselines are outdated and weak, such as KP14 from 2014, and the poor performance of the OICA method [SGKZ20] is not adequately explained. Additional baselines, like proximal causal inference, are needed for a more robust comparison.
2. Limitations of the proposed approach are not discussed, leaving questions about its applicability and robustness.
3. The model is restricted to linear causal frameworks, which may not hold in practical scenarios, and the method's applicability to multiple latent confounders is unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including more recent and relevant baselines, such as proximal causal inference, to provide a clearer comparison of their method's performance. Additionally, we suggest that the authors discuss the limitations of their approach, particularly regarding the assumptions of linearity and independent errors, and explore the implications of multiple latent confounders. Finally, clarifying the applicability of the method in practical scenarios where identifying a suitable proxy variable may be challenging would enhance the paper's comprehensiveness.
