### Key Points
This paper presents a model aimed at enhancing the alignment between the NLU component and a robot's physical environment through grounding tasks (intents) and arguments (objects) derived from natural language instructions. The authors propose a neural network-based architecture called GATE for extracting intents and arguments, alongside the adaptation of existing datasets for this purpose. Additionally, the paper introduces a new dataset for grounded task-argument extraction and an encoder-decoder architecture for embodied agents.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper proposes an end-to-end model integrating multiple subtasks that ground NLU to the robot's environment representation, with a detailed architectural description.
- A new dataset is curated for grounded task-argument extraction, which is beneficial for natural human-robot interaction.
- The authors employ five baseline models for performance comparison, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach.

Weaknesses:
- The annotation process lacks detail, including the number of annotators and basic statistics about the datasets.
- The results and discussion section is compressed, with minimal error analysis and insufficient reporting of component performance across subtasks and datasets.
- The dataset is relatively small, containing fewer than 2k examples, which may limit its effectiveness.
- The paper requires proofreading for typos, unclear passages, and incomplete references, and the evaluation results presentation lacks clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the annotation process description by including details on the number of annotators and basic dataset statistics. Additionally, the results and discussion section should be expanded to include a thorough error analysis and separate performance reporting for each component across all subtasks and datasets. To enhance the dataset's robustness, consider increasing its size and diversity. We also suggest proofreading the manuscript to correct typos and clarify unclear passages. Finally, please clarify the evaluation metrics and ensure that the dataset will be made publicly available.
