Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a denoising framework, DENOISER, aimed at mitigating the impact of noisy text descriptions on Open-Vocabulary Action Recognition (OVAR). The authors analyze various noise types and rates in text descriptions and evaluate the robustness of existing OVAR methods. The DENOISER framework employs generative and discriminative optimization to enhance recognition accuracy. Experimental results indicate that DENOISER effectively improves robustness against textual noise.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The focus on robustness to noisy text descriptions in real-world OVAR applications is both interesting and meaningful.
- The evaluation of existing OVAR methods' robustness against noisy text is valuable for the community.
- The motivation is clear, and the overall framework is technically sound.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed model shows limited superiority over existing models like GPT-3.5, raising concerns about the research significance. The authors should explore the performance with more advanced models like GPT-4.
- The experiments lack comprehensive comparisons with other correction methods and CLIP-based methods without textual adaptation.
- The method section is overly complex due to excessive symbols, making it difficult to follow.
- The paper primarily addresses text denoising rather than specific action recognition technologies, which may mislead readers regarding its core contribution.
- The types of text noise considered are too simplistic and may limit practical significance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including performance comparisons with other correction methods, such as GPT-3.5/4/4o, and demonstrate results from CLIP-based methods without additional textual adaptation. Additionally, simplifying the method section by reducing the number of symbols would enhance clarity. The authors should also clarify the distinction between text denoising and action recognition in their title and consider validating their framework on larger datasets with more complex noise types to strengthen the practical relevance of their work.
