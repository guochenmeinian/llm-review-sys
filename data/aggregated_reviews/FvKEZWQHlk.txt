### Key Points
This paper examines collective emotional dynamics on Sina Weibo during the initial year of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the epidemic epicenter. The authors employ the Knowledge Enhanced Pre-training (SKEP) model to quantitatively measure tweet emotions and utilize Pearson correlation coefficients to show that online emotional resonance correlates positively with geographic proximity. By redefining the critical parameter \(q_c\) from percolation theory as a country-wide emotional resonance indicator (ERI), the authors establish negative correlations between economic indicators and ERI. The study also identifies leader-follower patterns in emotional resonance fluctuations through time-lag emotion correlations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant topic by analyzing collective emotional resonance during a global health crisis.
- The use of a unique dataset from Sina Weibo and innovative computational methods contributes to the field.
- The findings reveal a positive correlation between online emotional resonance and geographic proximity, along with leader-follower patterns in emotional fluctuations.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clear definitions of key concepts, particularly "emotional resonance," leading to conceptual ambiguity.
- Methodologically, the unidimensional sentiment scores oversimplify emotional expression, and the provincial-based tweet categorization overlooks critical factors like population size and inter-provincial movement.
- The time-lag correlation analysis may not adequately capture social media dynamics, as user-to-follower emotional propagation patterns could be more relevant than province-to-province analysis.
- Writing quality is inconsistent, with unclear terminology and several typographical errors, which hinder comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of key definitions, particularly "emotional resonance," to enhance conceptual understanding. The operational definition of emotional resonance should be refined to account for the complexity of emotional expression on social media. Additionally, consider incorporating a relative emotion metric to capture both positive and negative emotional interactions, which could provide a more nuanced analysis.

The authors should address methodological concerns by discussing the implications of population size and density in their provincial tweet categorization. We suggest enhancing the time-lag correlation analysis to include user-to-follower emotional propagation patterns and contextualizing emotional resonance with significant COVID-19-related events.

To improve writing quality, we recommend proofreading for clarity and consistency in terminology, as well as restructuring the paper to ensure that results are presented in appropriate sections. Figures and captions should be improved for interpretability, and the appendix should provide a comprehensive dataset description, including geotagging details and potential biases. Finally, we encourage the authors to discuss limitations, such as demographic differences and ethical concerns, to provide a more balanced view of their findings.
