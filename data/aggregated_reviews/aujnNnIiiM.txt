Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents PASTA, a framework aimed at enhancing the training of end-to-end transformer-based trackers in heterogeneous scenarios by addressing negative interference and domain generalization. The authors propose using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and Modular Deep Learning (MDL) to create specialized modules based on scenario attributes such as camera viewpoint and lighting conditions. These modules are combined through task arithmetic to improve generalization to new domains. The effectiveness of PASTA is validated through extensive experiments on datasets like MOTSynth, MOT17, and PersonPath22, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional monolithic trackers.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The innovative combination of PEFT and MDL effectively addresses challenges in multi-object tracking, distinguishing it from traditional methods.
- Extensive experiments validate the framework's effectiveness, showing significant improvements in zero-shot settings and various key metrics.
- The paper is well-structured and clearly articulates methodologies, making it accessible to readers.
- The use of professional academic language enhances the paper's credibility.

Weaknesses:
- The framework lacks comparisons to ByteTrack and other trackers in zero-shot settings, limiting evaluation comprehensiveness.
- Detailed information on detection thresholds in Table 1 is missing, which is crucial for fair comparisons.
- The rationale behind the selection of specific attributes needs further elaboration.
- The impact of omitting LoRA in experiments is not explored, leaving questions about potential performance improvements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including comparisons to ByteTrack and other trackers in zero-shot settings to enhance comprehensiveness. Additionally, providing detailed information on detection thresholds in Table 1 would ensure fair comparisons. The authors should discuss their choice of attributes in more detail, explaining their relevance to the framework. Furthermore, exploring the performance implications of omitting LoRA in experiments would provide valuable insights into the framework's adaptability. Lastly, conducting experiments in broader application fields beyond pedestrian tracking would enhance the generality and practical value of PASTA.
