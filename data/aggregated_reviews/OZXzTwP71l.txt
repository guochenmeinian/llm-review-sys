### Key Points
This paper presents a privacy-preserving synthetic data generation technique, PriSHA, aimed at training clinical foundation models. The authors propose a combination of DPGAN and PATE-GAN to enhance privacy protection in synthetic data generation. Experimental results indicate a slight improvement of PriSHA over PATE-GAN Standard.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The focus on privacy protection and synthetic data in healthcare is crucial.
- The integration of existing techniques is logical and innovative.
- Experimental results demonstrate a surprisingly adequate performance.

Weaknesses:
- The claim that the proposed method can "address distribution shift" is questionable, as it merely combines two data sources rather than addressing the issue directly.
- The improvement over PATE-GAN rather than standard DPGAN raises concerns, particularly regarding the potential of synthetic data to enhance model performance.
- There is a lack of evaluation and real-world case studies to substantiate claims of effective privacy protection.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the optimization specification and pseudo-code, addressing specific questions regarding definitions and assumptions. Additionally, we suggest providing more detailed empirical results and clarifying the dataset used, including sample sizes and demographic ratios. Finally, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the implementation process and the rationale behind the claimed improvements in model performance.
