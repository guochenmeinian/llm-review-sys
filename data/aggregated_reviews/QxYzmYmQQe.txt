Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to fair machine learning under predictive uncertainty, introducing the concept of Equal Opportunity of Coverage (EOC). The authors propose a post-processing method called Binned Fair Quantile Regression (BFQR) to ensure that demographic groups with similar true labels receive equal prediction certainty while maintaining a predetermined coverage level for the entire population. The method is evaluated through experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving coverage rates across groups.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an important problem in algorithmic fairness by providing conditional coverage guarantees that consider both demographic groups and target variables.
- The proposed BFQR method shows promising empirical results, improving the maximum coverage gap between groups and achieving similar average coverage across groups.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation is often verbose and lacks clarity, particularly in the description of the proposed method and its implementation.
- The novelty of the approach is questioned, as it does not sufficiently differentiate itself from existing distribution matching techniques in the literature.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation, particularly in Section 4, where the method's implementation is described. It would be beneficial to provide a more rigorous definition of the mathematical objects used throughout the paper to enhance reader comprehension. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the novelty of their work in relation to existing literature on fairness, particularly regarding distribution matching techniques. Finally, addressing the concerns about the need for sensitive attributes at test time and discussing the implications of this requirement would strengthen the paper.
