### Key Points
This paper presents a study on core-competitive auction design within partially observable networked markets (PONM), where economic entities possess limited information due to the market's size and exclusive information holdings. The authors define PONM, explore auction design, and establish bounds for minimum core revenue, demonstrating the impossibility of achieving truthful, efficient, and core-competitive auctions simultaneously. They propose a class of auction mechanisms that are individually rational, incentive-compatible, and core-competitive, while also addressing the trade-offs between efficiency and revenue.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction effectively highlights the problem of information asymmetry in markets, setting a solid foundation for the exploration of PONM and core-competitive auctions.
- The paper is well-written, presenting a novel analysis with strong theoretical results.

Weaknesses:
- Theorem 4.5 appears straightforward and lacks depth.
- The proposed Deferred Allocation Auction (DAA) operates effectively only under specific conditions, limiting its applicability.
- There is a lack of practical motivation for the PONM model, which is crucial for applied contexts.
- Insufficient insights into general auction properties necessary for achieving core competitiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their definitions and notation, particularly regarding reported types and allocation policies. Specifically, clarify the meaning of "fixed and known" in Line 226 and ensure consistent notation for reported types throughout the paper. Additionally, we suggest providing a worked example of an allocation and payment rule for the PONM setting to enhance understanding. It would also be beneficial to include practical applications of the PONM model and address potential strategic behaviors of economic entities, such as collusion. Lastly, consider discussing the implications of core-competitiveness when the core is empty and explore the possibility of obtaining mechanisms that generate core outcomes for most instances.
