### Key Points
This paper presents a study on Sharpe ratio maximization under an m-sparse constraint, transforming the fractional optimization problem into an equivalent m-sparse quadratic programming problem. The authors propose a proximal gradient algorithm (PGA) to achieve a locally optimal solution, demonstrating its effectiveness through various datasets. However, the transformation raises questions about the necessity of framing the problem as Sharpe ratio maximization rather than m-sparse mean-variance optimization, which encompasses a broader range of solutions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is theoretically sound and effectively controls cardinality.
- The approach has been tested on various datasets, yielding strong experimental results.
- The writing is well-organized and clear, facilitating reader comprehension.
- The originality of optimizing the Sharpe ratio with sparse distributions is notable.

Weaknesses:
- There is insufficient discussion on practical implementation, particularly regarding computational time and additional constraints.
- The analysis lacks a comparative evaluation of computation time and the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm.
- The paper does not adequately differentiate its contributions from existing literature, raising questions about its novelty.
- The theoretical results regarding convergence to a global optimum in a non-convex setting require further justification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on practical implementation, including computational time and the ability to accommodate various additional constraints such as portfolio weight bounds. Additionally, we suggest providing a comparative analysis of computation time and convergence rates to enhance the evaluation of the proposed method's efficiency. Clarifying the distinction between this work and previous studies would strengthen the paper's contribution to the field. Finally, addressing the theoretical concerns regarding convergence in non-convex optimization would bolster the study's rigor.
