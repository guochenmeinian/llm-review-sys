### Key Points
This paper presents scalable algorithms, IFGN and FECE, for approximating forest-based centrality measures—Forest Node Centrality (FNC) and Forest Edge Centrality (FEC)—on large undirected graphs. The authors argue that existing sampling-based forest matrix estimation approaches primarily focus on directed graphs, leading to inefficiencies in edge centrality computation. The proposed methods utilize variance reduction techniques and are evaluated on various real-world networks, demonstrating improvements in efficiency and accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses computational challenges in applying forest-based centrality to large, disconnected graphs, a relevant problem in graph-based data analysis.
- It provides rigorous theoretical foundations, including formal proofs and error guarantees for the proposed estimators.
- A diverse set of experiments demonstrates the methods’ efficiency and scalability on large networks.

Weaknesses:
- The paper presents incremental advancements with limited novelty relative to prior work in variance reduction and forest centrality.
- Presentation is unclear, particularly in the introduction, where the motivation for the study is weak, making it difficult to understand the necessity of this research.
- The experimental evaluation lacks crucial comparative analyses and does not fully explore the impact of parameter choices or dataset selection.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction to better explain the motivation and significance of forest-based centrality measures over traditional ones. Additionally, the authors should clarify the rationale for focusing on undirected graphs, as this would strengthen the justification for their study. We suggest including comparative results with non-forest-based centrality measures to provide a stronger context for the empirical findings. Furthermore, the authors should elaborate on why existing estimators for directed graphs are not applicable to undirected graphs, and consider adding examples or diagrams to enhance comprehension of the estimators. Lastly, we recommend complementing the accuracy evaluation metric with alternatives that are less sensitive to outliers and that assess the ranking induced by centrality scores.
