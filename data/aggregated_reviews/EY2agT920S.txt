Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents GLAFF, a framework that enhances time series forecasting by utilizing timestamps to capture global dependencies and balance global and local information. GLAFF integrates a Mapper, quantile-based Denormalizer, and Combiner, which collectively improve predictive performance by an average of 12.5% across nine real-world datasets. The authors provide comprehensive experiments and code, demonstrating GLAFF's effectiveness compared to existing models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The article is well-structured, with clear writing and explicit motivation for the proposed method.
2. Comprehensive experiments validate the framework's performance against leading time series models.
3. The core code is provided, enhancing accessibility for readers.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper contains typos and lacks clarity in certain sections, particularly regarding the rationale for using quantile denormalization.
2. The method's simplicity raises concerns about its theoretical contributions and the initialization and tuning of weights in the Combiner.
3. Limitations regarding the framework's reliance on high-precision timestamps and its performance under different lookback window lengths are not adequately discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation paragraphs, particularly regarding "mitigating data drift" and the assumptions made. Additionally, the authors should expand the limitations section to address scenarios where the method may perform poorly, such as irregular sampling and data drift settings. It would also be beneficial to analyze the impact of timestamp granularity and noise on results, as well as to provide a more detailed discussion on the initialization and tuning of weights in the Combiner. Finally, we suggest including a comparison with existing methods that better utilize timestamps and presenting results in a more engaging format, such as bar charts.
