Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to human activity reasoning by integrating symbolic reasoning with visual inputs and leveraging probabilistic reasoning. The authors propose a symbolic system that enhances compositional generalization through relational reasoning, utilizing large language models (LLMs) to derive symbols and rules. They emphasize the importance of prompt design in their framework, which significantly influences performance and robustness. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that this system outperforms naive CLIP models, indicating strong reasoning capabilities and addressing uncertainties in symbolic reasoning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant problem by integrating symbolic reasoning with neural perception models, providing formal definitions and clear visualizations.
- The proposed system improves upon existing methods by offering broad semantic coverage and rational rules, enhancing explainability and generalization.
- The methodology is well-articulated, and experiments show promising results across multiple datasets.
- The authors effectively address previous concerns and clarify their contributions, particularly regarding the novelty of their symbolic system in real-world vision tasks.
- The trial-and-error process for prompt design is a thoughtful approach that allows for adaptability across different tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The notation and semantics of the proposed method are unclear, particularly regarding the distinction between logical entailment ($\models$) and implication ($\rightarrow$).
- The relationship of the proposed symbolic system to standard first-order logic is not well-defined, lacking clarity on its advantages and disadvantages.
- The empirical setting and activity reasoning descriptions are not sufficiently detailed, making it challenging for readers unfamiliar with the topic to follow.
- Key methodological details, such as symbol initialization and rule generation, are inadequately explained, leading to potential confusion about the system's operation.
- There is a lack of clarity on the integration of the proposed hierarchical structure for scalability and its current implementation in the framework.
- The sensitivity of experimental results to prompt design raises concerns about the robustness and generality of the system.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of notation and semantics, particularly by explicitly defining logical entailment and its distinction from implication. Additionally, the authors should provide a more comprehensive discussion on how their symbolic system relates to standard first-order logic, including its pros and cons. To enhance the paper's accessibility, we suggest including simple examples throughout to illustrate activity reasoning more effectively. Furthermore, the empirical settings should be articulated more clearly to aid reader comprehension. We also encourage the authors to clarify the methodological details regarding symbol initialization and rule generation to strengthen the overall presentation of their approach. Additionally, we recommend improving the clarity regarding the integration of the hierarchical structure for scalability and explicitly stating whether it is currently implemented or proposed as an extension. It would be beneficial to include a quantitative comparison of operations to enhance understanding of computational costs. Lastly, we suggest providing detailed discussions on prompt design, including how prompts are determined and their impact on performance, to address concerns about robustness and generality, and to explore the implications of their findings on computation scalability and applicability to other domains in the limitations section.
