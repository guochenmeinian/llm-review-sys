Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel theoretical framework for decomposing spurious causal effects, introducing the concept of partial abduction and prediction. The authors derive nonparametric decompositions of spurious effects and provide identifiability results for both Markovian and semi-Markovian structural causal models (SCMs). An empirical example using the COMPAS dataset illustrates the application of the proposed framework.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses the relevant problem of decomposing spurious effects in the presence of multiple confounders, with potential applications in causal algorithmic fairness.
- The novelty of the work is significant, as it develops a new theory for such decompositions based on Pearl's SCM framework.
- The technical rigor is commendable, with clear definitions, transparent assumptions, and well-supported proofs and examples.

Weaknesses:
- Concerns exist regarding the practical applicability of the proposed framework, particularly the necessity of knowing the full (semi-Markovian) causal graph, which may not be feasible in many high-dimensional applications.
- The empirical evaluation is limited, relying solely on the COMPAS dataset; additional examples would strengthen the findings.
- The notation used in the paper could be clearer, particularly regarding the definitions and implications of certain terms and symbols.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experiment section by including a second example dataset to enhance the empirical evaluation. Additionally, we suggest including a section on limitations that emphasizes the assumptions necessary for identifying spurious decompositions from observational data, along with a discussion of these assumptions in the context of the empirical example. Clarifying the difference between "spurious effect" and "spurious variations" would also benefit the reader's understanding. Furthermore, we advise providing more details on the implementation of the Semi-Markovian spurious decomposition procedure and comparing the proposed method against existing methods to highlight its advantages.
