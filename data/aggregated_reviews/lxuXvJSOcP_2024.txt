Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Unified Domain Generalization and Adaptation (UDGA) scheme for multi-view 3D object detection, incorporating depth inconsistency-based constraints and a label-efficient domain adaptation (LEDA) method. The proposed multi-view overlap depth constraint addresses geometric misalignment between source and target domains, while LEDA enables adaptation with fewer labels, maintaining knowledge from the source domain. The authors conduct experiments across multiple datasets to validate their approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper clearly identifies its focus and sets solid goals for each proposed module.
- Experimental results across various datasets are convincing, demonstrating strong performance.
- The writing is accessible, and the flowchart effectively illustrates core components.

Weaknesses:
- The method section lacks detailed specifications of input and output tensor dimensions, hindering reader comprehension.
- The depth inconsistency approach appears similar to existing methods like DETR3D, raising questions about its necessity and effectiveness.
- Insufficient discussion of related works, particularly in the context of LiDAR-based domain adaptation, limits the paper's contextualization.
- The effectiveness of LEDA is not convincingly demonstrated compared to existing methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the method section by specifying every input and output tensor dimension to enhance clarity. Additionally, a detailed analysis comparing the depth inconsistency constraint with RGB feature-based methods, such as DETR3D, should be included to justify its use. The authors should also address more related works, particularly those focusing on LiDAR-based domain adaptation, to clarify the distinctions and relevance of their research. Furthermore, a more thorough demonstration of LEDA's effectiveness in terms of efficiency and accuracy compared to existing approaches is necessary to strengthen the paper's claims.
