Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a probabilistic strategy for stream-based active learning that constructs anytime valid prediction sets by maximizing the variance process of an e-process. The authors extend the framework of Risk Controlling Prediction Sets (RCPS) to a sequential setting, providing guarantees on risk control and regret. The work includes theoretical guarantees and proof-of-concept experiments, aiming to enhance the utility of RCPS through selective querying of true labels within a budget.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel perspective of safe betting to active learning.
- The formalism is well-developed, demonstrating a strong understanding of e-variables and their application.
- The extension to label-efficient active learning is significant, providing a practical framework for practitioners.

Weaknesses:
- Section 2 lacks novelty, with similar results found in earlier works; it should be restructured to serve as background for Section 3.
- The notation is complex and not user-friendly, making it difficult for readers to grasp the method's goals.
- The experimental section is limited and lacks meaningful conclusions, with no summaries or additional intuitions to aid understanding.
- The related works section is inadequate, failing to provide a clear history of relevant literature in active learning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the notation and simplify complex concepts to enhance reader comprehension. Consider restructuring Section 2 as a background section and elevating Section 3 as the main contribution. We suggest including more extensive experiments and practical examples to illustrate the method's applicability. Additionally, a thorough literature review should be integrated into the main text to provide context and highlight the paper's contributions relative to existing work. Finally, addressing the confusion in the problem setting, particularly regarding the notation of actions and outputs, will strengthen the paper's clarity.
