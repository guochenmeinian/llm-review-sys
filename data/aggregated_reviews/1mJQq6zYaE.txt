Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of diffusion models, focusing on the impact of the diffusion coefficient in the reverse process when the score function contains errors. The authors investigate how the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true data distribution and the generated distribution varies with the diffusion term \( h \). They demonstrate that a larger \( h \) is advantageous when the score error is concentrated early in the generative process, while a smaller \( h \) is preferable when the error is concentrated later. The findings are supported by numerical experiments on synthetic data and datasets like MNIST. Additionally, the authors propose a framework that could benefit from further discussion regarding its limitations, particularly as the work currently relies on CIFAR10 for experiments, which may not be sufficient for demonstrating large-scale applicability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant question regarding the role of noise in generative processes, particularly in the context of diffusion models.
- The analysis is rigorous, with reasonable assumptions, and the authors effectively link theoretical findings to empirical results.
- The explicit characterization of the KL divergence error and the implications for future research are noteworthy.
- The authors have acknowledged limitations and potential societal impacts, enhancing the overall quality of the work.

Weaknesses:
- The upper bound on the constant \( \Tau \) is not adequately discussed, and examples of distributions where it can be computed would enhance understanding.
- The numerical experiment lacks clarity regarding its purpose, particularly in relation to the convergence of \( L(h) \).
- The reliance on CIFAR10 alone for experiments is insufficient for large-scale validation.
- The complexity of equations and variables may hinder readability, and the paper could benefit from improved explanations of these elements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the upper bound \( \Tau \) by providing explicit examples of distributions where it can be computed or controlled. Additionally, clarifying the purpose of the numerical experiment on the 2D 4-mode Gaussian mixture would enhance its relevance. We strongly urge the authors to conduct more experiments beyond CIFAR10, as results—even if not perfectly aligned with the theory—could highlight limitations and suggest future research directions. To enhance accessibility, consider adding intuitive figures that visually elucidate the implications of your theorems and provide more explanations and motivations to improve readability.
