Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on Nash equilibrium in federated learning (FL) with a focus on a utility model that incorporates agents' payoff functions minus data-sharing costs. The authors demonstrate the existence of Nash equilibrium under the assumptions of concave utility and convex cost functions. They propose a budget-balanced mechanism to maximize agents' utilities at equilibrium and validate their approach through experiments comparing it with existing methods like FedAvg.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper clearly highlights its differences from existing works, particularly in considering unconstrained settings and optimizing p-mean welfare.
2. Most claims and assumptions, such as concave payoff and convex cost functions, are well justified.
3. The writing is clear, and the implications following the theorems enhance understanding.

Weaknesses:
1. The assumptions that cost and payoff functions are common knowledge and that agent utility solely depends on the number of samples contributed limit the work's applicability and require better justification.
2. The utility model raises concerns, particularly the assumption that agents cannot achieve better utility independently, which oversimplifies real-world complexities and may undermine the paper's conclusions.
3. The mechanism's reliance on prior literature on public good provision raises questions about its novelty, and the comparison to existing literature is inadequate.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for their assumptions regarding common knowledge of cost and payoff functions, particularly addressing scenarios where data sharing may not be feasible. Additionally, a more detailed discussion on the motivation for the utility model is necessary, especially regarding the implications of agents potentially achieving better utility through independent actions. Clarifying the definition of $u_i$ and ensuring that it is explicitly expressed as a function of $p_i$ and $\beta^*$ would enhance the paper's clarity. Finally, we suggest incorporating a related work section to better situate the contributions within the existing literature on incentive mechanisms for federated learning.
