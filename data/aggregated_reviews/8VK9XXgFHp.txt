### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for zero-shot entity linking that enhances candidate ranking through mention-entity matching and sequence labeling. The authors propose a method that captures fine-grained cross-entity comparison information, aiming to improve performance in this task. The framework demonstrates state-of-the-art results on the ZESHEL dataset, highlighting the importance of cross-entity comparison, which has been overlooked in prior research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a meaningful and simple idea to improve candidate ranking for zero-shot entity linking.
- It achieves competitive, state-of-the-art results on the ZESHEL dataset.
- The method is easy to follow and includes a thorough comparison with previous work.

Weaknesses:
- The paper suffers from poor figures that lack clarity, hindering the understanding of the proposed method's effectiveness.
- The motivation for the approach is weak, as the cross-encoder architecture does not adequately differentiate itself from existing methods.
- The novelty of the methodology is questionable, as similar concepts have been previously proposed.
- The comparison with prior works is unfair due to differences in model parameters and candidate selection.
- The scope is limited, focusing solely on the ZESHEL dataset without broader validation across other datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of figures to better illustrate the effectiveness of their method. Additionally, we suggest strengthening the motivation for their approach by clearly articulating how it differs from existing methods. The authors should also address the novelty concerns by providing a more detailed discussion on how their work builds upon or diverges from previous research. To ensure fair comparisons, we advise conducting experiments using consistent parameters and candidate selections. Finally, we encourage the authors to expand their evaluation to include results from additional entity linking datasets, such as AIDA-YAGO, to enhance the robustness of their findings.
