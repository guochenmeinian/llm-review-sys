### Key Points
This paper presents the 3D Relative Position-aware Network (3DRP-Net), designed to enhance 3D visual object grounding using point clouds and natural language input. The authors propose a one-stage model that incorporates a 3D relative position multi-head attention mechanism and a soft-labeling strategy to improve training. Evaluations on benchmark datasets ScanRefer and parts of ReferIt3D demonstrate that 3DRP-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, enhancing spatial reasoning capabilities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with a clear motivation and comprehensive evaluations showing substantial improvements over existing baselines.
- The introduction of the 3D relative position multi-head attention effectively integrates location information into the model.
- The proposed soft-labeling strategy addresses ambiguity in training, contributing to the model's performance.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation is limited to indoor scenes in a western context, raising questions about the model's adaptability to diverse scenarios.
- The method primarily captures pairwise spatial relations, neglecting triplet relationships that may be present in language descriptions.
- The use of learnable embeddings for relative distances may lead to loss of fine-grained information, particularly in cases requiring precise distance differentiation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of existing works, particularly ViL3DRel, to provide a deeper comparison and explore its applicability within the one-stage framework. Additionally, we suggest addressing the limitations of the model by incorporating mechanisms to capture triplet relationships and refining the encoding of relative distances to retain fine-grained information. Lastly, we encourage the authors to evaluate the model on a broader range of datasets to assess its generalizability.
