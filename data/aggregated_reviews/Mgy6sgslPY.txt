Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an alternative approach to learning heuristics in search algorithms, focusing on optimizing the ranking of state pairs rather than imitating the optimal cost-to-go function. The authors argue that this method provides both theoretical and practical advantages over conventional approaches. The paper explores ranking algorithms within the context of heuristic search methods, particularly emphasizing the differences between ranking and estimating cost-to-goal. The authors acknowledge the limitations imposed by the conference's page constraints on the related works section and express a willingness to improve the manuscript based on feedback received. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed heuristic, indicating that the approach outperforms traditional methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces an original concept that could significantly enhance planning methods.
- The theoretical discussion, particularly regarding sufficiency and necessity in Theorem 1, is clearly articulated.
- The authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the theoretical aspects of their proposed algorithm and its relationship to existing literature.
- The empirical results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional methods.
- The authors express openness to constructive criticism and a willingness to incorporate suggestions into the final version of the manuscript.

Weaknesses:
- Claims made in the paper require stronger support; the connection between reported results and theoretical advantages is not sufficiently clear.
- The definition of "optimal ranking" is crucial and should be presented earlier in the text.
- The learning time required for the proposed method is substantial, raising questions about its efficiency.
- The writing and organization of the manuscript are noted as problematic, with issues that are not trivial to resolve.
- The related works section is perceived as insufficient, with a need for a more thorough literature review.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their claims by providing more detailed experimental analyses, including comparisons with additional baselines. It would be beneficial to clarify the theoretical advantages and disadvantages of various approaches and to discuss the implications of symmetries and multiple optimal paths more thoroughly. Additionally, we suggest that the authors simplify some expressions for better readability and consider reorganizing sections for improved flow, particularly moving the related work section to an earlier position in the paper. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the relationship between their work and reference [1], particularly regarding the ease of ranking versus regression. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to conduct a more comprehensive search of relevant literature to enhance the related works section. To address writing issues, we urge the authors to revise the manuscript for clarity and coherence, as the current writing does not meet the expected standards. Finally, we recommend that the authors explicitly define the concept of optimal ranking in relation to different search algorithms, particularly distinguishing between cases for A* and GBFS.
