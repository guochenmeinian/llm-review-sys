### Key Points
This paper presents Newswire, a comprehensive database of wire service stories from US newspapers spanning 1878 to 1977, primarily sourced from Associated Press, United Press, and the International Service. The dataset comprises 2.7 million unique public domain news wire articles, enriched with topics and named entities linked to Wikidata, aimed at providing a structured resource for historical analysis and machine learning applications. The authors employ various AI techniques, including OCR, de-duplication, and named entity resolution, to enhance digitization quality, resulting in a searchable database that serves historians, sociologists, and public policy officials. The authors demonstrate high precision and recall metrics in their processing pipeline, showcasing the dataset's utility through analyses of news coverage trends over time.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors demonstrate mastery of AI techniques and archival information, creating a high-quality, legally compliant database.
- The dataset's extensive historical coverage and structured nature enhance its applicability across various academic fields, including NLP, social sciences, and digital humanities.
- High-quality data processing is ensured through advanced techniques for OCR, de-duplication, and entity recognition, with robust evaluation metrics supporting its reliability.
- The public availability of the dataset and processing pipelines on Hugging Face promotes reproducibility and transparency.
- The paper is well-organized, clear, and provides evidence of the database's utility through historical analyses.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks sufficient detail on the technical approaches used for data processing, making it difficult to assess the overall quality.
- There is no validation of the dataset's usefulness, leaving its practical applications unconfirmed.
- Many components appear to rely heavily on prior work without adequate explanation or justification of their novel contributions.
- The dataset's geographical focus on U.S. news limits its applicability for global historical perspectives, and its coverage ends in 1977 due to copyright restrictions.
- The paper lacks detailed error analysis and ablation studies, which are necessary to understand the limitations of the processing pipeline and the impact of individual components on dataset quality.
- Potential biases in historical texts are acknowledged but not sufficiently addressed, and the absence of strategies for mitigating these biases could complicate analyses.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the technical approaches by providing more detailed descriptions of the methods used for data processing, including the performance metrics of models like RoBERTa and the F1 score for named entity recognition. Additionally, it would be beneficial to validate the dataset's usefulness through concrete examples or case studies. The authors should also clarify the motivations behind the choices of topics and named entities extracted, and ensure that all references to prior work are adequately contextualized within the paper. We suggest including a more detailed error analysis to discuss common OCR errors and de-duplication challenges, as well as incorporating ablation studies to clarify the contributions of each processing component to the overall dataset quality. To enhance clarity, we recommend adding visual aids, such as flowcharts or diagrams, to illustrate the processing pipeline. Furthermore, providing specific examples of research applications and comparisons with other historical datasets would strengthen the paper's claims of originality and significance. Finally, addressing potential biases in the dataset and discussing strategies for handling sensitive content would enhance its ethical considerations.
