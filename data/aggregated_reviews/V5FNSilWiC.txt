### Key Points
This paper studies the matching market with returning agents and introduces the concept of *adversarial interaction attacks*, where returning agents distort short-term interactions to influence future predictions. The authors analyze this behavior within a simplified three-phase framework, highlighting its implications for market design. They argue that predictive models used by agents can lead to unforeseen strategic behaviors that impact market outcomes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a novel and meaningful topic regarding strategic behavior in matching markets with returning agents.  
- The analysis is clear and well-structured, making it accessible to readers.  
- It provides significant insights into the interplay between predictive models and market mechanisms, emphasizing the need for careful market design to avoid exacerbating inequality.

Weaknesses:  
- The conclusions drawn may not be extendable to larger matching markets, as the simplified setting used may limit generalizability.  
- The theoretical analysis primarily focuses on the random serial dictatorship mechanism, leaving out potentially interesting results from other mechanisms, such as the deferred acceptance algorithm.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their conclusions by considering larger matching markets. Additionally, we suggest expanding the theoretical analysis to include other matching mechanisms, such as the deferred acceptance algorithm, to explore whether qualitatively similar findings arise. Furthermore, addressing the feedback loop between prediction models and market mechanisms could enhance the robustness of the analysis.
