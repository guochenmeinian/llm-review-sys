Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for Bayesian Optimization (BO) of Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs), termed NFT with EMICoRe. The authors propose a VQE kernel that constrains the Gaussian Process function space to valid VQE objective functions and introduce a new acquisition function for the EMICoRe method, optimizing expected maximum improvement. The experimental results indicate that the VQE kernel outperforms other kernels in a BO context, and the NFT-EMICoRe method surpasses other non-BO NFT approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The manuscript addresses a significant problem in optimizing noisy VQE circuits and provides a principled solution using BO with physical constraints.
- The writing is clear and well-organized, with effective figures illustrating the proposed method's performance relative to baselines.
- The introduction of a novel kernel tailored for VQE objectives is a sound contribution.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental evaluation is limited, focusing only on Q=3 and 5 qubit systems, lacking comparisons with other optimization methods beyond NFT.
- The practical implications of using a specific ansatz with single qubit gates are unclear, necessitating further explanation for practitioners.
- The benefits of the proposed kernel are not convincingly demonstrated, as shown in figure 2, where its superiority over existing methods is ambiguous.
- There is a lack of ablation studies for the EMICoRe acquisition function, which would clarify its significance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental evaluation by benchmarking their method against a wider range of optimization techniques and larger quantum systems. Additionally, the authors should clarify the practical applicability of their specific ansatz for general parametrized circuits. We also suggest including ablation studies for the EMICoRe acquisition function to demonstrate its importance. Finally, addressing the impact of hardware noise in their simulations would enhance the robustness of their findings.
