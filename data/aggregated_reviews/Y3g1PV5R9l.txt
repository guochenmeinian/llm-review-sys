Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents PTQD, a Post-Training Quantization framework for diffusion models that disentangles quantization noise into correlated and uncorrelated components relative to full-precision models. The method addresses each component separately, using linear regression for the correlation coefficient and modifying the stochastic variance in reverse diffusion for the residual noise. The authors propose a time-step aware mixed precision quantization scheme based on gathered statistics, demonstrating significant improvements in image quality across multiple datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is clearly written and well-organized, with a comprehensive analysis of quantization challenges in diffusion models.  
- The framework effectively outperforms previous methods, showcasing impressive experimental results.  
- The incorporation of quantization noise into diffusion noise is a novel approach that enhances the practical value of the method.  

Weaknesses:  
- The practical ability of the method to manage residual noise remains questionable.  
- Comparisons with other post-training quantization methods, particularly at different bit ranges, are insufficient.  
- The related work section lacks clarity regarding methodical differences with Q-Diffusion, and details on the linear regression process are inadequately explained.  
- No wall clock time comparisons are provided, despite slow runtime being a noted drawback of diffusion models.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the related work section by explicitly detailing the differences between their method and Q-Diffusion. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include a visualization of generated images to assess the impact on generation and reconstruction quality. We suggest conducting comparisons with regular PTQ across various bit ranges and performing ablation studies at constant precision to evaluate the real impact of each suggestion independently. Finally, providing wall clock time comparisons would strengthen the paper's contributions.
