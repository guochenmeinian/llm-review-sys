Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DeepPCR, a method for parallelizing sequential computations in neural networks, leveraging the Markov property to convert sequences into parallel operations using Parallel Cyclic Reduction (PCR) and Newtonâ€™s method. The authors demonstrate significant speedups in training and inference, achieving up to 30X speedup for forward passes and 200X for backward passes in MLPs, as well as notable improvements in ResNet training and diffusion model generation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors address a significant problem with innovative approaches, particularly using Newton's method to handle non-linearity effectively.
- The evaluation section is convincing, with limitations discussed thoroughly.
- The potential impact on parallelization techniques is substantial, and the paper is well-written, articulating main claims clearly.

Weaknesses:
- An analysis of space complexity concerning Jacobian blocks and a detailed memory profile during training is lacking.
- Additional evaluations on transformer-based models are needed, as architectures like BERT/T5/GPT should theoretically satisfy the Markov property.
- The evaluation of stable diffusion models trained with DeepPCR would benefit from presenting FID scores and generated images for comparison.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of space complexity related to Jacobian blocks and provide a detailed memory profile breakdown during training. More evaluations on transformer-based models should be included, as these architectures are expected to work with DeepPCR. Additionally, presenting FID scores and generated images for stable diffusion models would enhance the evaluation of DeepPCR's effectiveness. Finally, clarifying how DeepPCR handles layers that require historical information, such as residual connections, would address potential concerns regarding load balancing in parallel stages.
