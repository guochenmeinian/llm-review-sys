### Key Points
This paper presents MatchNAS, a neural network porting scheme aimed at automating the deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs) on mobile platforms, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. The authors propose a novel combination of neural architecture search (NAS) techniques and semi-supervised learning (SSL) to facilitate this process. The methodology is clearly articulated, allowing for replication in future research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The work addresses a significant challenge in bridging cloud AI and edge AI, enhancing the efficiency of network porting to edge devices amidst the growing IoT landscape.  
- MatchNAS represents a novel approach that integrates NAS and SSL, potentially reducing the effort required for network fine-tuning.  
- The paper is well-structured, with comprehensive experiments validating the effectiveness and training efficiency of MatchNAS.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks a detailed discussion on the limitations and trade-offs of the MatchNAS approach.  
- The novelty of the work could be further emphasized, as it primarily combines existing techniques without clear technological innovations.  
- The evaluation is limited to the MobileNetV3 structure, raising questions about the applicability of the method to other network architectures.  
- A more explicit analysis of the computational complexity of MatchNAS would strengthen the claims of efficiency.  
- The relevance of the chosen image classification datasets for evaluating a method intended for mobile network porting is not adequately justified.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the limitations and trade-offs associated with the MatchNAS approach. Additionally, we suggest that the authors emphasize the novelty of their work by clarifying the technological innovations beyond the combination of NAS and SSL. To enhance the evaluation, consider including benchmarks from the NAS community, such as Pascal VOC and Cityscapes, and provide a rationale for the choice of datasets used. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to analyze the computational complexity of MatchNAS explicitly and address the broader applicability of their contributions to mobile network porting.
