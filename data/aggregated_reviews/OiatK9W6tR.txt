Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents quantum algorithms for stochastic optimization, addressing both convex and non-convex functions. The authors introduce a technique called "quantum variance reduction," which utilizes a quantum sampling oracle to enhance the estimation of a random variable's mean. They propose three algorithms (Q-AC-SA, Quantum stochastic cutting planes, and Q-Spider) that replace classical oracle access with a quantum oracle, demonstrating quadratic speedup in specific scenarios, albeit with increased query scaling dependent on the dimensionality \(d\). The authors also establish lower bounds for quantum variance reduction, asserting the optimality of their approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper presents novel results that merge quantum variance reduction with stochastic optimization.
- It is well-organized, with mathematically rigorous claims and broad applicability across convex and non-convex problems.
- Theorems 1, 2, and 3 yield significant results regarding quantum algorithms for convex and non-convex optimization.

Weaknesses:
- The query scaling increases with dimensionality \(d\), limiting applicability to high-dimensional problems.
- The oracle model lacks clarity regarding practical scenarios where this method outperforms classical algorithms.
- Key routines, such as QuantumMeanEstimation, are not adequately explained.
- Several typographical errors and unclear definitions detract from the paper's clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definitions for the quantum sampling oracle and stochastic quantum gradient oracle. Additionally, providing a brief description of how Algorithms 2 and 3 differ from existing work would enhance the paper's self-containment. We suggest including comparisons with other quantum algorithms in Table 1 to contextualize the proposed methods. Furthermore, addressing the implementation details of the oracle and the resource requirements for quantum computers would strengthen the paper. Lastly, we advise proofreading to correct typographical errors and improve the overall presentation.
