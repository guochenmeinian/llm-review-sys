Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a hierarchical controller for reinforcement learning-based control, specifically designed for robots that can be decoupled into high-level and low-level controllers. The authors propose a joint learning approach using a behavior cloning objective, enhancing the robustness of the high-level controller against noise from low-level outputs. The model is tested on various morphologies, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to vanilla RL and NerveNet. Additionally, the MeMo framework is introduced, which enhances transferability across different robot morphologies by utilizing pre-trained modular controllers, improving training efficiency over conventional methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The hierarchical controller enables sample-efficient policy learning across morphological changes.
2. The method allows training on one morphology and transferring to a new one, unlike prior methods that require extensive training on multiple morphologies.
3. Experimental results indicate improved sample efficiency over baseline methods.
4. The modular approach of the MeMo framework facilitates rapid adaptation to new robot designs.

Weaknesses:
1. The method's ability to handle multiple morphologies during training is uncertain, particularly as existing works often randomize over many morphologies for efficient transfer.
2. The significance of morphology changes on system dynamics remains unclear.
3. The tasks evaluated are relatively simple, raising questions about the necessity of the proposed method when training from scratch is quick.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity on how the method can be trained across multiple morphologies, particularly in addressing the fairness of comparative evaluations. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion on the challenges of transitioning from simulation to real-world applications, such as hardware inconsistencies and environmental variations. Finally, conducting experiments to demonstrate the method's robustness in adapting to dynamic changes, such as uncontrollable joints, would strengthen the paper's contributions.
