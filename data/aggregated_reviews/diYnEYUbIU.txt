Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for panoramic semantic segmentation by dividing the task into over-sampled and under-sampled segmentations. The authors propose using a joint semantic segmentation and dense depth estimation for over-sampled segments, while under-sampled segments incorporate hand-crafted features representing vertical relative distances. A transformer-based context module is employed to merge these predictions. The contributions include the separation of ceiling and floor from other scene elements, the introduction of vertical relative distance features, and the transformer-based context module. The approach is conceptually related to previous works but offers distinct contributions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper describes a practical method for semantic segmentation in indoor environments, motivated by the specifics of such scenes.
2. The method provides a geometric representation of vertical relative distances, enhancing spatial relationships for better segmentation results.
3. The paper is well-structured and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
1. There is an error in the calculation of improvement in Table 1, where the difference in mIoU values is incorrectly reported.
2. The choice of Trans4PASS++ as a baseline is questionable, as newer methods yield better results.
3. The related work section lacks a discussion of the shortcomings of previous methods, limiting context for the proposed approach.
4. The method is computationally complex, and the merging process of segment predictions is not clearly formalized.
5. The performance improvement of the proposed model does not seem significant, and the ablation study lacks qualitative comparisons.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors correct the error in Table 1 regarding the mIoU calculations. Additionally, consider justifying the choice of Trans4PASS++ as the baseline or using a more current state-of-the-art method for comparison. It would enhance the related work section to include a discussion of the limitations of previous methods. We suggest formalizing the merging process in Section 3.5 for clarity and providing details on the computational complexity of the framework. Lastly, conducting ablation studies without depth estimation and including qualitative comparisons would strengthen the paper's contributions.
