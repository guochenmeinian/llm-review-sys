Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for task-driven exploration in controlling nonlinear systems, focusing on identifying relevant system parameters for specific tasks. The authors derive an algorithm based on a quantity that estimates task loss variation under a certainty-equivalence controller. This method extends existing exploration algorithms, specifically DynamicOED, to nonlinear systems. The paper demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness through experiments, showing improved performance over non-task-driven methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-motivated, addressing the relevance of certain parameters for controller tasks.
- It extends existing concepts to a broader class of nonlinear systems, contributing significant novelty.
- The introduction of a motivating example aids in understanding the problem space.
- The related work section effectively positions the paper within both reinforcement learning and traditional control contexts.
- Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms non-task-driven exploration methods.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation could be improved; intuitive descriptions of mathematical concepts and assumptions are lacking.
- Some assumptions, particularly assumption 3 and assumption 8, require clearer justification and explanation.
- The notation in DynamicOED is difficult to follow, complicating implementation.
- The experimental section is limited in scope, with small-scale systems and few baselines.
- The paper does not adequately address the computational complexity or real-time applicability of the algorithm.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation by providing intuitive explanations for the mathematical concepts and assumptions, particularly for assumption 3 and assumption 8. Additionally, including more complex tasks in the experiments would demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods over non-optimal exploration strategies. Clarifying the computational complexity and real-time applicability of the algorithm would also enhance the paper's impact. Finally, we suggest adding a discussion on the relationship between the theoretical insights and practical applications in the context of nonlinear systems.
