### Key Points
This paper presents a dynamic memory mechanism aimed at enhancing LLMs' decision-making capabilities through prompts. The method comprises two stages: memory formation, which captures human behaviors as state-action tuples, and memory refinement, which utilizes tree exploration to generate and update decision processes. The effectiveness of this approach is validated in Webshop and ALFworld, comparing it against standard prompting methods like ReAct and BUTLER. The authors propose that their dynamic memory system, unlike fixed prompts, allows for self-updating based on environmental feedback, thus improving decision-making performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an interesting problem and presents a novel approach that leverages LLMs' summarization abilities and dynamic prompting mechanisms.
- The clarity of the paper is commendable, with a well-structured presentation of the problem and methodology, supported by clear figures.
- Experimental results indicate a significant improvement over baseline methods.

Weaknesses:
- Concerns exist regarding the method's applicability in scenarios with insufficient human trajectories or expert examples.
- The computational cost of tree exploration may be prohibitive, especially with larger action spaces.
- The reliance on LLMs for clustering state-action tuples raises questions about accuracy and potential impacts on the overall process.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the applicability of their method in environments with limited expert trajectories and provide experimental analysis to address this concern. Additionally, we suggest incorporating comparisons with other memory-based frameworks, such as Reflexion, to highlight the advantages of the proposed method. To mitigate the computational costs associated with tree exploration, we encourage the authors to explore alternative tree search methods. Lastly, we advise the authors to unify the tense usage throughout the paper and clarify the process of summarizing human behaviors into state-action tuples to avoid potential information loss.
