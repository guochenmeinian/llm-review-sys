### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical framework of evaluation metrics for Information Extraction (IE) tasks, encompassing binary/n-ary relation extraction, event extraction, coreference resolution, role-filler entity extraction, and template extraction. The authors propose a systematic bottom-up approach to enhance IE theory by elucidating interconnections among various evaluation metrics and suggest that this framework could be adapted for other fields such as information retrieval and text classification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper provides a strong theoretical foundation and generalization over multiple evaluation measures in IE, marking it as the first theoretically motivated framework in this area.  
- The theoretical aspects are well presented, and the framework is likely to be of interest beyond the IE field.  
- The study offers sufficient support for its claims and arguments, demonstrating strong soundness.

Weaknesses:  
- There is a lack of example applications of the framework for widely used specific metrics in IE evaluation.  
- The paper does not adequately address limitations of the framework, such as its applicability to tasks involving tuples of various sizes or generative models.  
- The mathematical notation is overloaded with symbols, which may hinder clarity.  
- Some examples of data structures become redundant after initial presentation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including example applications of the framework for specific metrics in IE evaluation. Additionally, the authors should address the limitations of the framework, particularly regarding its applicability to various IE tasks and models. To enhance clarity, we suggest simplifying the mathematical notation to reduce the overload of symbols. Finally, we encourage the authors to consider revising the examples of data structures to avoid redundancy after the initial presentation.
