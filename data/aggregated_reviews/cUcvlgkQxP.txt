Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical framework for assessing the instance-level learnability of multi-instance learning (MIL) algorithms using PAC learning theory. It derives necessary and sufficient conditions for instance-level learnability and evaluates various existing Deep MIL algorithms against these conditions. The authors also conduct empirical studies to validate their theoretical findings. Additionally, the paper introduces ProMIL, which learns from individual instance predictions by utilizing a Bernstein Polynomial Estimator to enhance quantile estimation in datasets with complex distributions. The authors provide a theoretical framework that analyzes ProMIL's learning capabilities, demonstrating that it can optimize bag risk through instance-level learning on specific datasets. This framework is validated through examples of other MIL algorithms, indicating its broader applicability in real-world scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel theoretical framework that fills a significant gap in MIL research.
- Key definitions and implications are clearly articulated, aiding comprehension of complex theoretical constructs.
- The theoretical conditions and proofs are well-grounded in PAC learning theory, providing a robust foundation for the proposed framework.
- The study addresses practical concerns in expert-labeling domains, highlighting the potential impact of instance-level learnable MIL algorithms.
- The proposed theoretical framework offers valuable insights into the learnability of MIL algorithms and their application in various fields, such as medical image analysis and drug development.
- The authors provide concrete examples and analytical results that enhance the understanding of ProMIL's impact on instance-level learnability.

Weaknesses:
- Many statements lack rigor, affecting readability; for instance, Condition 4 inaccurately equates optimal hypotheses with risks.
- The paper's empirical validation is insufficiently thorough, lacking detailed experimental setups and reproducibility.
- The categorization of pooling methods is inconsistent with referenced literature, and the paper does not adequately address the implications of its findings for current state-of-the-art methods.
- Some reviewers express doubts about the overall impact of the work on subsequent research, suggesting a need for clearer articulation of its significance.
- There are concerns regarding the applicability of certain algorithms, such as Attention-pooling, which do not satisfy the proposed conditions for instance learning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the rigor of their statements, particularly in Condition 4, by clarifying the distinction between hypotheses and risks. Additionally, the authors should enhance the empirical validation by incorporating more comprehensive experimental designs and results, particularly using standard MIL benchmarks. It would also be beneficial to discuss the relevance of their findings in the context of contemporary attention-based methods and to clarify the categorization of pooling methods to align with existing literature. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to improve the discussion on the potential impact of their work on future research, elaborating on how their findings could influence subsequent studies in the field. Lastly, we suggest including a more detailed analysis of the limitations of existing algorithms like Attention-pooling and recommending learnable pooling methods, such as Conjunctive-Pooling, to enhance practical applications. Addressing the clarity of the paper's presentation and providing intuitive explanations for definitions and theorems would significantly enhance reader comprehension.
