### Key Points
This paper presents a method called "LOPE" to estimate long-term outcomes from policy deployment without extensive long-term experiments. The authors propose an estimator that combines historical datasets from a logging policy with short-term experimental outcomes to reduce noise in long-term outcome estimation. The estimator decomposes expected long-term rewards into surrogate effects and action effects, utilizing importance weights and reward regression. The authors demonstrate that this estimator is unbiased under certain assumptions and has lower variance than traditional off-policy evaluation methods. Empirical results validate the theoretical claims.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents a relevant problem formulation.
- It effectively combines theoretical analysis with empirical results.
- The proposed method addresses limitations of existing approaches and has a doubly robust property.

Weaknesses:
- The estimator relies on surrogate importance weights, which may not be readily available, raising concerns about the impact of estimation errors on the results.
- The real-world experiments are limited to one non-public dataset, hindering reproducibility.
- The synthetic experiments lack justification for design choices and are based on a narrow set of conditions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on how to learn the surrogate importance weights and address the potential impact of estimation errors on the estimator's performance. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments to empirically evaluate how errors in the surrogate importance weights affect the estimator. The authors should also consider using publicly available datasets or provide a rationale for their choice of the single dataset used in real-world experiments. Furthermore, elaborating on the synthetic data generation setup and justifying design choices would enhance the clarity of the experimental section.
