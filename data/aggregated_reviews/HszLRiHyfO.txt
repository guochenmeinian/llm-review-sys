Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Causal Component Analysis (CauCA) as a hybrid approach that combines elements of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Causal Representation Learning (CRL). The authors introduce two key assumptions: knowledge of the causal variables and their relationships, and knowledge of the causal variables intervened upon for each dataset. CauCA identifies latent variables up to element-wise nonlinearity, relying on a single technical assumption regarding causal mechanisms. The method assumes distributions are Markov to a given graph \( G \) but not necessarily faithful to \( G \). The authors argue that CauCA presents a more complex problem than ICA due to the allowance of independent components in any CauCA model. They plan to clarify the differences between CauCA and nonlinear ICA by detailing how their proofs diverge from existing literature. The method is validated through experiments with synthetic data, and the authors highlight that their approach requires only the Jacobian instead of the Hessian, thus simplifying the equations involved.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well-written, providing intuitive explanations of definitions, assumptions, and results, which enhances understanding. The approach of integrating domain knowledge into the analysis is commendable, yielding a strong identifiability result with minimal technical assumptions compared to existing literature. The clear distinction between CauCA and ICA emphasizes the increased complexity of the method, and the comparison of identifiability results with previous work is well-articulated, highlighting the novelty of their approach.

Weaknesses:  
A significant limitation is the unrealistic assumption of knowing the intervention targets $\tau_k$ for each dataset $\mathcal{D}_k$, which may not be feasible in non-synthetic datasets. While other models also make strong assumptions, they can be estimated from real-world data, unlike this model, raising concerns about its practical applicability. Additionally, the assumption of a known graph may limit the method's applicability, and the settings considered are highly artificial. The experiments lack comparisons with more relevant baselines, and the omission of detailed comparisons with nonlinear ICA proofs may leave readers unclear about the differences.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the assumption of known intervention targets, addressing its practicality and implications for real-world applications. It would be beneficial to explore alternative datasets that could demonstrate the method's applicability without requiring access to the underlying data-generating process. Furthermore, we suggest including a separate section discussing limitations more explicitly, as well as enhancing the experimental comparisons to include methods that learn the graph structure. Additionally, we recommend that the authors include a more detailed comparison of their proofs with those in nonlinear ICA in the Appendix to enhance clarity and understanding for the readers.
