Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents OwMatch, a novel method for open-world semi-supervised learning (OwSSL) that integrates conditional self-labeling and open-world hierarchical thresholding. The authors provide theoretical analyses demonstrating the unbiasedness and reliability of the label assignment estimator, alongside extensive experiments that show significant performance improvements over existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper offers adequate theoretical analyses supporting the proposed method.
2. It is well-structured and clearly presented, with detailed explanations of the methodology and results.
3. The experimental results indicate substantial performance enhancements across various benchmarks.

Weaknesses:
1. The innovation is limited, as the proposed strategies—Conditional Self-labeling and Open-world Hierarchical Thresholding—are similar to existing methodologies in OwSSL and GCD.
2. The method presumes a pre-determined number of unknown classes and does not address how to identify these classes, which is critical in the field.
3. Comparisons with other algorithms are insufficient; more recent methods, particularly those using pretrained ViT architectures, should be included, as well as comparisons with imbalance GCD methods.
4. The presentation is sometimes confusing, particularly regarding confirmation bias and the clarity of figures and captions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the innovation aspect by discussing the differences between their methods and existing ones in more detail. Additionally, the authors should address the identification of unknown classes within their method. We suggest enhancing the comparison section by including recent algorithms and methods that tackle imbalance in GCD. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the presentation, particularly around confirmation bias, and to provide more comprehensive captions for figures and tables to enhance readability.
