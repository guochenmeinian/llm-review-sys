### Key Points
This paper presents the theory of neural balance, proposing that the total incoming and outgoing cost of a neuron should be equal. The authors introduce a regularization scheme to enforce this balance, primarily focusing on linear activation functions like ReLU, which may limit applicability given the popularity of other functions such as ELU, SELU, or GELU. The experiments conducted on MNIST and IMDB demonstrate that neural balance can improve classification accuracy, particularly in data-starved scenarios, with improvements of up to 8.4% on MNIST. However, the experimental section lacks comparisons to other regularization methods and does not clarify the computational cost associated with the balancing process. The relationship of this work to emerging AI accelerators remains ambiguous.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The theory of neural balance is intriguing and shows potential merit in experiments.
- The paper is well-written and presents a straightforward proof of the theoretical results.

Weaknesses:
- The focus on linear activations may limit the theory's applicability.
- The experimental scope is limited, lacking necessary baselines for comparison.
- The relationship to neuromorphic computing and AI accelerators is unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including comparisons against other regularization methods, dropout, and data augmentation to provide a clearer context for the results. Additionally, the authors should clarify whether the balancing process incurs additional computational costs and compare results against compute-matched baselines. To strengthen the theoretical framework, we suggest considering information-theoretic perspectives or other angles to explain the desirability of neural-balanced networks. Finally, we advise against using the term "bilinear" for the activation function, suggesting alternatives like "leaky ReLU with amplification" or "generalized leaky ReLU," and ensuring that all terms, such as "BiLU," are clearly defined in the main text.
