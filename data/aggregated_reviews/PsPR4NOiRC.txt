Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a hierarchical generative system for material search, utilizing a language model to convert user input into intermediate textual representations, followed by a diffusion model for crystal structure generation, and a property predictor for sample selection. The authors propose a factorization of the text-to-crystal generation process into high-level text-to-symbolic and low-level symbolic-to-crystal steps, leveraging diverse data sources. The approach is validated through experiments on various material families, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating valid and low-energy structures.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The framework effectively utilizes data from multiple sources, showcasing a reasonable collaboration between generation and scoring modules.  
2. The structural design is comprehensive, incorporating various models and empirical functions, with technical innovations like compact crystal representations to enhance inference speed.  
3. The empirical results indicate good performance in generating structures that meet user requirements.

Weaknesses:  
1. The baseline comparisons are weak, primarily relying on a few-shot prompted LLM, which may not fairly represent the proposed framework's capabilities.  
2. The claim of "end-to-end" is misleading, as the components are not inherently connected or trained together, creating ambiguity in the term's application.  
3. The paper lacks sufficient exploration of the language model's role and potential improvements, such as prompting strategies and fine-tuning.  
4. The heuristic function design requires significant domain knowledge, making the method difficult to reproduce and necessitating more ablation studies to justify heuristic choices.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the baseline comparisons by including specialized material generation models based on diffusion methods or other techniques. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the "end-to-end" claim by detailing how the components interact and are trained. The authors should also explore the role of the language model more thoroughly, considering potential enhancements such as prompting strategies and fine-tuning. Finally, we encourage the inclusion of more comprehensive ablation studies to validate the heuristic rules and their impact on the overall system performance.
