### Key Points
This paper presents GO4Align, a multi-task optimization method designed to address task imbalance by aligning optimization processes across tasks. The authors propose an adaptive group risk minimization strategy, structured as a bilevel optimization problem, where the lower-level focuses on task grouping and the upper-level on weighted optimization of task group losses. The method employs two main techniques: (1) Dynamical Group Assignment, utilizing K-means clustering to cluster tasks based on interactions, and (2) Risk-guided Group Indicators, which balance task risks and align learning progress. Evaluations on benchmarks such as NYUv2, CityScapes, QM9, and CelebA demonstrate that GO4Align outperforms existing gradient-oriented and loss-oriented methods, achieving lower performance drops and enhanced computational efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper proposes a novel adaptive group risk minimization strategy to tackle task imbalance, effectively structured as a bilevel optimization problem.
- GO4Align shows superior performance across multiple benchmarks, outperforming 12 existing methods while maintaining lower computational costs.
- The methodology is well-organized and easy to reproduce, with clear articulation of the primary motivation.

Weaknesses:
- The rationale for selecting K-means clustering over other algorithms, such as spectral clustering or SDP-based clustering, is not discussed; an ablation study on clustering algorithms is needed.
- The choice of group indicators based on task loss trajectories lacks exploration of alternatives, such as gradients and model features.
- The explanation of the proposed method's computational efficiency compared to linear scalarization is insufficient; a detailed comparison of computational costs across methods is warranted.
- The paper does not adequately illustrate the phenomenon of task imbalance in MTO tasks or provide examples to enhance understanding.
- The reported results, particularly from CityScapes, raise concerns about the effectiveness of the proposed weight calculation, as they suggest performance inferior to existing methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the choice of K-means clustering by including an ablation study comparing it with other clustering algorithms. Additionally, the authors should explore the potential of using gradients and model features as group indicators and provide a rationale for their choice. It would be beneficial to clarify the computational efficiency of GO4Align in comparison to linear scalarization by detailing the additional computation required for each method. To enhance reader comprehension, we suggest including examples of task imbalance in MTO tasks and elaborating on the imbalance phenomenon in the introduction. Finally, the authors should consider providing results from more datasets with a larger number of tasks to strengthen the evaluation of the proposed method.
