Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a unified approach using Scale-Space HyperNetworks (SSHN) to model the accuracy-efficiency Pareto front for medical applications. The authors claim contributions include introducing SSHN, which generates weights for models with reduced spatial dimensions based on a rescaling factor, and demonstrating its performance across various datasets while reducing FLOPs by up to 50%. The method aims to enhance the trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- It addresses the significant problem of computational heterogeneity during inference.
- The proposed method is simple and reproducible, with strong empirical results supporting its effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The authors did not cite key pioneering works on Hypernetworks, particularly those highly relevant to this study.
- The novelty of the paper is limited, as Pareto Front Learning (PFL) is a well-explored area, and the authors should clarify how their approach differs from existing works.
- There is uncertainty regarding the model's performance on non-medical datasets and its generalization to unseen scales.
- The explanation of design choices, such as the prior scaling factor and the rescale module, is insufficient, and ablation experiments are needed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the citation of foundational works on Hypernetworks to provide context for their contributions. Additionally, the authors should clarify the novelty of their approach in relation to existing PFL research. It would be beneficial to include a section detailing their design choices, particularly regarding the prior scaling factor and the rescale module, along with ablation studies. Furthermore, we suggest exploring the model's performance on non-medical datasets and addressing how it generalizes to unseen scales. Lastly, the authors should provide a clearer explanation of the computational costs associated with using the hyper-network during inference.
