### Key Points
This paper presents a formalized approach to user simulations in system evaluation, characterized by different objectives. The authors provide empirical experiments demonstrating that optimizing for one training objective, such as maximizing similarity to real users, does not necessarily enhance performance on the evaluation objective. The problem statement, methodology, and results are clearly articulated, with a structured investigation into the complexities of user simulation objectives.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The datasets, methods, experiments, and metrics are clearly described.
- The paper is well-written and easy to read, with a straightforward presentation of complex concepts.
- The authors effectively establish the research question and provide insightful discussions on the implications of their findings.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental component relies on a limited number of agents and users, weakening the results.
- There is a lack of clarity regarding the use of similar systems, as they do not generate interactions that reflect the variability of human interactions.
- Some sections, such as the "Simulated Agenda Dataset," could benefit from improved organization and coherence.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the coherence and integration of the "Simulated Agenda Dataset" section to enhance readability. Additionally, providing more specific details in Chapter 4 regarding the interaction QRFA model would facilitate reader understanding. Finally, addressing the variability in the number of dialogues used for each user simulator would strengthen the empirical foundation of the study.
