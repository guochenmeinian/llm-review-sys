Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on unconstrained min-max optimization with a bilinear structure, focusing on time-varying payoff matrices $A_t$. The authors analyze two dynamics: periodic games and convergent perturbed games, employing three algorithms: OGDA, extra gradient (EG), and negative momentum method. The findings indicate that OGDA diverges under certain initializations in periodic games, while EG converges exponentially with an appropriate learning rate. In convergent perturbed games, all algorithms converge with suitable learning rates. The analysis relies on the eigenvalues of the linear operator in the recursive strategy forms, supported by empirical results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The exploration of min-max optimization with time-varying functions is significant and applicable in real-world scenarios.
- The paper uniquely addresses last-iterate convergence for the unconstrained bilinear min-max problem, revealing interesting divergence behavior of OGDA compared to EG.
- The overall organization and clarity of the paper are commendable, with sound analysis and empirical validation.

Weaknesses:
- The relevance of unconstrained min-max optimization with bilinear structures is questionable, as trivial Nash Equilibria exist, leading to convergence for all algorithms initialized at $(0,0)$. Extending the framework to a more general case like $x^\top A_ty + b_t^\top x + c_t^\top y$ would enhance the results.
- The constrained version of the min-max problem may offer more interesting dynamics, which are not captured in the current analysis.
- Some results lack intuitive explanations, and certain figures are poorly plotted, suggesting a need for clearer visual representation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for focusing on the specific classes of games studied, addressing their applications and potential generalizations. Additionally, providing intuitive explanations for the distinct behaviors of EG and OGDA would enhance reader comprehension. We suggest that the authors consider extending their results to a generalized linear case and explore the implications of the negative momentum method in strictly online settings. Furthermore, addressing the minor issues related to terminology and figure clarity would strengthen the presentation.
