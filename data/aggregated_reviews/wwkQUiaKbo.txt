Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the impact of missing values on algorithmic fairness, particularly critiquing the "impute-then-classify" approach. The authors propose three methods for handling missing features in linear fair classifiers and an ensemble method for non-linear classifiers, emphasizing the preservation of information encoded in missing patterns. Theoretical results demonstrate that imputed data can significantly degrade fairness and accuracy, particularly under the equalized odds fairness measure. Experimental evaluations indicate that the proposed methods outperform traditional imputation strategies, especially in datasets with notable missing patterns. Additionally, the authors present adaptive algorithms that utilize Leveraging and plan to compare these algorithms against FairMIPForest, committing to include new experimental results in the revised paper to address prior reviewer concerns.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant issue in algorithmic fairness, revealing the limitations of impute-then-classify methods.
- The use of mutual information to illustrate performance degradation due to imputation is a strong theoretical contribution.
- Proposed methods effectively utilize information from missing patterns and are adaptable to existing fairness interventions.
- The authors have effectively addressed reviewer concerns, leading to increased satisfaction and improved ratings.

Weaknesses:
- The focus is limited to scenarios where non-sensitive attributes are missing, neglecting cases with missing sensitive attributes, which may be more relevant.
- The paper lacks concrete guidelines for selecting among the proposed methods based on data distribution.
- The technical discussions, particularly regarding Theorem 1, are insufficiently detailed, lacking proof sketches and deeper insights into assumptions.
- No specific weaknesses were highlighted in the reviews regarding the adaptive algorithms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the extension to scenarios with missing sensitive attributes, providing a detailed discussion on its implications. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include concrete guidelines for selecting the appropriate method based on data distribution. We suggest enhancing the technical discussions surrounding Theorem 1, including proof sketches and addressing the assumptions made. Furthermore, the authors should ensure that empirical results clearly highlight the performance differences between their methods and baselines, making the figures more interpretable and accessible. Lastly, we advise stating upfront in the abstract that the focus is on missing non-group attribute input features to avoid potential misunderstandings. The authors should also improve the clarity of the experimental results by ensuring they are well-documented in both the main text and appendix, and ensure that comparisons with FairMIPForest are thorough and clearly presented in the revised paper.
