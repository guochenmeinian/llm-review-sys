Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for learning a generative model over sparse representations of signals, focusing on compressed sensing. The authors propose a training principle that regularizes the prior to learn sparse representations from noisy and compressed observations, utilizing Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). The method simplifies the inversion process by avoiding optimization during inference, enhancing computational efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through experiments on various compressible signal datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach of learning from compressed observations without requiring ground truth data is innovative and practical.
- The paper is well-written, effectively motivating the approach and connecting it to relevant literature.
- Promising results indicate potential for future research in this paradigm.

Weaknesses:
- The comparison methods are outdated, lacking contemporary algorithms that have emerged since 2018.
- The experimental section is limited, with insufficient detail on metrics beyond normalized mean square error (nMSE) and a focus on low-resolution grayscale images.
- The clarity of application scenarios and the distinction between CSVAE and CSGMM are insufficiently addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including additional metrics such as PSNR and SSIM for natural images and providing a more comprehensive analysis of the results. Clarifying the specific application scenarios for the research direction would enhance the paper's impact. Additionally, the authors should consider incorporating more recent comparison methods and elaborating on the differences between CSVAE and CSGMM to guide practitioners in their choice. Lastly, addressing the potential estimation errors related to the measurement y and providing perceptual metrics for reconstruction comparisons would strengthen the paper.
