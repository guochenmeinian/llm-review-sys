Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the identification of the base model of a large language model (LLM) using a unique fingerprint derived from the vector direction of its parameters. The authors propose three invariant terms that are robust against weight rearrangement attacks and introduce a method to generate human-readable fingerprints through an image generation model. Additionally, they incorporate zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) to ensure the authenticity of the generated fingerprints without exposing model parameters.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method effectively identifies the base model.
- The three invariant terms demonstrate robustness to weight rearrangement.
- Extensive experiments across a wide range of LLMs validate the approach.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for human-readable fingerprints is unclear, as the existing vector direction comparison already identifies the base model effectively. The authors' rationale for generating images may compromise accuracy due to potential human perception flaws.
- The related works section lacks references to broader model fingerprinting methods, which could enhance the context of the study.
- The applicability of the proposed ZKP for fingerprints is questionable, as it may not function effectively in a black-box setting due to potential model substitution attacks.
- A formal definition of 'vector direction' should be introduced in Section 3.1 for clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation and necessity for the human-readable fingerprints, addressing concerns about their impact on identification accuracy. Additionally, we suggest incorporating a more comprehensive discussion of related works in the literature to provide a broader context. The authors should clarify whether the proposed ZKP for fingerprints can effectively prevent model substitution attacks. Finally, introducing a formal definition of 'vector direction' in Section 3.1 would enhance the manuscript's clarity.
