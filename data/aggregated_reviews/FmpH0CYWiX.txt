Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method, NU-MCC, for 3D reconstruction from single-view RGB-D images, building on the existing MCC framework. It addresses two significant limitations of MCC: inefficient query handling due to a quadratic decoder and inadequate surface detail recovery. The authors propose a neighborhood decoder for efficient query management and introduce a Repulsive Unsigned Distance Function (UDF) to enhance surface reconstruction quality. The method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on datasets like CO3D and HyperSim, with extensive evaluations and ablation studies included.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively analyzes the limitations of the MCC method and proposes innovative solutions.
- The introduction of the repulsive UDF is a novel contribution that improves surface modeling.
- The writing is clear and the methodology is well-structured, making it accessible.

Weaknesses:
- There is a lack of quantitative comparison to PointTr, which employs a similar anchor-based approach, leaving a gap in understanding the performance differences.
- The source of the claimed speedup in inference is unclear, raising concerns about potential implementation differences rather than inherent novelty.
- The evaluation of accuracy and completeness in the context of Chamfer Distance (CD) is insufficiently detailed.
- The model's performance on unseen surfaces is not adequately assessed, and the potential for a simpler baseline approach remains unexplored.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation section by including a quantitative comparison to PointTr to clarify performance discrepancies. Additionally, it is crucial to elucidate the source of the speedup in inference, ensuring that the novelty of the approach is clearly established. We suggest breaking down the Chamfer Distance into accuracy and completeness metrics to provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to assess the model's performance on seen versus unseen surfaces separately and consider exploring a baseline that utilizes seen points for reconstruction.
