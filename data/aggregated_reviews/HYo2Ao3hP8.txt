### Key Points
This paper presents a learning-based framework for floorplan reconstruction from point clouds, utilizing a novel approach that decomposes complex polygons into non-overlapping, vertical-slicing boxes. The authors propose a bbox transformer and a room transformer for bbox and room regression, respectively, with post-processing steps to integrate the bboxes into rooms. Extensive experiments on the Structured3D dataset demonstrate the method's performance. Additionally, the paper introduces SLIBO-Net, which employs a transformer-based architecture to enhance room shape supervision and manage token numbers effectively, achieving state-of-the-art results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The novel idea of dividing complex rooms into bboxes effectively reduces the difficulty of learning polygon corners from scratch.
- The overall pipeline is clear and well-presented, with key challenges outlined in the introduction for better reader comprehension.
- The paper showcases significant advancements in semantic quality and geometric details, supported by thorough experimental evaluations and a new labeled dataset, Gibsonlayout.

Weaknesses:
- Bbox assignment relies on nearest distance search, which may lead to incorrect matches for irregular polygons. More suitable methods for bbox integration should be explored.
- The regression of bbox corners appears redundant; regressing height and width may suffice if the bbox center is known.
- The use of two parallel transformers instead of a single transformer for room center and slice box prediction raises questions about efficiency and clarity.
- The impact of the number of tokens on performance and computational efficiency is unclear, necessitating an ablation study to explore these relationships.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the bbox assignment method by considering the learning of an assignment matrix during training to enhance matching accuracy. Additionally, we suggest demonstrating the necessity of regressing both corners of the bbox, as it may not be required if height and width are provided. To clarify the use of the cell complex, we encourage the inclusion of explicit explanations and visual aids, such as diagrams illustrating its role in the final stages of the method. Conducting an ablation study on the number of tokens and their effects on performance and efficiency would also strengthen the paper. Lastly, evaluating inference time compared to other methods would provide insights into the practicality of the proposed approach.
