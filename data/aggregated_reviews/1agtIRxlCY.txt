Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of the EPIC-KITCHENS dataset to EPIC Fields, incorporating camera information for most video frames and introducing a novel pre-processing step to enhance reconstruction reliability and speed. The authors propose three benchmark tasks: novel view synthesis, dynamic object identification, and video object segmentation, to showcase the benefits of 3D information in video understanding. Additionally, the authors detail a method for estimating camera poses using existing software (COLMAP) applied to the EPIC-KITCHENS and VISOR datasets, emphasizing the significant computational effort involved, which required 9,056 GPU hours. However, the evaluation of the accuracy of the estimated camera poses is limited due to the absence of ground truth poses, relying instead on reprojection error and manual checks of video projections. The authors justify their focus on EPIC-KITCHENS due to its specific annotations while acknowledging the potential for applying their pipeline to Ego4D videos.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The focus on the significance of 3D information in video understanding datasets is commendable.  
- The novel pre-processing step applied to the Structure-from-Motion method improves reconstruction quality.  
- The computational effort and resources dedicated to camera pose estimation highlight the research's significance.  
- The proposed benchmarks and codebase provide valuable resources for further research in combining geometry with video understanding.  
- Additional results for semi-supervised video object segmentation benchmarks have been included, showcasing improved performance with state-of-the-art methods.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks experimental evidence or statistical analysis to support claims regarding the effectiveness of frame filtering and addressing skew in reconstruction.  
- The evaluation of camera pose accuracy is insufficient, as it relies solely on reprojection error without discussing the implications of pose estimation errors on benchmarks.  
- The focus on EPIC-KITCHENS without addressing the potential for including Ego4D, a larger dataset, is a missed opportunity.  
- The absence of complete code for camera pose estimation and the inability to replicate benchmark baselines hinder usability.  
- The baselines for semi-supervised video object segmentation are overly simplistic, lacking state-of-the-art comparisons.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the statistical analysis in Section 3 to demonstrate the benefits of frame filtering and skew addressing on reconstruction performance. Additionally, a direct evaluation of camera pose accuracy should be included, discussing the potential effects of estimation errors on the proposed benchmarks. The authors should consider providing camera poses for Ego4D to enhance the dataset's applicability. Furthermore, we suggest releasing the complete code for camera pose estimation and the necessary files to replicate the benchmark baselines. Finally, the authors should clarify the reasoning behind their frame filtering approach and its impact on reconstruction performance, as this is currently not well-supported by experimental evidence, and they should test state-of-the-art methods for semi-supervised video object segmentation and provide relevant citations to strengthen their comparisons.
