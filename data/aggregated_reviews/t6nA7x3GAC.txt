Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel diffusion model based on jump diffusion processes to address the challenges of modeling data with varying dimensions. The authors propose a transition kernel that semantically models the jump process, integrating both state values and dimensions during generation. Experimental results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in tasks such as molecule and robot arm video generation, showing competitive sample quality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed methodology is elegant, theoretically sound, and widely applicable to various natural data types.
- The joint modeling of state and dimension is an interesting and novel contribution, supported by thorough experiments.
- The paper is clear and well-presented, with effective explanations of the mathematical framework and loss functions.

Weaknesses:
- Metrics for the molecule task may not adequately address overfitting; a diversity/non-memorization metric is recommended.
- The robot arm example is somewhat simplistic.
- Predicting the content of newly created dimensions with a Gaussian distribution may limit performance, particularly for complex data.
- Fixing $\lambda=0$ towards the end of the diffusion process could be problematic, as it may not allow sufficient time for diffusion in more complex scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation of the molecule task by including a diversity/non-memorization metric to better assess model performance. Additionally, consider providing a comparison with simpler baseline methods for generating varying dimensionality, as this could strengthen the contribution of the proposed framework. Clarifying the rationale behind the choice of initial distributions and the scheduling of the rate function $\lambda(t)$ would also enhance the paper's clarity. Finally, including a perceptual quality metric for the video generation task would address some identified weaknesses.
