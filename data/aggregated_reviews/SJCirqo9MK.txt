### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the challenges of preserving safety during the fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). It systematically evaluates safety degradation across multiple LLMs, demonstrating that certain models are inherently more prone to safety misalignments. The study introduces novel mitigation strategies, such as detoxification methods and training procedures, which significantly reduce safety degradation. Additionally, it explores the role of subspace similarity in exacerbating safety degradation, providing empirical evidence that distinct training subspaces can prevent this issue. However, the paper's reliance on the Perspective API for toxicity evaluations may introduce biases or overlook certain aspects of language toxicity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- Comprehensive Evaluation: The study examines safety degradation across multiple LLMs and datasets, providing a broad understanding of the issue.  
- Novel Mechanistic Insight: The subspace similarity analysis offers a fresh perspective on the internal dynamics of model training, explaining why some detoxification methods are more effective than others.  
- Practical Implications: The findings provide actionable guidelines for preserving safety during LLM fine-tuning, with potential applications in real-world settings.  
- Thorough Methodology: The use of two detoxification procedures and multiple safety evaluation datasets ensures that the results are well-supported by empirical evidence.  

Weaknesses:  
- Limited Generalizability: The focus on Chinese LLMs reduces the relevance of the findings to other languages and contexts.  
- Reliance on Automated Tools: Using ShieldLM and the Perspective API for toxicity evaluations introduces potential biases that may affect the reliability of the results.  
- Resource Constraints: The experiments are limited to three LLMs in the detoxification section, narrowing the study's scope.  
- Complexity in Subspace Analysis: The subspace similarity analysis, while innovative, may be difficult to grasp for readers unfamiliar with the topic.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by expanding the study to include a wider range of languages and tasks. Additionally, addressing the potential biases introduced by automated tools like ShieldLM and the Perspective API through human evaluation or additional tools would strengthen the analysis. Including more models in the detoxification section could lead to more robust conclusions. Finally, enhancing clarity in the subspace similarity analysis with more intuitive explanations or visual aids would improve accessibility for readers unfamiliar with the topic.
