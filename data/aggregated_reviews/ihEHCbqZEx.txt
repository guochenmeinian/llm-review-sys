Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Flex-MoE, a multimodal learning framework aimed at classifying Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients with missing modalities. It introduces a learnable missing modality combination bank to complete missing embeddings and employs a well-designed training strategy and gating mechanism. The experiments demonstrate that Flex-MoE achieves state-of-the-art performance with the tested modality combinations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study addresses a practical issue of missing modalities in AD, which is significant for the community.
- The introduction is well-structured and comprehensible, with a recommendation to use .pdf or .svg formats for figures.
- The motivations for Flex-MoE's techniques are rational, and the ablation and sensitivity studies effectively showcase its components.

Weaknesses:
- The expression from Line 159 to Line 167 is confusing and requires further clarification or illustration.
- The missing modality bank's implementation appears simplistic; a more sophisticated approach may be warranted.
- The equation $R_{(x_j)}$ from Line 199 is missing and needs correction.
- The training mechanism of the S-router, as described in Eq. (3), lacks clarity.
- Lines 204-215 would benefit from additional equations for better expression.
- The discussion of related works is insufficient, particularly regarding other biomedical imaging tasks.
- The experimental modality combinations in Table 2 are limited; more combinations should be tested to better demonstrate Flex-MoE's performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the expression between Lines 159-167 and consider adding illustrations. Additionally, we suggest exploring a more advanced approach for the missing modality bank. The authors should correct the omission of $R_{(x_j)}$ in their equations and clarify the S-router's training mechanism. Incorporating equations to elucidate the content of Lines 204-215 is advisable. We also encourage a more thorough discussion of related works and an expansion of the modality combinations tested in the experiments to enhance the robustness of the findings.
