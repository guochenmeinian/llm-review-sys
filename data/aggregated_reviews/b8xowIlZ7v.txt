Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper explores the advantages and disadvantages of segmentation-based methods for classification tasks in medical imaging, proposing a "segmentation-for-classification" approach that outperforms traditional classification models, particularly in scenarios with small datasets or imbalanced classes. The authors demonstrate that this method enhances performance, reduces susceptibility to spurious correlations, and provides valuable location information, supported by comprehensive experiments across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Improved aggregate performance through enhanced divergence between positive and negative classes, particularly in limited data scenarios.
- Reduced susceptibility to spurious correlations, making the method more reliable.
- Location information aids human assessment of model predictions, crucial in medical imaging.
- Comprehensive experiments covering synthetic and real datasets, exploring various training regimes.

Weaknesses:
- Lack of baseline comparisons against state-of-the-art methods for imbalanced datasets, making it difficult to assess the proposed approach's true value.
- Limited empirical evidence on how the method mitigates spurious correlations; specific mechanisms need clearer elaboration.
- Dismissal of the high cost of pixel-level annotation compared to class-level annotation, which could impact practical application.
- Insufficient clarity in the presentation of results and critical content relegated to the appendix, hampering logical flow.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by adding more baseline comparisons to state-of-the-art methods for handling imbalanced datasets. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on the specific mechanisms through which their method mitigates spurious correlations. Addressing the cost and practicality of pixel-level annotation versus class-level annotation is crucial for real-world applicability. Furthermore, we suggest re-evaluating the organization of content, moving critical information from the appendix to the main text to enhance clarity and flow. Lastly, the authors should consider re-running their results to ensure reproducibility and discuss the implications of network size on performance.
