Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ProgressGym, an experimental framework aimed at addressing value lock-in in AI systems by emulating human moral progress mechanisms. The authors define the problem of progress alignment, formalize it as a POMDP, and introduce a longitudinal dataset covering approximately 800 years of moral development. They propose two algorithms—lifelong and extrapolative—as baseline methods for studying progress alignment challenges, which include PG-Follow, PG-Predict, and PG-Coevolve. Additionally, the authors address biases in historical datasets used for modeling moral progress, classifying them into *Value Bias* and *Sampling Bias*. They emphasize that historical biases can serve as valuable negative samples for the model and detail their approach to mitigate sampling bias by including a diverse range of text types from various sources, while acknowledging limitations in cultural representation. The authors clarify their strict adherence to copyright regulations in dataset assembly and advocate for a value-neutral approach in operationalizing morality to avoid normative assumptions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The novel concept of progress alignment and the incorporation of a temporal dimension to AI alignment are significant contributions.
- ProgressGym is a comprehensive framework that includes datasets, models, algorithms, and benchmarks, providing a solid foundation for future research.
- The introduction of lifelong and extrapolative algorithms demonstrates the feasibility of addressing progress alignment challenges.
- The authors provide a clear classification of biases and articulate how historical biases can be leveraged for modeling moral progress.
- A diverse dataset covering multiple text types is utilized to address sampling bias, enhancing the robustness of the research.
- Strict compliance with copyright and consent requirements is demonstrated.

Weaknesses:
- The clarity and detail in the presentation of the methodology and evaluation sections are lacking, making it difficult to grasp the main ideas.
- The empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is insufficient, with limited discussion of potential limitations and challenges.
- The dataset's cultural diversity is limited, skewed towards English and Western European texts, which may affect the generalizability of the findings.
- The complexity of operationalizing morality remains a challenge, and the authors acknowledge this as a limitation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and structure of the methodology section by providing detailed explanations of the framework components and algorithms. Additionally, the authors should enhance the integration of figures and tables into the text for better comprehension. 

To strengthen the empirical validation, we suggest conducting more comprehensive experiments and providing detailed results that support the claims about the framework's capabilities. Expanding the dataset's cultural diversity by identifying and incorporating additional sources from non-Western texts would also enhance the study's robustness. 

Furthermore, we encourage the authors to discuss the potential biases in historical data and propose strategies to mitigate these biases, as well as address the scalability of the framework for larger datasets. Lastly, a thorough discussion of the ethical implications of the proposed approach is essential to ensure responsible use of the framework.
