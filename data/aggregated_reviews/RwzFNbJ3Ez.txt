### Key Points
This paper presents a zero-resource hallucination detection method utilizing self-consistency of LLMs. The authors propose evaluating stochastically-generated responses against four similarity metrics and introduce a sentence-level annotated hallucination detection dataset comprising 1908 sentences. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, which checks LLM outputs for non-factual statements without relying on external data or output probabilities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses the important and under-evaluated task of hallucination detection.
- The methodology is intuitive, and the dataset and experiments significantly benefit the research community.
- The experiments are comprehensive, including the role of external knowledge and various evaluation metrics.
- The paper is well-written, with thorough discussions of related work and solid experimental design.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset's limited scale and coverage may hinder broader applicability.
- The method's reliance on multiple sampled responses incurs high computational costs.
- The assumption of unavailability of hidden states and output probabilities lacks justification, particularly for LLM service providers.
- The experiments are conducted on a restricted domain (WikiBio), raising questions about generalizability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset's scale and coverage to enhance its applicability. Additionally, consider justifying the assumption regarding the unavailability of hidden states and output probabilities, as this may not hold for all LLMs. We also suggest exploring the use of different sampling parameters for stochastically generated samples to avoid potential inconsistencies. Finally, clarify the rationale for using average aggregation in section 7.2 instead of min/max, as this could impact the interpretation of factuality across passages.
