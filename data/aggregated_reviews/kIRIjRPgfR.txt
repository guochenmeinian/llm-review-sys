### Key Points
This paper presents MacLaSa, an efficient framework for controllable text generation that constructs a latent space using VAE with classification and discrepancy regulation, followed by an EBM for sampling target latent vectors via ODE. The authors propose that MacLaSa effectively addresses multi-aspect controllable text generation, demonstrating superior performance over strong baselines. The paper is well-written and provides clear implementation instructions, although some areas require further elaboration.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is elegant and effectively resolves issues in multi-aspect controllable text generation.
- MacLaSa outperforms strong baselines and is well-supported by experimental evidence.
- The paper is clearly written, with comprehensive comparisons to prior research.

Weaknesses:
- The framework appears to closely resemble LatentOPS and Distribution, with similarities in key equations, necessitating a detailed discussion of differences.
- Insufficient experimental comparisons with optimization-based methods, such as FGIM, and a lack of robustness analysis.
- Missing relevant baselines, including DExperts, Quark, and MaRCo, which could strengthen the evaluation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the differences between MacLaSa, LatentOPS, and Distribution in detail. Additionally, the authors should include more experimental comparisons with optimization-based methods and conduct a robustness analysis, particularly regarding the model's combination with ELBO loss. Furthermore, we suggest integrating missing baselines like DExperts, Quark, and MaRCo to provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Lastly, an analysis of the latent space characteristics, including interpolation capabilities and distance metrics, would enhance the understanding of the model's performance.
