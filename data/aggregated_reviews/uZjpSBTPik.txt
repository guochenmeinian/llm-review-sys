Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CL-NeRF, an approach for efficiently adapting Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to real-world scene changes over time using minimal new images. The authors propose specialized methods, including a lightweight expert adaptor for adapting to new changes and a conflict-aware knowledge distillation learning objective for preserving unchanged areas. The paper addresses challenges such as catastrophic forgetting and conflicting supervisory signals when adapting to new scenes. The authors introduce a new benchmark with comprehensive metrics to evaluate continual learning in NeRFs and provide experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach compared to existing methods, including GNT and DVGO.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The inclusion of a benchmark provides a standardized evaluation framework for assessing continual learning methods applied to NeRFs.
2. The authors effectively address the integration of continual learning with NeRF, representing a novel contribution to the field.
3. Experimental results indicate that the proposed methods outperform traditional approaches in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving performance in new tasks.
4. The provision of rendered datasets generated by CL-NeRF benefits the research community.
5. The paper acknowledges and plans to incorporate relevant dynamic NeRF works, enhancing its academic rigor.

Weaknesses:
1. The assumption that continual learning is necessary for NeRFs is questionable, as NeRFs do not typically require vast amounts of training data and can render images of the scene.
2. The paper lacks a simple baseline approach for the scene change challenge, as rendering images for new poses can straightforwardly identify areas of change.
3. Concerns remain regarding the novelty and generality of the proposed method, with some recent representative dynamic NeRF works missing from the discussion, which may limit the paper's comprehensiveness.
4. The explanation of "catastrophic forgetting" and its implications could be more detailed, and the experimental results are not well represented, lacking clear explanations for tables and figures, with qualitative results not being intuitive.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing, particularly regarding the concept of "catastrophic forgetting," which may require more explanation to avoid misleading readers. Additionally, please ensure that all recent dynamic NeRF works, such as HyperNeRF, Hexplane, K-planes, and TiNeuVox, are included in the final version to provide a more comprehensive overview of the field. The authors should also consider evaluating their method on more real scenes to enhance the robustness of their findings. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of the experimental design, such as the number of scenes and the nature of the data used, would strengthen the paper. Lastly, including discussions on efficient network tuning methods, such as the well-known LoRA scheme, would provide valuable motivation and enhance the practical applicability of the findings.
