Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel three-stage algorithm for hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) in tabular Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), which integrates both offline datasets and online exploration. The authors introduce the concept of single-policy partial concentrability, which relaxes previous concentrability assumptions and effectively connects the sample complexity of pure online and offline RL. The algorithm aims to improve sample complexity compared to both pure online and offline approaches, leveraging reward-agnostic exploration to fill gaps in the offline dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a unique three-stage hybrid RL algorithm that enhances sample complexity in tabular settings.
- The notion of single-policy partial concentrability is well-conceived, addressing issues of distributional mismatch and coverage effectively.
- The writing is generally clear and the theoretical contributions are significant, providing a solid foundation for the proposed algorithm.

Weaknesses:
- Justifications for certain algorithmic choices, particularly regarding the imitation and exploration datasets, are insufficiently explained in the main text.
- The paper lacks empirical evaluations, which would demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed algorithm.
- The presentation could be improved, as key algorithm details are relegated to the appendix, making it harder to follow the main ideas.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the algorithm by providing justifications for the choices made regarding the imitation and exploration datasets directly in the main text. Additionally, including empirical evaluations to validate the algorithm's performance would strengthen the paper significantly. We also suggest that the authors consider discussing the computational complexity of each stage in detail, particularly in relation to established methods like UCBVI, to address concerns regarding the practicality of their approach.
