Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the polarized effects of data augmentation in the domain generalizable person re-identification (ReID) problem and proposes a framework, Balancing Alignment and Uniformity (BAU), to mitigate these negative effects. The authors find that while data augmentation improves performance on training domains, it degrades performance on unseen domains. The BAU framework maintains a balance between alignment and uniformity in the latent space and introduces a domain-specific uniformity loss for domain-invariant representation. The paper presents a thorough investigation of these polarized effects, addressing a critical issue previously overlooked in the literature. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of BAU across various baselines, loss functions, and augmentation types, demonstrating promise in achieving state-of-the-art performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for the work is clearly articulated, highlighting the significant issue of data augmentation negatively impacting out-of-distribution performance in domain generalizable ReID.
- Insightful analysis of polarized effects provides new insights into DG ReID.
- The proposed BAU framework is simple yet effective, with loss functions designed to address the polarized effects of data augmentation, effectively applying alignment and uniformity concepts to the ReID task.
- Comprehensive experimental results, including ablation studies and qualitative analyses, demonstrate the robustness and applicability of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- Major concerns include the generalization of the polarized effects of data augmentations across different backbone architectures and loss functions, as experiments are limited to a specific setup (ResNet50 with cross-entropy and triplet losses).
- There is a lack of individual analysis on the effects of different types of data augmentation, raising questions about the safety of commonly used augmentations like RandAugment and Color Jitter.
- The novelty of the proposed method is somewhat limited, relying heavily on existing alignment and uniformity loss concepts, despite introducing new weighting strategies.
- The paper may benefit from further clarification on the implications of the findings and how they compare to existing methods.
- The paper lacks a thorough analysis of the increased training costs associated with the proposed methods, and some results could be more explicitly linked to the theoretical underpinnings of the proposed approach.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalization analysis of the polarized effects by conducting experiments with various backbone architectures and loss functions to validate the findings across different setups. Additionally, a detailed examination of the individual effects of different data augmentation techniques should be included to clarify their impact on performance. We suggest that the authors provide a more comprehensive comparison with recent methods published in 2023 to enhance the novelty and relevance of their contributions. Furthermore, we recommend improving the clarity of the implications of their findings in relation to existing studies and providing a more explicit connection between the experimental results and the theoretical aspects of the proposed method. Lastly, an analysis of the training cost implications of the proposed methods should be included to address concerns regarding computational efficiency.
