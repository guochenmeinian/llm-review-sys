Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for inferring plasticity rules from neural and behavioral data, optimizing the plasticity rule to maximize the similarity of model outputs to target neural activity or behavior. The approach is validated through synthetic experiments and applied to fruit fly behavioral data. The study highlights the challenges of inferring learning dynamics from complex neural activity, particularly when unobserved neurons influence outcomes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The determination of synaptic plasticity's functional roles is a fundamental issue in computational neuroscience.
- The method, while not particularly novel, is simple, well-explained, flexible, and validated.
- The paper is well-written, with clear descriptions of methods and findings.
- It addresses an interesting inference problem relevant to AI and neuroscience, with thoughtful experimental settings.

Weaknesses:
- Concerns exist regarding the broader applicability of the method to complex problems, especially in cases with incomplete observations.
- The model's non-identifiability and potential overfitting due to lack of cross-validation are significant issues.
- The paper is jargon-heavy, lacking clear definitions and grounding for certain terms and results.
- The tested plasticity rules appear limited, and the implications of ablation results are not thoroughly discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by defining niche terms and providing clearer conclusions. Additionally, discussing the potential for overfitting and the need for cross-validation in model fitting would strengthen the analysis. The authors should also consider expanding the range of tested plasticity rules and providing a more comprehensive exploration of the implications of noise and sparsity in their results. Finally, addressing the limitations of assuming known connectivity based on connectomics would enhance the robustness of their claims.
