### Key Points
This paper presents NormDial, a synthetic dialogue dataset that includes English and Chinese dialogues annotated for adherence to social norms. The authors utilize ChatGPT to generate social norms and dialogues, followed by human verification for naturalness and coherence. The study investigates ChatGPT's ability to detect norm violations, revealing its limitations in this area.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The inclusion of a non-Western culture and a language other than English is commendable.  
- The machine-and-human pipeline for dataset creation is effective, with careful manual verification of dialogues.  
- The experiments on ChatGPT yield interesting insights regarding norm detection.

Weaknesses:  
- The quality of model-generated conversations is questionable, particularly in comparison to expert-annotated datasets.  
- The analysis of the quality of generated social norms is lacking, specifically regarding inter-annotator agreement.  
- Important related works are not adequately cited, which undermines claims of novelty.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the quality of the generated social norms, including a discussion on inter-annotator agreement. Additionally, we suggest that the authors edit the introduction to better scope their claims of novelty by incorporating relevant works such as Kim et al. (2022a) and Kim et al. (2022b). Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide quantitative measures of dataset diversity to justify their approach. Lastly, clarification on how Chain-of-Thought prompting enhances the labeling process would strengthen the paper.
