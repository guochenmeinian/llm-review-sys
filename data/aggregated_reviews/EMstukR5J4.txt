Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents FM-Delta, a novel lossless compression scheme designed for storing massive fine-tuned models in the cloud. FM-Delta maps model parameters into integers and entropy codes their differences from pre-trained models, achieving an average reduction in cloud storage consumption of about 50%. The method demonstrates a higher compression ratio than existing lossless methods and shows robustness across various models and datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research topic is novel and has significant practical implications for compressing fine-tuned large models in the cloud.
- The paper provides extensive experiments and clear statistics, demonstrating the necessity of the proposed method.
- Theoretical results, including Theorem 1 and Theorem 2, offer a solid foundation for the robustness of the delta coding method.

Weaknesses:
- The practical applications of delta compression remain unclear; specific scenarios where this method can be applied need elaboration.
- The authors should compare the proposed method with quantization techniques, as existing studies indicate that quantized LLMs maintain compressibility.
- The writing from the Method section onwards requires improvement, particularly in explaining technical terms like "most significant bit" and "difference range."
- The choice of range coding over other entropy coding methods, such as zstd, needs justification, and the reported compression throughput of approximately 100MB/s is relatively slow.
- Some related works are not cited, which could enhance the context of the research.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of practical applications by elaborating on specific scenarios for the use of FM-Delta. Additionally, the authors should consider comparing their method with quantization techniques to address the necessity of lossless compression. We suggest enhancing the writing in the Method section by providing detailed explanations of technical terms. Furthermore, the authors should justify their choice of range coding and explore the potential of zstd compression. Lastly, we encourage the authors to include relevant related works to strengthen the manuscript's context.
