Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method called PIPS for sampling transition paths between metastable states in molecular systems, addressing challenges posed by high energy barriers that complicate standard Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Unlike traditional methods that rely on Collective Variables (CVs), PIPS employs stochastic optimal control with neural network policies to learn optimal bias potentials, demonstrating effectiveness in generating low-energy transitions across various molecular systems. The authors connect transition path sampling to the Schr√∂dinger Bridge Problem and Stochastic Optimal Control, providing a theoretical foundation for their approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-organized, making complex concepts accessible, particularly the connections between MD, optimal control, and their applications.
2. PIPS introduces a fresh perspective by eliminating the need for CVs, enhancing applicability to diverse molecular systems without extensive domain knowledge.
3. The theoretical framework establishes a credible basis for the proposed method, motivating its significance in the field.

Weaknesses:
1. The transferability of PIPS across all molecular systems remains uncertain, raising concerns about its generalizability.
2. The ML contribution is limited, as many technical aspects, such as optimal control and neural network implementations, are established concepts, potentially diminishing its impact on the ML community.
3. The application scenario appears niche, with a need for more real-world examples to illustrate broader implications.
4. The manuscript lacks sufficient baseline comparisons and statistical rigor in experiments, including error bars and performance variation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of PIPS by exploring its applicability across multiple molecular structures rather than training on single systems. Additionally, we suggest providing more real-world impact examples to enhance the perceived significance of the application. To strengthen the ML contribution, consider discussing the novelty of the neural network architecture and its implications in the context of existing methods. Furthermore, we urge the authors to include baseline comparisons with CV-based methods and report error bars and statistical tests to ensure robust evaluation of PIPS performance. Lastly, clarifying the relationship between the control and bias components in PIPS, as well as addressing notation inconsistencies, would enhance clarity and coherence in the manuscript.
