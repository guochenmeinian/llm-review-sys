### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the relationship between Knowledge Distillation (KD) and Label Smoothing (LS), challenging the notion that KD is a form of LS regularization. The authors argue that while both techniques introduce soft labels, they operate differently, with empirical evidence demonstrating that KD decreases model uncertainty compared to LS, which increases it. The study utilizes four text classification tasks from the GLUE benchmark to support its claims.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper provides a novel perspective on KD and LS, supported by empirical results that clarify their differences.  
- The experimental design is well-organized, effectively illustrating changes in entropy and accuracy throughout training and testing.  
- The findings contribute valuable insights into the understanding of KD in the context of text classification tasks.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks a solid mathematical foundation for its claims, relying primarily on empirical findings.  
- It does not sufficiently address related works, limiting its contextual depth.  
- The analysis could be strengthened by extending the investigation to other machine learning tasks, such as image classification.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical framework to support their empirical findings, enhancing the overall rigor of the paper. Additionally, addressing a broader range of related works would provide a more comprehensive context for their claims. Finally, we suggest extending the analysis to include other machine learning tasks, such as image classification, to improve the generality of the results.
