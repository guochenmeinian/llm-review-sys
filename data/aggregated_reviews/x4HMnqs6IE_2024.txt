Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method called $\text{ID}^3$ for synthetic face recognition, focusing on optimizing the generation process through inter-class and intra-class diversity while preserving identity consistency. The authors claim that their approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, although they acknowledge that accuracy using generated data still lags behind that of real data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Clear explanation of formulas and algorithm flow.
- Achieved state-of-the-art results compared to methods from the past two years.
- Well-written and organized, providing insights for synthetic face recognition.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks analysis and comparative experiments with recent models based on LDM, such as Face0 and DCFace.
- The Face Attribute Conditioning Signal does not effectively demonstrate age and pose variations, as visual results do not reflect these attributes.
- The focus on mathematical derivations overshadows the need for intuitive visual results.
- The performance on the FFHQ dataset is questionable due to its restrictions on face recognition applications, and the dataset's limited diversity is a concern.
- Experiments are insufficient, particularly regarding results on larger datasets like CASIA-WebFace.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparative analysis with recent models like DCFace and others based on LDM to strengthen their claims. Additionally, the authors should enhance the visual representation of the Face Attribute Conditioning Signal to better demonstrate the effects of age and pose. We suggest reducing the emphasis on mathematical derivations in favor of more intuitive visual results. Furthermore, including results from CASIA-WebFace at various data volumes would provide a more convincing argument for the model's effectiveness. Lastly, clarifying the computational demands and scalability of the model would be beneficial for practical applications.
