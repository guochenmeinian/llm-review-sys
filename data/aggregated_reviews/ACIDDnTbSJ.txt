Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive formalization of feint behaviors in multiplayer games, introducing a method for automatic generation using Palindrome-directed templates and a Dual-Behavior Model that combines these with high-reward actions. The authors propose a framework that includes pre-processing to compute feasible feint behavior templates and a learning phase to select proper templates based on action sequences. They formalize feint implications at both action and strategy levels, considering temporal, spatial, and collective impacts. An implementation scheme for integrating feint behaviors into Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) frameworks is provided, demonstrating significant improvements in game rewards through extensive evaluations across various MARL models. However, the authors acknowledge the complexity of their implementation and the need for clearer explanations, particularly regarding the generation of feint templates and the associated time complexities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of Palindrome-directed templates for generating feint behaviors is a novel contribution that enhances game strategy formalization.
- The paper offers the first detailed formalization of feint behaviors, addressing a notable gap in existing literature.
- The structured approach to generating feint behaviors is relevant for MARL applications and allows for a generalizable implementation that can adapt to various gaming scenarios.
- The integration of feint behaviors into common MARL frameworks and diverse experimental scenarios enhances the practical applicability of the proposed methods.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity and consistency in the definitions and notations of key concepts, such as reward functions and the Policy Occupancy Measure.
- Insufficient methodological details are provided for calculating crucial measures, which may hinder replication.
- The evaluation primarily focuses on gaming rewards without a thorough analysis of the types and distributions of observed feint behaviors, limiting the understanding of the study's contributions.
- The theoretical analysis of performance improvements and convergence guarantees is lacking due to insufficient complex gaming scenarios.
- The implementation details, particularly around generating feint templates, are not clearly articulated, leading to potential confusion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by providing distinct notations for the reward functions in Section 4.2.1 and clarifying how these are determined. Additionally, the authors should include a detailed explanation of how the Policy Occupancy Measure is calculated for model-free policies. To enhance the evaluation, we suggest incorporating a comprehensive assessment of the types and distributions of observed feint behaviors, as well as discussing the limitations of the Palindrome-directed templates in capturing complex feint behaviors. Furthermore, including experiments across a wider range of game types would demonstrate the generalizability of the approach. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their implementation by providing simplified versions or pseudocode of the key algorithms. Additionally, we suggest that they include a more detailed theoretical analysis of their approach, specifically addressing performance bounds and convergence guarantees. Clarifying the process for computing feint behavior template candidates in complex environments, such as multi-agent football games, would enhance understanding, as would addressing the time complexity of searches for proper templates to provide valuable insights into the efficiency of their method.
