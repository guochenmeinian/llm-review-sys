### Key Points
This paper presents AURO (Adaptive User Retention Optimization), a reinforcement learning framework designed to optimize user retention in recommender systems facing non-stationary environments. AURO incorporates a state abstraction module within the policy network to adapt to changes in user behavior and employs a guarded exploration mechanism to balance exploration and stability in recommendations. The method is validated through a user retention simulator, the MovieLens dataset, and live experiments on a real-world short-video platform, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing user retention.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a value-based state abstraction module is a novel approach to addressing non-stationarity in recommendation systems.
- The paper is well-structured, providing a clear explanation of the AURO algorithm and its theoretical foundations.
- Comprehensive evaluations across multiple settings reinforce the practical applicability and effectiveness of AURO.

Weaknesses:
- The success of AURO is contingent on the accuracy of the state abstraction module; failure to represent the environment accurately could lead to suboptimal policies.
- The discussion on "poor generalization ability" and "unreliable exploratory actions" in other methods lacks sufficient detail and supporting evidence.
- The paper's use of abstract terminology may hinder readability for those unfamiliar with the topic.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the state abstraction module's limitations and explore potential fallback strategies when it fails. Additionally, conducting more in-depth analytical experiments across diverse user groups would enhance understanding of AURO's performance. Clarifying the novelty of AURO compared to existing methods and simplifying the language used throughout the paper would improve accessibility. Finally, validating the method on additional datasets reflecting varied user behaviors would strengthen the generalizability of the findings.
