Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on data collection for learning preference models, focusing on generalizing optimal design to ranked lists within a dueling bandit framework. The authors explore both absolute and relative feedback settings, proposing algorithms that demonstrate statistical efficiency through synthetic and real-world experiments. They introduce an optimal design solution $\pi_*$ with at most $d(d + 1)/2$ non-zero entries, allowing for a budget $n$ that does not need to be proportional to the number of lists $L$. The work contributes to the field by providing a theoretically grounded method for preference learning, with applications in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). The authors acknowledge limitations regarding the Hessian of the negative log-likelihood in the relative feedback scenario and discuss the implications of using a lower bound for the Hessian.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The problem addressed is significant, as collecting human feedback is costly.  
2. The proposed algorithms show clear advantages over benchmark methods in both synthetic and real-world experiments.  
3. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with relevant theoretical guarantees provided.  
4. The paper delivers a solid theoretical foundation, methodology, and real-world experiments, demonstrating relevance to applications in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs).  
5. The versatility of the proposed approach is highlighted by providing both prediction and ranking bounds.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The application of optimal design in the relative feedback setting raises concerns, as the Fisher information matrix differs from that used in least squares regression. The authors need to apply a correct optimal design approach specific to this scenario.  
2. Some assumptions regarding feature vectors are inadequately discussed, particularly concerning the independence of certain variables.  
3. The manuscript lacks comprehensive evaluations across different combinations of L and K values in synthetic experiments, and comparisons to more recent methods in preference learning are insufficient.  
4. The main criticism regarding the order-wise bounds versus tight optimality has not been adequately addressed.  
5. The authors do not sufficiently explain why the rate cannot exceed $d^2/n$, leaving a gap in understanding the optimality of their results.  
6. The use of the term 'optimal design' may not fully align with the proposed approach, particularly in the context of relative feedback.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the rigor of their approach to optimal design in the relative feedback scenario, ensuring it aligns with the complexities of the Fisher information matrix. Additionally, the authors should clarify the assumptions made about feature vectors and provide a more detailed discussion on the implications of these assumptions. Expanding the synthetic experiments to include various combinations of L and K, as well as comparing the proposed algorithms to more recent methods in preference learning, would strengthen the paper's contributions. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their response to the main criticism regarding order-wise bounds versus tight optimality and provide a more detailed explanation of the limitations of the rate in Theorem 3. It may also be beneficial to reconsider the use of the term 'optimal design' in the context of relative feedback, potentially toning down its emphasis throughout the paper. Lastly, we suggest that the authors clarify how the optimal design in Section 5 is approximated, as this was an unfortunate omission in the current version.
