### Key Points
This paper presents a study of the loss function properties in predictive coding (PC) networks, specifically focusing on the "equilibrated energy" as opposed to traditional loss functions like mean squared error (MSE). The authors conjecture that all saddle points of the PC energy are strict, unlike the MSE loss, which has non-strict saddle points. They support this conjecture through a comparison of spectral properties of the Hessians at theta=0 in deep linear networks, demonstrating that non-strict saddle points of the MSE become strict in the PC energy. Empirical evidence suggests that PC networks escape saddle points faster than backpropagation (BP) networks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is clearly presented and well-motivated, addressing an important topic in energy-efficient computing paradigms.  
- The combination of theoretical and empirical results creates a compelling narrative.  
- The analysis of the Hessian and the nature of saddle points provides valuable insights into the convergence properties of PC networks.

Weaknesses:  
- The theoretical analysis is limited to linear networks, and simulations are restricted to the saddle point at theta=0.  
- Some claims may be exaggerated, particularly regarding the exclusivity of strict saddles in PC networks.  
- The connection between PC and neuroscience is not sufficiently explored, and terminology can be confusing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on how the theoretical aspects of PC relate to neuroscience, possibly including more context in the appendix. Additionally, we suggest exploring whether changing the learning rate for BP affects learning speed to match that of PC. Clarifying the necessity of $\textbf{W}_L = 0$ for the equilibrated energy and addressing the broader implications of their findings for energy-based networks would enhance the paper's impact. Lastly, we advise the authors to be more precise in their claims regarding the nature of saddle points and to ensure that terminology is clearly defined to avoid confusion.
