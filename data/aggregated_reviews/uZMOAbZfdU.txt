### Key Points
This paper presents an evaluation for knowledge graphs (KGs) in scientific research, aiming to guide users in designing KG-based models more effectively. The authors propose metrics for assessing KG performance but face scrutiny regarding their applicability and robustness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper contributes to the field by proposing an evaluation framework for KGs, which could aid in the design of more effective KG-based models. The submission is deemed sufficient for a workshop publication.

Weaknesses:  
The metrics used lack support, making it difficult to correlate KG model performance with specific problems. There is insufficient discussion on the certainty of KG graph edges, as some edges may not appear in all datasets. Additionally, the authors do not adequately address the impact of directionality in certain KGs, such as citation or regulatory networks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the robustness of their metrics to better link KG model performance with specific research problems. It is essential to explore the certainty of each edge in the KG and discuss how this uncertainty may affect the evaluation. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors include a more thorough analysis of the impact of directionality in KGs, particularly in contexts like citation and regulatory networks.
