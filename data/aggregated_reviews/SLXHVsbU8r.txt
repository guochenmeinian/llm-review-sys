Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents UAD (Unsupervised Autonomous Driving), an end-to-end autonomous driving method that eliminates the need for costly 3D manual annotations by introducing an unsupervised pretext task. The authors propose an Angular Perception Pretext that predicts angular-wise spatial objectness and temporal dynamics, along with a direction-aware training strategy to enhance robustness in steering scenarios. UAD builds on the BEVFormer framework, modifying the use of "ego status" in BEV features while maintaining streaming temporal fusion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate UAD's superior performance over existing methods like UniAD and VAD, achieving significant improvements in both open-loop and closed-loop evaluations with reduced training resources and faster inference speeds.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of UAD represents a significant departure from traditional modular approaches, effectively addressing the limitations of existing end-to-end autonomous driving models.
2. The Angular Perception Pretext offers a novel perspective on spatial-temporal understanding without manual labeling, enhancing the method's effectiveness.
3. UAD demonstrates superior performance metrics compared to baseline methods, even without the use of ego status.
4. The extensive experiments, including various ablation studies, provide a thorough evaluation of the proposed method's performance across different scenarios.

Weaknesses:
1. The reliance on 2D ROIs generated by the GroundingDINO detector raises concerns; results using other third-party detectors should be discussed.
2. The design and implementation of angular perception remain unclear, leading to confusion among reviewers.
3. The paper lacks sufficient analysis on the influence of training data volume, particularly regarding the effects of using different dataset sizes.
4. The angular perception design may not be as novel as claimed, as similar concepts have been validated in other works, and the paper does not adequately address this.
5. The paper requires significant revisions to clarify the use of ego status and temporal information.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the use of 2D ROIs by including results from other detectors. Additionally, it is suggested that the authors conduct experiments to evaluate the impact of varying training data volumes on performance metrics. Clarifying the novelty of the angular perception design and providing more insights into its effectiveness compared to existing methods would strengthen the paper. We also recommend improving the clarity of the angular perception design and its implementation details. Including results of experiments without ego status under the BEV-Planner metrics for a clearer comparison would be beneficial. Furthermore, providing more explicit explanations regarding the differences in performance between angular perception and the 2D auxiliary head, as well as clarifying the role of streaming temporal fusion in UAD, should be addressed. Lastly, a more detailed exploration of the model's limitations and its applicability to real-world scenarios, including the handling of traffic signals and other critical elements, should be included.
