### Key Points
This paper investigates the use of large language models (LLMs) for evaluating scientific figure captions, specifically through the SCICAP-EVAL dataset, which includes 3,600 captions for 600 figures. The authors find that GPT-4, as a zero-shot evaluator, achieves the highest correlation with assessments made by Ph.D. students, outperforming other models and undergraduate evaluations. The study addresses the challenges of evaluating scientific captions and contributes to the ongoing discourse on the capabilities of LLMs in this context.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper tackles an interesting problem and provides a new dataset (SCICAP-EVAL) that enhances the evaluation of scientific captions.  
- It demonstrates the effectiveness of GPT-4 as a caption evaluator, particularly in a zero-shot setting.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks novel techniques and is perceived more as an experimental report than a technical contribution.  
- The methodology may be misleading, as the evaluation does not utilize visual input from the figures.  
- Comparisons between GPT-4 and undergraduate evaluations are problematic due to differing scoring scales and insufficient detail on experimental design.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their methodology, particularly regarding the scoring criteria and the rationale behind their choices. Additionally, addressing the lack of novel techniques and providing more technical contributions would strengthen the paper. It would be beneficial to discuss how the visual aspects of the figures impact the perceived utility of the captions more thoroughly. Finally, we suggest including missing references and ensuring that all experimental details, such as hyperparameters and model sizes, are clearly specified.
