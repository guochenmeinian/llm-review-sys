Aggregated Review:
**Key Points**  
The Robotic Exploration (RoboEXP) system utilizes the Large Multimodal Model (LMM) and an advanced memory framework to navigate various real-world environments with remarkable adaptability. It explores and maps unfamiliar areas without prior training, constructing an Abstract Conceptual Spatial Graph (ACSG) in the process. This method allows RoboEXP to effectively perform a range of manipulation tasks, including handling rigid and articulated objects, navigating nested structures like Matryoshka dolls, and manipulating deformable materials such as cloth.

**Strengths and Weaknesses**  
We find the system's ability to operate without prior training and its innovative construction of the ACSG to be significant strengths. The adaptability in tackling diverse manipulation tasks is commendable. However, the review does not highlight any specific weaknesses or limitations of the RoboEXP system.

**Suggestions for Improvement**  
We suggest further exploration of potential limitations or challenges faced by the RoboEXP system in specific scenarios to enhance our understanding of its capabilities.
