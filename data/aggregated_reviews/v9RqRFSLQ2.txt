Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new approach for uncertainty quantification of linear models, introducing a method called ZORRO that over-approximates ridge regression models learned from various datasets. The authors utilize abstract interpretation and develop algorithms for efficient model learning, demonstrating ZORRO's effectiveness in robustness verification and causal inference applications. The work aims to address dataset multiplicity by representing uncertainty in both input features and output labels, extending existing frameworks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed approach for propagating uncertainty in linear models is interesting and empirically constructs tighter confidence sets than prior work.
- ZORRO is efficient in computing prediction ranges and remains consistent across dimensions for ridge regression.
- The paper provides a comprehensive overview of related literature and includes a SymPy implementation for extensive evaluation.

Weaknesses:
- The empirical comparison to established uncertainty quantification methods, such as Bayesian linear regression and conformal prediction, is limited.
- The techniques are only applicable to linear models, and scaling to more complex hypothesis spaces remains unclear.
- The argument dismissing other uncertainty quantification methods lacks sufficient justification, and the paper does not adequately address the limitations of its approach.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical comparison by including established methods such as Bayesian linear regression, conformal prediction, and likelihood ratios to substantiate the advantages of their approach. Additionally, we suggest providing a clearer argument for when the proposed method is preferable over probabilistic inference. The authors should also clarify the robustness thresholds used in experiments and consider discussing the limitations of their methods explicitly in the main text rather than the appendix. Furthermore, enhancing the definition and context around the robustness ratio and providing practical examples of uncertain data would strengthen the paper. Lastly, addressing the questions regarding the choice of features for modeling uncertainty and the specifics of the experimental setup would add clarity.
