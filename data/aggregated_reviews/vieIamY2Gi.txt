Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for training diffusion models to sample from a target distribution, addressing challenges in high-dimensional spaces with separated modes. The authors provide a codebase for diffusion-based samplers, propose GFlowNet-based off-policy training objectives to enhance exploration, and validate their approach through experimental results. The work also includes a comprehensive review of existing methods and offers a benchmark for evaluating these techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles a significant problem in statistical inference, providing a useful review and a unified codebase for the community.
- The experimental analysis is thorough, comparing diffusion-based methods with classical MCMC algorithms, demonstrating the advantages of the proposed techniques.

Weaknesses:
- The results are not overwhelmingly strong, with only one statistically significant improvement over baselines in the modeling tasks presented.
- Experiments are primarily conducted on synthetic datasets, raising concerns about the practical applicability of the method in real-world scenarios.
- The proposed method may still incur high computational costs similar to traditional MCMC methods, and its application scenarios appear limited, particularly in cases where the target distribution's PDF is unavailable.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental validation by including more complex, high-dimensional real-world applications to demonstrate the method's scalability and practicality. Additionally, addressing the concerns regarding the computational efficiency of the proposed method compared to traditional MCMC would strengthen the contribution. Clarifying the role of the VAE in the conditional sampling case and discussing the relevance of the missing reference on variational methods would also enhance the paper's depth. Finally, correcting identified typos and ensuring clarity in the equations will improve the overall presentation.
