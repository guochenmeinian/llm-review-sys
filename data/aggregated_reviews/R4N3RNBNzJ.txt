Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel semi-supervised method, STINMatch, for financial risk detection that leverages semantic information and topological associations through a News-Enterprise Knowledge Graph (NEKG). The authors propose a content-label-topology aggregation mechanism to enhance multi-label risk diffusion and release a new dataset annotated with multiple financial risks. Experimental results demonstrate that STINMatch outperforms baseline methods across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method effectively reduces reliance on labeled data, achieving significant cost savings in annotation.
- The NEKG dataset is a valuable resource for future research in financial risk detection.
- The paper provides a thorough evaluation of STINMatch's effectiveness and the contributions of its components.

Weaknesses:
- The writing lacks clarity, with numerous undefined symbols and a confusing task definition that may hinder reader understanding.
- Key challenges and the rationale behind certain methodological choices are insufficiently analyzed.
- Important hyperparameters and their influence on results are not discussed, and the model framework is difficult to comprehend.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing by providing a symbol table and clearly defining all symbols used in the paper. Additionally, the authors should analyze the influence of important hyperparameters, such as the balance weight parameter Î³, and clarify the task definition to distinguish between risk detection and financial risk classification. Furthermore, we suggest enhancing the description of the model framework in Figure 2 and addressing the rationale behind the use of weak and strong augmentations. Lastly, providing more information about the reliability of the NEKG dataset would strengthen the paper.
