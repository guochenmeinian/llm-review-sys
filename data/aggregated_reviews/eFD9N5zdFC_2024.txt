### Key Points
This paper presents a novel algorithm, Monte Carlo Counterfactual Value-Based Fictitious Play (MCCFVFP), designed to enhance the convergence of Nash Equilibria in extensive-form imperfect information games. The authors propose that MCCFVFP integrates counterfactual value calculations from Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) with the best response strategy from Fictitious Play (FP), achieving up to three times faster convergence than advanced MCCFR variants, particularly in large-scale games with a high proportion of dominated strategies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces a unique combination of counterfactual value calculations with fictitious play, leveraging strengths from both methods.  
- The theoretical analysis supporting the convergence of MCCFVFP provides a solid foundation for the empirical results.  
- MCCFVFP demonstrates significantly faster convergence rates in extensive-form games, especially in scenarios with a high proportion of dominated strategies.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks a detailed comparison with a broader range of existing algorithms beyond MCCFR variants, limiting the performance baseline.  
- Numerous undefined symbols and typos hinder understanding, suggesting the paper was not thoroughly revised before submission.  
- Certain sections, such as the discussion in section 5.2.1, appear accidental and lack coherence.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by defining all symbols explicitly in the main text, particularly $u^i$, $R_{T}^{i,+}$, and $RM$. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the comparison with other algorithms, including reinforcement learning approaches, to establish a more comprehensive performance baseline. The authors should also address the coherence of discussions in section 5.2.1 and ensure that all figures and plots are adequately referenced. Finally, we encourage the authors to conduct further investigations into the performance of MCCFVFP in multi-player games and its sensitivity to the proportion of dominated strategies.
