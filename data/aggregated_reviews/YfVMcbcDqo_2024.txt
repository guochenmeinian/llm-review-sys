Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method that integrates a discrete physics-based loss function to infer the spatial distribution of tumor cells, which imaging data alone cannot assess. The authors propose a model that maps imaging data to a biomechanical model of tumor tissue, addressing inverse problems and enhancing understanding of tumor progression. The model shows promise by learning the unknown initial condition of brain tissue prior to pathology and achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art methods for tumor recurrence prediction from preoperative brain MRI.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method effectively incorporates brain tissue deformation observed in medical images, enhancing the accuracy of tumor growth simulations.
- The model can estimate the brain tissue state before tumor appearance, supported by a loss term that ensures symmetry in healthy anatomy.
- The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of various loss terms.

Weaknesses:
- The comparison with reference [16] raises questions, as it appears that the previous method achieved better results in recurrence coverage prediction.
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion on the "Healthy anatomy" loss term and its impact on results compared to reference [16].
- The experimental evaluation is based on a small dataset, raising concerns about the generalizability of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion regarding the differences between their approach and reference [16], specifically addressing the impact of tissue deformation on results. Additionally, the authors should clarify the significance of the initial condition reconstruction and provide a clear method for its application in identifying post-surgical complications. It would be beneficial to expand on the training dataset size to assess whether better results could be achieved with more data. The authors should also explain how parameters theta_up and theta_down are inferred. Furthermore, in the appendix, it should be corrected to reflect that c_i is used instead of u_i in equation 14. Lastly, the authors should elaborate on the potential limitations of the "Healthy anatomy" term leading to overly symmetric structures, as indicated by the average brain template in Figure 3.
