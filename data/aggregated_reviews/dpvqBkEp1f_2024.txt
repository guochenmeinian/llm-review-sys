### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Bayesian framework, termed Noether's Lazor, for learning Hamiltonian dynamics by incorporating learnable symmetries derived from Noether's theorem. The authors propose to parameterize conserved quantities as quadratic functions, allowing for analytical flow solutions that maintain invariance under these symmetries. The model employs variational inference to optimize the evidence lower bound (ELBO), facilitating the learning of symmetries in various dynamical systems. Additionally, the paper discusses the application of Noether's theorem to model complex symmetry groups and presents a method for scaling variational inference (VI) for model selection, although the details are primarily relegated to the appendix. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method effectively captures true symmetries and demonstrates the ability to perform model selection with VI in deep neural networks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of Noetherâ€™s theorem with variational inference to learn conserved quantities is a significant contribution, providing a fresh perspective on symmetry learning.
- The application of Noether's theorem to model complex symmetry groups is a notable contribution.
- The empirical results demonstrate that the learned symmetries align with ground truth symmetries, showcasing the method's effectiveness.
- The authors successfully demonstrate the ability to perform model selection with VI in deep neural networks, marking a significant achievement.
- The paper is generally well-written, with a clear motivation and sufficient background for understanding the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the paper is somewhat limited, as much of the methodology closely resembles prior work, particularly in Sections 2 and 3.2, which could be more clearly delineated from novel contributions.
- The paper lacks clarity regarding the computational complexity of the proposed method compared to vanilla Hamiltonian neural networks (HNNs).
- The evaluation metrics for symmetry comparisons, particularly the "parallelness" metric, may not be ideal for higher-dimensional vectors, and the absence of variability metrics in experiments raises concerns about statistical significance.
- The assumption of using quadratic forms for parameterizing symmetries is not sufficiently justified, and the paper does not adequately address limitations related to the scale of experiments or the generalization of results.
- The details regarding the scaling of VI for model selection are insufficiently emphasized in the main text, and the paper closely resembles previous works without adequate citation, which may misrepresent its novelty.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by explicitly separating background material from novel contributions, particularly in Sections 2 and 3.
- We urge the authors to heavily emphasize the contribution of using Noether's theorem in the main paper, clarifying its impact on modeling complex symmetry groups.
- We suggest elaborating on the proposed evaluation metrics for symmetry comparisons and addressing the absence of other baselines in experiments, such as Laplace approximations.
- We encourage the authors to include mean and variability metrics in the experimental results to provide a clearer understanding of statistical significance.
- We advise the authors to justify the use of quadratic forms for parameterizing symmetries more thoroughly and to discuss the limitations of their approach in the main body of the paper.
- We recommend addressing the computational complexity of the proposed method compared to traditional HNNs to provide a clearer understanding of the trade-offs involved.
- We urge the authors to properly cite relevant literature to acknowledge the similarities with previous works, particularly in Sections 3.2, 4.2, and 4.3, and to specify what was uniquely contributed to scaling VI for model selection, including the rationale behind the chosen special case.
