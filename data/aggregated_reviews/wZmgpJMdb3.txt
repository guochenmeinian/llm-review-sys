### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to repurposing reference-based metrics as reference-free metrics for summarization tasks by using the input document instead of a reference summary. The authors demonstrate that this method improves performance across various single-document summarization datasets, outperforming non-GPT baselines and achieving results comparable to GPT-3.5 with only 0.5B parameters.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The repurposing approach enhances the performance of reference-based metrics, making them reference-free on multiple datasets.  
- It outperforms non-GPT baselines and shows competitive results against GPT-3.5.  
- The proposed method is sound and the writing is fairly clear.

Weaknesses:  
- The metric is tested solely on one domain and type (single document), raising concerns about its generalizability.  
- The results for reference-based metrics are notably low, and the lack of crucial experimental details diminishes the persuasiveness of the findings.  
- The writing lacks organization and clarity, with excessive explanations and insufficient formatting to highlight key results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization and clarity of the writing, possibly by using abbreviations consistently throughout the paper. Additionally, we suggest conducting further analysis, such as an ablation study, to strengthen the findings. It would also be beneficial to provide more details about the creation of idf in the usage of BERTScore and clarify how the proposed method avoids potential overfitting issues. Lastly, addressing the low performance of reference-based metrics in the results tables would enhance the paper's credibility.
