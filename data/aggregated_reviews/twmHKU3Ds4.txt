Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DinoSR, a self-supervised learning method for speech representation that integrates masked language modeling, self-distillation, and online clustering. The authors demonstrate that these components work synergistically, leading to improved performance on various downstream tasks. The method utilizes a teacher network to extract contextualized embeddings, which are then clustered to identify phonetic units, guiding the training of a student network. The evaluation shows that DinoSR achieves state-of-the-art results in automatic speech recognition and aligns well with human phonetic categories.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively combines contemporary approaches for speech representation learning, showcasing a novel gradient-free online clustering method that enhances acoustic unit discovery.
- Extensive experiments validate the proposed method's effectiveness, with clear improvements over existing state-of-the-art models.
- The paper is well-structured and provides sufficient detail for reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- The originality of the contributions is somewhat limited, as self-distillation and masked language modeling have been previously explored in models like data2vec.
- There is a lack of theoretical analysis explaining why the proposed method aligns well with phonetic units and the quality of the codebook.
- The paper does not adequately discuss its limitations, particularly regarding the generalizability of results to other languages and tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the limitations of DinoSR, particularly regarding its applicability to languages beyond English and its performance on diverse downstream tasks. Additionally, providing a theoretical analysis of why the online clustering method effectively aligns with phonetic units would enhance the paper's persuasiveness. Clarifying the hyper-parameter tuning process and the implications of summing losses over multiple layers would also strengthen the methodology section. Finally, addressing the clarity of figures and tables, particularly regarding bolding in Table 5 and the caption for Figure 3, would improve the overall presentation.
