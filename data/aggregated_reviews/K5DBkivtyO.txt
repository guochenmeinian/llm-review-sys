### Key Points
This paper presents a non-autoregressive diffusion language model (QFS-DLM) for query-focused summarization (QFS) that addresses the limitations of autoregressive models, such as long-term dependencies and exposure bias. The authors incorporate query-document relevance into the loss function, aiming to enhance model performance and improve the quality of generated summaries. The paper reports state-of-the-art results on Debatepedia and PubMedQA datasets, demonstrating the method's effectiveness in generating concise and relevant summaries.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method effectively incorporates query-document relevance, improving performance and potentially applicable to other NLP tasks.
- The paper achieves state-of-the-art results, with summaries that are more accurate and smoother than those generated by competing models.
- It provides a solid mathematical foundation for diffusion models in NLP.

Weaknesses:
- The work is perceived as largely incremental, primarily adapting GENIE, a recently proposed diffusion model, to QFS.
- There is a lack of in-depth analysis regarding the impact of query-document relevance on the model's generalizability to other domains and datasets.
- Limited reproducibility due to the absence of released code and vague parameter definitions, along with insufficient qualitative analysis of results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the depth of analysis regarding the effects of incorporating query-document relevance into the loss function, particularly its impact on model generalization across different datasets and query types. Additionally, conducting human experiments to assess the comprehensibility of the generated summaries would strengthen the paper. The authors should also clarify the novel contributions of adapting GENIE to QFS and ensure that the relevance of efficiency is explicitly highlighted if it is a significant aspect of the submission.
