### Key Points
This paper presents a study using N-RCA with critical-band masking to investigate spatial frequency preferences across various brain areas. The authors explore eight deep neural networks with noise-contaminated natural images at different frequencies, finding consistent bandwidth across all visual regions of interest (ROIs). The results indicate an inverted U-shaped channel, aligning closely with human data for center frequency, though bandwidth and peak noise sensitivity diverge from human behavior.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The topic and results are engaging and relevant, contributing to the understanding of spatial frequency processing in the brain.  
- The findings reveal interesting patterns in channel bandwidth across visual ROIs.

Weaknesses:  
- The methodology lacks sufficient detail, particularly regarding the variable "N" in N-RCA and the selection of the eight encoding models.  
- The relationship between fMRI responses and noise levels is unclear, raising questions about the applicability of the findings to actual human brain responses.  
- The rationale for stimulus processing choices appears weak, undermining the robustness of the study's conclusions.  
- The focus on channel bandwidth may overlook potential side effects on other model properties.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the N-RCA methodology by providing more detailed mathematical explanations and concise background information. Additionally, please clarify how the predicted fMRI responses were measured and report the correlation values, potentially including them in an appendix. We also suggest exploring the relationship between physical distance and perceptual distance in both the brain and deep networks, particularly how noise affects this relationship. Finally, it would be beneficial to justify the choices made in stimulus processing and conduct robustness analyses to strengthen the study's findings.
