Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a meta-learning framework for continual knowledge learning (CKL) in large language models, focusing on dynamically adjusting token perplexity weights based on their importance. The authors propose a new definition of token importance and establish a benchmark, LAMA-CKL, to evaluate the trade-off between learning new information and retaining existing knowledge. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The use of a meta-learning technique to adjust token weights is innovative and well-motivated.
2. The introduction of LAMA-CKL enhances the ability to distinguish between plasticity and stability in CKL.
3. The experiments are comprehensive, demonstrating solid performance and compatibility with existing methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The concept of adjusting token weights is not sufficiently novel, sharing similarities with prior work.
2. The analysis of token importance, particularly in Figure 6, lacks depth; additional insights into attention patterns would enhance understanding.
3. The description of the meta-learning algorithm is unclear, and the method's applicability appears limited to specific experimental setups.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the algorithm details in Section 3.2 to enhance understanding. Additionally, providing a more thorough analysis of token importance, including attention patterns, would strengthen the paper. The authors should also consider conducting ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the learned meta-weights and explore the generalizability of their method beyond the current experimental setup. Finally, a discussion on the scalability and computational efficiency of TAALM in resource-constrained environments would be beneficial.
