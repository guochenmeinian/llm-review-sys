### Key Points
We find the authors' ideas in the abstract, introduction, method, and conclusion to be interesting and clearly explained. The main claim is that a finetuned version of LiteMedSAM, utilizing low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and sampling modalities with specific probabilities, outperforms the baseline in parallel inference. The authors achieved an average dice similarity coefficient of 87.05% and normalized surface distance of 87.77% on the validation set. However, the results and discussion sections are largely incomplete, lacking critical validation results and efficiency metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths include a well-structured abstract and introduction, along with a promising method that demonstrates improved performance over the baseline. However, weaknesses are evident in the incomplete results and discussion sections, which lack quantitative and qualitative results, making it difficult to assess the proposed approach's effectiveness. Additionally, there are several missing references, unclear descriptions of methodology, and typographical errors throughout the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We suggest updating the results and discussion section (Section 4) with new content and validation results. It is essential to fill out Table 5 and provide a clearer caption for Figure 1. Including a table in Section 2.1 to summarize numerical data would be beneficial. We recommend clarifying the relation to stratified sampling in Section 2.1 and addressing the template remnants in Section 2.3. More details on concurrent inference in the CPU setup should be provided, and the README for the code should be improved to reflect the methods described in the paper. Finally, we advise correcting typographical errors, particularly in Table 1 and Table 2, and ensuring accurate environment information is included.
