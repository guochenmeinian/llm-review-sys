### Key Points
This paper presents a study on designing agents for mixed-motive interactions in negotiation dialogues by modifying the standard self-play Reinforcement Learning (RL) technique. The authors propose two variations to enhance negotiation systems: adjusting the reward function to reflect agent personality and utilizing a reinforcement learning partner as a teacher model. The findings indicate that a selfish agent, which maximizes its own performance while avoiding walkaways, outperforms other variants by learning to create value for both itself and its negotiation partner. The paper includes automated and human evaluations to assess model performance and discusses implications for future negotiation dialogue systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides thorough evaluations using both automated metrics and human assessments, yielding academically intriguing insights into negotiation behaviors.
- The study is solid, with the choice of reward function and experimental results grounded in economic theory, facilitating future replication.

Weaknesses:
- The model and task are relatively simple, with short and straightforward negotiation dialogues, limiting the complexity of strategies developed.
- Experiments are conducted on a single dataset/task, raising concerns about the generalizability of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the complexity of the negotiation dialogues to allow for more sophisticated strategies. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments across multiple datasets and tasks to enhance the robustness of the findings. We also encourage the authors to elaborate further on the novelty of their training procedure in the revised manuscript, particularly in relation to the new reward formulation and automated techniques for varying partner personality. Finally, we advise moving important results from the appendix to the main body of the paper for better organization and clarity.
