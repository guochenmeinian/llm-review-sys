### Key Points
This paper presents a deep learning framework, NODE-GAMLSS, for scalable uncertainty modeling through distributional regression, focusing on modeling the location, scale, and shape (LSS) of distributions. The authors propose a unique contribution to interpretable machine learning by integrating deep distributional regression into this framework. However, the paper's presentation quality is uneven, with dense technical jargon and complex mathematical notations that hinder clarity. While NODE-GAMLSS shows promising results in benchmarks, its practical significance is limited by a lack of extensive real-world application examples and insufficient discussion on scalability in high-dimensional datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Novel approach: Introducing deep distributional regression for uncertainty modeling with NODE-GAMLSS is innovative.
- Interpretable: The model’s feature importance and interpretability aspects provide valuable insights for uncertainty-aware decision-making.
- Comprehensive benchmarks: Performance is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showcasing its potential across different domains.

Weaknesses:
- Lack of clarity: The presentation is overly complex and lacks sufficient explanations for readers unfamiliar with deep distributional models.
- Scalability concerns: The framework’s scalability to larger datasets or higher dimensions is not adequately addressed.
- Limited real-world applicability: The paper does not provide enough real-world examples, limiting the scope of its practical impact.
- Insufficient baselines: The comparison to existing uncertainty models is limited to a few, potentially outdated, models without exploring recent advancements in the field.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by simplifying technical jargon and mathematical notations. Including visual aids, such as diagrams of the architecture and examples of uncertainty predictions, would enhance understanding. Additionally, the authors should provide step-by-step guidance on applying the proposed approach to specific use cases. To address scalability concerns, a thorough discussion on the model's performance with larger datasets and high-dimensional data is necessary. We also suggest including more real-world application examples to demonstrate practical significance and expanding the comparison to include recent advancements in uncertainty modeling techniques. Finally, the authors should mention the running time of the method and clarify the notation regarding the vector in R^{2^C}.
