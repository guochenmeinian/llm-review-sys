### Key Points
This paper presents a Federated Learning framework with a mobile server, proposing the Random Walk Stochastic Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (RWSADMM) to address issues of instability and limited capacity in networks. The authors aim to mitigate the non-IID nature of clients' data by ensuring local proximity among adjacent clients through hard inequality constraints. The theoretical and empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of RWSADMM, which is validated against existing methods like APFL, Ditto, PerAvg, FedAvg, and pFedMe.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The introduction of mobilizing federated learning in an infrastructure-less environment is significant.  
2. The RWSADMM algorithm is rigorously developed and its convergence performance is well-proven.  
3. The algorithm improves model update speed and communication costs through dual problem solving.  
4. The paper establishes a mathematical framework that allows the server to interact with various clients effectively.

Weaknesses:  
1. The random walk mobility model is overly simplistic and does not realistically represent wireless ad-hoc networks.  
2. The assumption of stationary clients fails to capture the dynamics of moving entities in practical scenarios.  
3. The proposed setting may not be applicable in real combat situations where long-range communication is absent.  
4. Privacy concerns arise from the need for nodes to receive updates from neighbors, potentially exposing sensitive data.  
5. There is a lack of ablation studies to analyze the impact of proposed components on performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the realism of the mobility model by considering more complex routing strategies for the server. Additionally, the authors should clarify the differences between their work and existing asynchronous Federated Learning literature. We suggest including an ablation study to analyze the effectiveness of the local proximity term in addressing data heterogeneity. Furthermore, the authors should address privacy concerns related to model updates and provide confidence intervals for reported performance metrics. Lastly, expanding the experimental setup to include a larger number of clients would enhance the applicability of the proposed algorithm.
