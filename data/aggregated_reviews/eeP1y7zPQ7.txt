### Key Points
This paper presents a Fast and Robust Early-Exiting (FREE) framework aimed at enhancing the efficiency of autoregressive models through an early exit mechanism. The authors propose a shallow-deep division of the language model, synchronized parallel decoding, and an adaptive threshold estimator to mitigate issues such as low-quality outputs and latency. Experimental results indicate that FREE effectively accelerates inference in tasks like summarization and machine translation while maintaining a favorable balance between latency and accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized and thoroughly written.
- Comprehensive experiments validate the proposed methods.
- The framework provides insightful observations on existing early-exit strategies, potentially benefiting future research.
- The novel threshold estimation approach is a significant contribution.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed method requires modifications to the model and training.
- There is a lack of qualitative human evaluation alongside ROUGE-L results, which may overlook nuances in output quality.
- Missing references and citations detract from the paper's completeness.
- Section 5.2 lacks clarity, with insufficient mathematical explanation or English description of parallel decoding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 5.2 by including mathematical formulas and clearer explanations of how parallel decoding operates. Additionally, we suggest incorporating qualitative evaluations to complement the ROUGE-L results, ensuring a more comprehensive assessment of output quality. The authors should also address the missing references and ensure consistency in their claims regarding GPU usage in the code repository. Finally, we advise implementing `torch.cuda.synchronize()` before model calls for accurate wall clock time measurements and using `time.perf_counter()` instead of `datetime.datetime.now()`.
