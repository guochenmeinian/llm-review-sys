### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive and detailed security risk classification method for large language models (LLMs), offering significant practical application value for security assessments. The authors propose a jury system that combines manual annotation with LLM capabilities, resulting in a large-scale, diverse dataset. The experimental setup is clear and reproducible, demonstrating strong model efficacy and alignment with real-world safety concerns in LLMs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. Complete and detailed classification method.  
2. Comprehensive dataset with a well-defined taxonomy.  
3. Strong experimental results.  
4. Clear alignment with real-world safety concerns.  
5. Thoughtful ethical considerations.  
6. Clear and detailed experimental settings that are easy to reproduce.  

Weaknesses:  
1. Lack of open-source availability, raising concerns about the utility of the claimed effects.  
2. Some areas lack depth, particularly regarding implications and limitations.  
3. The literature review could benefit from a more critical perspective on key works related to AI safety guards and risk taxonomies.  
4. Extensive reliance on LLMs for dataset annotation complicates the isolation of impacts on downstream applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related works section to provide a more critical analysis of key literature. Additionally, they should offer a more detailed justification for the chosen categories in the taxonomy and expand discussions on the implications of their findings for both research and industry. Thoroughly addressing potential limitations and future research avenues would also enhance the paper's contributions and applicability.
