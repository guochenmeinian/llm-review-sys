Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for transferring garment deformations using a neural network (EUNet) that learns constitutive relations from observed cloth. The authors propose that their EUNet can learn constitutive behaviors from simulation data, enabling direct animation of real garments in CAPE. Unlike previous approaches that require extensive datasets or limited analytical models, the proposed method utilizes a disentangled learning scheme to animate garments from a single piece of cloth. The EUNet captures energy-based constitutive behaviors, allowing for improved garment animation through energy optimization. The authors note that benchmarking on simulation data is standard practice in both physics simulation and garment animation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method significantly reduces data requirements by learning from a single cloth piece, making it more practical.
- The theoretical foundation is sound, with a clear demonstration of improved results over previous methods.
- The approach effectively addresses the challenge of animating garments by learning constitutive behaviors.
- The paper is well-structured, with clearly defined terms and a novel approach that separates constitutive behavior learning from animation.
- The use of simulation data for benchmarking aligns with established practices in the field.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on synthetic data for training raises concerns about the method's applicability to real-world scenarios, as real cloth geometries are often unknown.
- The availability of real data for learning constitutive laws remains a limitation, as it is not publicly accessible.
- The energy optimization process can be computationally intensive and may require fine-tuning.
- The evaluation lacks comparisons with a broader range of existing methods and does not convincingly demonstrate superiority over analytical models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental validation by including comparisons with a wider array of existing methods, particularly state-of-the-art techniques like HOOD. Additionally, addressing the limitations of using synthetic data by demonstrating the method's applicability to real-world data would strengthen the paper. We suggest improving the clarity of how their method can be applied to real garments, possibly by providing more detailed examples or case studies. Clarifying the design of the EUNet and providing more coherent explanations of its components would enhance reader understanding. Lastly, exploring the handling of anisotropic materials and self-collision in future work would be beneficial.
