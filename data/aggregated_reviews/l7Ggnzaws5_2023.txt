Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents TradeMaster, an open-source Reinforcement Learning for Finance and Trading (RLFT) platform designed to address the complexities of deploying RL methods in real-world financial markets. TradeMaster serves as a comprehensive software toolkit, empirical benchmark, and user interface, providing access to 13 well-processed financial datasets, 15 popular RLFT algorithms, and tools for systematic evaluation and visualization. The platform aims to facilitate transparent and reproducible RLFT research while enhancing practical applications in the industry. It distinguishes itself by offering a user-friendly graphical interface, automatic feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning, making it accessible to a wide range of users, including researchers and professional trading firms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
1. TradeMaster fills a significant gap between laboratory financial algorithms and real-world applications, offering a practical toolkit for evaluating new RL techniques.
2. The platform allows for fair comparisons of different RLFT techniques under consistent evaluation conditions.
3. It provides a comprehensive benchmark of 15 popular RLFT algorithms, considering the impact of extreme market conditions.
4. The inclusion of a GUI enhances accessibility for users without coding expertise, and collaboration with industry partners bolsters its practical relevance.

**Weaknesses:**
1. The training setup of 10 epochs may not be sufficient for convergence, and the paper lacks convergence curves to support this.
2. The suitability of default hyperparameters for each algorithm is not addressed.
3. The clarity of the MDP steps and the specifics of how to extend the platform with new algorithms are insufficiently detailed.
4. The paper does not sufficiently clarify why TradeMaster is superior to other RLFT platforms.
5. The experimental results and benchmarks may not be comprehensive enough to fully validate the platform's capabilities.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the training setup by providing convergence curves to validate the adequacy of 10 epochs. Additionally, the authors should clarify whether the default hyperparameters in TradeMaster are appropriate for each algorithm. To enhance user experience, we suggest demonstrating how to develop and seamlessly integrate new algorithms into TradeMaster, emphasizing its simplicity and extensibility. Furthermore, addressing the complexities of financial data and the platform's scalability would strengthen its appeal to a broader user base. Lastly, we recommend providing more extensive experimental results, including standard deviations, to strengthen the validation of the platform and improve the clarity of TradeMaster's unique advantages over existing platforms by explicitly detailing its features and benefits.
