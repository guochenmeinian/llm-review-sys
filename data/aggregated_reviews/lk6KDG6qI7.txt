Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of kernel ridge regression with a finite rank kernel in the under-parameterized regime, providing tighter non-asymptotic upper and lower bounds for test error compared to previous works. The authors develop a more dependable framework for finite-rank kernels, which is crucial for practical machine learning applications. The analysis utilizes tools from random matrix theory and includes a detailed comparison with existing generalization bounds.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant gap in the understanding of machine learning algorithms by providing more accurate bounds for finite-rank kernel ridge regression.
- The writing is clear, and the contributions are well-articulated, with careful comparisons to prior work.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation requires improvement, with inconsistent use of symbols and notations, and some sections lacking clarity.
- The paper primarily focuses on the under-parameterized regime, and the technical details of the proofs are relegated to the appendix, which may hinder understanding.
- The novelty of the analysis is not sufficiently explained, and the comparison with standard generalization results lacks clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by standardizing symbols and notations throughout the paper. Additionally, we suggest including a brief description of the target functions and regularization used in the figures within the main text. It would be beneficial to provide explicit lower bounds in the main paper, as this is a major focus of the research. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the technical difficulties in extending their results beyond the finite rank setting and clarify the conditions on the kernel K mentioned in Theorem 4.1 and Corollary 4.3.1.
