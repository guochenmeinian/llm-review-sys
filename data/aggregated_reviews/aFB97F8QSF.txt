Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the fair allocation of indivisible items among strategic agents using truthful mechanisms augmented by predictions of agents' preferences. The authors aim to optimize the approximation to maximin share (MMS) while ensuring mechanisms are robust to inaccuracies in predictions. They introduce a framework called "plant-and-steal," which operates by first allocating items based on predictions and then allowing agents to "steal" their preferred items from each other's bundles. The paper provides mechanisms for both two-agent and n-agent scenarios, achieving various consistency and robustness guarantees.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an important problem in fair allocation, bridging the gap between strategic and non-strategic settings through predictions.
- It is well-written and structured, making complex ideas accessible.
- The results are interesting, particularly the near-optimal guarantees for two agents, which align closely with known bounds.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for studying space-efficient predictions is not sufficiently convincing.
- Most results are limited to two agents, with weaker guarantees for larger groups.
- The lower bound for consistency is not promising, as it does not exceed known results in non-strategic settings.
- Minor issues include unclear definitions and typographical errors throughout the text.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for studying space-efficient predictions to clarify their significance. Additionally, consider expanding the results beyond two agents to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms' performance. Address the concerns regarding the robustness guarantees, particularly in relation to existing non-truthful mechanisms that achieve better MMS approximations. We also suggest reorganizing the paper to enhance clarity, such as moving experimental results to the main body and ensuring all definitions and terms are clearly explained. Finally, please clarify the definition of "success rate" in the experiments and consider alternative utility sampling methods to strengthen the empirical evaluation.
