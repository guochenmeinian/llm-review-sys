### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative approach to harmful meme detection using multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) like LLaVA and GPT-4, which generate dialectical reasoning texts. The authors propose a method that facilitates multimodal fusion between harmfulness rationales and the intrinsic information within memes, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. The study emphasizes the need for explainable detection mechanisms that reveal implicit meanings in memes, which are often overlooked by existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The method of multimodal debate between LLMs is novel and well-justified, contextualizing it within consensus formation.  
- Experimental results demonstrate convincing performance improvements, supported by ablation analysis.  
- The approach provides textual explanations alongside classification, enhancing interpretability.

Weaknesses:  
- The algorithmic contribution appears limited beyond leveraging LLMs.  
- Issues of reproducibility, black box explanations, test set leakage, and generalizability are raised regarding the use of ChatGPT.  
- The introduction's definitions of 'memes' and 'harmful' are overly simplistic and potentially authoritarian.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the visualizations in Figure 3 by including harmless arguments for comparison and examples of incorrect samples. Additionally, ensure consistent notations in contexts and tables. Clarify the relationship between the dialectical arguments depicted in Figure 1 and those analyzed in the introduction. We also suggest that the authors reconsider the definitions of 'memes' and 'harmful' to reflect a broader understanding. Finally, we advise reorganizing the manuscript to include limitations and ethical implications in the main text, as well as providing clearer explanations for the values presented in Table 5.
