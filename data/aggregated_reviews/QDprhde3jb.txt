Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates optimal tax design in congestion games to minimize social costs with partial information, where the tax designer can only observe the Nash equilibrium and cost after tax assignments. The authors propose a non-parametric algorithm for obtaining an $\epsilon$-optimal tax design, particularly for nonatomic congestion games, which is computationally efficient in terms of polynomial complexity concerning the number of vertices and edges.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel algorithm for learning optimal tax design under equilibrium feedback, which has not been previously explored.
- The theoretical foundation is robust, with rigorous proofs and a well-defined algorithm addressing key challenges in tax design.
- The approach is realistic, as it only requires mild assumptions about the cost function, such as monotonicity and smoothness.

Weaknesses:
- The empirical validation of the proposed algorithm, particularly for network congestion games, is lacking, which diminishes the practical applicability of the findings.
- The review of the literature is insufficient, particularly regarding the complexity of MPECs and related congestion pricing works.
- There are editorial mistakes and unclear terminology in the paper, such as the term "boundary tax" in the abstract.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical validation of their algorithm by including simulation results to support their theoretical claims. Additionally, please justify the assumptions regarding the smoothness and other properties of cost functions in greater detail. It would also be beneficial to enhance the literature review by citing works that discuss the NP-hardness of MPECs and related congestion pricing problems. Furthermore, we suggest clarifying unclear terms in the abstract and expanding the conclusions section to include directions for future work. Lastly, consider addressing the modeling assumption of immediate Nash equilibrium reaching and explore relaxing this assumption to include boundedly rational behavior.
