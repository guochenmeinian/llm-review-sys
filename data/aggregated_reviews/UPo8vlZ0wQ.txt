Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of the classical regret minimization problem in the stochastic multi-armed bandit setting, focusing on arms with bounded distributions. The authors propose approximations for the empirical version of K-inf, which is computationally expensive to compute exactly. They develop algorithms such as FMED and FIMED that compute K-inf for one arm and approximate it for others, leveraging ideas from online portfolio selection to enhance computational efficiency. The paper provides numerical evidence supporting the theoretical claims.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work addresses the significant issue of high computational complexity in optimal bandit algorithms, marking an important step towards practical implementations.
- The novel use of portfolio algorithms to estimate K-inf is commendable.
- The paper is well-written and presents a coherent narrative from motivation to empirical validation.

Weaknesses:
- The assumption regarding the no-regret algorithm in the second approximation is questionable.
- The paper may be challenging for newcomers; foundational concepts like MED algorithms should be introduced earlier.
- The claim that KL-UCB requires multiple K-inf computations is misleading; alternative formulations exist that simplify this.
- The reliance on known results from Honda and Takemura (2010) limits the contribution's significance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by introducing basic concepts of MED algorithms before discussing the fast MED algorithms. Additionally, provide a one-line justification for the reformulation of K-inf below line 126 and clarify why K-inf computations occur only O(log T) times in line 112. It would also be beneficial to address the regret assumption for portfolio algorithms earlier in the paper. Lastly, consider elaborating on the analytical challenges beyond existing literature and provide a more detailed comparison with Honda and Takemura (2015) regarding proof techniques and performance metrics.
