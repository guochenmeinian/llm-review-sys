Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new dataset and benchmark called the Vocal Call Locator Benchmark (VCL) for sound source localization (SSL) in rodents. The dataset includes synchronized video and multi-channel audio recordings of 767,295 sounds with annotated ground truth sources across nine conditions, addressing a significant gap in the bioacoustics and neuroscience communities. The authors propose various methods for generating ground truth through playback experiments, including fixed speakers, robotic speakers, and surgically mounted earbud speakers on rodents.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The dataset is well-constructed and original, filling a critical gap for SSL evaluation in rodents.  
- The variety of recording setups allows for comprehensive studies on the effects of measurement configurations.  
- The paper is clearly written and accessible, even for readers without specific knowledge of rodents.  

Weaknesses:  
- The description of data collection procedures and analysis is somewhat lacking in detail, particularly regarding the properties of the vocalizations and the accuracy of ground truth locations.  
- The baseline experiments, especially Task 2 (vocalization attribution), require better motivation and analysis.  
- The paper's discipline-specific writing may limit its accessibility to a broader NeurIPS audience.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the description of the data collection procedures and provide a more detailed analysis of the obtained data, including vocalization properties and ground truth accuracy. Additionally, we suggest expanding the discussion on the relationship between vocalization type and localization error, and exploring the synthetic-to-real transfer quality. It would also be beneficial to simplify the writing to make it more accessible to a generalist audience and to include a clear mention of ethics approvals related to animal data collection in the main paper.
