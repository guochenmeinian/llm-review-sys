Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to future motion prediction by integrating event-sequences with a video diffusion model. The authors propose an Event-Sequence Diffusion Network that leverages the high temporal resolution of event cameras and aligns the model with real-world motion through reinforcement learning. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated across various scenarios, showcasing its potential for applications in robotics and autonomous vehicles. Additionally, the authors provide a comprehensive rebuttal to reviewer comments, including additional qualitative figures and graphs, and express gratitude for the feedback, indicating a willingness to address any remaining concerns before the discussion deadline.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is the first to combine event-based sensors with video diffusion models, providing a unique solution for future motion prediction.  
- It effectively aligns the pre-trained event-sequence diffusion model with real-world motion using reinforcement learning, enhancing motion fidelity.  
- The authors conduct extensive testing and validation, demonstrating the method's effectiveness in complex scenarios.  
- The authors provide detailed and comprehensive explanations to address reviewer concerns, and the inclusion of additional qualitative figures and graphs reinforces the results.

Weaknesses:  
- There is insufficient analysis of the relationship between event cameras and future motion estimation tasks, with high-speed cameras as a potential alternative.  
- The proposed solution leans towards image-based techniques, not fully utilizing the characteristics of event data.  
- The rationale for using reinforcement learning is unclear, requiring a more convincing justification.  
- Some experimental settings lack clarity, particularly regarding the processes in Table 2, which are not well-explained in the main text.  
- The model's generalization to real-world conditions and its computational efficiency are inadequately discussed.  
- There is a lack of specific feedback from reviewers regarding the content of the paper, which may limit constructive criticism.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the relationship between event cameras and motion estimation tasks, addressing the potential of high-speed cameras. Additionally, the authors should enhance the utilization of event characteristics in their approach. A clearer justification for the incorporation of reinforcement learning is necessary. We suggest providing more detailed explanations for experimental settings, particularly in Table 2, to aid reader comprehension. Furthermore, a discussion on the model's performance under various real-world conditions and its computational efficiency would strengthen the paper. Lastly, we recommend that the authors directly address any remaining questions or concerns raised by the reviewers in future communications and ensure that all figures and graphs are clearly labeled and referenced in the text to enhance the overall presentation of the results.
