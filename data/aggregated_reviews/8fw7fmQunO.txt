### Key Points
This paper presents a node embedding method for link prediction that incorporates local positional information by calculating distances between nodes and local landmarks after clustering. The authors provide a theoretical foundation for selecting landmarks based on graph types and compare their method against fifteen others across seven real-world datasets, yielding promising results. The research also explores hierarchical position encoding using landmarks, enhancing node representation with distance information.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized and easy to follow, with clear method descriptions and logical experiments.
- The theoretical analysis of landmark selection is solid and offers valuable insights for future research.
- Extensive experimental validation demonstrates the method's effectiveness and strong empirical performance across various datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for the proposed method is unclear, particularly regarding how it overcomes limitations of existing position-based methods.
- Insufficient experimental analysis, particularly regarding claims of efficiency and robustness, as well as a lack of detailed ablation studies.
- The theoretical analysis in Section 2 does not convincingly justify the selection of high-degree nodes as landmarks.
- The implementation details of the position encoder are inadequately described, and the reproducibility is compromised due to the absence of shared source code.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation section by clearly articulating the limitations of current position-based competitors and how HPLC addresses these issues. Additionally, the authors should enhance the experimental analysis by including results that support claims of efficiency and robustness, as well as providing a more comprehensive ablation study. Clarifying the implementation details of the position encoder and sharing the source code would also aid reproducibility. Finally, we suggest that the authors elaborate on the theoretical justification for selecting high-degree nodes as landmarks and consider testing the implications of landmark distribution on position encoding using a toy graph.
