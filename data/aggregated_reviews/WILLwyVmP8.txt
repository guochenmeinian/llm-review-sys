Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of Concept Bottleneck Models by modeling task predictions as neural selections over a learnable memory of rules, which is jointly learned during training. The resulting model is fully differentiable, allowing for interpretability and formal verification of specific properties. The authors conduct experiments on well-known benchmarks to assess generalization, explainability, and verifiability of the model. However, the paper lacks formal definitions of rules and reasoning processes, making it difficult to substantiate claims of soundness and interpretability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Novel and interesting extension of Concept Bottleneck Models.
- Combines neural and symbolic approaches for rule learning and concept prediction.
- Wide experimentation on several benchmarks.
- Clarity of presentation.

Weaknesses:
- No comparison with other neural-symbolic systems.
- Informal references to rules and reasoning without clear definitions.
- Limited experimental analysis and unclear claims regarding verification and interpretability.
- The notation used is not formalized, complicating understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the formalization of rules and reasoning processes to substantiate claims of soundness and interpretability. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with other neural-symbolic systems to highlight the advantages of the proposed approach. Clarifying the origin and validity of rules in the rulebook, as well as providing examples, would enhance understanding. The authors should also address the scalability of their method to complex datasets and clarify how the optimal number of rules is determined. Finally, we urge the authors to discuss potential negative societal impacts of their work more thoroughly.
