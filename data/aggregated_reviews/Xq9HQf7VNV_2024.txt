Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel posterior sampling algorithm for solving inverse problems using diffusion models, specifically through the Split Gibbs Sampling (SGS) approach. The authors introduce an extended distribution that allows for efficient sampling of both the prior and likelihood, leveraging the generative capabilities of diffusion models. The method is validated on various linear and nonlinear inverse problems, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods. Additionally, the authors propose to enhance their manuscript by including a detailed comparison with Coeurdoux et al. and an extended theoretical analysis featuring an approximate score function.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is original and clever, providing theoretical guarantees while maintaining manageable memory requirements.
- The writing is clear and detailed, facilitating understanding of complex concepts.
- The experimental section is robust, including a toy example and rigorous evaluations across diverse imaging problems.
- The authors demonstrate a willingness to improve their work by addressing feedback and clarifying key aspects of their theoretical framework.

Weaknesses:
- The computational cost of the proposed method is not adequately addressed, and a runtime comparison with existing methods is lacking.
- The originality of the method is questioned due to similarities with existing approaches, particularly SDEdit, which should be acknowledged.
- The impact of various parameters, such as the annealing schedule for the coupling parameter ρ, on performance is not sufficiently explored.
- The manuscript lacks a comprehensive comparison with existing literature, specifically Coeurdoux et al., and does not provide an extended theoretical analysis with an approximate score function.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on computational costs by including a proper runtime comparison with existing methods. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explicitly acknowledge the similarities with SDEdit and other related works to clarify the novelty of their contribution. A sensitivity analysis regarding the annealing schedule for the coupling parameter ρ would also enhance the understanding of the method's robustness. Furthermore, we recommend incorporating a more detailed comparison with Coeurdoux et al. and extending the theoretical analysis to include an approximate score function. It should also be made clear that the theory is only applicable with a fixed ρ parameter. Finally, providing more theoretical insights into the convergence of the proposed Gibbs Sampler with approximate scores would be beneficial.
