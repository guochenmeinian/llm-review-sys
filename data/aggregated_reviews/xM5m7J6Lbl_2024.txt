Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper defines social Markov decision processes (SMDPs) as a generalization of MDPs that incorporates a population of individuals with distinct utility profiles aggregated by a social welfare function. The authors propose a novel quantitative definition of alignment and characterize probably approximately aligned (PAA) and safe policies, proving conditions for their existence and relating them to the accuracy of the reward model. The work aims to ensure AI agents' actions are predictable and safe, particularly in critical decision-making contexts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written, with clear background and rigorous definitions.
2. It effectively relates the probability of aligned behavior to world model accuracy, which is valuable.
3. The discussion of limitations is thorough, addressing theoretical conditions under which PAA and safe policies may be unreliable.

Weaknesses:
1. The practical approach of safeguarding a black-box policy may have severe limitations, and the paper lacks a discussion on the computational complexity of computing $\mathcal{A}_{safe}$ for an SMDP.
2. The abstract nature of the work does not provide a clear idea of its practical utility, and an experimental section could enhance understanding of world model accuracy and the benefits of PAA/safe policies.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the feasibility of safeguarding methods, particularly by addressing the computational complexity of $\mathcal{A}_{safe}$. Additionally, including examples of real-world applications for the safeguarding method, such as in autonomous vehicles or healthcare, would enhance the paper's practical relevance. Providing a roadmap with detailed steps for implementing the safeguarding method in real-world systems would also be beneficial.
