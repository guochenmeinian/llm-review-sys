Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents PARNI-DAG, a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for Bayesian structure learning on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) under observational data. The authors build upon the PARNI sampler, introducing enhancements such as a warm-start procedure for sampler parameters, a reversal neighborhood step, and adaptive neighborhood skipping to improve scalability and mixing properties. The paper details the problem setup, baseline algorithms, and the proposed modifications, demonstrating advantages over existing methods through empirical experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a solid proposal for improvements in Bayesian network inference, covering recent developments in Bayesian machine learning.
- It is detailed enough for a diverse audience, from beginners to experts, to understand the historical context and advancements in the field.
- The provision of code facilitates further research, marking a significant contribution.

Weaknesses:
- The claims regarding the mixing time analysis of the proposed MCMC algorithm are somewhat unclear, leading to potential misconceptions.
- The paper appears to adapt existing techniques from the PARNI method without sufficiently distinguishing its novel contributions.
- Empirical results primarily compare PARNI-DAG with MCMC methods, lacking comparisons to state-of-the-art Bayesian structure learning approaches.
- Limitations regarding the linear model assumptions and computational complexity are not adequately discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their claims regarding the mixing time analysis of the proposed MCMC algorithm, addressing how existing results apply to their method and whether theoretical analysis is needed. Additionally, we suggest reorganizing the paper to clearly delineate the novel contributions of PARNI-DAG compared to existing methods. Including comparisons with state-of-the-art Bayesian structure learning approaches would strengthen the empirical validation. Finally, we encourage the authors to explicitly discuss the limitations related to the linear model assumptions and the computational complexity of their method.
