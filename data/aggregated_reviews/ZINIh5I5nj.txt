### Key Points
This paper presents a novel association refining and compositional contrasting (ARCC) framework aimed at addressing the author name disambiguation (AND) task. The authors propose a two-stage process that includes association refinement to reduce uncertainties and a contrastive learning approach to enhance representation learning. The methodology is evaluated against benchmark datasets, demonstrating improved F1 scores compared to existing methods. The rationale is sound, and the paper is well-structured and clear.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The problem addressed is significant and relevant to bibliographic databases.
2. The proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art systems.
3. The paper is well-written, and the experiments are appropriately designed.
4. The authors conduct ablation studies to analyze the effectiveness of various components.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper contains several typographical errors that need correction.
2. Important existing works are not sufficiently considered in the related works section and experimentation.
3. The number of hyperparameters is large, complicating grid search and diminishing applicability.
4. The impact of uncertainties in the paper association graph and the effectiveness of the proposed refinements require further analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by addressing the typographical errors identified, such as correcting "textural" to "textual" and "infromation" to "information." Additionally, the authors should compare their method with more baselines, including SND-all from the WhoIsWho benchmark, and consider conducting an ablation study to assess the impact of their proposed heuristics for initial graph refinement. It would also be beneficial to provide a more detailed description of the datasets used, including their provenance and the demographics of the authors involved. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors clarify the optimization techniques used in their methodology and the rationale behind their choice of evaluation metrics, particularly regarding the trade-off between precision and recall.
