Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an adaptation of the Douglas-Rachford splitting to efficiently solve a variety of sparsely-regularized optimal transport (OT) problems using GPU-parallelizable operations. The authors propose to handle regularized OT problems with sparsity-inducing penalties, prove global convergence of the method, and establish an accelerated local linear rate once the support is identified. Additionally, they provide GPU kernels for common regularizers (quadratic, group lasso) that achieve low-cost per iteration.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well-written, with an exhaustive literature review that correctly cites relevant references. The subject matter is critical for the broader adoption of OT in large-scale problems. The supplementary materials effectively enhance reproducibility and clarify the kernel implementation details. The introduction of convex regularization within the DR algorithm is novel, offering computational and theoretical benefits.

Weaknesses:  
The experimental section requires improvement; specifically, the authors should utilize the Benchopt tool for benchmarking, as it provides reproducible benchmarks and convergence curves. A comparison of RDROT to L-BFGS using Benchopt would be more impactful than the current figures. Furthermore, the authors should favor real-world datasets over simulated cost matrices to demonstrate the robustness of their method. The theoretical aspects need clarification, particularly regarding the convergence rates and assumptions. The empirical comparisons with existing methods, such as Sinkhorn divergences, are insufficiently justified and should be addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by incorporating the Benchopt tool for benchmarking and providing a comparative figure of RDROT against L-BFGS. Additionally, favoring real-world datasets in the quadratic regularization and Group Lasso sections would strengthen the paper. Clarifying the theoretical aspects, particularly the convergence rates and assumptions, is essential. We also suggest including a comparison with Sinkhorn-based algorithms to better position the work within the literature. Lastly, addressing the citation of foundational works, such as the 2014 paper on the DROT methodology, is crucial for proper attribution.
