### Key Points
This paper presents a method for cross-domain sentiment analysis that aligns domain-specific distributions in a shared embedding space and induces larger margins between classes using an intermediate multi-modal Gaussian mixture model (GMM) distribution. The authors propose learning a parametric distribution for the source domain and aligning it with the target distribution using confident samples to mitigate the domain gap. The paper includes both theoretical and empirical analyses to support the effectiveness of the proposal.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The idea of using a GMM to align different domain distributions is interesting and theoretically sound.
- The proposed method shows promising improvements over baselines when using traditional text features like tf-idf.
- The paper provides a thorough theoretical framework and empirical analysis.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed method is less competitive when using advanced pretrained models like BERT, as it only achieves comparable results to existing methods.
- The writing is difficult to understand, and some figures are unreadable.
- The paper lacks recent references, raising concerns about the relevance of some claims.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing and ensure that figures are legible by using more space. Additionally, the authors should enrich the references with studies published after 2020 to support their claims. We suggest that the authors clarify the distinction between the introduction and related work sections to better highlight the contributions of the paper. Furthermore, addressing minor grammatical errors and ensuring the accuracy of the experimental results, particularly regarding BERT reimplementations, would strengthen the paper.
