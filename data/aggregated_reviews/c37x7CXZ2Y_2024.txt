Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a two-stage framework for estimating Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATEs) by integrating observational data with weak instrumental variables (IV). The method addresses challenges posed by unobserved confounding and low compliance, initially estimating biased CATEs from observational data and subsequently applying a compliance-weighted correction using IV data. The authors validate their approach through simulations and real-world applications, notably assessing the impact of 401(k) participation on financial wealth.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel method that effectively combines observational data with weak IVs to estimate CATEs.
- It demonstrates the ability to handle unobserved confounding and low compliance, including scenarios with zero compliance for certain subgroups.
- The exposition is clear, and the theoretical results are insightful, supported by simulations and real-world data.

Weaknesses:
- The relevance assumption in Assumption 1 does not guarantee $\gamma(x)>0$, raising concerns about the identification of CATE.
- The paper does not adequately address scenarios where $\mathbb{E}[A^E \mid Z^E=1, X^E=x] - \mathbb{E}[A^E \mid Z^E=0, X^E=x] = 0$, which could undermine the soundness of the assumptions.
- There is a lack of baseline comparisons in the empirical results, particularly against debiased CATE estimation methods.
- The treatment of IV datasets and the random assignment of treatment in experimental data require clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the assumptions, particularly regarding the identification of CATE and the implications of Assumption 1. It is crucial to provide a complete proof of identifiability for Eq.(3) and to clarify the treatment of IV datasets. Additionally, we suggest including baseline comparisons with existing methods in the empirical results to strengthen the paper's contributions. Finally, addressing the potential impact of smaller sample sizes in IV studies and exploring high-dimensional settings would enhance the robustness of the findings.
