Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents NEST, a semi-parametric language modeling approach that integrates real-world text spans into language model generations, enhancing both generation quality and attribution. The authors propose a two-step k-NN search and speculative decoding, which improves performance and reduces inference time. NEST outperforms conventional kNN-LM and competes effectively with in-context retrieval methods across various tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in speed and efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The extensive experiments across tasks and datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach over standard LLM decoding and retrieval-augmented methods.
- The introduction of a novel semi-parametric technique enhances attribution and generation quality.
- The two-stage k-NN search optimally balances search accuracy and efficiency, providing direct attribution to sources, which enhances reliability.

Weaknesses:
- The performance heavily relies on the accuracy of both the first-stage passage retrieval and second-stage token retrieval, which may complicate practical deployment.
- The paper lacks a detailed comparison with state-of-the-art methods and does not thoroughly discuss the generalizability of NEST across different domains and languages.
- It is unclear what the most impactful contributions of the work are, leading to low confidence in the novelty of the approach.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by explicitly stating the most significant contributions and their impact on results. Additionally, a more comprehensive comparison with advanced language models and a detailed analysis of error rates and statistical significance would strengthen the work. We suggest that the authors address scalability concerns and the potential biases in retrieved text spans, as well as provide insights into the decision-making process behind hyperparameter choices. Finally, moving the ablation study to the main text could enhance clarity regarding the contributions of different techniques to performance improvements.
