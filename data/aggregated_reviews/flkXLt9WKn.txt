### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework for modeling conversations through multi-step reasoning using large language models (LLMs). The authors propose a three-step process that includes extracting implicit question-answer pairs, filtering for consistency, and training a conversational model to generate dialogues. They utilize counterfactual rationales and dialogue comprehension datasets, such as the Donut dataset, to enhance response generation. The framework demonstrates significant improvements over baseline approaches, particularly in common-sense reasoning across multiple conversational turns.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The framework is novel and applicable to nuanced conversations, improving competitive baseline approaches.
- The paper is well-written, clear, and easy to follow, with robust evaluations of the Donut dataset.
- The proposed Doctor framework shows strong empirical performance across multiple dialogue datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The abstract lacks a summary of percentage improvements.
- There is insufficient clarity on the applicability of certain approaches for commonsense reasoning.
- The critic model's training instance requirements and the number of rationales needed for generating relevant responses are not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the abstract by summarizing the percentage improvements achieved. Additionally, the authors should clarify why certain approaches are not applicable for commonsense reasoning and provide a detailed analysis of the training instances required for the critic model. It would also be beneficial to explore semantic-based scoring approaches, such as BleuBERT, to enhance evaluation metrics. Lastly, the conclusion should summarize the main contributions and improvements more effectively.
