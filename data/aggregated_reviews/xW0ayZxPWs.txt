Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents fair graph distillation (FGD), an advanced approach aimed at generating fair distilled graphs while addressing group fairness issues in graph distillation methods. The authors propose a novel metric for measuring bias in representation space, termed coherence, and introduce a bi-level optimization framework for iterative fair graph distillation. Experimental results demonstrate that FGD achieves performance-fairness trade-offs across various datasets and architectures.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses the novel issue of group fairness in graph distillation.
- The coherence metric for bias measurement is both simple and effective.
- Theorems and algorithms are well-presented, and the theoretical analysis is solid.
- Experimental results validate the effectiveness of FGD in reducing bias while maintaining model utility.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks sufficient baseline comparisons with other graph distillation methods, such as *FairGNN* and *EDITS*.
- Significant drops in AUC performance (e.g., from 94% to 70%) in some experiments are concerning for node classification.
- The methodology primarily relies on previously developed strategies, making the contribution appear incremental.
- The time and space complexity of the proposed algorithm is not discussed.
- Some terminology requires clearer definitions for better understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by incorporating more baseline comparisons with established graph distillation methods. Additionally, the authors should clarify the coherence loss design to address potential confusion and ensure rigorous justification of the theoretical components. It would be beneficial to provide a discussion on the applicability of FGD to multi-class cases and other graph-level tasks beyond node classification. Furthermore, the authors should include details on the computational complexity of the algorithm and enhance the presentation by defining key terms more clearly.
