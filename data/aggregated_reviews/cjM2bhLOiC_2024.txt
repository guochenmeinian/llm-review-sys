Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Implicit Regularization Enhancement (IRE) framework aimed at accelerating the convergence of optimization algorithms towards flat minima in deep learning, thereby improving generalization and convergence. The authors propose decoupling the dynamics along flat and sharp directions, enhancing the implicit sharpness reduction of base optimizers without compromising stability. Empirical results across various tasks demonstrate that IRE consistently improves generalization performance and achieves a 2x speedup compared to a well-tuned AdamW optimizer in pre-training Llama language models. The paper also provides theoretical guarantees showing that IRE can accelerate the minimization of the Hessian trace, indicating the flatness of the loss landscape.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The originality of the IRE framework, which creatively decouples optimization dynamics, is a notable contribution.
- IRE integrates efficiently with existing optimizers, enhancing their performance without significant computational overhead.
- Extensive empirical results support the effectiveness of IRE across multiple tasks, particularly in improving convergence speed in large language models.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for IRE relies heavily on a stylized example, which may not generalize well to real-world deep learning scenarios.
- Improvements in performance metrics are not as significant as anticipated, raising concerns about IRE's utility for certain architectures like CNNs.
- The experimental setup lacks detailed information on hyperparameter tuning and model architectures, which could hinder reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion comparing IRE with related works to better highlight its novelty and advantages. Additionally, a more in-depth analysis of potential limitations and failure cases of IRE should be included, particularly regarding the effectiveness of the diagonal Hessian approximation and sensitivity to hyperparameters. 

Furthermore, we suggest enhancing the description of the experimental setup by including key details such as hyperparameter tuning ranges and model architectures in the main text. To fully assess IRE's significance, comparisons with a broader range of state-of-the-art optimizers and regularization techniques should be conducted. Lastly, evaluating the downstream performance of models trained with IRE on benchmark tasks would provide valuable insights into its practical impact.
