Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for inference-stage backdoor detection, focusing on identifying poisoned samples using the Mahalanobis distance as a scoring function. The authors leverage the conformal prediction framework to establish a statistical threshold for detection, ensuring a controlled false positive rate. The proposed method is validated through extensive experiments across multiple datasets in both computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) domains, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods. Additionally, the authors provide a comprehensive analysis of backdoor defenses against various types of attacks, emphasizing the importance of adaptive attacker results. They incorporate several contemporary latent-space adaptive backdoor attacks into their evaluation, including TacT, Adaptive Blend, and Adaptive Patch, along with their own devised M-attack. The authors acknowledge the significance of Gaussian assumptions in their theoretical framework and commit to clarifying these aspects in the revised paper.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors formally address the inference-stage backdoor detection problem and propose the conformal backdoor detection (CBD) framework, which maintains a high probability of the detector's false positive rate (FPR) being close to a pre-selected value.
2. The theoretical analysis of the optimal score function is complemented by a practical proxy, addressing numerical stability through matrix shrinkage techniques.
3. The extensive experimental setup, including diverse datasets and attacks, effectively showcases the generalizability of the method.
4. The authors have engaged thoroughly with reviewer feedback and provided additional experimental details, enhancing the clarity of their work.
5. A broad range of adaptive attacks has been tested, demonstrating a commitment to comprehensive evaluation.

Weaknesses:
1. The title does not accurately reflect the focus on inference-stage backdoor input detection rather than defenses, and the term "unified" may overstate the scope of the theoretical analysis.
2. The intuitions behind the empirical Mahalanobis distance as a proxy to the optimal score function are not clearly articulated, leading to confusion regarding its derivation.
3. The experimental comparisons lack a broader range of baseline defenses and attacks, particularly recent methods like SPECTRE and adaptive attacks specifically targeting the proposed detection approach.
4. Additional ablation studies are needed to explore the impact of validation data size, the effect of out-of-distribution validation data, and potential adaptive attacks against the proposed method.
5. There remains a lingering concern regarding the Gaussian assumptions and their implications for the theoretical results.
6. The need for clearer comparisons between different threat models and their impact on the significance of the work has been highlighted.
7. Several typographical errors are present throughout the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the title to more accurately reflect the focus on inference-stage backdoor input detection and consider toning down the term "unified." Additionally, the authors should clarify the rationale behind using the empirical Mahalanobis distance as a proxy for the optimal score function. Expanding the experimental comparisons to include more baseline defenses and adaptive attacks will strengthen the evaluation. We also suggest conducting further ablation studies on the number of validation samples required for effective defense, the robustness of the method against out-of-distribution data, and the exploration of adaptive attacks targeting the weaknesses of their approach. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors clarify the implications of the Gaussian assumptions in their theoretical framework and ensure that the narrative accurately reflects the significance of these assumptions. Finally, the authors should correct the identified typographical errors to enhance the paper's clarity.
