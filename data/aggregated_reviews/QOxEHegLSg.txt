### Key Points
This paper presents DyG-MF, a dynamic graph clustering framework that utilizes a novel approach to matrix factorization to address scalability, robustness, and efficiency in clustering large-scale, noisy, real-world dynamic graphs. The authors propose three main strategies: Temporal Separated Matrix Factorization (TSMF), Bi-clustering Regularization (BR), and Selective Embedding Updating (SEU). The experimental results demonstrate that DyG-MF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in clustering quality and scalability, although the improvements are not substantial across all metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The integration of TSMF, BR, and SEU effectively enhances clustering performance and addresses key challenges in dynamic graph clustering.
2. The experimental validation across synthetic and real-world datasets showcases DyG-MF's scalability and robustness, with results indicating significant improvements over existing methods.
3. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it accessible to readers.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper primarily relies on the K-means clustering algorithm without discussing or comparing other potential clustering algorithms, which limits the exploration of alternatives.
2. The scalability claims lack sufficient evidence from experiments on very large, complex datasets, particularly those with millions of nodes and edges.
3. The theoretical justification for certain terms in the methodology, such as "topological changes" and "relative positions shift," is not adequately supported.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the conceptual framework by emphasizing a key selling point of DyG-MF over previous work, particularly one metric where it excels. Additionally, we suggest providing formal definitions for concepts mentioned in theorems, such as "embedding consistency" and "bi-clustering regularization." A more detailed analysis of the trade-offs between time and space complexity, including comparisons with other methods, would enhance the paper's rigor. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include a discussion on the limitations of DyG-MF, particularly regarding performance under extreme data sparsity or imbalanced clusters. Lastly, addressing minor issues such as spelling errors and providing more details on datasets and preprocessing steps would improve reproducibility.
