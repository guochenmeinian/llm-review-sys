Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the lambda discrepancy, a measure of partial observability based on TD-lambda, which can be estimated from POMDP observations without a transition model or knowledge of state information. The authors demonstrate that the lambda discrepancy is zero under a Markovian state representation and typically non-zero otherwise. The optimization of this metric is shown to enhance representation learning and downstream performance in both smaller POMDP planning domains and larger problems solved by PPO.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- **Originality**: The lambda discrepancy is a novel and widely applicable metric that creatively leverages TD-lambda techniques to address significant challenges in sequence decision making.
- **Quality**: The theoretical justification for the lambda discrepancy is sound, and the experiments validate its utility in improving policy learning.
- **Significance**: The potential impact of this work is high, as it addresses a critical issue in reinforcement learning.

Weaknesses:
- The investigation of the lambda discrepancy's reliability and applicability across general POMDP problems is insufficient.
- Clarity issues persist, with important content relegated to the appendix, making the manuscript difficult to read.
- The theoretical discussion lacks depth, particularly regarding the selection of $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ and the implications of high variance in TD error estimators.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical discussion by clearly characterizing the conditions under which the lambda discrepancy can be zero and providing guidance on selecting $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$, particularly addressing the variance concerns for high $\lambda$ values. Additionally, we suggest conducting observational experiments to verify the lambda discrepancy's effectiveness in measuring Markovian state representations, such as varying the observability of environments and comparing results with established metrics like bisimulation distance. Lastly, enhancing the clarity of the manuscript by integrating key definitions and discussions into the main text will improve reader comprehension.
