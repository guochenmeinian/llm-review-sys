### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for evaluating information extraction (IE) quality using large language models (LLMs) in the absence of human-annotated data. The authors propose a `Needle in a haystack` evaluation method, where an LLM generates a piece of information (needle) that is then infused into a document, allowing assessment of whether the needle can be successfully extracted. The paper also discusses challenges related to processing long documents with LLMs and introduces the MINEA score as a new evaluation metric.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a relevant problem in the field, focusing on the lack of curated benchmark data.
2. The introduction of the MINEA score is somewhat innovative, providing a new method for evaluation.

Weaknesses:
1. The writing quality is poor, with vague statements and unclear contributions, making it difficult to understand the work.
2. The paper lacks a thorough literature review and fails to address various existing analyses of LLMs in IE.
3. The experimental setup is insufficiently described, with limited sample sizes and reliance on toy examples, hindering reproducibility.
4. The analysis primarily focuses on named entity recognition (NER) without exploring other IE tasks, such as relation and event extraction.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing and provide concrete definitions of key terms, particularly regarding the information extracted. It is essential to clarify the roles of Sections 3 and 4 and to ensure that the contributions are explicitly stated. We suggest conducting experiments on publicly available datasets from domains like news or biomedicine to enhance reproducibility and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Additionally, the authors should include a comprehensive literature review and address the limitations of their approach, particularly regarding the evaluation of the MINEA score and its empirical support.
