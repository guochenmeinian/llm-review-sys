Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel algorithm for matrix sparsification, specifically the Randomized Minor-value Rectification (RMR) algorithm, aimed at enhancing computational efficiency in cancer radiation therapy optimization. The authors propose that their method effectively sparsifies large matrices while maintaining treatment quality, demonstrating its effectiveness through both empirical results and theoretical deductions. The algorithm retains significant matrix entries while applying a randomized approach to minor entries, ensuring minimal impact on optimization constraints.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The RMR algorithm introduces a unique combination of deterministic and randomized approaches tailored for cancer radiation therapy optimization.
- The method allows for a lower number of non-zero elements (nnz) for a given error, outperforming both second-category and first-category sparsification methods in terms of feasibility and optimality gaps.
- The paper is well-organized, providing thorough explanations of the algorithm, its theoretical guarantees, and its practical implications for improving patient outcomes.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the RMR algorithm could be better highlighted through a more detailed comparison with existing sparsification methods.
- The experimental validation relies heavily on controlled datasets from lung cancer patients, lacking diversity in real-world testing scenarios.
- Some technical aspects, such as the optimization process for fixed-point representations, require further clarification to enhance understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing a more detailed discussion on the limitations of the proposed approach, particularly in scenarios with extreme data heterogeneity. Additionally, including more diverse real-world testing scenarios would enhance the assessment of the RMR algorithm's effectiveness. We also suggest elaborating on the optimization runtime when using the original matrix A and providing references for techniques where sampling hyperparameters play a role. Lastly, addressing the ethical implications and privacy concerns associated with using sensitive health data in optimization problems is crucial for the paper's impact.
