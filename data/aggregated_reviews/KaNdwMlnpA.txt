### Key Points
This paper presents the local harmonic centrality minimization problem, where the objective is to minimize the harmonic centrality of a target vertex \( v \) in a directed graph by removing at most \( b \) incoming edges. The authors prove the problem is NP-hard and propose two approximation algorithms. The first algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of \( \sqrt{2h_G(v)} \), which is superior to that of the greedy method. The second is a bicriteria approximation algorithm based on the Lov√°sz extension. Experimental results indicate that the first algorithm performs comparably to the greedy method, while the second is slower and less practical.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a thorough analysis of the complexity of the local centrality minimization problem, establishing its NP-hardness.
- The authors develop two approximation algorithms with theoretical guarantees.
- The writing is clear, and the theoretical contributions are significant.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental section lacks detail, particularly in explaining the quality metrics and hardware specifications for reproducibility.
- The second algorithm shows no clear advantage over the greedy algorithm in practical scenarios, raising questions about its applicability.
- The motivation for the local harmonic centrality minimization problem is not fully developed, and comparisons with existing centrality measures are insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by providing clearer definitions of quality metrics and including hardware specifications for reproducibility. Additionally, we suggest that the authors validate the advantages of harmonic centrality over other centrality measures and explore the practical implications of their algorithms more thoroughly. It would also be beneficial to investigate whether the efficiency of the greedy algorithm can be enhanced, given its superior performance in practice compared to Algorithm 1. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the motivation for the problem and consider evaluating their model with real data to illustrate its relevance.
