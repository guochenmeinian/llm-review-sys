Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an online learning problem for pricing homogeneous data, where sellers must establish a price function based on data size and learn the arrival probabilities of various customer types to maximize cumulative revenue. The authors analyze the optimal price function structure with known arrival probabilities and introduce new discretization schemes to improve approximation error. In the online learning context, they develop algorithms for both stochastic and adversarial settings with theoretically bounded regret.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and addresses an interesting online learning problem in data pricing.  
- It explores the unique structure of the optimal pricing curve and provides algorithms for both stochastic and adversarial settings with theoretical regret bounds.  
- The proposed price discretization schemes significantly reduce the discretization size and add substantial value.  

Weaknesses:  
- The algorithms (Algorithm 3 and 4) exhibit computational complexity that depends on the horizon \(T\), which may be large in practice.  
- There is a lack of numerical validations to demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithms, particularly given their computational complexity.  
- Sections 3 and 4-5 appear independent, with Section 3 containing the main contributions, while Sections 4-5 utilize standard techniques.  
- The construction of the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) for buyer types may not be as non-trivial as claimed, and the necessity of perturbation in Section 5 is unclear.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions, particularly in Sections 4-5, by elaborating on the unique difficulties encountered and the specific techniques developed. Additionally, providing numerical experiments would validate the algorithms' efficiency. The authors should consider addressing the computational complexity of Algorithms 3 and 4 and explore the possibility of using a joint confidence interval to enhance the UCB construction. Lastly, clarifying the process for determining the price set \(\bar{\mathcal{P}}\) and discussing the tightness of the regret bounds would strengthen the paper.
