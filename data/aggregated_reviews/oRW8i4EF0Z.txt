### Key Points
This paper presents a Bayesian crowdsourcing approach aimed at enhancing truth discovery from LLM outputs, effectively addressing the issue of LLM hallucinations. The authors propose a method that combines outputs from multiple LLMs, facilitating uncertainty quantification. The paper demonstrates performance improvements across various domains and thoroughly examines practical applications while considering scalability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The introduction of a novel method that creatively mitigates LLM hallucination issues, applicable to diverse use cases from classification to general QA.  
- Robust experimental results with solid settings, utilizing three datasets and establishing several baselines to validate the Bayesian method's performance.  
- High readability and well-organized presentation of the content.  

Weaknesses:  
- Limited exploration of practical costs and real-world applications, which may hinder understanding for a general audience.  
- The evaluation datasets could benefit from further expansion to enhance the depth of the analysis.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by exploring the performance of the method across a broader range of tasks beyond QA. Additionally, providing an explanation about the agentic method mentioned in the paper would be beneficial. Including more evaluation metrics in the experiments would also strengthen the evidence presented.
