Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to solving the constrained sampling problem using a primal-dual method, specifically through the proposed PD-LMC sampling technique. The authors provide a detailed convergence analysis and conduct several numerical experiments to validate their method. The objective function focuses on KL divergences with a target distribution, while constraints are expressed as expectation equations or inequalities. The authors reformulate the problem into a saddle point formulation and explore convergence through Wasserstein gradient descent and L2 gradient ascent directions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-structured and clearly articulates the background and related work.  
- The authors establish solid convergence guarantees for their algorithms across various settings.  
- The application of constrained sampling from convex sets is particularly noteworthy.  

Weaknesses:  
- The primal-dual method is not novel, as similar algorithms have been previously studied.  
- The theoretical analysis lacks clarity on the rate of constraint violation, particularly regarding whether $\mu_k$ satisfies constraints.  
- The correctness of Theorem 3.3 is questionable, especially in the presence of equality constraints, suggesting a need for alternative metrics like W2 distance or TV distance.  
- The numerical experiments do not compare the proposed method with other relevant techniques, such as mirror Langevin methods or PD Langevin in rate-constrained Bayesian models.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis by explicitly addressing the rate of violation of constraints. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the conditions under which Theorem 3.3 holds, particularly regarding equality constraints, and considering alternative metrics for evaluation. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include comparisons with other sampling methods in their numerical experiments to strengthen their findings.
