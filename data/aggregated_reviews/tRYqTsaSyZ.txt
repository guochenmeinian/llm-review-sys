### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for enhancing the quality and coherence of abstractive related work generation through a Causal Intervention Module for Related Work Generation (CaM). The authors propose that CaM effectively captures causality in the generation process, addressing spurious correlations and incorporating contextual information. By integrating CaM with a Transformer architecture, the authors claim to deliver an end-to-end causal related work generation model that outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of this approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The concept of causal intervention for related work generation is intriguing and innovative.
- The framework is clearly introduced and appears reasonable.
- Extensive experiments demonstrate improvements in quality and coherence across two datasets, supported by ablation studies.

Weaknesses:
- Key concepts such as causality and spurious correlations require clearer definitions.
- The automatic evaluation using Rouge-based metrics lacks convincing support; additional metrics for semantic similarity and correctness should be considered.
- The claimed performance improvements of CaM over existing models, particularly TAG, appear overstated, as evidenced by conflicting results in Table 2.
- The integration of CaM with the Transformer architecture raises questions about the application of BERT's pre-trained weights and the choice of model architecture.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the descriptions of key concepts, including causality and spurious correlations, to enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest expanding the human evaluation to provide more robust performance comparisons. The authors should also tone down claims regarding the contribution of the causal intervention to avoid misleading readers, and provide a more thorough discussion of the limitations, particularly regarding the applicability of CaM to models beyond BERT. Finally, we encourage the authors to improve the clarity of sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2, possibly by including running examples, and to refine variable naming conventions for better readability.
