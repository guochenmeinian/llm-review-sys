### Key Points
This paper presents a method to enhance exploration in the MuZero agent by introducing a hybrid policy that combines exploratory and optimized strategies. The authors aim to mitigate the brittleness of optimal policies, with empirical evaluation conducted on Tic-Tac-Toe. The exploration scheme encourages the agent to investigate less-experienced areas of the decision tree, which is a significant aspect of decision-making in games.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The problem of exploring less-experienced parts of the decision tree is interesting and relevant.  
- The paper provides a detailed review of related work, demonstrating thorough research.  
- The motivation for the proposed method is clear, and the inclusion of source code is beneficial.  

Weaknesses:  
- The contribution is marginal, as the proposed method is a minor modification to existing algorithms, lacking sufficient evidence for its effectiveness through theoretical analysis or extensive experimentation.  
- The experiments are limited to a simple domain (Tic-Tac-Toe), which does not adequately demonstrate the method's scalability or effectiveness in more complex scenarios.  
- The writing quality is unprofessional, with issues such as references included in the abstract and sections that feel disconnected.  
- The evaluation lacks comparisons to other advanced exploration algorithms, and the rationale behind certain parameters, such as the random time $t_{startNormal}$, is unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and professionalism of the writing, ensuring that references are appropriately placed and that sections flow logically. Additionally, we suggest that the authors conduct experiments in more complex environments, such as Connect Four, to better assess the scalability and effectiveness of their approach. It would also be beneficial to include comparisons to other algorithms that utilize advanced exploration techniques and to provide a theoretical analysis to support the proposed method. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the rationale behind the randomization parameters used in their experiments.
