Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
We note that the paper employs an ensemble of SAM frameworks to train a modality-agnostic framework, optimizing inference efficiency by exporting the model to ONNX format. The authors focus on lightweight medical image segmentation models, demonstrating improvements in accuracy and runtime across modalities, particularly with PET scans. However, concerns arise regarding the limited training data, discrepancies in inference times, and differences in results between PyTorch and ONNX models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
1. The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of multiple models, highlighting their strengths and limitations across various medical imaging modalities.
2. It demonstrates methodological rigor by incorporating advanced techniques such as model quantization and Sharpness-aware Minimization.
3. The focus on CPU deployment has significant practical relevance for resource-constrained environments.

**Weaknesses:**
1. The training data is insufficient, as only PET and Microscopy images are used for training and fine-tuning.
2. The reported inference times appear inconsistent, especially given the input resolution of 1024 pixels.
3. There are notable discrepancies in results between PyTorch and ONNX models, with unexpected performance variations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We suggest improving the method by addressing the following:
1. Provide a more detailed algorithm description and pseudocode in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 to enhance understanding.
2. Clarify the choice of quantization strategy and how to balance accuracy and efficiency.
3. Expand on the datasets' source, diversity, and scale in Section 3.1, and offer a deeper explanation of evaluation metrics and loss functions in Section 3.2.
4. Include a more detailed training protocol in Section 3.3, specifying parameter settings and adjustment strategies.
5. Compare inference speed results with existing technologies in Section 4.1 to highlight advantages.
6. Conduct a deeper analysis of quantitative results in Section 4.2, focusing on performance differences across modalities.
7. Provide more case studies in Section 4.3 to illustrate model performance in various situations.
