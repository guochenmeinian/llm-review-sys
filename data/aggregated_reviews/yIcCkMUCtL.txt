Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a unified analysis of convergence properties for kernel-based estimators under covariate shift, covering various loss functions and focusing on standard and importance-weighted empirical risk estimators. The authors propose two approaches: a usual M-estimator and an importance-sampling-like M-estimator, demonstrating that the latter outperforms the former both theoretically and empirically. The results extend previous work by showing optimal learning rates under specific conditions related to the importance ratio.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The theoretical analysis provides interesting results regarding learning under covariate shift, contributing to a contemporary topic.  
- The paper is well-organized, clearly explaining the problem and illustrating theoretical findings with numerical experiments.  
- The clarity of the writing and notation facilitates understanding, making the theoretical contributions accessible.  

Weaknesses:  
- Concerns about the novelty of the proofs arise, as some derivations appear straightforward and lack sufficient explanation regarding their originality.  
- The empirical study may be the weakest aspect of the paper, and the relevance of the assumptions on distribution shift to practical applications is not fully explored.  
- Certain terms and symbols in theorems are not clearly defined, which may hinder comprehension.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the original derivations in the proofs, particularly in relation to techniques used for similar results without covariate shift. Additionally, clarity could be enhanced by addressing the definitions and assumptions more explicitly, such as clarifying that $f^*$ corresponds to the optimal function under the target distribution and ensuring expectations are conditioned on observed data. We suggest revising Figure 1 to better align with the hypotheses or discussing its implications if it does not. Furthermore, we advise including more details in the proofs, particularly regarding undefined notations and inequalities. Lastly, addressing the limitations related to the practical impact of estimating the importance function would strengthen the manuscript.
