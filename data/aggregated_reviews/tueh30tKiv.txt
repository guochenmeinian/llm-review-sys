### Key Points
This paper discusses the vulnerability of contrastive learning (CL)-based models to length-induced semantic shifts and proposes a length-agnostic self-reference framework, LA(SER)^3, for robust sentence representation learning. The authors demonstrate that elongating a document increases intra-document similarity and that isotropy in CL is dependent on the text length during training. The proposed framework relies on semantic signals from document length and achieves state-of-the-art unsupervised performance on an information retrieval benchmark.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant research gap regarding length bias in contrastive learning, providing a theoretical foundation for length attacks and demonstrating their impact on model performance.
- The proposed LA(SER) framework is intuitive and enhances robustness to length attacks without sacrificing representational power.
- Empirical results support the effectiveness of the proposed methods, showing promising performance across various benchmarks.

Weaknesses:
- The writing and presentation require improvement, as the novelty of the contribution is not clearly articulated, making it difficult to differentiate from prior work.
- The evaluation is primarily focused on unsupervised performance, lacking comprehensive comparisons with existing methods that address length vulnerability.
- The proposed mathematical formulation lacks strict definitions, leading to potential ambiguities that could undermine interpretability.
- The absence of analytical experiments for the elongation attack limits the ability to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and distinctiveness of the writing to better highlight the novel contributions of the paper. Additionally, we suggest including a comprehensive comparison with existing methods addressing length vulnerability to clarify the unique advantages of LA(SER)^3. To enhance the robustness of the findings, we advise conducting experiments on various downstream tasks beyond the standard information retrieval benchmark. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide a more rigorous definition of the proposed mathematical formulation and to include analytical experiments to validate the effectiveness of the elongation attack countermeasures. Lastly, addressing the positional invariance argument with empirical evidence and discussing how the context length issue is managed in encoders for elongated sequences would strengthen the paper.
