Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents causal dependence plots (CDPs) to visualize how model predictions are influenced by changes in input variable distributions. The authors utilize an explanatory causal model (ECM) to simulate the effects of input interventions on related variables, differentiating between direct and total dependence. Additionally, the authors reformulate model explanations as a causal problem, aiming to connect visual model explanations to existing literature on causality. They propose utilizing causal models not only for adjusting input data but also for inferring explanations, particularly through diagnostic plots of residuals. Evaluations on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that incorporating causal relations enhances understanding compared to non-causal methods, and the relevance of visualization methods is acknowledged.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of CDPs is a novel contribution that leverages causal relationships for model interpretation, providing insights into total and direct effects.
- The paper is well-structured, with clear visualizations that support the claims and facilitate understanding.
- The approach is relevant for evaluating fairness and distribution shifts, and the authors present a thorough exploration of the method's applications.
- The authors effectively address reviewer concerns and demonstrate a willingness to incorporate feedback.
- The proposed use of diagnostic plots of residuals could enhance the paper's contributions to understanding model misbehavior.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on a fully specified ECM is a significant limitation, as it requires complete knowledge of the directed acyclic graph (DAG) and functional forms, which may not always be feasible.
- The significance of the contributions to causal inference is questioned, as the work primarily focuses on visualizing known results rather than offering new insights into causal analysis.
- The paper lacks detailed discussions on practical applications of the method in areas like fairness and out-of-distribution testing.
- There is a need for clearer examples demonstrating the application of diagnostic plots to illustrate the proposed concepts.
- The paper currently lacks a comprehensive discussion on related methods and their implications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the implications of estimating functions within the ECM, as this would enhance the applicability and clarity of the approach. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide clearer guidance on how to choose suitable models and verify assumptions, especially for users unfamiliar with causal inference. It would also be beneficial to include comparisons with causal Shapley values and to elaborate on the potential applications of CDPs beyond visualization. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors enhance the discussion on related methods, particularly focusing on causal SHAP, and consider including an example of diagnostic plots of residuals in the paper or appendix to clarify the analysis and address reviewer concerns regarding model mispredictions. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify definitions and terms earlier in the paper to aid reader comprehension.
