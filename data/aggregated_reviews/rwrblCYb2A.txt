Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents MindEye, a novel fMRI-to-image approach that effectively reconstructs natural scenes from brain activity. The model comprises two parallel submodules: a retrieval submodule utilizing contrastive loss for image retrieval and a reconstruction submodule employing a diffusion prior and CLIP image embedding to generate semantic features. The authors demonstrate superior performance through experimental results, highlighting the method's ability to preserve low-level image features.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces an interesting method for the fMRI-to-image task, combining retrieval, diffusion prior, and low-level information.
- Comprehensive comparisons with existing methods showcase MindEye's state-of-the-art performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.
- The experimental evaluation is robust, with thorough ablation studies validating the modeling choices.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the methodology is limited as it heavily relies on existing models, including pre-trained diffusion prior and CLIP.
- There is a lack of theoretical proof for certain claims, such as the rationality of aligned embeddings for image reconstruction.
- The computational cost of using large-scale models is not addressed, raising concerns about practicality.
- The model's generalization is questioned due to reliance on a single dataset (NSD) and the absence of performance evaluations after removing specific submodules.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical foundation of the paper by providing proofs for the claims made regarding aligned embeddings. Additionally, addressing the computational complexity of the proposed method in comparison to other approaches would enhance its practical applicability. Exploring the model's generalizability across different patient populations and datasets would also be beneficial. Finally, conducting a sensitivity analysis to investigate the relationship between image output and fMRI input could provide deeper insights into the model's performance.
