Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates advancements in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for pre-trained neural networks by integrating spectral information from pretrained weights, enhancing the classic LoRA approach. The authors propose two spectral adaptation techniques—additive tuning and orthogonal rotation of the top singular vectors—employing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The paper presents a novel approach to fine-tuning neural network weights by focusing on the singular vectors rather than just the singular values. The experiments demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art methods in specific datasets and tasks, while theoretical analyses support the proposed methods' rank capacity and robustness. The authors emphasize the advantages of their method over existing techniques like SVDiff and OFT, particularly in terms of parameter efficiency and the preservation of orthogonality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The topic of LoRA adaptation is valuable for various tasks, with the proposed methods showing improvements in specific contexts.  
- The theoretical analysis indicates that spectral adapters have a larger rank capacity than LoRA and demonstrate a clear theoretical foundation and practical advantages over existing approaches.  
- Experiments on language and diffusion model fine-tuning demonstrate the proposed method's superiority over previous techniques while maintaining efficiency.  
- The authors provide detailed comparisons with prior works, highlighting the benefits of tuning singular vector space over singular values.

Weaknesses:  
- There are several typographical errors that need correction, including "Apppendix" and "digged."  
- The motivation for fine-tuning singular vectors lacks clarity, particularly regarding the implications of losing orthogonality.  
- The literature review's placement in the appendix is uncommon, and the claim regarding storage requirements lacks clarity.  
- The application boundaries of the two proposed methods (spectral adapter^A and spectral adapter^R) are not clearly defined.  
- The analysis of spectral adaptation robustness could be clearer, and the paper's organization may benefit from restructuring, particularly with the placement of Lemma 4.1 and Table 3.  
- The limitations section is missing, and the potential for overfitting when tuning the most important eigenvectors is a concern.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the claim regarding storage requirements in lines 82-93 to avoid logical inconsistencies. Additionally, please clarify the differences and relationships between the two spectral adapter versions. We suggest restructuring the paper to enhance clarity, particularly by moving certain content from the experiments section to the methods section, including Lemma 4.1 and Table 3. It would also be beneficial to include a separate limitations section and to discuss the potential for overfitting due to the focus on top eigenvectors. Finally, consider using validation loss for comparisons in Figures 1 and 8 and including quantitative measures alongside qualitative comparisons in the image generation results.
