### Key Points
This paper presents a benchmarking of various Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) approaches, including Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), Monte-Carlo Dropout (MCD), and Deep Ensembles (DE). The authors exploit Burger's equation and the Navier-Stokes equation, providing results that can offer valuable insights for the community.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- Well written  
- The heat map representation of model uncertainties is interesting  
- The results contribute valuable information to the field  

Weaknesses:  
- None explicitly mentioned in the reviews  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology section to enhance understanding of the UQ approaches utilized.
