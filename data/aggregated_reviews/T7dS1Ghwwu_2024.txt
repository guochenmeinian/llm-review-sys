Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Rank Calibrated Class-conditional Conformal Prediction (RC3P) algorithm, which aims to reduce the size of prediction sets in conformal prediction (CP) while ensuring valid class-conditional coverage. The RC3P algorithm employs a label rank calibration strategy to selectively apply class-wise thresholding, resulting in smaller prediction sets compared to the standard class-conditional CP (CCP) method. The authors demonstrate that RC3P significantly reduces prediction set sizes across various real-world datasets while maintaining valid class-wise coverage.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of a rank calibration strategy within the class-conditional CP framework is a novel contribution, effectively addressing the challenge of large prediction sets in imbalanced datasets.
2. Comprehensive experimental results across diverse datasets and imbalance types show significant reductions in prediction set sizes while maintaining valid class-wise coverage.
3. The authors provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for class-wise coverage and improved predictive efficiency, demonstrating the robustness and general applicability of the RC3P algorithm.
4. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with detailed explanations of the algorithm, theoretical analyses, and experimental setups.

Weaknesses:
1. The theoretical analysis of predictive efficiency could be expanded, particularly regarding the conditions under which RC3P outperforms CCP.
2. Additional experiments on larger and more diverse datasets could further validate the generalizability of the RC3P method.
3. The predictive efficiency should be verified using approximate conditional coverage metrics suggested in the literature, such as those by "Cauchois et al. (2021)."

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis of predictive efficiency by exploring the specific conditions under which RC3P outperforms CCP. Additionally, conducting experiments on larger and more diverse datasets would enhance the validation of the RC3P method. Furthermore, we suggest verifying predictive efficiency using approximate conditional coverage metrics, as indicated in the literature. Lastly, clarifying the computational complexity of the RC3P algorithm compared to CCP and Cluster-CP methods would provide valuable insights.
