### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach, S3T, to utilize PEFT for exact machine unlearning. The experiments demonstrate that the method efficiently manages multiple data sources and outperforms baseline methods. The authors introduce fine-tuning large-scale models using the Sequence-aware Sharded Sliced Training (S3T) framework, but the clarity regarding dataset partitioning's impact on model performance is lacking.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The S3T method shows improved performance and efficiency in handling multiple data sources compared to baseline methods.  
- The deletion performance analysis indicates that S3T outperforms existing methods like SISA and ProtoSISA.

Weaknesses:  
- The description of dataset partitioning in Section 3 is unclear regarding its effect on model performance.  
- There is no experimental validation comparing S3T with other fine-tuning techniques, such as LoRA or adapters, in terms of computational cost and model convergence.  
- Insufficient detail is provided on the experimental setup, particularly regarding dataset sizes and deletion scenarios.  
- The paper lacks a comparison of sequence selection algorithms with simpler heuristic approaches.  
- The analysis of deletion requests is brief and could benefit from visualizing performance decay over time.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the dataset partitioning description in Section 3 and provide experimental validation comparing S3T with other fine-tuning techniques regarding computational cost and model convergence. Additionally, we suggest including more details on the experimental setup, such as dataset sizes and deletion scenarios. A comparison of sequence selection algorithms with simpler approaches should also be added. Finally, visualizing the impact of deletion requests over time would enhance the demonstration of S3Tâ€™s robustness in dynamic settings.
