Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method to assess social biases encoded in LLMs, specifically focusing on gender bias in job applications. The authors propose the PRISM algorithm, which masks individual words in generated text and predicts them using a masked language model (MLM) based on predefined lists of masculine and feminine terms. The study finds that biases in job postings are reproduced and exacerbated in applications generated by ChatGPT. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses the critical issue of detecting social biases, particularly relevant given the increasing use of LLMs in the labor market.
- PRISM is an intuitive and flexible method that requires only word lists and an MLM for evaluation.
- The writing is clear, enhancing the understanding of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation of the new method is insufficient, with limited validation exercises and reliance on a single dataset for human expert validation.
- There is a risk of misattributing biases from the MLM to the LLM, necessitating a discussion on the calibration of the MLM used.
- Experiments lack baselines for comparison, and the method is only tested on one LLM and one MLM, limiting robustness.
- More qualitative examples and details about the experiments would enhance the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including robustness checks across multiple datasets and LLMs to validate the generalizability of PRISM. Additionally, addressing the potential biases in the MLM used is crucial; the authors should discuss how to ensure that the MLM produces calibrated predictions. It would also be beneficial to include baseline comparisons to demonstrate the unique contributions of PRISM. Finally, providing more qualitative examples and detailed experimental setups, such as the full word lists, would strengthen the paper.
