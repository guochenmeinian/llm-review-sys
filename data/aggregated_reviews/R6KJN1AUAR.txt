Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theory for additive decoders aimed at disentangling images composed of multiple components, proposing that these decoders can generate novel images and provide insights into generative models. The authors explore the statistical identifiability of latent variables and connect this to extrapolation capabilities. Additionally, the paper investigates block identifiability in the context of nonlinear independent component analysis (ICA), arguing that extending existing proof techniques to block identifiability is a strength, as it encompasses trivial partitions that yield full disentanglement. However, concerns are raised regarding the implications of such partitions, particularly that they may lead to a lack of nonlinear mixing and only disentangle partitions rather than solve nonlinear ICA. The authors acknowledge that their approach does not fully align with traditional definitions of ICA, particularly regarding the independence of latent variables.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents clear intuitions behind complex mathematical concepts.
- It addresses important topics in latent variable identifiability and block identifiability, focusing on additive decoders and their relationship to compositional decoders, which is both relevant and novel.
- The theoretical findings are interesting and provide a new perspective on existing literature, including a near-complete proof that compositional decoders imply additive ones.
- The paper effectively connects assumptions and results to prior work, enhancing its contribution to the field and demonstrates a willingness to clarify and improve upon original arguments.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments are limited and disconnected from existing literature, lacking citations of relevant works.
- The definition of "reasonableness" is unclear, particularly regarding the distinction between $Z^{test}$ and $Z^{train}$.
- Assumption 2 is problematic, as it lacks clarity and may be overly restrictive, raising questions about its practical relevance.
- The argument for the strength of extending proof techniques to block identifiability is not convincingly supported, as it may lead to arbitrary transformations of ground-truth representations.
- The notation for the Jacobian is defined only in the appendix, which could lead to confusion.
- The color choices in Figure 4 are problematic, particularly for individuals with color blindness, detracting from the accessibility of the visual data.
- The paper does not adequately discuss its limitations or the implications of its assumptions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the connection of their experiments to existing literature by citing relevant works, such as those by Li et al. and Yoon et al. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the definition of "reasonableness" and expand on the differences between $Z^{test}$ and $Z^{train}$. It would be beneficial to provide a more thorough explanation of Assumption 2, including its implications for neural networks and potential models that satisfy or violate this requirement. Furthermore, we advise defining the notation for the Jacobian in the main body of the paper for clarity. We also recommend improving the clarity of the discussion on the differences between their approach and traditional nonlinear ICA by explicitly stating that the B-disentanglement result differs from those in nonlinear ICA in that it does not recover each latent component but rather disentangles the partitions. Lastly, we encourage the authors to revise the color palette used in Figure 4 to ensure better visibility for all readers, particularly those with color vision deficiencies, and to include a discussion on the limitations of their approach, particularly regarding the applicability of their findings to more complex datasets and scenarios involving occlusions.
