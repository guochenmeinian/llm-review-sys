### Key Points
This paper presents LargePiG, a novel model aimed at achieving hallucination-free query generation by transforming Large Language Models (LLMs) into Pointer Generators. LargePiG utilizes a model-agnostic and training-free approach, leveraging inherent attention weights for pointer attention distribution and calculating copy probability based on vocabulary distribution differences. Experimental results on datasets involving document and video scenarios demonstrate LargePiG's effectiveness in reducing hallucinations and improving the accuracy of document-based question-answering and factuality evaluation tasks. The authors provide source code and datasets for further research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors introduce "relevance hallucination" and "factuality hallucination," enhancing the understanding of hallucination issues in query generation with LLMs.
- LargePiG effectively reduces hallucinations by decoupling content and form, offering flexibility and ease of integration with various LLMs.
- Extensive experiments validate LargePiG's effectiveness across two datasets.
- The provision of source code and datasets facilitates further exploration by the research community.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental section lacks sufficient baseline models, particularly for multimodal data experiments.
- Additional theoretical analysis of computational complexity is needed to assess the method's scaling capabilities.
- The claim that "LargePiG causes negligible latency" is one-sided; compatibility with acceleration techniques like Flash Attention and Paged Attention is unclear, affecting practical applicability. The authors should discuss this to ensure LargePiG's effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by incorporating more baseline models, particularly for multimodal data. Additionally, a thorough sensitivity analysis of the copy probability $p_{cp}$ and its dependence on key parameters should be included to optimize the model's performance. The authors should also address the scalability of LargePiG for extremely long texts and its ability to achieve real-time query generation. Finally, a more comprehensive comparative analysis with other recent methods for hallucination mitigation would strengthen the paper's contribution.
