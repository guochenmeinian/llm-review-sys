Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel diffusion-based generative model for planning sequences of milestones in a latent space, aimed at solving long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks and multi-task decision-making problems. The authors propose a hierarchical architecture, DTAMP, which decomposes long-term goals into short-term milestones, utilizing goal-conditioned imitation learning for training. The method demonstrates superior performance on benchmarks such as D4RL and CALVIN, effectively generating control-relevant latent representations and planning efficiently.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method effectively combines diffusion models with hierarchical reinforcement learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.
- The approach allows for flexible planning and generates control-relevant features in a learned latent space, facilitating efficient long-term planning.
- The paper is well-organized and accessible, making it easy to understand for readers not specialized in planning or diffusion models.

Weaknesses:
- The training process lacks clarity, particularly regarding whether the diffusion model and imitation learning are trained separately or synchronously, and how labeled data for milestones is obtained.
- The experiments are insufficient, particularly lacking results on D4RL MuJoCo locomotion tasks and comparisons with the PointMaze tasks.
- There are minor language issues and typos throughout the paper, which detract from the overall presentation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the training process by explicitly stating the training methodology for the diffusion model and imitation learning. Additionally, providing more ablation results on the choice of sampling methods and the number of sampled points would enhance the instructiveness of the results. It would also be beneficial to include experiments on D4RL MuJoCo locomotion tasks and clarify the rationale for not including PointMaze tasks in the comparisons. Lastly, addressing the minor language issues and typos will improve the overall quality of the paper.
