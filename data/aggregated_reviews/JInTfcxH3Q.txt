Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents PowerPM, a foundation model designed for modeling electricity time series (ETS) data in power systems. It integrates a temporal encoder and a hierarchical encoder, employing a self-supervised pre-training framework that includes masked ETS modeling and dual-view contrastive learning. PowerPM aims to capture complex temporal patterns and hierarchical correlations, demonstrating significant economic benefits in real-world applications, particularly in the Zhejiang Power Grid. The model's performance is validated through extensive experiments across various tasks, showcasing its generalizability and practical value. Additionally, the authors emphasize ethical considerations in their study on electricity usage data, highlighting the importance of informed consent obtained from users prior to data collection. They propose a predictive model aimed at optimizing electricity procurement to minimize waste while ensuring user needs are met, with data anonymization handled by the State Grid Corporation of China.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The originality of the approach in addressing ETS data modeling challenges is notable, particularly through the innovative combination of encoders and pre-training strategies.
- The thorough evaluation of PowerPM, including real-world deployment and comprehensive experimental results, highlights its high quality and effectiveness.
- The paper is well-structured, clearly articulating the model's motivation, methodology, and results, supported by detailed figures and explanations.
- The authors demonstrate a strong commitment to ethical research practices, ensuring informed consent and data anonymization.
- The predictive model aims to enhance energy efficiency and reduce waste in electricity procurement.

Weaknesses:
- There is a limited comparison with the latest state-of-the-art models, which could enhance the evaluation of PowerPM's performance.
- The discussion on model interpretability is insufficient, lacking insights into how PowerPM captures temporal dependencies and hierarchical correlations.
- The exploration of hyperparameters and sensitivity analysis is limited, which could provide valuable insights into the model's robustness.
- Scalability and efficiency considerations are not adequately addressed, particularly regarding computational requirements for large-scale applications.
- The paper does not sufficiently discuss the ethical and societal implications of deploying PowerPM in real-world settings.
- The authors do not provide sufficient details on the dataset and model release plans, which may limit transparency and accessibility for other researchers.
- There is a lack of clarity regarding the potential impacts of prediction deviations on user electricity availability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- We recommend that the authors incorporate a thorough comparison with the latest state-of-the-art models in electricity time series analysis to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of PowerPM's performance.
- Enhance the model interpretability analysis by including a section that explains how PowerPM processes ETS data and its decision-making processes.
- Conduct a detailed hyperparameter tuning process and sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of key parameters on model performance.
- Address scalability and efficiency concerns by discussing computational requirements, training time optimization strategies, and considerations for real-time deployment.
- Expand the discussion on ethical and societal implications by analyzing potential negative impacts and proposing mitigation strategies to ensure responsible deployment of the PowerPM model.
- Improve the clarity of the dataset and pre-trained model release plans, detailing the steps and timelines for each stage.
- Address the implications of prediction deviations more thoroughly to enhance understanding of the model's reliability and user impact.
