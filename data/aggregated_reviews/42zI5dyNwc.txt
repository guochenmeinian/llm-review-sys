Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for natural language processing (NLP) that utilizes a database-based approach rather than traditional language corpora. The authors propose a tree-graph hybrid model that incorporates spatial relations for both natural language generation and understanding tasks. They argue that current neural network architectures overlook the encoding of information, suggesting that information should be represented as entities and relations akin to databases.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The authors propose a revolutionary perspective on neural networks that aligns more closely with human cognitive processes.
- The insight of leveraging human cognition to develop an NLP model is noteworthy.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks experimental validation, with no experiments or datasets presented to support the proposed method.
- The concept of structured information is inadequately defined, and the paper does not acknowledge the existing body of work on structured representations in NLP.
- The approach is perceived as being close to existing methodologies, lacking originality.
- The paper does not adequately address the relationship between structured information and semantic representation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including experimental observations and analyses to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Additionally, a more comprehensive literature review is necessary to contextualize their approach within the existing body of NLP research. Clarifying the definition of structured information and its relation to semantic representation would enhance the paper's clarity and depth. Finally, proposing a dataset for experimentation would strengthen the contribution of the work.
