### Key Points
This paper presents OpenSatMap, a large-scale dataset designed for constructing maps from high-resolution satellite imagery. OpenSatMap offers significant advantages over existing datasets, including finer-grained instance-level annotations, higher resolution images, larger scale, and greater geographic diversity, making it suitable for autonomous driving applications. The authors provide baseline methods and evaluation metrics for instance-level line detection tasks, demonstrating the dataset's potential to enhance HD map construction.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- OpenSatMap effectively addresses critical limitations in existing satellite imagery datasets, enhancing resolution, annotation detail, scale, and geographic diversity.
- The dataset includes meticulously crafted instance-level annotations, capturing intricate details of road structures with exceptional precision.
- OpenSatMap's geographic diversity spans 60 cities across 19 countries, ensuring a wide range of road types and urban environments, and aligns with popular autonomous driving datasets like nuScenes and Argoverse 2.

Weaknesses:
- The practical value of the HD map dataset is diminished without corresponding onboard sensor data, such as images, lidar, GPS, and IMU, which are essential for semantic HD map construction.
- It remains unclear whether OpenSatMap covers more regions than the existing HD map annotations in nuScenes and Argoverse 2.
- Some road elements, such as pedestrian crossings, are missing from the dataset.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset by including corresponding onboard sensor data to enhance its practical applicability for HD map construction. Additionally, an analysis of the accuracy of satellite images in relation to their coordinates would be beneficial for understanding the localization accuracy of the ground truth HD map. Furthermore, including intersection-related elements, such as intersections, crosswalks, and stoplines, would provide more comprehensive map information. Lastly, clarifying the alignment accuracy of lane lines between nuScenes, Argoverse 2, and OpenSatMap, as well as specifying the number of categories C in the baseline method, would enhance the dataset's clarity and usability.
