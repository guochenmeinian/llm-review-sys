### Key Points
This paper presents CrossDyG, a novel framework for cross-graph dynamic link prediction that aims to enhance transferability from a single source graph to multiple target graphs. The authors propose a deconfounded training method to eliminate structural bias and utilize causal intervention to adapt predictions to graph-specific characteristics. The effectiveness of CrossDyG is demonstrated through extensive experiments, showing significant performance improvements in terms of AUC and AP.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The one-to-many mechanism for cross-graph dynamic link prediction addresses a notable gap in existing methods.
- The empirical results indicate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with gains of up to 17% in AUC.
- The paper is well-organized, clearly communicating its contributions and methodology.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for the proposed approach lacks sufficient evaluation and validation, particularly in comparison to existing methods like DyGFormer and GraphMixer.
- The experimental evaluation is limited to three datasets, raising concerns about the generalizability of the findings.
- There is no detailed analysis of scalability or computational efficiency, which is crucial given the paper's claims regarding the reduction of computational costs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the validation of the motivation for CrossDyG by providing a thorough discussion on the performance of existing methods in one-to-many settings. Additionally, including scalability results, particularly in comparison to many-to-many methods, would strengthen the paper. Expanding the experimental evaluation to include more datasets, such as the MOOC dataset and artificial graphs generated using the dynamic LFR model, would enhance the robustness of the findings. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of runtime and memory usage, along with a performance-to-efficiency ratio, should be included to highlight the advantages of the proposed method. Lastly, clarifying the use of neighbor sampling and addressing any potential typos would improve the clarity of the paper.
