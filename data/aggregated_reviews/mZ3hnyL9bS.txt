Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical exploration of the learning difficulty associated with interactive concepts, demonstrating that deep neural networks (DNNs) are more inclined to encode simpler interactive concepts. The authors argue that low-order interactive concepts are more stable against data noise and consistently affect inference scores across samples. The paper provides empirical validation through experiments on various DNN architectures using image and tabular datasets, while also relating findings to existing theoretical and empirical works.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper offers a useful theoretical contribution by deriving an approximate analytical solution to the variance of interactive concepts' effects concerning data noise, showing an exponential increase with concept order.
2. The findings provide novel insights into DNNs, explaining empirical results such as adversarial robustness and the efficiency of adversarial training for certain concepts.
3. Experiments conducted on multiple architectures and datasets yield consistent results with theoretical predictions.
4. The paper is well-written and effectively covers existing literature.

Weaknesses:
1. The claim that easy samples primarily consist of low-order interactive concepts lacks supporting evidence; the authors should clarify how "easy" is defined.
2. The choice of variance value in experiments requires further explanation, including its impact and the effects of using different noise types.
3. The authors should consider experimenting with newer architectures like transformers and textual data inputs.
4. A limitations section is absent; the authors should discuss assumptions and the real-world applicability of their definition of "simplicity."

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the experimental design's validity in verifying their claims. Additionally, a clearer distinction between the contributions of prior work and this study is necessary. The authors should also provide a limitations section that addresses assumptions and broader impacts, including how their findings can guide future network designs. Finally, clarifying the connection between variance and learning difficulty theoretically would enhance the paper's rigor.
