Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Discrete Dictionary-based Decomposition (D3) method, a novel approach for tensor product representation (TPR) that enhances decomposition capabilities by utilizing discrete, trainable key-value dictionaries. The D3 layer maps input data to learned symbolic features, facilitating integration with existing TPR models and demonstrating strong performance across various tasks, including systematic generalization. The authors claim that D3 outperforms previous methods, such as AID, without relying on iterative attention mechanisms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The D3 method introduces a novel approach to discrete representation learning, addressing the decomposition problem in TPR models.
- Comprehensive experiments across multiple tasks and detailed ablation studies support the claims of effectiveness.
- The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations and visualizations of the D3 layer.

Weaknesses:
- The distinction between components generated by the codebook and those from the residual connection is unclear, necessitating further ablation studies.
- The paper lacks comparisons with state-of-the-art models for individual tasks, which diminishes the significance of the results.
- There is insufficient discussion on the interpretability of the model and how the dictionaries correspond to TPR components, leading to potential confusion regarding the representation's symbolic nature.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by providing definitions for key concepts such as roles and fillers, as the current terminology may confuse readers. Additionally, conducting ablation studies to isolate the effects of the codebook and the shared residual network would enhance understanding of their contributions. We suggest including comparisons with state-of-the-art models to better contextualize the performance of D3. Furthermore, a deeper theoretical analysis of why D3 works well could strengthen the paper's contribution. Finally, addressing the scalability of the method to more complex, real-world tasks would bolster the claims regarding generalization capabilities.
