### Key Points
This paper presents a study on Few-shot Document-level Relation Extraction (FSDLRE), addressing two main issues: refining relation prototype representations and customizing representations of NOTA types for specific tasks. The authors propose the Relation-Aware Prototype Learning (RAPL) method, which utilizes relation semantics for prototype aggregation and incorporates a relation-weighted contrastive learning module. The method also constructs task-specific NOTA prototypes. Experimental results on public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of RAPL, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed issues are significant for Few-shot Document Relation Extraction, and the method appears reasonable.
- The paper achieves strong performance on public benchmarks and is well-written, making it accessible.
- The methodology, combining contrastive learning with instance-level aggregation, is innovative and justified by experimental results.

Weaknesses:
- Some technical details lack clarity, such as the computation process for certain variables and inconsistencies in notation.
- The RAPL model is considered incremental, and the architecture may be limited by the use of a weak BERT encoder.
- There is insufficient analysis of the NOTA case, and the paper lacks detailed experiments to evaluate NOTA relations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the computation process for $\bm{a}_{e_h}$ and $\bm{a}_{e_t}$ in Line 210. Additionally, the authors should clarify the differences between $a^{(h,r,t)$ in Eq. 5 and Line 235. To enhance the robustness of the RAPL model, consider addressing the assumption that entity mentions must be specified for a query document. We suggest adding more datasets to demonstrate generalization and including additional case studies to illustrate outputs. Furthermore, an error analysis on RAPL's failures, particularly regarding NOTA relations, would provide valuable insights. Lastly, we encourage the authors to include more recent literature in the references to strengthen the paper's context.
