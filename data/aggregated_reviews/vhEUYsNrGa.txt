### Key Points
This paper presents a concept where AI systems share information openly to enhance the dissemination of scientific knowledge. The authors propose a network of AI models that perform various scientific tasks while interlinked to efficiently share discoveries. However, the concept relies on unrealistic conditions and overly optimistic assumptions about human behavior and the future role of AI in scientific pursuits. The paper is well-structured and provides a clear context, but lacks a concise statement encapsulating the authors' vision, leading to ambiguity regarding the definitions of openness among AI agents and between AI agents and humans.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors provide a thorough explanation of their concept, which is interesting and considers ethical concerns.
- The paper is clear and well-cited, making it accessible to scientists.

Weaknesses:
- The concept is based on unrealistic assumptions and lacks grounding in reality.
- There is ambiguity in the definitions of openness, and the creation of AI agents is not clearly explained.
- The paper does not adequately address the implications of allowing privately-owned AI agents in the proposed network, nor does it consider the potential for model collapse over generations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the articulation of AI models and agents in the scenarios considered, ensuring clarity in definitions of true and false knowledge. We suggest integrating the idea of a feedback loop earlier in the paper, particularly in Figure 2, and using uncertainty quantification to inform the data creation process. Additionally, we encourage the authors to explore real-world implementations of their ideas and to quantify the impact of "bad agents" on knowledge growth. It would also be beneficial to address potential edge cases and nonlinear relationships between knowledge sets. Finally, we advise reducing the focus on the merits of open science in Section 5 and instead emphasize practical solutions to the issues raised.
