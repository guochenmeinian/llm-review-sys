Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to embedding supervised models, specifically decision trees and their ensembles, in hyperbolic space using the Poincaré disk model. The authors propose three main advancements: linking loss functions for class probability estimation to hyperbolic embeddings, extracting monotonic subtrees for unambiguous embedding of decision trees, and introducing a tempered integral to enhance visualization and numerical accuracy near the Poincaré disk's border. The work aims to improve model interpretability and analysis without altering model performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The approach to embedding supervised models, particularly decision trees, in hyperbolic space is original and significant.
2. The paper provides a robust theoretical framework that connects class probability estimation losses with hyperbolic embeddings and introduces monotonic decision trees (MDTs) for cleaner embeddings.
3. The tempered integral addresses numerical issues near the Poincaré disk's boundary, showcasing a deep understanding of hyperbolic geometry challenges.
4. The paper is well-structured, with clear definitions, thorough explanations, and detailed experimental results supported by effective figures and tables.

Weaknesses:
1. The theoretical aspects, especially the tempered integral, may be challenging for practitioners to implement without additional guidance or examples.
2. The applicability of the methods to other types of supervised models is not discussed, limiting the scope of the work.
3. The experiments, while thorough, would benefit from including more diverse use cases, such as various datasets or real-world applications, to demonstrate versatility.
4. The presentation suffers from clarity issues, particularly in the integration of mathematical notation and the overall readability of the text.
5. Limited empirical validation on small-scale datasets raises questions about the scalability and effectiveness of the approach in larger, real-world contexts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the theoretical aspects, particularly the tempered integral, by providing more guidance or examples for practitioners. Additionally, discussing how the methods could be adapted for other supervised models would enhance the paper's relevance. Including a broader range of use cases in the experiments, particularly with larger datasets, would strengthen the demonstration of the method's robustness. We also suggest refining the presentation to enhance readability, especially in the integration of mathematical notation. Lastly, providing quantitative measures or user studies to substantiate claims of improved interpretability would add value to the work.
