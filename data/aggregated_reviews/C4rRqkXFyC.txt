### Key Points
This paper presents a novel embedding table compression method for recommender models called Clustered Compositional Embeddings (CCE). The authors propose that CCE learns the sparse matrix during training, unlike other methods that use random matrices. By combining clustering and hashing techniques, CCE achieves a baseline accuracy equivalent to the full model while using 50% fewer parameters than state-of-the-art (SOTA) compression models and 11,000 times fewer parameters than the full model. Experimental results on Criteo's click log datasets demonstrate that CCE performs comparably to fully learned embedding tables and outperforms other compression methods. The authors provide a theoretical analysis showing convergence to the optimal codebook for the least squares regression problem and discuss potential extensions of their method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a comprehensive overview of the problem and related work, effectively connecting the technique to existing methods.
- Good illustrations and pseudo-code enhance the paper's readability.
- The theoretical analysis on the least squares regression problem is robust and supports the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental results only report Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) loss, while the authors mention baseline accuracy, leading to potential confusion regarding the evaluation metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by consistently using evaluation metrics throughout the paper, particularly distinguishing between BCE loss and accuracy. Additionally, we suggest including experiments on more datasets to strengthen the findings and discussing the trade-offs of the method, particularly regarding any overhead in training time or computational resources. Furthermore, clarifying the implementation details in Algorithm 3, including the frequency of clustering, would enhance understanding. Lastly, addressing the theoretical limitations regarding the dense CCE method and its applicability to practical scenarios would be beneficial.
