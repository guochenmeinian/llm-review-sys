Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel metric, the s-value, which quantifies the stability of statistical parameters against distributional shifts by calculating the minimum KL divergence required to flip the sign of the parameter. The authors propose methods to compute the s-value for mean parameters and demonstrate its application in transfer learning. The paper discusses both marginal and conditional shifts, providing a two-stage procedure for determining when to collect additional test set samples based on parameter stability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The development of the s-value is relevant and addresses the common issue of distribution shifts in statistical inference.
- The theoretical analysis is solid, and the paper is well-organized, making it easy to follow.
- The proposed methods have practical implications for online experimentation and robust transfer learning.

Weaknesses:
- The interpretation of the s-value in multidimensional cases lacks clarity, particularly regarding its relevance and application.
- Experimental results are inadequately described, making it difficult to derive meaningful conclusions or assess the contributions compared to existing methods.
- The paper's presentation suffers from poor quality figures and insufficient contextualization of the proposed methods, especially regarding their limitations and practical applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the s-value's interpretation in multidimensional contexts and provide a more thorough discussion of its practical implications. Additionally, the authors should enhance the presentation of experimental results, ensuring that key takeaways are clearly articulated and that comparisons with existing techniques are included. Improving the quality of figures and addressing typesetting issues would also enhance readability. Finally, we suggest that the authors include a more detailed discussion of the limitations of their methods and explore the potential for applying the s-value in non-convex models or larger-scale problems.
