Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to deriving convergence rates in reinforcement learning (RL) using two stability properties: propagation of estimation errors across iterations and change of occupancy measure with respect to policy. The authors prove $O(n^{-1})$ convergence in the offline setting and $O(\log T)$ regret in the online setting, significantly improving upon traditional bounds. The paper also discusses the implications of these results on covariate shifts and the absence of pessimism in deriving fast bounds.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors introduce a new framework for analyzing RL convergence properties, leading to improved bounds that decay as $1/n$ for offline and $\log T$ for online settings.
- The intuition provided in Section 2.3 clarifies the derivation of fast convergence rates and extends the analysis to linear function approximation.
- The paper is well-motivated, linking results to practical observations in RL, such as the fast convergence in the Mountain Car problem.

Weaknesses:
- The stability assumptions, "Bellman stability" and "Occupation measure stability," are difficult to understand without proper motivation or illustrative examples, which could enhance clarity.
- The term "stability" lacks a clear connection to its established meaning in control theory, leading to potential confusion.
- Minor issues include the need for full assumption statements in theorem declarations and inconsistencies in figure presentations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the stability assumptions by providing detailed explanations and illustrative examples, particularly in Section 3. Additionally, we suggest explicitly defining how "stability" relates to established control theory concepts. The authors should also ensure that all theorem statements include the complete set of assumptions and address minor inconsistencies in figures and notation for better readability.
