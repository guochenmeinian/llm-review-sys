### Key Points
This paper presents the concept of pseudo-intelligence, which evaluates learning algorithms based on their indistinguishability from real experts under limited resources. The authors propose a framework for evaluating large language models (LLMs) that emphasizes the dynamic interaction between the model and a learned evaluator, suggesting that claims of intelligence are meaningful only when considering the evaluator's capabilities. The paper conveys three main messages: (1) Intelligence claims must be supported by a clearly defined evaluator, (2) resources for evaluation should match those for model development, and (3) self-evaluation cannot substantiate intelligence if the evaluator is derived from the model itself.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a fresh perspective on evaluating LLM capabilities.
- It presents a meticulous theoretical framework for understanding and evaluating pseudo-intelligence.
- The writing is clear and well-structured.

Weaknesses:
- The work is too preliminary, lacking concrete algorithms for learning models and evaluators.
- It does not sufficiently explore the conditions for successful learning within the proposed framework.
- The framework is criticized for being too general, limiting its utility for theoretical analysis.
- There is a lack of empirical validation or case studies demonstrating practical application.
- The paper does not adequately compare the proposed framework with existing evaluation methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by providing concrete examples or case studies that apply the concept of pseudo-intelligence to evaluate LLM capabilities. Additionally, we suggest conducting empirical studies to validate the proposed framework. To enhance accessibility, the authors should offer clearer explanations and examples of complex concepts like pseudo-intelligence and pseudorandomness. Finally, we encourage the authors to include a thorough comparison of their evaluation framework with existing methods to clarify its advantages and limitations.
