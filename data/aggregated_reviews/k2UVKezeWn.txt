Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new diagnostic tool, L-C2ST, for evaluating posteriors learned from simulation-based inference (SBI) without access to true likelihoods. The authors propose training a classifier to distinguish between samples from the true joint distribution \( p(x, \theta) \) and a variational approximation \( q(\theta | x) p(x) \). The classifier's performance is measured by how much its weights deviate from 0.5, with a hypothesis testing framework to assess the significance of these deviations. The method is extended for use with normalizing flows, allowing classification in latent space.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
* The paper addresses a critical need for trustworthy diagnostics in variational posteriors, marking a significant contribution to the field.
* It is well-written, clearly motivated, and effectively explains the theoretical underpinnings of the proposed algorithm.
* The simplicity of the algorithm enhances its practical applicability.

Weaknesses:
* There is skepticism regarding the ease of learning the proposed classifier compared to the variational posterior, raising concerns that good posterior fit diagnostics could stem from suboptimal classifiers.
* The benchmarking lacks depth; empirical relationships between L-C2ST and existing measures should be explored further.
* Minor technical issues in the proofs and theorems regarding measure zero sets could affect rigor.
* The scalability of the method to high-dimensional data remains untested, and comparisons with local-HPD are insufficiently detailed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical validation of L-C2ST by adding scatter plots comparing L-C2ST to true C2ST where ground truth is available. Additionally, conducting benchmarks with higher-dimensional data would help assess scalability. An analysis of the runtimes of L-C2ST versus local-HPD should be included to clarify efficiency claims. We also suggest addressing the minor technical points in the proofs for greater rigor. Finally, a limitations section detailing scenarios where L-C2ST may produce noisy estimates would enhance the paper's clarity and robustness.
