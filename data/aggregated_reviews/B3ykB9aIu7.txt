### Key Points
This paper presents CONFLATOR, a method utilizing switching point-based rotatory embeddings for code-mixed language modeling. The authors review existing positional embeddings and introduce their approach, which can be likened to an electromagnetic wave that changes rotation direction with language switches in the input. The paper is well-written and relevant to the workshop.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The introduction and review of existing work are well articulated.  
- The approach is innovative and relevant to the field of code-mixed language modeling.  

Weaknesses:  
- The explanation of the approach and results is rushed, lacking necessary detail.  
- Section 6.2 is difficult to follow, particularly regarding the role of unigrams and bigrams.  
- The clarity of the Conflator architecture and experimental setup is insufficient, making it hard to grasp.  
- Certain acronyms, such as 3HA, are not defined, leading to confusion.  
- Minor typos and writing issues are present throughout the paper.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and detail in the explanation of the approach and results, particularly in Section 6.2, by elaborating on the relevance of unigrams and bigrams. Additionally, please clarify the integration of different types of positional embeddings into the vanilla transformer in Section 6.3 and the Results section. We suggest expanding Section 7.1 to clarify the data used for pre-training and the training of BERT and GPT-2. It would be beneficial to define all acronyms, including 3HA, to enhance understanding. We also advise careful proofreading to address minor typos and writing issues. Lastly, please elaborate on Equation 1 to ensure it is self-contained and correct "CONFALTOR" to "CONFLATOR" in Figure 4.
