### Key Points
This paper presents a new task, Uniform Complexity for Text Generation (UCTG), aimed at evaluating whether generative language models can produce continuations with the same complexity as the given prompts. The authors analyze 176 features by comparing human prompts with continuations generated by humans and various GPT-2 models. The findings indicate inconsistencies in complexity between prompts and continuations for both humans and models, although some psycholinguistic features show correlation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a linguistically and cognitively motivated task that is novel and interesting.
- It is well-written and organized, with thorough reporting of results.
- The exploration of text complexity is a valuable contribution to the field.

Weaknesses:
- The assumption that text should maintain uniform complexity is questionable, as various counter-examples exist.
- The analysis is limited to GPT models, restricting the generalizability of results.
- The complexity metrics used appear miscalibrated, as they indicate that humans do not maintain complexity, contradicting the authors' intuition.
- Presentational issues exist, particularly regarding the clarity of tables and the need for visualizations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the assumption that "humans will maintain complexity between a text prompt and its continuation," especially in light of the complexity metrics. Additionally, we suggest expanding the analysis to include a broader range of models beyond just GPT-2, as well as providing results from models not fine-tuned on the test set. To enhance clarity, we advise the authors to include consistent references to tables in the text, clarify what the reported values represent, and consider adding visualizations to illustrate major trends. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore the potential for UCTG to serve as an automatic evaluation metric, which would significantly increase the paper's value to the community.
