Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents PiSSA, a novel initialization strategy for LoRA fine-tuning that utilizes singular value decomposition (SVD) to initialize matrices A and B based on the top r singular values, while the pre-trained weights are initialized with the remaining components. The authors demonstrate that this approach leads to faster convergence and improved performance on natural language generation (NLG) and natural language understanding (NLU) tasks compared to traditional quantization techniques like NF4. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PiSSA over standard LoRA and other quantization methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The theoretical motivation is clear, and the method is well-explained.  
- Empirical results show significant improvements in quantization error and convergence speed, supported by comprehensive ablation studies.  
- The paper is well-organized and presents the new idea effectively.

Weaknesses:  
- The absence of error bars raises questions about the statistical significance of the results.  
- Claims regarding LoRA gradients pointing in random directions lack experimental verification and require further clarification.  
- PiSSA is not compared to other common initialization schemes, such as uniform Gaussian or Kaiming initialization, nor to recent LoRA enhancements like AdaLoRA and DoRA, which would strengthen the paper's contributions.  
- Some experimental details are missing, such as the evaluation settings for benchmarks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the literature review by providing more granularity and explicitly discussing how AdaLoRA leverages SVD compared to PiSSA. Additionally, please include error bars and conduct significance tests for all experiments to validate the results statistically. A comparison of PiSSA with other initialization methods and recent LoRA adaptations would enhance the paper's robustness. Finally, addressing the missing experimental details, such as the evaluation settings for GSM8K and other benchmarks, will improve the overall quality of the paper.
