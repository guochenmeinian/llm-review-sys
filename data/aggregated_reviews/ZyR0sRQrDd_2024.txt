Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents OPS, a novel framework for occupancy prediction in autonomous driving, formulated as a direct set prediction problem using a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. The authors propose this approach to predict occupied locations and classes simultaneously, eliminating the need for explicit space modeling. The OPS framework demonstrates superior performance on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset, achieving improved RayIoU scores and addressing traditional mIoU overestimation issues. An ablation study highlights the effectiveness of strategies such as adaptive re-weighting, consistent point sampling, and coarse-to-fine prediction.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- **Clarity:** The paper is well-written and presents the problem formulation, methodology, and results clearly, with informative figures.  
- **Quality:** The OPS framework is thoroughly described, and experimental results validate its merits, particularly in RayIoU.  
- **Novelty:** The introduction of sparsity in occupancy prediction and the use of a point cloud + set prediction approach are innovative and effective.

Weaknesses:  
- **Technical soundness:** The use of Chamfer distance as the main objective function is sub-optimal and complicates the system, making comparisons potentially unfair.  
- **Limited Evaluation:** The evaluation is restricted to the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset; additional datasets like SemanticKITTI or Waymo Open Dataset would enhance generalizability.  
- **mIoU Performance:** While OPS excels in RayIoU, its mIoU performance lags behind dense models, which could impact its appeal for safety-critical applications.  
- **Lack of Qualitative Analysis:** More thorough qualitative analysis of predictions, including failure cases and the impact of proposed strategies, would provide deeper insights.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the technical contributions by rephrasing the contribution list to emphasize key technical ideas, such as Consistent Point Sampling. Additionally, addressing the use of Chamfer distance and its implications for comparison in the rebuttal would strengthen the paper. We suggest expanding the experimental evaluation to include additional datasets to assess generalizability. Furthermore, discussing the implications of mIoU performance on safety-critical tasks in the next version of the paper would be beneficial. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide a more detailed qualitative analysis of predictions to enhance understanding of the method's strengths and weaknesses.
