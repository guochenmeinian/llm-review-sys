Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a variational formulation of Doob's h-transform, transforming the problem of expensive trajectory simulations into an optimization problem over possible trajectories with specified initial and terminal conditions. The authors propose a simulation-free variational optimization method to estimate the h-function, leveraging a least action principle and Gaussian approximations. The method is applied to transition path sampling in molecular simulations and protein folding tasks, demonstrating its efficiency compared to traditional methods. Additionally, the authors have clarified their proposed framework in response to reviewer concerns, which has led to an increased score from the reviewers.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors provide a clear background on Doob's h-transform, supported by proofs in the appendix.
2. The paper effectively highlights the challenges of the optimization problem and offers an efficient solution.
3. The related work section is comprehensive and connects well to relevant topics.
4. The authors have provided thorough clarifications and addressed concerns effectively, resulting in a positive response from reviewers.

Weaknesses:
1. The path histograms in Figure 2 are cluttered; fewer samples would enhance clarity.
2. The paper lacks a learning curve and more detailed training information.
3. The experimental evaluation is limited, particularly regarding the Chignolin protein, and lacks comparisons to various baselines.
4. The connection to Doob's h-transform in Section 3.2 is not clearly established, and the implications of Gaussian parameterization on accuracy are not discussed.
5. Further effort is needed to enhance the presentation of the proposed framework, as noted by one reviewer.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the path histograms in Figure 2 by reducing the number of samples. Additionally, including a learning curve and more training details would enhance the paper. We suggest providing a plot showing the Max Energy as a function of training epochs to better illustrate the performance of the variational approach. Furthermore, a discussion of the limitations of the approach should be included in Section 6, addressing the robustness against model misspecification and the implications of Gaussian parameterization. Lastly, clarifying the notation introduced in Eq. (6) and ensuring that the sampling process accounts for dependencies between states would strengthen the manuscript. We also recommend that the authors enhance the presentation of the proposed framework by incorporating the points discussed in the rebuttal.
