### Key Points
This paper presents a study on multimodal out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, leveraging a vision language model to combine text and image modalities. The authors propose a method that enhances OOD detection performance by extracting high-quality descriptors for each class label and calibrating them through multiple steps. The method demonstrates improved performance over existing approaches, with experiments illustrating the contributions of each model component. The paper also addresses the challenges posed by hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) and introduces a consistency-based uncertainty calibration method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The methodology shows good performance without requiring additional training.
- The novel calibration method for long-form and structured descriptors is both innovative and practical.
- Comprehensive experimental comparisons effectively illustrate the strengths of each component.

Weaknesses:
- The explanation of specific experimental setups is lacking, making it difficult to evaluate the validity of the results.
- The reliance on a third-party model for descriptor creation may undermine the model's advantages.
- The validation of hypotheses regarding descriptor faithfulness is not sufficiently concrete, complicating the establishment of clear correlations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental setup descriptions, particularly in lines 203-206 and 211-217, to provide a better understanding of how descriptors were extracted and utilized. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify how similarity scores were derived from multiple descriptors in lines 220-227. To enhance the soundness of the paper, we advise the authors to address the reliability issues associated with LLMs and image detectors. Furthermore, we recommend splitting Table 2 into multiple tables or subtables for clearer presentation of results. Lastly, exploring alternative models like ChatGPT or GPT-4 for generating descriptions could be beneficial.
