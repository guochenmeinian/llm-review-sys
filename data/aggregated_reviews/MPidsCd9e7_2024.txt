Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an algorithm for adversarially robust $L_p$ estimation in the turnstile streaming model, achieving improved space complexity for $p \in (1, 2)$. The authors enhance the dense-sparse tradeoff technique from existing algorithms by focusing on tracking heavy-hitters and estimating a residual. The results include an adversarially robust streaming algorithm for the heavy-hitters problem and for estimating the residual of the frequency vector, supported by empirical experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors effectively situate their work within prior research, clearly articulating how their results differ and improve upon existing methods.
- The paper provides a conceptual breakthrough, demonstrating that the previous bound of $\tilde{O}(m^{p/2p+1})$ is not tight, and presents a non-trivial improvement in the context of heavy hitters and moment estimation.

Weaknesses:
- The improvement over previous work appears minimal, with only slight reductions in space complexity for specific values of $p$. The most significant enhancement is for $p=1$, while other improvements are incremental.
- The preliminaries are confusing; a clearer introduction to the setting and definitions of variables is needed. Additionally, the empirical evaluations' purpose is unclear, particularly regarding their relation to the algorithm's worst-case guarantees.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction by providing a more detailed explanation of the setting and definitions of variables. Additionally, addressing the confusion surrounding the variable \( b \) in Algorithm 3 would enhance understanding. Clarifying the purpose of the empirical evaluations in relation to the algorithm's performance guarantees is also essential. Finally, a discussion on potential barriers to the approach and the limitations of the results would provide valuable context for readers.
