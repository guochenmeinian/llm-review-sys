Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a unified single-loop zeroth-order gradient descent extragradient ascent (ZO-GDEGA) algorithm aimed at solving nonconvex-concave minimax problems more efficiently and robustly. The authors provide a theoretical analysis that guarantees an overall complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-6})$. Experimental results on data poisoning attacks and AUC maximization tasks validate the practical performance of the proposed method. The ZO-GDEGA is the first zeroth-order algorithm with complexity guarantees for stochastic nonconvex-concave problems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors propose a zeroth-order algorithm that achieves lower complexity under nonconvex-concave conditions.
2. The first convergence analysis of stochastic zeroth-order algorithms under nonconvex-concave conditions is provided.
3. The method shows improved complexity for nonconvex strongly-concave problems.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper does not discuss the complexity of first-order minimax algorithms in the related work section, which may undermine its novelty and contribution.
2. The contribution could be strengthened by considering variance reduction techniques as discussed in reference [18].
3. The figures in the experimental section are too small, and some curves are obscured by legends, suggesting a need for better presentation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion in section 2 to include the complexity of first-order minimax algorithms, as this could enhance the understanding of the novelty of their work. Additionally, the authors should consider incorporating variance reduction techniques to potentially strengthen their contribution. We also suggest that the authors enhance the clarity of their experimental results by resizing figures and possibly rearranging some sections to the Appendix for better readability.
