Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel label-only membership inference attack, termed One-Shot Label-Only (OSLO), which requires only a single query to the target model. The OSLO attack exploits the observation that member samples require more adversarial perturbation to misclassify than non-member samples. The method involves three phases: surrogate model training, creating transferable adversarial examples, and performing membership inference. The authors demonstrate that OSLO significantly outperforms existing label-only attacks across multiple datasets, achieving high precision and true positive rates.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to understand, even for non-experts.
- The proposed approach is novel and effectively organized.
- Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of OSLO compared to previous methods.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks discussion of important related works, particularly a recent label-only attack that also requires a single query, which is not compared to OSLO.
- Equation 2 is presented without defining its variables, making it less accessible.
- The discussion on potential countermeasures against OSLO is limited, and the computational costs associated with training multiple models may hinder practical application.
- The experimental setup lacks clarity regarding data splits and the number of models trained.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by including comparisons with relevant works, particularly the recent label-only attack that requires a single query. Additionally, please clarify the variables in Equation 2 to enhance understanding. Expanding the discussion on mitigation strategies and addressing the computational costs associated with model training would enhance the paper's practical relevance. Furthermore, we suggest providing a clearer explanation of the experimental setup, including the number of source and validation models used, and conducting an ablation study to investigate the contributions of different design elements.
