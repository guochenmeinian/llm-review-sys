### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of how large language models (LLMs) balance memorization and reasoning through the use of Knights and Knaves puzzles. The authors introduce a novel benchmark and the Local Inconsistency-based Memorization Score (LiMem) to quantify memorization's impact on reasoning tasks. Findings indicate that while LLMs excel on training puzzles, they struggle with minor modifications, revealing a significant reliance on memorization. However, higher memorization levels correlate with improved performance on unseen puzzles and resilience to perturbations, suggesting a complex relationship between memorization and genuine reasoning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The introduction of a Knights and Knaves puzzle-based benchmark offers a fresh and controlled method for evaluating LLMs' reasoning abilities.  
- The study provides valuable insights into the interplay between memorization and reasoning, showing that models with higher memorization levels generalize better and are more robust.  
- The novel LiMem metric effectively measures memorization in reasoning tasks, enhancing understanding of LLM capabilities.  
- The paper is well-structured and presents a thorough evaluation of both pre-trained and fine-tuned models.

Weaknesses:  
- The focus on a specific type of puzzle limits the generalizability of findings to broader logical reasoning challenges.  
- The paper lacks a comparative analysis with existing reasoning benchmarks, making it difficult to assess the proposed method's performance relative to state-of-the-art techniques.  
- Further clarification on the interpretation of LiMem scores is needed for readers less familiar with memorization in LLMs.  
- A deeper exploration of model complexity and scaling effects on memorization and reasoning would enhance the analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by incorporating a variety of logical reasoning benchmarks beyond Knights and Knaves puzzles. Additionally, providing a more detailed interpretation of LiMem scores would aid reader understanding. Finally, exploring the effects of model size on memorization and reasoning could further enrich the analysis.
