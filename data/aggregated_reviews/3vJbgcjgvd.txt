Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an approach to total treatment effect estimation under interference with an unknown structure, proposing a data-driven model for the dynamics of observed experimental outcomes over time. The methodology utilizes state evolution equations derived from approximate message-passing (AMP) to estimate treatment effects by propagating observed means and variances through this learned model. The authors also introduce an algorithm that generalizes existing estimation methods under network interference, efficiently utilizing data before system equilibrium without requiring knowledge of the network's interference matrix. The proposed method runs in time O(NT) and enhances accuracy by leveraging both first and second moments, unlike previous work that only considers the first moment. The methodology is validated through synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments, demonstrating its application beyond the original estimator's derivation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant problem in causal inference, contributing to the understanding of treatment effects under unknown interference.
- The data-driven model enhances flexibility by learning dynamics from observed data without requiring exact functional forms.
- The algorithm effectively generalizes treatment effect estimation methods and operates without prior knowledge of the interference matrix.
- It demonstrates scalability with a runtime of O(NT), making it practical for larger datasets.
- The use of both first and second moments enhances the accuracy of treatment effect estimations.
- Empirical analyses extend beyond the original experimental settings, showing improvements over existing baselines.

Weaknesses:
- The scope of the algorithm needs clarification, particularly regarding the dynamics defined in Equation 2, which may not generalize to real-world systems.
- The novelty of the contribution is unclear, as the extension of the causal message-passing framework appears limited to adding interaction terms without substantial theoretical backing.
- The algorithms rely on low-dimensional feature specifications, and the computational complexity of Algorithm 1 is not addressed.
- Clarity is lacking in several areas, including the justification for using state evolution modeling over direct modeling of Equation 2.
- The feature specification in Table 1 is limited to first and second moments, with higher-order moments yielding higher variance and MSE.
- Some reviewers expressed that their overall opinion on the paper remained unchanged despite the authors' clarifications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the algorithm's scope and its applicability to real-world scenarios. Specifically, they should discuss the necessity of the assumptions introduced in Section 2.1 and clarify the dynamics defined in Equation 2. Additionally, we suggest providing a more thorough comparison with related works to highlight the novel contributions of the HO-CMP algorithms. The authors should also address the computational complexity of Algorithm 1 and provide more detailed empirical results, including MSEs and convergence rates, to support their claims. Furthermore, we recommend improving the clarity of the feature specification in Table 1 by discussing the implications of excluding higher-order moments. Lastly, consider revising terminology such as "higher-order" to avoid confusion and ensure that the theoretical foundations of the proposed methods are explicitly stated, while also emphasizing the unique contributions and advantages of the proposed method more explicitly in the introduction.
