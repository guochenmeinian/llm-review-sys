Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents two datasets focused on 3D human reconstruction: Ava-256, which includes head captures from 256 subjects using high-resolution capture systems, and Goliath-4, featuring full-body captures of 4 subjects across multiple modalities. The authors propose that these datasets will enhance avatar generation by providing high-quality, multimodal data, including paired captures from both sophisticated setups and casual devices like smartphones. Additionally, the paper discusses consent forms detailing the study's purpose, capture devices, procedures, estimated time, and participant rights, asserting that participation is voluntary and participants can withdraw at any time while still receiving compensation. The authors have added context regarding these consent forms in response to reviewer inquiries. The submission also includes pretrained models for avatar generation, although some of these models appear to be previously published work.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The datasets are well-constructed, utilizing state-of-the-art capture systems that are not commonly accessible to many research labs.
- The inclusion of both high-end and smartphone captures fosters broader accessibility and applicability in avatar generation research.
- The authors provide comprehensive details about the consent forms, addressing reviewer concerns.
- The paper is well-written, clearly outlining the datasets' scope and contents, and provides a website for additional information.
- The rebuttal has clarified some theoretical doubts and resolved editing issues, leading to improved reviewer ratings.

Weaknesses:
- The scale of the datasets is limited compared to recent releases like MVHumanNet and DNA-Rendering, which may affect their long-term relevance.
- Claims regarding the datasets' generalizability and completeness are seen as overstated, particularly given the small number of identities in Goliath-4.
- The discussion around the headset capture's significance is shallow, lacking depth in motivation and implications for avatar generation.
- The manuscript lacks clarity regarding the generalization of results, particularly concerning head-only avatars versus complete bodies.
- There is ambiguity about the training data used for models, raising concerns about reproducibility.
- The phrasing regarding participants' rights to data deletion may not adequately reflect ethical considerations across different jurisdictions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their claims regarding generalizability and completeness, particularly in light of the limited scale of the datasets. It would be beneficial to provide more technical details about the capturing systems, including camera and light models, and calibration procedures. Additionally, we suggest incorporating comparisons with existing datasets to substantiate the advantages of their dataset, particularly in terms of segmentation accuracy and the effectiveness of the provided models. The authors should also consider including qualitative results for the generalizable face encoder and exploring advanced compression methods like VVC or WEBP to enhance data efficiency. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors explicitly state that generalization is limited to head-only avatars and not complete bodies, addressing the misleading implications in the title and introduction. They should clearly delineate what data was used for model training, distinguishing between released and internal datasets to enhance reproducibility. Finally, providing a more explicit explanation of participants' rights regarding data deletion in line with ethical standards would strengthen the ethical considerations of the work.
