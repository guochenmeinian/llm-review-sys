Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on dataset valuation, focusing on quantifying the contributions of multiple datasets to machine learning model performance. The authors analyze the computation of the Shapley value, treating each dataset as a player, and propose the "Discrete Uniform" Shapley values (DU-Shapley) as an efficient approximation method. The theoretical foundation is supported by three synthetic use-cases, demonstrating asymptotic convergence and non-asymptotic guarantees. Empirical evaluations against permutation-based Monte Carlo approaches on benchmark datasets, including OpenDataVal tasks, are also provided.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The exploration of dataset valuation is significant, addressing an important research question.
- The paper is well-structured, with precise mathematical notation.
- The theoretical results for synthetic use-cases are compelling and relevant for computability.
- Empirical performance on OpenDataVal tasks shows promise.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental evaluation is limited, primarily comparing DU-Shapley against permutation sampling, neglecting stronger baselines like KernelSHAP and SVARM.
- There is no assessment of whether DU-Shapley's assumptions hold in real-world applications, raising concerns about the relevance of synthetic use-cases.
- Section 3.2 lacks clarity, particularly regarding the derivation of (10) from Definition 3, and the intuition behind these definitions is not well articulated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental evaluation by including comparisons against stronger baselines, such as KernelSHAP and SVARM, to better contextualize DU-Shapley's performance. Additionally, we suggest evaluating the applicability of DU-Shapley in real-world scenarios to validate the assumptions made in synthetic use-cases. Clarifying Section 3.2, particularly the derivation of (10) and the relationship to Definition 3, would enhance understanding. Lastly, consider providing a pseudo-code algorithm to elucidate the DU-Shapley approach and its implementation.
