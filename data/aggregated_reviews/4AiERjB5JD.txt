### Key Points
This paper presents an unsupervised text style transfer method utilizing prefix-tuning of GPT-2, incorporating three types of prefixes: style, content, and task. The authors propose an adversarial framework with a generator and discriminator, aiming to enhance style transfer while preserving content. The method is evaluated on Yelp and IMDb datasets, demonstrating effectiveness through automatic and human evaluations, as well as ablation studies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method introduces a novel approach based on GPT-2 for unsupervised text style transfer.
- The use of three different prefixes provides comprehensive information to the model, improving performance.
- The methodology is well-structured, and the implementation is thorough, yielding solid results.

Weaknesses:
- The work is incremental, closely resembling the framework of (Dai et al., 2019), and lacks novelty.
- Evaluation is limited to sentiment transfer tasks, with no exploration of other styles or datasets.
- The experiments compare a small number of baselines, omitting recent and relevant models, and lack analysis of the generator's training losses.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the problem statement, explicitly addressing the need for text style transfer and the implications of using generative models. Additionally, we suggest expanding the evaluation to include diverse styles and datasets beyond sentiment transfer, as well as incorporating more recent baselines such as DelRetri, Template, UnsuperMT, and DualRL for a more comprehensive comparison. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide a detailed analysis of the three losses used to train the generator to enhance understanding of their contributions.
