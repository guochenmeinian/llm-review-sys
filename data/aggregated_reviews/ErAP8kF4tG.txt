Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents logarithmic regret bounds for Bayesian bandits using the BayesUCB algorithm, specifically addressing Gaussian multi-armed bandits (MABs) and linear bandits. The authors improve upon prior works that established standard $\sqrt{n}$ regret bounds, demonstrating finite-time logarithmic regret bounds that scale as $O(c_h \log^2 n)$ for Gaussian bandits and $O(c_\Delta \text{polylog} n)$ for linear bandits. The empirical results support the theoretical findings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The writing is generally clear, with a well-defined problem setup and results.
- The proofs are straightforward and comprehensible.
- Numerical simulations validate the theoretical claims.

Weaknesses:
- The contributions of the paper are not clearly articulated, particularly how the techniques differ from prior works.
- The scope of the experiments is limited, raising questions about their robustness and applicability.
- The paper does not match Lai (1987) asymptotically, which may undermine the rigor of the theoretical claims.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions by explicitly detailing how their techniques differ from prior works. Additionally, the authors should address the mysterious parameter $\epsilon$ in the main text by setting it to canonical values. The interpretation of the bounds could be enhanced by providing intuition for the $\xi_a$ functions and the term $\sum_a \int_{\theta_{-a}}$. We suggest that the authors extend their analysis beyond Gaussian settings and explore the implications of model misspecification. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to conduct more extensive experiments, including tuning confidence widths for BayesUCB and UCB1, plotting confidence bands, and demonstrating the robustness of BayesUCB against real-world datasets. Lastly, we advise revising the title to reflect the finite-time nature of the bounds more accurately.
