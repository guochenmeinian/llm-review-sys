### Key Points
This paper presents a new dataset of 11,300 multimodal tweets with stance annotations towards 113 different frames of communication related to COVID-19 vaccination. The authors evaluate baseline models on this dataset and propose a data augmentation approach that generates 46,606 synthetic training samples. The work aims to address the multimodal stance detection task, which combines text and images, a departure from previous methods that primarily relied on text.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a well-motivated and theoretically solid multimodal stance detection dataset.
- It utilizes a combination of unimodal and multimodal models, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating text and images for stance prediction.
- The dataset collection procedure is well explained, and the evaluation is exhaustive.

Weaknesses:
- The concept of "communication frames" is not clearly defined, raising questions about its novelty and advantages over traditional stance detection.
- The evaluation is limited to existing baselines without proposing new approaches for stance detection.
- The data augmentation method, while intuitive, lacks novelty, and the necessity of presenting Text-Image Relations is questionable.
- There is a lack of diversity in the collected data, and deduplication of similar tweets was not conducted.
- The writing quality poses a significant reading challenge.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the concept and application scenarios of "communication frames" and address whether stance detection towards these frames is a novel task. Additionally, the authors should consider proposing new approaches for stance detection rather than relying solely on existing baselines. We suggest simplifying the data augmentation method or exploring more generic methods like self-training. Furthermore, we advise annotating both text-based and image-based stances simultaneously to avoid incorrectly predicted relations. Lastly, improving the writing quality and providing more details about the annotators and dataset statistics would enhance the paper's clarity and comprehensibility.
