Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a zero-shot method for non-rigid shape matching that integrates unsupervised functional map regularisation and non-rigid shape deformation regularisation. The authors propose a method that combines intrinsic information from functional maps with extrinsic information from shape deformation, resulting in improved matching performance over methods relying solely on either type of information. The proposed method demonstrates competitive results on standard shape matching benchmarks, outperforming axiomatic approaches and achieving comparable performance to both supervised and unsupervised learning-based methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and clearly explains both the motivation and the proposed method, with technical details well illustrated in the supplementary material.
- The method incorporates spatial alignment through shape deformation regularisation, enhancing matching performance compared to existing methods focused solely on functional map regularisation.
- The use of PriMo energy for deformation regularisation results in smoother and more natural shape deformations, as evidenced in the supplementary material.

Weaknesses:
- The distinction between the proposed zero-shot method and previous unsupervised methods is not adequately discussed, as prior methods could also be considered zero-shot for single shape pairs. More explanation and experiments are needed.
- The average runtime of approximately 70 seconds on the FAUST dataset is significantly slower than existing learning-based methods, necessitating further discussion and experimentation on runtime efficiency.
- The method's robustness to rotation and its performance on partial shape matching scenarios are not sufficiently addressed, limiting its applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the differences between their method and previous unsupervised methods, providing additional experiments to clarify this distinction. Furthermore, a thorough analysis of the runtime performance should be included, potentially exploring test-time adaptation strategies used in prior works. We also suggest providing insights into the rotation robustness of the proposed method and including results for partial shape matching in the supplementary material. Additionally, clarifying the number of LBO eigenfunctions used for functional map computation and discussing the implications of this choice would enhance the paper's technical depth. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the role of the autoencoder in the optimization process and consider visualizing the feature extractor's performance.
