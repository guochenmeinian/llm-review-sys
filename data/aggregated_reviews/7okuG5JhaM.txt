### Key Points
This paper presents a novel corpus, SIRAC, aimed at evaluating the legal reasoning capabilities of ChatGPT using the IRAC (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) method. The dataset comprises 50 annotated legal scenarios from the Australian Social Act and the Contract Acts of Malaysia. The authors empirically assess ChatGPT's performance, revealing its struggles in generating reasoning paths aligned with legal professionals. The study highlights the relevance of the topic for both the NLP community and legal scholars.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The creation of the SIRAC dataset is a significant contribution to legal NLP, providing valuable resources for legal professionals and researchers.
- The methodology and evaluation are clearly articulated, enhancing the reader's understanding of the study.
- The paper addresses a timely and relevant topic, offering insights into the limitations of current LLM technology in legal reasoning.

Weaknesses:
- The focus on only two jurisdictions (Malaysia and Australia) limits the generalizability of the findings to other legal systems.
- The paper lacks a comprehensive review of related work on the IRAC methodology, which would strengthen its theoretical foundation.
- The dataset's small size (50 scenarios) may affect the robustness and applicability of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related works to better contextualize the IRAC methodology within existing literature. Expanding the dataset to include a more diverse range of legal scenarios from various jurisdictions would enhance the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, a more thorough explanation of the experimental setup is necessary to clarify the methodology and avoid potential misunderstandings. Finally, addressing the limitations of the dataset and providing insights into how the results could be improved would strengthen the paper's contributions.
