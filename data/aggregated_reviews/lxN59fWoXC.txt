### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative data-centric approach for calibrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), focusing on modifying graph structures to enhance calibration performance without compromising classification accuracy. The authors introduce the concepts of "decisive" and "homophilic" edges, proposing a method called Data-centric Graph Calibration (DCGC) that adjusts edge weights to improve the expected calibration error (ECE). The study includes extensive experiments validating the effectiveness of DCGC across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research addresses a significant and challenging problem in GNN calibration.
- The analysis is thorough, with a well-articulated motivation and extensive experiments demonstrating the proposed method's effectiveness.
- The paper is well-organized, with high-quality figures that clarify the findings.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution appears insufficient as the method builds upon existing frameworks without introducing novel concepts.
- The evaluation is limited to two backbone models (GCN and GraphSAGE), and additional models such as GAT and GIN should be included for a more comprehensive assessment.
- The relationship between the calibration target and the proposed edge weighting methods lacks justification, and the logic connecting experimental results to conclusions is not fully convincing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the design choice of modifying homophilic edge weights, possibly exploring alternatives such as edge removal or rewiring. Additionally, we suggest expanding the evaluation to include more backbone models beyond GCN and GraphSAGE to assess the generalizability of the proposed method. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the relationship between edge weighting and calibration targets, addressing the logical gaps noted in the review. Lastly, we recommend considering multi-dimensional metrics for calibration performance to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
