Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Fourier Neural Process (FNP) model, which addresses the limitations of existing data assimilation methods by effectively handling observational data of varying resolutions. The authors demonstrate the model's superior performance on the ERA5 dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results in assimilating key weather variables. The FNP model integrates neural processes with Fourier transforms, providing uncertainty estimates and preserving high-frequency information.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The FNP model successfully addresses the challenge of assimilating observational data of varying resolutions, offering uncertainty estimates compared to deterministic methods.  
2. The use of the Fourier neural operator preserves high-frequency information, enhancing performance as evidenced by experimental results.  
3. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance in arbitrary-resolution data assimilation for critical weather variables.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The ERA5 dataset lacks high-frequency information; validation on datasets with richer high-frequency data (e.g., HRRR) could strengthen the findings.  
2. The paper's technical clarity is insufficient, with key concepts like "spatial variable functional representation" and "dynamic alignment and merge" poorly explained, making it challenging for readers to grasp the model's functionality.  
3. The role of FNP in weather forecasting tasks is not thoroughly discussed or validated experimentally.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of technical terms and concepts, providing precise mathematical formalisms for key modules such as the “Spatial-variable decoupled representation,” the Neural Fourier layer, and DAM. Additionally, the authors should validate the model on datasets with richer high-frequency information to better demonstrate the effectiveness of the Neural Fourier layer. Finally, a more thorough discussion of the FNP's role in weather forecasting tasks would enhance the paper's contribution.
