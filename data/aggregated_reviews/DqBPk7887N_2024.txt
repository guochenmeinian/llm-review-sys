### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for generating adversarial patches to attack Vision Transformer (ViT) models in physical-world settings, introducing "G-Patch" as the first physical-world universal attack on ViTs. The authors propose an ingenious design that decouples the attacker's location from ViT input patches using a "deployer" module and enhances the patch generator's learning ability with a five-layer convolutional network. The methodology is thoroughly described and evaluated through synthetic tests and physical-world experiments, demonstrating significantly higher attack success rates (ASR) compared to existing digital attacks on ViTs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The writing is clear and understandable.
- The experiments demonstrate G-Patch's effectiveness in achieving high targeted attack success rates in both digital and physical settings.
- The approach addresses practical challenges of attacking ViTs, particularly their sensitivity to precise positioning.

Weaknesses:
- There is insufficient basis for why previous work cannot achieve generalization and positional randomness; a comparison with prior work is lacking.
- The scale of physical-world experiments is unclear, with results presented for only four objects/attacks.
- The decision process for determining patch sizes is not well-explained, and the patches appear excessively large for outdoor scenarios.
- The authors do not compare their model against existing physical-world attack baselines, limiting the evaluation context.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with previous work to clarify why their approach achieves better generalization and positional randomness. Additionally, consider conducting a more systematic experiment by selecting several locations on the victim object to evaluate the attack's effectiveness. It is also advisable to clarify the decision-making process for patch sizes and to include a baseline comparison using random noise patches of the same size. Finally, addressing the double referencing of the lead author names throughout the paper would enhance clarity.
