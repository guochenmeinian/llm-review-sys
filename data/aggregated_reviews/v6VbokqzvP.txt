Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method termed R3 (Review, Rephrase, Resolve) prompting to enhance reasoning performance in Large Language Models (LLMs) amidst noisy or irrelevant information. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of R3 prompting through empirical results across various datasets, showing significant improvements over baseline methods. The main contributions include the introduction of R3 prompting, application across diverse problem types, empirical validation against other methods, and a broader understanding of LLM performance in noisy contexts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers an innovative, multi-stage design that emulates human reasoning processes.
- Empirical evidence supports the superiority of R3 prompting over certain Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods.
- The methodology is straightforward and intuitive, making it easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation scope is narrow, limiting insights into the method's versatility across a wider range of tasks.
- There is a lack of in-depth ablation studies on each stage of R3 prompting, hindering understanding of their individual contributions.
- The paper does not provide complex examples or detailed error analyses, which could enhance understanding of the method's capabilities.
- There is no comparison with related works, particularly those involving interactive prompting, which diminishes the novelty of the contribution.
- The authors do not explore how R3 prompting could be adapted for different problem types or integrated into existing LLM training strategies.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation scope by testing R3 prompting across a broader range of tasks to demonstrate its versatility. Additionally, conducting in-depth ablation studies on each stage of R3 prompting would clarify their individual contributions to overall performance. The authors should include complex examples and detailed error analyses to provide a nuanced understanding of the method's capabilities. Furthermore, we suggest comparing R3 prompting with related works, particularly those involving interactive prompting, to highlight its novelty. Lastly, exploring adaptations of the R3 prompting strategy for different problem types and its integration into existing LLM training strategies could further enhance its applicability.
