Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Unsupervised Segment Anything Model (UnSAM) for interactive and automatic whole-image segmentation without human annotations. The method employs a divide-and-conquer strategy using CutLER for initial mask generation and iterative merging from SHOES for refinement. The authors claim that UnSAM achieves state-of-the-art results and improves segmentation performance by combining pseudo labels with a small amount of ground truth data from SA-1B. The authors also conducted ablation studies on various backbones and the number of masks, indicating that a larger backbone and an increased number of masks lead to improved outcomes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The results demonstrate solid performance improvements in unsupervised segmentation, reducing the recall gap between supervised and unsupervised methods.
- The two-stage approach combining CutLER and SHOES for pseudo-mask generation is reasonable and well-documented.
- The authors have effectively addressed reviewer concerns, leading to notable performance improvements.
- The additional experiments provide valuable quantitative results that support the paper's claims.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks experimental proof that unsupervised training of UnSAM consistently outperforms fully supervised SAM as dataset size increases, only showing better semi-supervised results.
- Technical contributions are unclear, with limited novelty as the method heavily relies on existing works like CutLER and SHOES without adequately distinguishing its innovations.
- There is a lack of clarity regarding the evaluation protocol, particularly concerning the number of masks used for assessing recall and the robustness of threshold hyperparameters.
- The paper does not adequately compare with previous interactive segmentation methods, nor does it include tests for interactive segmentation performance metrics such as the number of clicks.
- There is a potential misunderstanding regarding the formulation of bottom-up clustering, as indicated by the reviewerâ€™s comments on lines 167-173.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their technical contributions by explicitly detailing the differences between UnSAM and prior works like SHOES and MIS. Additionally, conducting a thorough evaluation of interactive segmentation performance and including comparisons with methods such as SimpleClick would strengthen the paper. Addressing the robustness of the threshold hyperparameters and providing a consistent evaluation protocol for the number of masks used in recall assessments are also crucial for enhancing the paper's credibility. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors clarify the formulation of bottom-up clustering in lines 167-173 to avoid any confusion. Finally, we suggest including a limitation section that discusses potential failure cases to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's performance.
