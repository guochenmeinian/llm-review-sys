Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a bidirectional consistent diffusion framework for instantaneous trajectory prediction, utilizing two coupled diffusion models to predict unobserved historical and future trajectories. The authors introduce a gating mechanism to manage noise in early prediction steps. The experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy on popular datasets, ETH-UCY and SDD.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and organized, making the methodology easy to follow.
2. The proposed solution effectively leverages complementary information from historical and future trajectories.
3. Extensive experiments validate the proposed method across multiple datasets and models, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation for the method may not align well with the task of instantaneous trajectory prediction, as it allows access to unobserved historical trajectories during training, which could skew comparisons with other methods.
2. The proposed solution is time-consuming, with a prediction time of 4 seconds, which is a significant limitation for real-time applications like autonomous driving.
3. Insufficient details are provided regarding the social and scene context used in the model, and the evaluation lacks failure cases that could provide deeper insights into model performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the alignment between the motivation and the experimental setup by clarifying the use of unobserved trajectories during training and its impact on performance comparisons. Additionally, addressing the long computation time by exploring potential optimizations would enhance the model's applicability in real-time scenarios. Including more recent baselines for comparison and providing detailed evaluations of failure cases would strengthen the paper's contributions. Lastly, clarifying the role of social and scene context in the model and discussing the implications of using a Bi-directional LSTM could provide valuable insights.
