Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a robust Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework called ERNIE, which utilizes adversarial regularization to promote Lipschitz continuity of policies, enhancing robustness against noisy observations, changing dynamics, and malicious actions. The authors reformulate the training process as a Stackelberg game to improve stability and extend the method to mean-field MARL. Experimental evaluations demonstrate ERNIE's effectiveness in traffic light control and particle environments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation connecting Lipschitz continuity with robustness in MARL.
- The method addresses training instability effectively through the Stackelberg game formulation.
- Comprehensive experimental results support the claims of improved robustness and performance.

Weaknesses:
- The clarity of the experiments section is lacking, with figures being barely legible and captions needing improvement.
- The writing can be inconsistent, particularly regarding the motivation and methods, leading to confusion about the specific robustness issues being addressed.
- The evaluation is limited to specific tasks, which may not fully capture the implications of smoothness on robustness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experiments section by enhancing figure legibility and providing clearer captions. Additionally, addressing the inconsistencies in motivation and methods will help clarify the paper's objectives. We suggest conducting experiments on simpler matrix games or small-scale multi-agent scenarios to better illustrate the connection between smoothness and robustness. Furthermore, including comparisons with existing robust MARL methods would strengthen the paper's contributions. Lastly, consider revising the organization of the paper to ensure related topics are presented cohesively.
