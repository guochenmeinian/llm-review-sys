Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel explainable AI (XAI) method called Clustered Compositional Explanations (CCE), which generalizes existing methods by analyzing neuron activations across multiple ranges rather than solely high activation thresholds. The authors aim to maximize the Intersection over Union (IoU) score between input activations and neuron activations across clusters, employing a heuristic algorithm named Min-Max Extension per Sample Heuristic (MMESH). Results indicate that CCE outperforms prior methods, such as CoEx and NetDissect, particularly in coverage metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively connects CCE with existing neuronal explainability methods, demonstrating improved coverage by explaining groups of neurons over broader activation ranges.
- The systematic interpretability analysis of neuron activations across different ranges is a significant contribution, revealing that lower activation ranges yield consistent interpretations for most neurons.

Weaknesses:
- The MMESH algorithm, while admissible, is complex and not easily understandable, potentially limiting its practical utility unless the authors release their code.
- The contributions are seen as incremental, with insufficient justification for the clustering approach and a lack of experiments across diverse models and datasets, raising concerns about overfitting.
- Several notational inconsistencies and potential redundancy in metrics, such as Activation Coverage, detract from the clarity and rigor of the presentation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the MMESH algorithm to enhance its accessibility for practitioners, possibly by providing a detailed explanation or releasing the code. Additionally, conducting experiments across a broader range of models and datasets would help validate the robustness of the proposed method. We suggest addressing the notational inconsistencies and clarifying the rationale behind the choice of five clusters, including potential ablation studies. Finally, we encourage the authors to discuss the implications of the results with and without ReLU activations to provide deeper insights into their findings.
