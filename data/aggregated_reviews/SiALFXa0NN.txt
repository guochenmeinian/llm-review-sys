Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents VerSAILLE, a novel method for verifying the safety of Neural Network Controlled Systems (NNCSs) using differential dynamic logic (dL) to derive specifications. The authors introduce Mosaic, an efficient verification method that extends existing neural network verification (NNV) tools to handle polynomial real arithmetic properties on piecewise linear neural networks. The evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of VerSAILLE and Mosaic in proving infinite-time safety across various benchmarks, including complex applications like airborne collision avoidance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The theoretical novelty is significant, with VerSAILLE providing sound proofs of infinite-time safety for NNCSs, reusing safety proofs from control-theory literature for the first time.
2. Mosaic enhances existing NNV tools by enabling them to handle polynomial queries while maintaining completeness.
3. The experiments are thorough, effectively demonstrating the proposed methods' capabilities through detailed comparisons with existing techniques.
4. The paper is well-written, with a running example that aids comprehension.

Weaknesses:
1. There is a notable gap between the theoretical contributions and the implementation, particularly regarding the limitations of the N3V tool, which only supports ReLU networks.
2. The introduction and related work sections lack clarity and readability, necessitating simplification and better organization.
3. The evaluation is limited to a few case studies, raising concerns about the generalizability of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction and related work sections by simplifying the text and organizing it into clearer paragraphs. Additionally, addressing the gap between theoretical contributions and implementation is crucial; the authors should clarify the reasons for this gap and the challenges in overcoming it. To enhance the evaluation, we suggest including a broader range of benchmarks beyond the current three case studies to validate the proposed methods more comprehensively. Finally, it would be beneficial to summarize key takeaways from the extended evaluation in the main body of the paper for better accessibility.
