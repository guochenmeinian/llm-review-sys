Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a diffusion-based cross-interaction sequential recommendation framework, T2Diff, which aims to enhance user behavior modeling in Two-Tower architectures. The authors propose a deeper interaction modeling framework that utilizes a diffusion module to reconstruct user intentions and a mixed-attention mechanism to capture interactive signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate T2Diff's superior performance compared to baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method T2Diff shows good performance against baselines.
- The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, including both offline and online experiments.
- The authors provide source codes, enhancing reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- The discussion of related work is insufficient, lacking engagement with recent advancements and limiting contextual understanding.
- The writing lacks clarity, with poorly explained figures and numerous unexplained symbols, reducing readability.
- The evaluation metrics, Recall@N and MRR@N, are undefined, and the effectiveness of the diffusion module is not directly evidenced.
- The proposed method may incur significant latency and complexity costs, which need further justification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing by providing detailed explanations for figures and symbols. Additionally, the authors should enhance the discussion of related work by including recent state-of-the-art models. To robustly demonstrate T2Diff's superiority, we suggest comparing it with recent diffusion-based sequential recommendation methods. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the calculation of Recall@N and MRR@N metrics and provide evidence for the effectiveness of the diffusion module. Finally, we encourage the authors to analyze the potential latency and complexity costs associated with the diffusion model and justify its use in the context of sparse user interaction data.
