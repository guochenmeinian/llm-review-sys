### Key Points
This paper presents a method for single-cell developmental trajectory inference from time-course single-cell data, utilizing optimal transport with conditional flow match in the latent space of a variational autoencoder (VAE). The authors introduce a regularizer to enforce Euclidean geometry in the latent space, addressing the challenge that the latent space is generally not Euclidean. The paper provides a solid background on VAE, optimal transport, and latent space geometry, although the mathematical details in the appendix are lacking. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
* The integration of optimal transport, conditional flow match, and VAE effectively addresses the trajectory inference problem.
* The model demonstrates promising results in benchmarking studies, particularly in interpolation tasks.
* The paper is well-organized and clearly written.

Weaknesses:
* The effectiveness of enforcing a Euclidean latent space versus using non-Euclidean geometries, such as hyperbolic geometry, is unclear.
* The absence of code and scripts for reproducing the results limits the paper's accessibility.
* There is no discussion regarding the time complexity of different models, which may hinder practical adoption.
* The pancreas dataset used is relatively simple; more complex datasets should be employed to showcase the model's strengths.
* Some writing issues exist, such as undefined terms like NND (likely nearest neighbour distance) and the variables N and M in density definitions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the regularization parameter $\lambda$, as it is critical to the model's performance. Additionally, conducting extensive experiments to evaluate the method's robustness against noise in scRNA-seq data would enhance the paper. Providing code and scripts for result reproduction is essential for transparency and usability. Finally, incorporating more complex datasets would better demonstrate the proposed approach's capabilities.
