Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the Max Cut and 2-CSP problems under noisy and partial prediction models. The authors propose algorithms that leverage predictions with a correctness probability of \( \frac{1}{2} + \epsilon \) to improve approximation ratios. Specifically, they achieve an approximation guarantee of \( 0.878 + \Omega(\epsilon^4) \) for the noisy prediction model and \( 0.858 + \Omega(\epsilon) \) for the partial prediction model. The work extends these results to 2-CSPs, marking a significant contribution to learning-augmented algorithms in approximation theory.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written, with clear explanations and sound proofs.  
- It provides significant improvements over existing approximation algorithms, addressing a fundamental question in algorithm theory.  
- The study of prediction-augmented algorithms for Max Cut and CSPs is innovative and may lead to further advancements in the field.  

Weaknesses:  
- The results are narrowly focused on specific problems, which may limit broader applicability.  
- The introduction could better emphasize the significance of the offline setting and how it differs from existing literature.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by elaborating on the practical advantages of utilizing predictions in the offline setting. Additionally, clarifying how their work differs from concurrent studies, particularly those by Bampis et al. and Ghoshal et al., would enhance the paper's context. Addressing the potential costs associated with acquiring predictions and discussing a computational upper bound for these costs could provide valuable insights. Lastly, we suggest including a discussion on deterministic predictions and their implications for the results presented.
