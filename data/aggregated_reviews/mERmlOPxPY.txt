### Key Points
This paper presents a method to enhance zero-shot multi-label classification of conspiracy theories in tweets using large language models, specifically GPT-3.5. The authors propose two low-effort techniques: i) Human-Written (HW) label definitions and ii) example-generated definitions (EG), which involve providing the model with 25 examples for each conspiracy theory. The study documents the semantic correlation between HW and EG definitions and their impact on classification performance, demonstrating that these approaches can improve results compared to standard zero-shot classification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written, structured, and easy to understand, even for those not deeply familiar with large language models.  
- The proposed techniques are efficient and complement each other, offering alternatives to time-consuming fine-tuning.  
- The analysis of "Definition Understanding" adds depth beyond mere classification performance.  

Weaknesses:  
- The reliance on a single dataset and model (GPT-3) limits the generalizability of the findings.  
- Some terms, such as "co-prediction" and "in-context," are not defined, which may confuse readers.  
- The paper does not explore alternative prompt specifications beyond label definitions, raising questions about the novelty of the contributions.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the correlation analysis by unifying the terminology used for Cohen’s kappa, Spearman’s correlation, and Matthews correlation. Additionally, we suggest expanding the evaluation to include multiple datasets and tasks to strengthen the results and conclusions. It would also be beneficial to define all technical terms clearly and to explore the impact of multi-label tweets on the effectiveness of the EG approach. Finally, consider discussing potential alternative prompt specifications beyond definitions to enhance the novelty of the work.
