Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a risk-averse active sensing approach (RAS) aimed at balancing timely and accurate outcome predictions with acquisition costs. The authors propose a decomposition of the policy into an acquisition scheduler and a feature selector, with a focus on high-risk patients through a risk-averse training strategy. The approach is evaluated using both synthetic and real-world datasets from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to three baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed continuous-time risk-averse active sensing method effectively addresses the trade-off between timely predictions and acquisition costs.
- It optimizes predictions specifically for tail-risk patients.
- Experimental results illustrate the performance of the proposed method against established baselines.

Weaknesses:
- The related work section lacks sufficient references despite the well-studied nature of active sensing over time.
- Certain descriptions of the problem and solution are unclear or relegated to the appendix, hindering comprehension.
- Missing or confusing notation definitions and unjustified decision choices detract from clarity.
- The experimental evaluation is limited to two datasets, one of which is synthetic, raising concerns about the robustness of the findings.
- The terminology regarding "cost pressure on patient trajectory acquisition" is unclear, and the budget on acquisition costs is inadequately integrated into the problem formulation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section by incorporating relevant references to position their work within the existing literature on active sensing and quickest change detection. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the problem and solution descriptions, particularly in Section 2.1, and ensuring that all notation is clearly defined. The authors should justify the structure of the proposed solution and the choice of the beta distribution for the policy. To strengthen the experimental validation, we advise expanding the evaluation to include more datasets and providing statistical significance for the results. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the terminology used and ensure that the budget for acquisition costs is explicitly stated in the problem formulation.
