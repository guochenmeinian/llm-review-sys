### Key Points
This paper presents the Hindsight-Sequence-Planner (HSP), a reinforcement learning (RL) model inspired by the brain's ability to achieve precise control using slow neurons. The authors propose that HSP mimics human-like sensory and reaction times by leveraging an environmental model for sequence learning. The model demonstrates competitive performance across various continuous control tasks, even with fewer observations and actor calls compared to faster RL models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The concept of mimicking brain-like conditions in RL models is innovative, offering a fresh perspective on sequence learning.  
2. The integration of a temporal recall mechanism allows for fine-tuned action sequence learning despite operating on slower hardware.  
3. HSP shows robust performance across various continuous control tasks, showcasing its adaptability.  
4. The experiments cover a range of tasks and provide comparisons with state-of-the-art models like Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), highlighting HSPâ€™s efficiency.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The paper lacks specific numerical performance comparisons to quantify improvements over baseline models.  
2. Sections like "Learning the Model" and "Learning Critic" need further elaboration to highlight their specific contributions and novelty.  
3. The broader implications and potential real-world applications of HSP are not fully discussed.  
4. The performance of the proposed framework does not show significant improvements over traditional RL methods, particularly when $J=16$.  
5. The novelty of the framework is questionable, as producing action sequences is common in control literature, and a detailed comparison with existing control algorithms is lacking.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the policy and evaluation sections, as some parts are difficult to follow. In particular, we suggest providing an overview at the beginning of the experiment section to clarify the structure and goals of each conducted experiment. Additionally, we recommend that the authors elaborate on how HSP handles situations with highly inaccurate model predictions and provide more specific numerical comparisons of HSP's performance gains over baseline models. A detailed comparison with existing control algorithms, such as model predictive control (MPC), should also be included to contextualize HSP's contributions. Finally, we encourage the authors to discuss the potential real-world applications of HSP more thoroughly, especially in relation to its performance on slow hardware.
