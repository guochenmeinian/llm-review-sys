Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SyncTweedies, a framework designed for generating diverse visual content, including ambiguous images, panoramas, mesh textures, and Gaussian splat textures. The authors propose a synchronization process that averages outputs of Tweedie's formula across multiple instance spaces, which eliminates the need for fine-tuning and preserves rich priors from large-scale datasets, enhancing generalizability. The paper analyzes various synchronized diffusion approaches and provides empirical insights, demonstrating the effectiveness of SyncTweedies across multiple tasks, including panorama image generation and 3D texturing.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-structured and enjoyable to read, with clear analysis of diffusion categories and task definitions.
2. The toy experiment is well-designed, effectively covering challenges across different task types and providing valuable empirical insights.
3. Extensive experiments demonstrate the versatility of SyncTweedies, showcasing its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques across various applications.

Weaknesses:
1. The depth-to-360Â° panorama result is blurry, raising questions about the underlying reasons for this discrepancy.
2. The paper lacks a discussion on generation diversity and how different noise initializations affect results and robustness.
3. Missing implementation details hinder understanding, particularly regarding the aggregation function for different tasks and the sampling of projected views.
4. The method assumes accurate projection and unprojection functions, which may not hold in practice, especially for complex transformations.
5. The theoretical basis assumes well-aligned data distributions, which may not be realistic, and the implications of misalignment are not explored.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on generation diversity, specifically addressing how different noise initializations impact results and the robustness of the approach. Additionally, we suggest providing more detailed implementation information, particularly regarding the aggregation function and the number of projected views for each task. The authors should also clarify how SyncTweedies handles projection errors and the implications of misaligned data distributions on performance. Lastly, we encourage the authors to tone down claims regarding the novelty of their method and to provide clearer explanations of the figures and methodologies used in the paper.
