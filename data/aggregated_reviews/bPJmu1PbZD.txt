Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents QuinNet, a novel method for molecular modeling that integrates five-body interactions using only dihedral angles. The authors discuss machine learning force fields, group equivariance, and empirical force field calculations, detailing their architecture's integration of five-body terms and mathematical formulations. Results demonstrate QuinNet's performance on low and high complexity datasets (MD17 and MD-22), showcasing its energy and force modeling capabilities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Originality: The architecture incorporates previously unutilized physical terms for molecular modeling.
- Quality: The method and experimental design effectively apply GNN models to molecular modeling, with a well-motivated architecture.
- Clarity: The paper cohesively presents its method through clear figures, mathematics, and experimental descriptions.
- Significance: QuinNet shows improved modeling performance, particularly in forces, and offers a framework for integrating physical interactions into GNNs.

Weaknesses:
- The discussion of limitations is unclear and lacks detail.
- Context for results in Figure 4 is insufficient, as MD simulations are briefly mentioned and easily overlooked.
- The benefits of a broader set of many-body interactions are inadequately contextualized in the experimental results.
- The motivation for the designed components of many-body interactions is not well explained, and the empirical performance does not consistently outperform baselines.
- The complexity analysis is limited, lacking detailed comparisons of time/memory costs with baselines and model parameters.
- The writing quality does not meet conference standards, with sections needing expansion and clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of limitations, providing clarity on QuinNet's applicability to various molecular sizes and systems. Additionally, we suggest adding more context for the results in Figure 4 and elaborating on the benefits of many-body interactions in the conclusion. The authors should clarify the motivation behind their component designs and provide quantitative evidence for their claims. Furthermore, we advise including a detailed complexity analysis with comparisons to other methods, as well as expanding the writing quality to meet conference standards.
