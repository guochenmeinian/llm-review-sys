Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new causal discovery method for learning linear Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) based on the assumption of few "root causes" and the presence of measurement noise. The authors propose an effective method to identify the true DAG, demonstrating its superiority over baseline methods through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. Identifiability of the weight matrix is established via an L0-norm objective, with a relaxation to L1-norm for practical applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The few roots assumption is well-motivated and reasonable.
- The proposed solution is simple and effective, with strong performance in synthetic experiments.
- The paper includes a useful identification result (Thm. 3.2) and conducts experiments on diverse datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The objective function in Eq. (10) lacks clarity regarding the inclusion of noise, requiring further explanation.
- The motivation for the new setting and examples, particularly the pollution model, is insufficiently convincing.
- The proposed method does not achieve optimal results on real-world datasets, raising doubts about the applicability of the few roots assumption.
- The definitions of "few roots" and "negligible noise" in (6) are not formal or clear.
- The paper does not adequately compare with constraint-based methods, such as the PC algorithm.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the objective function in Eq. (10) by providing a more detailed explanation and derivation. Additionally, the authors should enhance the motivation for the new setting by including more practical examples of DAG learning. It would be beneficial to clarify the definitions of "few roots" and "negligible noise" in (6) to ensure they are formal and clear. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors discuss LiNGAM's performance more thoroughly, as the theoretical framework relies on it, and consider including additional experiments to validate their findings. Lastly, a comparison with constraint-based methods should be included to address potential limitations related to the Markov property and faithfulness in the new formulation.
