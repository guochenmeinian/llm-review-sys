Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an examination of online learning within Stackelberg games, where both the leader and follower observe a shared context that influences their utilities. The authors propose a framework for analyzing these games, focusing on the leader's selection of mixed strategies and the follower's best-response actions. They evaluate no-regret algorithms using the concept of "policy regret," aiming for sublinear regret relative to an optimal fixed contextual policy. The authors provide various results, including an $O(T^{1/2})$-regret algorithm under certain conditions and an $O(T^{2/3})$-regret algorithm for the bandit case.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem of online learning in Stackelberg games with contextual information is well-motivated and relevant to the game theory and learning community.
- The paper is clear, well-organized, and presents rigorous analyses and sound results.
- The incorporation of side information into the model is novel and practically significant.

Weaknesses:
- The regret bounds for the bandit case are not tight, and the impossibility result relies on the infinite context space and non-linear model.
- The analysis of relaxed cases appears standard, making the contributions seem more like applications of existing techniques rather than novel advancements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including numerical experiments or case studies to validate the theoretical findings. Additionally, providing more clarity on the validation of the adversarial model for context selection and discussing the scalability of the algorithms in relation to the number of contexts or follower types would enhance the paper's impact. Addressing the potential limitations regarding the dependency on accurate modeling of side information and follower behavior would also strengthen the overall contribution.
