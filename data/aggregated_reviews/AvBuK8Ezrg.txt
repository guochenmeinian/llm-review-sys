Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents NeuroPath, a graph transformer that integrates structural (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) matrices to learn their relationship with brain functions. The framework employs a twin-branch design to generate coupled features of multi-hop neural pathways. Experimental results on large datasets, including HCP and UKB, demonstrate that NeuroPath outperforms state-of-the-art brain models in tasks such as neural activity classification and cognitive disorder diagnosis, showing promise for zero-shot learning. The model's interpretability is enhanced through visualization of key neural pathways contributing to its predictions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Comprehensive Integration of Connectivity Matrices: The model effectively incorporates multi-hop SC and FC matrices, addressing a significant gap in understanding the interplay between these neural interactions.
- Extensive Experimental Evaluation: NeuroPath's effectiveness is validated through rigorous experiments on large-scale datasets, consistently outperforming SOTA and traditional models.

Weaknesses:
- Thresholding Ambiguity: The paper lacks clarity on the thresholding process for SC and FC matrices, raising concerns about the comparability and validity of the results.
- Lack of Clarity on Theoretical Foundations: The explanation of Fact 3.1 and the concept of "expressive power" is insufficient, diminishing the theoretical contributions and overall comprehensibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the thresholding methodology used for deriving the SC and FC matrices, including details on the criteria and process for selecting these thresholds. Additionally, please ensure that identical thresholds are applied across all models tested, or provide a rationale for any variations. It would be beneficial to explore the sensitivity of the results to different threshold levels. Furthermore, we suggest providing a clearer definition of the model's "expressive power" and its implications for performance. Lastly, we encourage the authors to enhance the presentation of mathematical details and ablation studies for better comprehensibility.
