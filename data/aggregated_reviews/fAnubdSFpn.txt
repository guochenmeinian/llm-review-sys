Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a PID-based controller aimed at optimizing model accuracy and calibration through the proposed Relative Calibration Error (RCE). The controller dynamically adjusts the gradient decay rate to manage model confidence, while a learning rate compensation mechanism mitigates fluctuations in gradient amplitude. Empirical experiments validate the effectiveness of this approach, particularly in dynamic calibration for online machine learning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed RCE effectively highlights over-confidence and under-confidence, which the PID-based controller can exploit.
2. A clear illustration (Figure 3) connects the PID controller with model optimization.
3. Empirical results demonstrate the method's efficacy.
4. The potential application in dynamic calibration for online machine learning is promising.

Weaknesses:
1. The work lacks theoretical analysis, as noted in the appendix.
2. The contribution is not sufficiently differentiated from existing PID-related research in model calibration.
3. The balance between addressing over-confidence and under-confidence is inadequately analyzed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis of their method, as mentioned in the appendix. Additionally, we suggest including a related work section to thoroughly investigate existing research on PID controllers in model calibration. It would be beneficial to provide a sensitivity analysis for the PID controller parameters and discuss the choice of hyper-parameter values, such as the temperature coefficient $\tau$. We encourage the authors to explore different optimizers, particularly adaptive ones like Adam, to assess their impact on gradient fluctuations. Furthermore, we recommend elaborating on the strategy for selecting and tuning the P/I/D terms and providing more details regarding the threshold statement in $\textit{Line 178-179}$. Lastly, addressing the computational overhead and scalability of the proposed method in the limitations section would enhance the paper's practical implications.
