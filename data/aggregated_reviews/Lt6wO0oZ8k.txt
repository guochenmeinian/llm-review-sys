Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an algorithm for learning policy in multi-agent environments by predicting the subgoal intents of other agents, addressing the non-stationarity problem in multi-agent learning. The authors argue that predicting future states of opponents provides a strategic advantage, as demonstrated through examples and empirical validation across three environments. The method focuses on opponent modeling through subgoal inference, which is claimed to enhance performance in cooperative and general-sum games. The authors introduce the concept of "bridging the information gap between agents," emphasizing the importance of communication and information sharing for improved decision-making. They also clarify the distinction between autonomous agents and those that are jointly trained, asserting that their method addresses the limitations of existing approaches that focus solely on action prediction. Furthermore, the authors acknowledge feedback received and have addressed ambiguities while enhancing references to relevant literature.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is simple, interesting, and potentially more robust than traditional action prediction models.
- The paper is well-organized, providing ample context, clear formalization, and solid empirical evidence.
- Diagrams, pseudocode, and a dedicated ablation studies section enhance clarity and understanding.
- The introduction of a new framework in opponent modeling is a notable contribution.
- The authors effectively clarify complex concepts, such as the information gap and the nature of autonomy in agent training.

Weaknesses:
- Experimental results show only minor improvements over baselines, particularly in the Foraging environment, where the main difference is a reduction in episode steps.
- The authors exhibit overconfidence in claims regarding the superiority of their method without sufficient context or evidence.
- The definition of a subgoal as a feature embedding of a future state lacks soundness and clarity.
- The paper does not adequately address the originality of its contributions, overlooking significant prior work in goal recognition and inverse planning.
- Some statements describing existing methods as "short-sighted" or "pedantical" lack sufficient justification and could be perceived as unprofessional.
- The notation used for agents may cause confusion, deviating from established norms in game theory and MARL.
- The authors were unable to complete all suggested experiments before the discussion concluded, which may limit the current findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental design by selecting environments that amplify the impact of a single agent and increasing the number of trials to tighten confidence intervals. Additionally, we suggest analyzing in which contexts their method outperforms others rather than making broad claims of superiority. Clarifying the notation used for subgoals and revising the notation from $\pi^o, a^o$ to the standard $\pi^{-i}, a^{-i}$ would enhance the paper's rigor and align it with established conventions. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their language, particularly when critiquing existing literature, to ensure a more professional tone. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide a more detailed discussion of the implications of their experimental results, particularly in the Foraging task, to clarify the takeaways and reinforce the significance of their findings. Lastly, we suggest that the authors complete the remaining tests and include them in the revision to improve the completeness of their experimental results and consider further clarifying the distinctions between their method and existing approaches to strengthen their argument.
