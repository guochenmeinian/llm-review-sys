Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Guided Set Diffusion Model (GS-DM) for reconstructing polygonal shapes from floorplan and autonomous driving sensor images. The authors propose a two-stage reconstruction pipeline that includes a forward diffusion process to learn guidance networks, which address denoising ambiguity by establishing distinct Gaussian distributions for each polygon. The model is evaluated through comprehensive experiments, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods in reconstruction quality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively formulates reconstruction as a generation process conditioned on sensor data, advancing diffusion models for shape reconstruction.
- The approach of guiding noise injection per element addresses ambiguous denoising issues, leading to promising results for layout reconstruction.
- The method is well-presented, with clear illustrations and thorough evaluations.

Weaknesses:
- The computational costs of the iterative denoising process need better elucidation to highlight advantages over initial estimates.
- The challenge of selecting appropriate initial noise for reconstruction is not convincingly validated in experiments.
- The generalization of the guided diffusion process to data outside the training set is unclear, particularly when initial reconstructions differ significantly from training data.
- The paper lacks clarity on how polylines/polygons with varying vertex numbers are encoded, which is crucial for likelihood-based refinement.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity around the computational costs associated with the iterative denoising process and compare these with the base costs of initial reconstructions. Additionally, please provide experimental evidence supporting the claim that perturbations of the optimal noise can lead to failures in denoise-based reconstruction. Clarification is needed regarding the self-contradictory statement about permutation-invariant models and how the proposed permutation contrastive loss is defined. We suggest detailing how polylines/polygons are represented, as this impacts refinement. Furthermore, a clearer definition of the standard diffusion model in Section 5.3 is necessary to justify proposed components. Lastly, we encourage a thorough discussion on the limitations of the learned diffusion network, particularly regarding its generalization capabilities to hand-annotated inputs.
