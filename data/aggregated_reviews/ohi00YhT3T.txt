Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework that integrates 3D brain structures with visual semantics using a Vision Transformer 3D (ViT3D). By aligning fMRI features with visual embeddings through a unified feature extractor, it eliminates the need for subject-specific models and enhances decoding capabilities for tasks such as brain captioning and visual reconstruction. The method shows promise for applications in neuroscience and human-computer interaction.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The framework offers a multi-task visual neural decoding approach that is simpler and more elegant than previous methods.
- It introduces a novel method for precise localization of language-based concepts within brain signals using GradCAM.
- Promising results on NSD reconstruction and innovative analyses are presented.

Weaknesses:
- The Dual-Stream fMRI Feature Extractor is common in the field, and the combination of features appears suboptimal, with low-level features yielding inferior results compared to previous methods.
- Concerns about preprocessing methods and the assumptions made regarding inter-subject variability and BOLD signal linearity need to be addressed.
- The clarity of LLM interaction details and the evaluation metrics used in the empirical studies require improvement.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors benchmark the proposed method with more real-world fMRI datasets to evaluate generalizability and robustness. A discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of the method in comparison to existing approaches should be included, emphasizing interpretability and explainability. Additionally, please provide more details on the cross-validation technique employed, including the type and rationale for its selection, as well as the metrics used for evaluation. 

We suggest including pseudocode for the proposed method to enhance transparency and reproducibility. Finally, a thorough proofreading process is recommended to correct minor typos and grammatical mistakes throughout the paper.
