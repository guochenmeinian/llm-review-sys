### Key Points
This paper presents the concept of _objective awareness_, a specific form of out-of-context reasoning, validated through various experimental setups, including multiple choice and the "Make Me Say" game. The findings are significant for AI safety regulation, particularly in detecting backdoored models through direct questioning. The topic of implicit goal articulation aligns well with the workshop, and the analyses are thorough, encompassing numerous experiments across models, tasks, and personas. The paper contributes valuable insights into LLM safety.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The originality of introducing _objective awareness_ and validating it across diverse experimental setups.
- The thorough and creative evaluations, including indirect evaluations in the multiple-choice training experiment.
- The use of two distinct datasets and tasks, demonstrating the proposed methodology's versatility.

Weaknesses:
- Limited discussion on future research directions and how findings could be leveraged or expanded upon.
- Insufficient interpretation of results due to length constraints, particularly in the context of the "trigger condition" experiment.
- Lack of clarity regarding the configuration mentioned in the “Finetuning” section, specifically the setup involving instructions and a scratchpad.
- Difficulty in extracting key evaluation metrics and their relevance to conclusions, especially in the “Make Me Say” section.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on future research directions, exploring how the findings could inform subsequent studies and testing of objective awareness in additional tasks. We suggest expanding the interpretation of results, particularly for the "trigger condition" experiment, to provide deeper insights. Clarifying the configuration details in the “Finetuning” section would enhance understanding. Additionally, we encourage the authors to frame the evaluation metrics more clearly, indicating which are most critical and how they relate to the overall conclusions. Finally, exploring the robustness of finetuning in more mismatched data and evaluation scenarios would be beneficial.
