Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the application of k-NN graphs for classification tasks using tabular data, focusing on the Cross-Class Neighborhood Similarity (CCNS). The authors provide a theoretical framework to analyze the benefits of k-NN graphs and demonstrate through experiments that these graphs do not outperform structure-agnostic methods like MLP. They also present a formal analysis of CCNS and its implications for class separability in node classification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper presents a well-structured theoretical framework for analyzing k-NN graphs.
- It provides a formal analysis of CCNS and its lower bound.
- The authors conduct a robust comparison across multiple datasets, yielding results consistent with their theoretical findings.

Weaknesses:
- The assumptions made, particularly regarding attribute independence, may not hold in real-world datasets, limiting generalizability.
- The numerical experiments lack convincing empirical evidence, particularly concerning the construction of k-NN graphs and the application of GNN models.
- The paper does not sufficiently clarify the utility of its theoretical developments in relation to the experimental results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical validation of their theoretical claims by providing more comprehensive experiments that address the construction of k-NN graphs and the performance of various GNN architectures. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the implications of the assumptions made in the analysis and exploring their significance in practical applications. Finally, we encourage the authors to enhance the clarity of key equations and figures to facilitate better understanding among readers.
