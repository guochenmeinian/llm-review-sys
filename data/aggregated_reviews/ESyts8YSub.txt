### Key Points
This paper presents a method to enhance zero-shot task generalization through retrieval-augmented soft prompting, specifically using Retrieval of Soft Prompt (ROSPR). The authors propose training soft prompt embeddings for hard prompts, creating a source prompt library that retrieves relevant embeddings during inference. The experimental evaluation covers various tasks, demonstrating the method's efficacy in improving zero-shot capabilities while maintaining minimal computational overhead.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and provides clear explanations of the proposed framework.
- ROSPR consistently outperforms baselines across multiple tasks with minimal additional parameters.
- The use of a retriever-based source prompt library is straightforward and effective, leading to state-of-the-art performance.

Weaknesses:
- The idea of retrieval soft prompts lacks novelty, and the benefits of this approach for zero-shot generalization are not clearly articulated.
- The presentation is weak, particularly in Section 3, which lacks clarity, and Sections 5 and 6 are overly verbose.
- The paper does not adequately compare its approach to existing methods, such as those discussed in related work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation, particularly in Section 3, by providing preliminary information rather than solely referencing external sources. Additionally, the authors should include necessary comparisons with baselines in Figures 3 and 14 to contextualize their contributions. It is also crucial to clarify the number of queries used per test data instance in Table 1 and address the adaptability of the T0-3B soft prompt library for the T0-11B scenario. Finally, providing insights into the time constraints associated with the retrieval process would enhance the understanding of the method's practicality.
