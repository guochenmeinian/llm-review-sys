Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the optimal rate for parameter estimation in multivariate deviated models, specifically analyzing the model $(1-\lambda) h(x) + \lambda f(x|\mu,\Sigma)$, where $h$ is known. The authors propose using the concept of *distinguishability* to examine the convergence rate of parameters via Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) under both distinguishable and non-distinguishable scenarios. They provide three pairs of upper and lower bounds for different cases of distinguishability and support their theoretical findings with experimental results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is clear, with consistent notation throughout.  
- It includes comprehensive explanations and discussions around main results, enhancing readability.  
- The proofs are technically sound and sophisticated, with the notion of distinguishability being intuitive.  
- Lower bounds presented align with the convergence rates for all considered cases.  

Weaknesses:  
- The concept of distinguishability is not entirely novel, as similar ideas have been explored in prior works.  
- The related works section is overly concise.  
- The paper may be better suited for a statistically-focused journal rather than neurips, given its classical parametric approach.  
- The comparison to existing literature, particularly regarding heterogeneous mixture detection, is limited.  
- The experimental setup is constrained to Gaussian distributions, lacking broader numerical results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related works section to provide a more thorough literature review, particularly in relation to heterogeneous mixture detection. Additionally, we suggest shortening Section 3 and incorporating results from Appendix A into the main content, as Theorems 3.3/3.5/3.6 appear to be intermediate results that should not occupy excessive space. Furthermore, the authors should clarify how to obtain $h_0$ in practical applications and discuss how their results may guide methodology in real-world scenarios.
