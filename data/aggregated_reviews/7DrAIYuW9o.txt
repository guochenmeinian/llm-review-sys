### Key Points
This paper presents FUNU, a novel approach aimed at enhancing the efficiency of machine unlearning by filtering unnecessary unlearning requests. The authors propose a method that identifies similar data points, thereby optimizing computational resources. While the experimental design is robust and demonstrates significant improvements in unlearning time, the paper lacks direct relevance to security and privacy, as its "privacy guarantee" pertains only to model consistency rather than actual data protection.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- FUNU innovatively addresses the inefficiencies of traditional machine unlearning methods.
- The experimental results show significant reductions in unlearning time.
- The framework adapts to various unlearning scenarios and provides theoretical privacy guarantees.

Weaknesses:
- FUNU fundamentally focuses on optimization for unlearning efficiency without addressing data privacy or security, failing to meet the track's requirements.
- The method requires considerable computation time to identify similar data points, and there is a risk that crucial data may not be removed if similar points are found.
- The performance is dependent on accurately tuning parameters like similarity thresholds, which may vary by dataset.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the term "privacy guarantee" to avoid misleading readers regarding actual data protection. Additionally, the authors should provide pseudocode for the algorithm and clarify how FUNU can integrate with methods beyond SISA. It would also be beneficial to address the potential risks associated with not removing crucial data points and to include relevant literature to support claims made in section 3.2. Lastly, the authors should enhance the formatting of tables and images for better presentation.
