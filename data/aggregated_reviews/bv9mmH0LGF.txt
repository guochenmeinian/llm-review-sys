Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a diffusion-based framework for low-light image enhancement that incorporates global structure-aware regularization and uncertainty-guided techniques. The authors propose a method that divides images into patches, using clustering algorithms and matrix rank to minimize discrepancies between reconstructions. They claim that their approach is superior to existing methods, citing promising results on widely adopted datasets and emphasizing the challenges of integrating regularization into diffusion models. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms some state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques, although the authors acknowledge the competitive nature of the field and the necessity of recognizing prior works that have also demonstrated significant performance in this area.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The incorporation of global structure regularization via matrix rank modeling significantly improves performance compared to existing methods.
- The authors provide a clear claim of superior performance supported by experimental results, indicating a comprehensive literature review.
- The paper is well-written, and the supplementary material includes the code, facilitating reproducibility.
- The novel approach to regularization represents a meaningful contribution to the field of diffusion models.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution lacks convincing novelty, as the generality of the proposed method is not sufficiently verified, and some aspects are deemed generic.
- The integration of global structure regularization is critiqued as merely a loss function, lacking the depth implied by the term "seamlessly."
- Several unclear details exist, such as the specific training data used and the baseline settings in experiments.
- The method's reliance on matrix rank as a measure of global structure requires more justification and experimental validation.
- The effectiveness of uncertainty in the proposed framework is not clearly demonstrated, and some formulations lack clarity.
- The paper does not adequately compare with advanced clustering algorithms or other regularization terms that could enhance performance.
- There is a need for more citations to support claims made in the methodology, particularly regarding established techniques.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contribution by providing more robust experimental validation of the proposed global structure-aware regularization. Additionally, the authors should clarify the training data and baseline settings used in their experiments. It would be beneficial to include comparisons with advanced clustering algorithms and other regularization techniques to strengthen the paper's claims. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors elaborate on the importance of using global structure in their framework and justify the necessity of the additional module designed for this purpose. Addressing the unclear formulations and ensuring all references to tables and figures are accurate will enhance the overall presentation of the work. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide a more thorough explanation of the challenges faced in integrating regularization into their model to strengthen their claims and enhance the novelty of their architecture by incorporating more innovative elements.
