### Key Points
This paper presents a method called Dynamic Multi-network Mining (DMM) for subsequence clustering of tensor time series data, which includes multiple modes such as timestamps. DMM transforms tensor time series into segment groups characterized by sparse dependency networks with l1-norm constraints, aiming for interpretability, accuracy based on minimum description length (MDL), and scalability for large datasets. Experimental results indicate that DMM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in clustering accuracy and provides interpretable insights from both synthetic and real datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant and timely topic, enhancing the understanding of tensor time series data.
- DMM is scalable and interpretable, making it suitable for large and complex datasets.
- A comprehensive overview of related works demonstrates a solid grasp of existing literature.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity and motivation, which could hinder reader engagement and understanding.
- There is no notion of optimality in Problem 1, and the algorithm lacks performance guarantees, raising concerns about its robustness.
- The datasets used in experiments are small, which may limit the generalizability of the proposed approach.
- The methodology is complex, potentially making replication challenging.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and motivation of the paper by providing more intuitive explanations and examples, particularly in the introduction. Additionally, consider adding an optimality goal or criterion in Problem 1 to enhance the practical relevance of the algorithm. To strengthen the validation of DMM, we suggest conducting experiments on larger and more diverse real-world datasets and providing a more detailed comparison with a broader range of baseline methods, including traditional tensor decomposition techniques. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the application of the MDL principle in determining the number of clusters and segments, and to discuss potential measures for evaluating accuracy and interpretability in real-world datasets.
