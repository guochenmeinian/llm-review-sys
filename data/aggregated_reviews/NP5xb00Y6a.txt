Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to Item-side Group Fairness (IGF) in recommendation systems by incorporating social attributes of users. The authors propose two new social attribute-aware IGF metrics, NSP and NEO, and formulate a multi-objective optimization problem that balances direct and social utilities. A new optimization algorithm is introduced, theoretically guaranteed to approach restricted Pareto optimality. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a significant research area by integrating social attributes into IGF, enhancing the understanding of fairness in recommendation systems.
2. The introduction of two new metrics expands existing fairness metrics, considering user neighbor distributions.
3. The formulation of a multi-objective optimization problem allows for flexible trade-offs between utilities, providing practical solutions.
4. The development of a new optimization algorithm with theoretical guarantees adds rigor to the methodology.
5. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness across various datasets.

Weaknesses:
1. The introduction lacks detailed discussion of relevant work, relying heavily on legends that are not intuitively clear.
2. The experimental section is insufficiently detailed, lacking dataset descriptions and comparisons with other fairness indicators.
3. The analysis of model results is not thorough, with some proposed metrics not achieving strong performance.
4. Clarity issues exist in the presentation of the optimization algorithm and its theoretical guarantees.
5. The choice of matrix factorization as a backbone method is outdated; modern deep learning approaches could yield better insights.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by providing a more comprehensive review of relevant literature and clearly articulating the significance of their proposed metrics. In the experimental section, please include detailed descriptions of the datasets used and compare the proposed metrics against additional relevant fairness indicators. We suggest enhancing the analysis of model results, particularly for the NSP and SP metrics, and clarifying the presentation of the optimization algorithm and its theoretical guarantees. Additionally, we encourage the authors to explore modern deep learning methods, such as NeuMF and NGCF, as backbone models to assess the proposed approach's effectiveness more robustly.
