Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a family of mutual information (MI) estimators based on normalizing flows, proposing a Monte Carlo estimator applicable to any base distribution. The authors refine this estimator for Gaussian base distributions, allowing for analytical MI calculations, and introduce a simplified Gaussian base estimator with fixed mean and tridiagonal covariance matrices for easier computation. The methodology leverages trainable normalizing flows to transform data distributions, facilitating MI estimation in high-dimensional contexts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses the significant challenge of estimating information-theoretic measures for complex target distributions, demonstrating a sound mathematical treatment of the proposed methods.  
- The results indicate stability and scalability of the proposed technique in high-dimensional settings, with promising experimental outcomes.  
- The authors effectively outline the limitations of their methodology and offer refinements to address these issues.

Weaknesses:  
- The presentation is dense in places, particularly in sections like Sec. 4.2, which could benefit from clearer contextualization of results.  
- Experimental validation lacks baseline comparisons, making it difficult to assess the efficacy of the proposed approach. Additionally, the results are presented with minimal discussion beyond validation metrics.  
- The absence of a related work section hinders the reader's ability to contextualize the contributions relative to prior research.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by adding more explanatory remarks, particularly in dense sections like Sec. 4.2. Additionally, the authors should consider including baseline comparisons in their experimental validation to substantiate the efficacy of their approach. It would be beneficial to present plots of density estimates for various cases, especially in lower-dimensional settings. Furthermore, we suggest incorporating a related work section to better situate the contributions of this paper within the existing literature. Lastly, providing a detailed discussion on the computational complexity of the proposed method and its implications for sample complexity would enhance the manuscript's depth.
