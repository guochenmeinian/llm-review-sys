Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a unified diffusion model called ActFusion, designed to tackle Time Action Segmentation (TAS) and Long Term Action Prediction (LTA) within a joint learning framework. The authors propose an anticipative masking strategy alongside random masking to effectively manage both visible and invisible parts of the sequence during training. Experimental results demonstrate that ActFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, including 50 Salads, Breakfast, and GTEA.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The design of the ActFusion model is novel, effectively unifying TAS and LTA through anticipative masking.
2. The model enhances performance on both tasks via mutual promotion.
3. The reported results surpass existing techniques across multiple evaluation metrics.

Weaknesses:
1. The methodology lacks novelty, closely resembling existing models, particularly the DiffAct model, with limited distinctions.
2. The performance improvement over state-of-the-art methods is marginal, particularly in frame-wise accuracy on the TAS task.
3. The model's computational efficiency remains unclear; details on GFLOPs, parameter scale, and inference time are needed.
4. The use of ground truth video length during inference raises concerns about test data leakage, which could impact the validity of results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the differences between the Diffusion model used in this paper and the DiffAct model. Additionally, the authors should analyze the impact of the various loss functions employed in training rather than merely exploring the encoder and decoder effects. To address computational efficiency, please provide information on the model's GFLOPs, parameter scale, and inference time. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors clarify the meanings of the circles and triangles in Figure 1(c) and ensure that all experimental results are updated to reflect the absence of ground truth length during inference.
