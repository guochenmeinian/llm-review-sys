Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Geometric Diffusion Bridge (GDB), a framework for generating the evolution of geometric states in coordinate systems. GDB employs a diffusion bridge with equivariant transition kernels to maintain symmetry and joint state distributions. The authors validate GDB's effectiveness across various tasks, including QM9, Molecule3D, and OpenCatalyst IS2RS, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Theorems in Section 3.1 are presented clearly, establishing a solid theoretical foundation for GDB.
- GDB shows strong performance across diverse tasks, outperforming previous machine learning force field baselines.
- The motivation for using a diffusion bridge to connect initial and target states is well-founded, and the equivariant design is theoretically robust.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion of related works on diffusion bridges, which diminishes clarity regarding GDB's novel contributions.
- The contribution appears limited, as the use of diffusion bridges for generative modeling has been previously explored.
- The experimental setup requires more clarity, particularly in comparisons with existing generative models and the rationale for using deterministic processes over stochastic ones.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related works on diffusion bridges to clarify the unique contributions of GDB. Additionally, the authors should consider including more relevant baselines, particularly existing bridge models, to strengthen the comparative analysis. We suggest that the authors provide a detailed explanation of the sampling algorithm used and investigate the impact of varying the number of sampling steps on performance. Lastly, addressing potential limitations, such as scalability and computational overhead, would enhance the paper's comprehensiveness.
