Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for assessing fairness in image restoration, termed the Group Perceptual Index (GPI). GPI quantifies the statistical disparity between a group's original images and their restored versions, aiming for perfect Perceptual Fairness (PF) where all GPI values are identical. The authors provide theoretical insights and practical applications of GPI, particularly in advanced face image super-resolution algorithms, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to existing fairness measures.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a significant issue in the image restoration community, proposing a reasonable measure for fairness through the Group Perceptual Index.
2. It includes solid theoretical and experimental results that validate the effectiveness of GPI.
3. The writing is clear and the structure is well-organized, making it easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
1. The applicability of GPI is primarily validated on face restoration, raising questions about its effectiveness in broader image restoration scenarios.
2. The paper lacks potential solutions for addressing fairness issues beyond merely measuring them.
3. The complexity of evaluating fairness increases with GPI compared to traditional methods, and the experiments rely on synthetic datasets, limiting generalizability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the applicability of the Group Perceptual Index by validating it across various image restoration tasks, such as image denoising and deblurring. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide insights into how existing super-resolution methods can be modified to enhance fairness handling. A more in-depth discussion on detecting and acquiring sensitive attributes would also strengthen the paper. Finally, clarifying the application of GPI in real-world scenarios would enhance its practical relevance.
