### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into deceptive patterns (DPs) in mobile apps and websites, introducing a unified taxonomy and a novel detection technique called DPGuard. The authors compiled a large dataset of DPs, merging existing datasets and adding new samples, which they claim allows DPGuard to outperform state-of-the-art methods. The paper also discusses the implications of DPs on user trust and privacy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is extensive, comprising 6,725 images and 10,421 instances, showcasing the prevalence of deceptive patterns.
- The integration of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into the detection framework is innovative and addresses limitations of traditional methods.
- The paper is well-structured and clearly communicates the authors' findings and experimental setup.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution to the unified taxonomy is limited, primarily reusing existing categories with minor modifications that lack substantial justification.
- The experimental evaluation lacks clarity, particularly regarding dataset splits and the performance of the classifiers in real-world scenarios.
- Some definitions of deceptive patterns are overly broad or exaggerated, and the security implications discussed are weak.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the unified taxonomy, providing clearer distinctions between deceptive patterns and acceptable functionalities. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on the dataset collection and analysis in the main body of the paper, toning down claims about the taxonomy. Clarifying the experimental evaluation details, including dataset splits and the performance metrics of DPGuard, is essential. We also suggest refining the definitions of deceptive patterns to avoid exaggeration and including more concrete examples in the case studies. Finally, addressing the computational costs associated with using MLLMs and considering alternative prompting strategies could enhance the practical applicability of DPGuard.
