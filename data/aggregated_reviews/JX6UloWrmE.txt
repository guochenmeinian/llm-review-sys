Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SDVT, a method addressing non-parametric task variability in Meta-RL through a bi-level task encoding structure that combines categorical encoding and a VariBad-style continuous task belief. The authors employ imagined rewards to enhance generalization, demonstrating that SDVT outperforms baseline Meta-RL algorithms on challenging ML10 and ML45 benchmarks. Additionally, the paper introduces a context-based meta-RL methodology for tasks decomposable into sub-tasks, utilizing a novel encoder variant that predicts a categorical latent variable alongside a conventional latent vector. The proposed method shows strong empirical results on relevant benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The approach tackles the critical issue of multi-modal and diverse task distributions in Meta-RL.
2. The presentation is clear, making the paper easy to follow.
3. The methodology is well-motivated and sensible.
4. Experimental results are solid and convincing, showcasing strong performance against state-of-the-art baselines.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a clear formulation of the general problem definition, particularly regarding "non-parametric" tasks.
2. There is insufficient discussion on the omission of imagined dynamics, which may impact SDVT's generalization power.
3. Some design choices are inadequately motivated or compared, particularly regarding occupancy regularization and its empirical validation.
4. The analysis of the learned subtask compositions and the effects of various components, such as occupancy regularization and decoder dropout, is weak and lacks clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the problem definition by explicitly defining "non-parametric" tasks and providing context for "simple parametric variations." Additionally, we suggest including a discussion on the potential benefits of using imagined dynamics for training. The authors should also conduct ablation studies on occupancy regularization, decoder dropout, and latent dispersion to validate their contributions empirically. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to enhance the presentation of learned subtask compositions, possibly through clearer visualizations or explanations. Lastly, a more detailed outline of the specific contributions in the introduction would help clarify the novelty of the work.
