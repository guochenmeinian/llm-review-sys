### Key Points
This paper presents a new method for multi-criteria Chinese word segmentation (CWS) that incorporates context awareness through a secondary objective of learning sentence representations. The authors propose modeling segmentation criteria with a special token and a criteria-specific training objective, alongside a contrastive objective from SIMCSE to enhance word segmentation. The experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on F1 scores for six out of nine benchmark datasets and improved out-of-vocabulary (OOV) recall for eight of nine datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed method is clear and well-written, with extensive experiments verifying its performance across various benchmarks.  
- It achieves SoTA results on multiple datasets, indicating its effectiveness in improving CWS.  

Weaknesses:  
- The improvements in overall performance are marginal and the method appears incremental, primarily introducing the SIMCSE loss without significant innovation beyond existing models.  
- The modeling of criteria and sentence meaning is considered simplistic, and the average scores do not surpass the current state-of-the-art on popular datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how context-aware information and joint training contribute to the model's effectiveness, providing additional evidence beyond performance scores. Furthermore, consider addressing the incremental nature of the work by exploring more innovative approaches or comparing against a two-stage model that first trains SIMCSE on BERT before the multi-criteria CWS model. This could help clarify the advantages of the proposed method over existing techniques.
