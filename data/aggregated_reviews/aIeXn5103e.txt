Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Severity-aware Recurrent Modeling (Samba) method for disease grading in medical imaging, specifically addressing challenges such as variability in disease levels and performance drops in unseen target domains. The authors propose encoding image patches sequentially to capture severity information and utilize an Expectation-Maximization (EM) based recalibration mechanism to manage cross-domain variations. The method incorporates a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for feature distribution modeling and reconstructs intermediate features using learnable severity bases. Additionally, experiments conducted on the CAMELYON17 dataset evaluate the performance of the proposed Samba model in cross-domain breast cancer grading, analyzing the impact of the number of components K in GMM and comparing computational costs and performance against VMamba-ERM. The results indicate that a K value of 64 yields optimal performance across unseen domains. The authors argue that the Cross-domain Breast Cancer Grading Benchmark is valid for assessing model generalization due to inherent distribution shifts between domains.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Addresses a significant problem in medical image analysis where different grading can appear differently in the data.
- Evaluates various diseases and imaging modalities using publicly available datasets.
- Provides a thorough analysis of the impact of K in GMM, demonstrating clear performance improvements with Samba across various domains.
- The response to reviewer feedback shows a willingness to refine the paper and address concerns regarding methodology and dataset selection.
- Code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Weaknesses:
- Some sections lack detailed explanations, assuming a high level of pre-knowledge; more clarity on Samba's workings is needed.
- The recurrent use of patches and their sequencing is unclear; further elaboration is required.
- No study demonstrates that the model specifically attends to patches related to severity; a method to illustrate this should be provided.
- The significance of the Mamba architecture in cross-domain tasks is uncertain, and the ablation experiments are not comprehensive.
- The Breast Cancer Grading Benchmark is not a well-defined cross-domain problem and should be replaced with more standard datasets.
- Some reviewers express skepticism about the choice of the BCGR dataset as a representative benchmark, suggesting it may not adequately reflect cross-domain challenges without extensive validation.
- There is a need for clarification regarding the distinction between cross-scale and cross-domain generalization in the context of the study.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the EM-based State Recalibration module, providing more intuition on the use of GMMs and EM, and detailing the initialization strategy and convergence criteria. Additionally, the authors should clarify how the Mamba model selects severe lesion information and provide a theoretical justification for this process. We suggest including balanced accuracy metrics for highly imbalanced datasets to better represent model performance on rare classes. Furthermore, the authors should conduct ablation studies on various model components and ensure that comparisons with baseline methods are fair and well-defined. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the dataset's role by explicitly stating that the BCGR dataset represents cross-scale generalization and not multi-domain generalization. Prioritizing the CAMELYON17 dataset as the main pathology representative dataset, using BCGR results as supplementary, would enhance the reliability and generalizability of their results. Finally, a clarification section should be added to ensure the reliability of results for a pathology-related audience.
