Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel perspective on knowledge graph embedding (KGE) methods by interpreting them as circuits, specifically through the development of generative KGE circuits (GeKCs). The authors prove the circuits-based equivalence of score functions for several KGE models and introduce modifications to score functions via non-negativity and squaring restrictions. The proposed GeKCs can be efficiently trained using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and demonstrate competitive performance in generating new triples while adhering to logical constraints. Empirical results indicate that GeKCs maintain link prediction accuracy comparable to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a unique and insightful theoretical framework that enhances existing KGE methods, allowing for efficient learning and sampling.
- It is well-written, with clear language and structured presentation, making it accessible and engaging.
- The empirical evaluations are thorough, demonstrating the advantages of the proposed method over traditional approaches.

Weaknesses:
- The perspective of probabilistic circuits may be limited, primarily focusing on tensor factorization-based KGE models.
- Some empirical results lack motivation, particularly regarding the comparative performance of GeKCs against other methods and datasets.
- The reduction of existing KGE methods to circuits is straightforward and may not encompass a broader range of models, such as graph neural networks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity around the motivation for the introduced properties and their practical implications. Additionally, providing more comprehensive empirical results across various datasets and models would strengthen the claims regarding the performance of GeKCs. It would also be beneficial to explore the applicability of the proposed framework to a wider array of KGE methods beyond those currently addressed.
