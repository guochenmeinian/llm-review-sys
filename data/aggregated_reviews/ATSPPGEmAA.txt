Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the Batched Best Arm Identification (BBAI) problem in multi-armed bandits, aiming to design efficient algorithms that find the arm with the highest mean with a probability of at least \(1 - \delta\), while minimizing sample and batch complexities. The authors propose two algorithms: Tri-BBAI, which achieves asymptotically optimal sample complexity in three batches on average, and Opt-BBAI, which provides near-optimal sample and batch complexities in finite confidence settings while maintaining the same guarantees as Tri-BBAI in the asymptotic case.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The exploration of asymptotic optimality and expected number of rounds offers fresh perspectives on a well-studied problem.
- The algorithms demonstrate strong performance, achieving optimal sample complexities within a small constant number of rounds.
- The presentation is generally clear and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The main result is intuitive, and the proof does not provide significant new insights into pure exploration algorithms.
- The analysis of the Tri-BBAI algorithm may only hold for very small values of \(\delta\), raising concerns about its practical applicability.
- The paper lacks a fair comparison with existing algorithms, which could mislead readers regarding the novelty of Opt-BBAI.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with existing literature by including relevant works in the analysis and experimental results. Additionally, we suggest reducing the introductory section to allocate more space for discussing the methodologies and results. Clarifying the necessity of presenting both Tri-BBAI and Opt-BBAI, as well as providing intuition behind the choice of three batches in Tri-BBAI, would enhance the paper's clarity. Finally, conducting experiments in real-world scenarios would strengthen the practical relevance of the proposed algorithms.
