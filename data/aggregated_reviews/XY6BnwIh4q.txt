Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel representation called binary radiance fields (BiRF) aimed at enhancing memory efficiency in novel view synthesis tasks. The authors propose a binarization of real-valued feature grids, allowing for significant storage reduction while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality. BiRF integrates a 3D voxel grid with three 2D plane grids to mitigate hash collisions and employs a binarization-aware training scheme. Experiments conducted on various datasets demonstrate that BiRF achieves high-quality rendering with substantially lower storage requirements compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The idea of using binary feature encoding is innovative and effective, leading to significant storage savings.  
- The combination of 3D and 2D feature grids is a novel approach that enhances the representation.  
- The paper is well-organized and presents rigorous experimental results, showcasing the method's effectiveness across multiple datasets.  

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty is somewhat limited as the approach primarily applies techniques from Binarized Neural Networks to radiance fields.  
- The paper lacks a thorough evaluation of inference speed compared to relevant methods, which is crucial for practical applications.  
- There is insufficient discussion on the implications of hash collisions in the context of the proposed method.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including a comparison of inference speed against relevant methods such as TensoRF and Instant-NGP, and analyze the impact of the hybrid 3D and 2D feature grid architecture on training and inference speeds. Additionally, it would be beneficial to provide a more detailed discussion on the handling of hash collisions compared to Instant-NGP. We also suggest streamlining sections that contain redundant content to enhance clarity and addressing the performance gap observed in specific results, particularly those related to K-Planes. Lastly, a thorough comparison with non-compressed and non-optimized baselines would strengthen the claims regarding quality.
