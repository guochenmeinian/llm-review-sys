Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive survey of techniques for aligning large language models (LLMs) with evolving world knowledge without requiring retraining from scratch. The authors propose a taxonomy categorizing methods into "implicit," which modify internal representations, and "explicit," which utilize external resources to update knowledge during inference. The authors contextualize these approaches, discussing their applicability and future trends.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is exhaustive and provides a useful overview of methods for keeping LLMs up to date.
- It contextualizes different approaches, offering insights into their situational effectiveness and future challenges.
- All reviewers find the paper exciting and sound, with strong support for its claims.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a quantitative study to assess the effectiveness of the various methods discussed.
- There is a significant omission of research on "keeping LLMs up to date with structural knowledge," which is critical for LLM applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by incorporating a thorough review of existing literature on structural knowledge, particularly referencing Pan et al. (2023), to address the gap in explicit knowledge coverage. Additionally, we suggest including a quantitative analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of different methods, potentially by comparing LLMs updated through various approaches. Clarifying the survey methodology and selection criteria for included papers would also enhance the paper's rigor.
