Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel self-calibration strategy for monocular camera calibration using a deep neural network to predict the incidence field, followed by RANSAC to filter outliers and regress intrinsic parameters. The incidence field, defined as a collection of rays from a 3D point to the camera, is claimed to be invariant to cropping and resizing. The authors assert that their method achieves superior performance on various benchmarks and demonstrates potential applications in detecting image transformations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed approach addresses an important problem in single-image camera calibration and shows technical novelty in relating incidence fields to camera intrinsics.
- The method is simple and has been evaluated extensively, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.
- The paper provides clear explanations and necessary derivations, with numerous interesting applications presented.

Weaknesses:
- The literature review is incomplete, missing key references that address camera distortion and calibration on cropped images.
- The claim of novelty regarding the incidence field regression is questioned, as similar methods have been previously described.
- The writing quality is inconsistent, with several sections requiring editing for clarity and precision.
- The evaluation lacks detailed descriptions of metrics and their calculations, and some tables do not provide necessary units or context.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by integrating relevant works such as "DeepCalib" and "A Perceptual Measure for Deep Single Image Camera and Lens Calibration" to address distortion and cropping issues. Additionally, testing on non-cropped images would provide a more realistic evaluation of the method's performance. We suggest clarifying the integration of radial distortion in the framework and providing statistics on the field of view distribution used for training. A full editing pass is necessary to enhance the writing quality and figure aesthetics. Finally, implementation details should be included in the main document rather than the supplemental materials.
