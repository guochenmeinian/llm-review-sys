### Key Points
This paper examines whether structural components of sentences, referred to as chunks, are present in sentence embeddings, specifically using transformer-based models. The authors propose a VAE model to analyze syntactic structures derived from sentence embeddings, focusing on the classification token "[CLS]" in BERT-style models and conducting two main tasks: (i) training a simple VAE on sentences constructed from a specific syntactic recipe, and (ii) employing a two-level VAE for Blackbird Language Matrices to assess syntactic analogies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research topic and experiments are intriguing and merit further exploration.
- The clever use of the VAE model for semi-supervised probing and the interpretability of latent units indicate that high-level syntactic information is encoded in embeddings.
- The findings suggest that syntactic information is present in transformer models, with notable differences in performance between BERT-based and sentence-transformer models.

Weaknesses:
- The approach is convoluted, and simpler methods like PCA and ICA could have been more straightforward for addressing the research question.
- The paper is complex and difficult to follow, with many abbreviations that should be explained for clarity.
- Graphs and plots are small and poorly labeled, making it hard to interpret results, and there is a lack of real error analysis.
- The writing lacks clarity, particularly regarding the metrics and the evaluation of the models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by simplifying the content and reducing the number of graphs that do not add value to the main argument. Additionally, the authors should provide clear explanations for abbreviations and ensure that all figures are adequately labeled and legible. We suggest restructuring the paper to focus more on the tasks and methodologies early on, while reducing the literature review. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the evaluation metrics used, particularly regarding the F1 scores and the loss function for the 2x VAE model. Lastly, linking the VAE approach to SAEs could enhance interpretability.
