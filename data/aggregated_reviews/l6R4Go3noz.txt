Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Fine-Grained Visual Prompting (FGVP), which utilizes Blur Reverse Mask to enhance the semantic localization capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP. The authors propose a visual prompting method that blurs the background of images while retaining focus on the object of interest, motivated by the shallow depth of field commonly found in training data. The method shows improved performance on referring expression comprehension tasks and achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized, clearly presenting the motivation and framework.
- The proposed method consistently outperforms other techniques, demonstrating significant improvements in experiments.
- The evaluation includes a comprehensive analysis of different visual prompting techniques.

Weaknesses:
- The related work section omits two relevant studies in visual prompting.
- The complexity of the proposed method, relying on a large segmentation model, increases inference costs, which should be discussed.
- The novelty of the work is not well established, appearing as an engineering combination of existing methods.
- The evaluation lacks a thorough analysis of biases and failure cases compared to the "red circle" method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section by including Bhang et al. (2022) and Bar et al. (2022). Additionally, the authors should discuss the runtime costs associated with using SAM and consider simpler segmentation alternatives. A more detailed analysis of the empirical results, including insights on the performance gaps between ground truth and predicted bounding boxes, would enhance the paper. Furthermore, we suggest providing a breakdown of per-class performance and conducting a failure analysis to clarify the strengths and weaknesses of FGVP compared to other methods.
