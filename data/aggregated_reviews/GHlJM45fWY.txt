Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the "GeoLife: Spatial Plant Species Prediction Dataset," a comprehensive dataset for Species Distribution Models (SDMs) at high spatial resolution (10-50 meters). It includes over 5 million Presence-Only (PO) records and 90,000 Presence-Absence (PA) surveys, covering more than 10,000 species. The dataset integrates diverse environmental rasters, satellite images, and climatic time-series data, making it the largest and most diverse resource for species distribution modeling. The authors provide pre-trained models and baseline methods, enhancing accessibility for further research and benchmarking.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset's scale and diversity, including various environmental indicators, provide a robust benchmark for evaluating SDMs.
- It addresses challenges of integrating heterogeneous data and is relevant for advancing ecological knowledge and conservation efforts.
- The paper is well-written, clearly explaining the dataset, its components, and potential applications.

Weaknesses:
- The PA data is highly imbalanced, with most species observed only once or twice, and the PO data is biased towards areas with high observer density and common species.
- The experimental section is weak, lacking comprehensive error analysis and consideration of alternative modeling approaches.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset by addressing the imbalance in the PA data through more targeted sampling or data augmentation techniques. Additionally, the authors should reduce sampling biases in the PO data by incorporating more diverse sampling protocols or using techniques to control for biases in model calibration. The experimental section should be strengthened by including ablation studies on different data modalities, considering additional modeling approaches like MaxEnt and random forests, and providing error analysis such as confusion matrices and ROC curves. Lastly, exploring the integration of temporal dynamics using a 2D+1D CNN/LSTM could enhance classification performance.
