### Key Points
This paper presents an exploratory analysis of biases in multilingual sentence representation models concerning European countries. The authors demonstrate that the strongest dimensions in the models correlate with political and economic distinctions between Western and Eastern Europe, as well as GDP. The models effectively differentiate between high and low-prestige jobs, although a strong correlation between job prestige and country prestige is generally absent. The study is timely and relevant to the NLP community, addressing significant questions about biases in model data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper investigates critical biases in multilingual models, contributing valuable insights to the field.
- It is well-organized and written, with a sound case study covering multiple languages.
- The findings are fascinating and timely, with few similar studies conducted previously.

Weaknesses:
- The scope of the study is relatively small, which may affect the reliability of the results.
- The lack of mathematical expressions makes the operational steps difficult to understand, relying heavily on intuition.
- Some reviewers expressed concerns about the unclear impact and relevance of the study's findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 2.4 by elaborating on the methodologies used, including the rationale behind the choice of templates and models. Additionally, we suggest incorporating mathematical expressions to elucidate the operational steps involved in the analysis. Expanding the scope of the study to provide a more comprehensive discussion on the potential ethical concerns and implications of the identified biases would enhance the paper's impact. Finally, reporting standard deviation values in Tables 2 and 3 would strengthen the statistical analysis presented.
