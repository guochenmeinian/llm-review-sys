### Key Points
This paper presents CodeT5+, a flexible encoder-decoder model designed to address two main limitations of existing code Language Models (LLMs): the inflexibility of fixed architectures for diverse tasks and the inadequacy of pretraining objectives. The authors propose a modular architecture that allows for various configurations and utilize a compute-efficient pretraining strategy by initializing CodeT5+ with frozen off-the-shelf LLMs. They also explore instruction-tuning to align the model with natural language instructions, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several code-related tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- CodeT5+ introduces a novel architecture and training method for code LLMs, enhancing performance with fewer parameters.
- The paper effectively summarizes existing limitations and offers practical solutions.
- A comprehensive description of CodeT5+ and its computationally-efficient pretraining strategy is provided.
- The model achieves state-of-the-art performance across various code tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity on certain details, particularly regarding the impact of the "Compute-efficient Pretraining with Frozen Off-the-shelf LLMs" method on performance.
- Questions remain about the differences between encoder-decoder and decoder-only configurations.
- The description of pretraining tasks, especially "Text-Code Contrastive Learning," is insufficiently detailed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the pretraining tasks, particularly regarding "Text-Code Contrastive Learning," to enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest providing a clear method for downloading pre-training data to facilitate reproducibility. It would also be beneficial to include experiments that demonstrate the impact of the proposed pretraining method on performance and to compare the encoder-decoder configuration with a decoder-only configuration under similar conditions.
