### Key Points
This paper presents a method for offline change point detection in multivariate non-parametric time series, utilizing a two-stage algorithm that combines CUSUM statistics with seeded binary segmentation (SBS). The authors prove consistency and derive limiting distributions for the change point estimators, addressing the challenges posed by temporal dependencies and HÃ¶lder continuous densities. Numerical experiments demonstrate the method's effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The theoretical findings, particularly the consistency and limiting distributions for change point estimators in a non-parametric setting, are significant contributions.  
- The model accommodates temporal dependencies under mixing conditions, broadening its applicability.  
- The writing is generally clear, with well-defined notations.

Weaknesses:  
- The presentation lacks motivation for the chosen time-series model and does not adequately discuss the implications of the $\alpha$-mixing condition.  
- The methodological novelty is unclear, as combining CUSUM and SBS is not new; the refining step requires more emphasis.  
- The numerical results are somewhat limited, with insufficient demonstration of the proposed method's advantages over competitors.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation by providing a clearer motivation for the time-series model class considered, including a discussion on $\alpha$-mixing and its implications. Additionally, we suggest including a more detailed explanation of the SBS algorithm and its relevance to the proposed method. 

To enhance the numerical results, we advise the authors to report the standard deviation of the misestimation rates and include plots of the time-series realizations for better context. Furthermore, illustrating the advantages of the refined estimators in the numerical results would strengthen the paper. 

Lastly, we recommend correcting the typo in line 126 regarding the subscript of \( F_{s_k,\eta_k} \) and clarifying the notation used in the algorithm.
