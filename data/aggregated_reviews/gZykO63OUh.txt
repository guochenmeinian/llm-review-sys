### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for argument mining (AM) utilizing ensemble methods to enhance the accuracy of various tasks within the AM pipeline. The authors aim to identify optimal combinations of AM modules and evaluate their effectiveness. The methodology involves dividing the AM process into four tasks: sentence classification, boundary detection, component identification, and relation prediction. The authors also provide access to their code for reproducibility.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach allows for the recombination of modules, which is transferable to other tasks.
- The methodology is well-explained and methodical in testing various ensemble configurations.
- The paper provides sufficient support for its claims and is clear in its presentation.

Weaknesses:
- The Related Work section references only one source, lacking broader context.
- The conclusions may be affected by the Multiple Comparisons problem, as results are based on a single test set without statistical significance testing.
- The authors do not estimate the computational and temporal costs of their approach, which limits its practical relevance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the Related Work section by introducing additional relevant components included in the evaluation. Additionally, the authors should address the Multiple Comparisons problem by applying statistical corrections, such as the Bonferroni correction, and provide results from different test sets. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors include an estimation of the computational and temporal costs associated with their approach to enhance its practical applicability.
