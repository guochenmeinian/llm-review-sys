Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework for unsupervised option discovery utilizing Determinantal Point Processes (DPP) to optimize both diversity and coverage of learned options. The authors propose a unified approach that integrates variational and Laplacian-based methods, addressing a significant challenge in the unsupervised reinforcement learning community. Empirical results demonstrate the method's superiority over existing baselines in continuous control tasks and Atari environments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The adoption of DPP for option discovery is innovative and effectively addresses the dual goals of coverage and diversity.
- The paper is well-motivated, clearly written, and presents a compelling toy example to illustrate the main idea.
- Experimental results validate the proposed approach, showing improvements over methods like DIAYN.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion of related work, particularly recent variational methods and option-discovery approaches that optimize coverage.
- The complexity of the proposed method, particularly the objective function in Eq.(9), raises concerns about hyperparameter tuning and computational scalability.
- The empirical evaluation could be more comprehensive, with comparisons to stronger baselines and additional quantitative metrics for diversity and coverage.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related work by including recent advancements in variational methods and explicitly connecting their approach to option-discovery techniques that prioritize coverage. Additionally, we suggest providing clearer guidance on hyperparameter tuning and elaborating on the scalability of the method, including computational requirements compared to VIC/DIAYN. The empirical section should be strengthened by incorporating comparisons with stronger baselines and presenting quantitative metrics for diversity and coverage. Lastly, we encourage the authors to enhance the clarity of the writing, particularly in the exposition of complex terms and concepts.
