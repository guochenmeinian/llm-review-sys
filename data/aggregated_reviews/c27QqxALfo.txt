### Key Points
This paper presents MM-Reasoner, a multi-modal knowledge-aware framework for knowledge-based visual question answering (KVQA). The system integrates large language models (LLMs), vision APIs, and vision-and-language models (VLMs) to effectively address complex questions requiring external knowledge and detailed visual understanding. Empirical studies indicate that MM-Reasoner achieves state-of-the-art performance on several KVQA datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The method is novel in utilizing vision APIs to extract detailed features, enhancing the richness of query-specific knowledge obtained from LLMs.  
- Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance.  
- The integration of various models and plugins is innovative and relevant to the NLP community.

Weaknesses:  
- The overall framework is complex and may pose challenges for deployment due to its reliance on multiple external APIs and LLMs.  
- Some experimental results appear weak, with marginal performance improvements and a lack of single model comparisons.  
- Details regarding prompt construction and few-shot experiments are insufficiently explained, and key figures are relegated to the appendix, potentially limiting visibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the prompt construction process, including how examples are selected and the number used for each sample. Additionally, we suggest that the authors report results for single models alongside ensemble results for fair comparison. It would also be beneficial to include key information from Figure 6 in the main text to enhance understanding. Finally, addressing the complexity of the framework and its deployment challenges would strengthen the paper.
