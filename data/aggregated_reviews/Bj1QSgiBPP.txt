Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a family of classification models called participatory systems, which enable individuals to opt into personalization at prediction time, addressing ethical concerns regarding the use of personal data without informed consent. The authors argue that existing personalization models often fail to facilitate consent and may not improve outcomes for certain groups. The study includes a theoretical framework for Participatory Personalization in Classification (PPC) and evaluates its effectiveness in various domains, particularly healthcare.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles a significant problem in machine learning regarding consent and data use, presenting a compelling vision for participatory systems.
- It provides a robust theoretical framework and demonstrates effectiveness through empirical studies, particularly in clinical prediction tasks.
- The clarity of presentation is high, with well-defined assumptions and strong motivation for the proposed approach.

Weaknesses:
- The complexity of the proposed method may increase with a higher number of categorical attributes.
- There is a lack of evaluation with actual users, which limits the understanding of the system's practical implications.
- The paper does not sufficiently address the computational complexity and scalability of PPC models, nor does it explore the limitations of real-world applications and potential biases.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the underlying mechanisms of the proposed framework and explicitly outline the assumptions about user behavior and ML operator incentives. Additionally, a more thorough discussion of the challenges in implementing participatory systems, including user interface design and technological literacy, would enhance the paper's robustness. The authors should also consider a detailed comparison of PPC with existing personalization methods and address the potential for exacerbating biases in the data. Finally, a clearer exploration of how the resulting training datasets differ when using this approach would provide valuable insights for ML operators.
