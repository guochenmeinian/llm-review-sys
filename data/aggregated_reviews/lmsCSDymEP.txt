### Key Points
This paper presents DIFFUSIONHOI, a novel Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detector that leverages text-to-image diffusion models to enhance HOI detection by focusing on complex relationships between objects. The authors propose a relation-driven approach that improves image generation capabilities and enriches training samples for rare interactions, achieving good performance on HICO-DET and V-COCO benchmarks. The method utilizes textual inversion and a human-object relation inversion strategy, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The experiments are comprehensive and well-organized.
- The design of Inversion-Based HOI Modeling and Relation-Driven Sample Generation is intriguing.
- Achieving zero-shot generalization on SWiG-DET is impressive.
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the tackled problems.

Weaknesses:
- Despite fewer trainable parameters, DIFFUSIONHOI has a large total parameter count, raising concerns about fair comparisons with existing methods.
- The authors claim to set a new state-of-the-art on HICO-DET, but there are better models available, such as PViC, which should be acknowledged.
- Quantitative results and analysis of failure cases are needed.
- The computational cost of the inversion process could affect training speed and requires further clarification.
- The authors should provide results using a smaller backbone, like ViT-B, for a clearer comparison with previous state-of-the-art models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the total parameter count and its implications for fair comparisons with existing methods. Additionally, the authors should acknowledge and compare their results with models like PViC, which do not utilize external knowledge. We suggest providing more details about the data scale and parameter scale of the diffusion model used. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the computational cost of the inversion process and consider presenting results with a smaller backbone, such as ViT-B, to enhance the fairness of comparisons.
