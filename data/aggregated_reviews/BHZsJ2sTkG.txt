### Key Points
This paper investigates the contextual bandit problem with sequentially sampled contexts from a known i.i.d. source and adversarially generated losses. The authors propose oracle-efficient algorithms that minimize expected regret, achieving a bound of the order $T^{2/3}(K\log|\Pi|)^{1/3}$ for any finite policy set $\Pi$ with a value-ERM oracle. This represents an improvement over the previous bound of order $(TK)^{2/3}(\log |\Pi|)^{1/3}$ established by Syrgkanis (2016). The proof technique builds on the relaxation-based argument from Rakhlin and Sridharan (2016) and Syrgkanis (2016), introducing novel Rademacher vectors in the analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper presents an oracle-efficient regret bound that improves the state of the art.  
- The writing is clear, and the proposed algorithm is well-structured, based on a novel relaxation function.  
- The introduction of new ideas and techniques is of independent interest.  

Weaknesses:  
- The improvement in the regret bound is only a factor of $K^{1/3}$, which may not be significant in practical applications.  
- The paper contains several typographical errors and lacks references to corresponding appendix sections in the main text.  
- The abstract inaccurately states that the algorithm requires knowledge of the context distribution; it only requires sampling from it.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation by correcting typographical errors, such as "for for" on line 1 and ensuring proper references to appendix sections. Additionally, we suggest including specific values for $K$, such as setting $K=T^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha<1$, to provide clearer comparisons with previous bounds. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore whether the techniques could enhance Rademacher complexity-based bounds and consider relaxing the i.i.d. assumption to accommodate smooth adversaries. Lastly, an experimental evaluation would strengthen the paper's contribution to computational efficiency.
