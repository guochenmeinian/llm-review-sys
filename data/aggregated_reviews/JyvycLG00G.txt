### Key Points
This paper presents a large-scale emotion-cause dataset comprising over 700,000 tweets categorized into 48 emotion classes, which allows for nuanced emotion-cause analysis. The authors propose that this dataset offers a more refined categorization than the traditional seven emotion categories, potentially benefiting future research in emotion-cause detection.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The dataset's large scale and the emphasis on human annotation are commendable.  
- The 48 emotion categories provide a more detailed perspective on emotions, which could enhance emotion-cause analysis.

Weaknesses:  
- The motivation for creating the dataset and its advantages over existing datasets are not clearly articulated.  
- The finer granularity of emotion categories lacks justification, and the potential challenges in model predictions due to this granularity are not adequately addressed.  
- The method for emotion cause extraction relies on specific patterns, limiting its applicability to a broader range of emotional expressions.  
- The paper suffers from poor readability due to confusing claims, repetitive descriptions, and insufficient explanations of key concepts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind the dataset's creation and explicitly analyze the benefits of finer granularity in emotion categories. Additionally, the authors should provide a detailed justification for the selection of the 48 categories and address potential overlaps in meanings. Enhancing the readability of the manuscript by eliminating repetitive descriptions and clarifying confusing claims will also be beneficial. Finally, we suggest that the authors include a more comprehensive analysis of the emotion cause extraction method and its limitations, particularly regarding the patterns used for data collection.
