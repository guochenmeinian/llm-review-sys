Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents EduQate, a framework that utilizes EdNetRMABs to account for interdependencies among educational content, enhancing personalized learning. The authors propose a Q-learning algorithm that optimizes content recommendations without requiring prior knowledge of transition matrices. The theoretical and empirical effectiveness of EduQate is demonstrated through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, showing its superiority over traditional methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of EdNetRMABs offers a realistic model for educational settings, addressing interdependencies among learning topics.
2. The theoretical analysis of EduQate is rigorous, providing optimality guarantees for k=1 and complexity bounds for k>1.
3. The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making complex concepts accessible.
4. The incorporation of experience replay effectively addresses the cold-start problem in reinforcement learning applications.

Weaknesses:
1. The clarity of explanations is insufficient in some areas, particularly regarding the student model and dataset details.
2. The model's assumption of fully observable knowledge states is a significant limitation, as it does not reflect real-world educational scenarios.
3. The experimental section lacks sufficient baseline comparisons and validation experiments, raising concerns about the necessity of the proposed method.
4. The discussion on user experience for educators and students is inadequate, and the scalability of the EduQate algorithm in larger educational contexts is not thoroughly explored.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of explanations regarding the student model and dataset characteristics to enhance understanding. Additionally, the authors should consider extending the model to handle partial observability, reflecting more realistic educational environments. Increasing the number of baseline comparisons and validation experiments would strengthen the paper's claims about the necessity of EduQate. Furthermore, we suggest conducting user research to gather insights on the system's intuitiveness and user-friendliness. Lastly, a comprehensive performance analysis of the EduQate algorithm's scalability in large-scale educational settings should be included.
