### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for monocular 3D scene reconstruction, termed Inner-Outer Aware Reconstruction (IOAR). The authors propose a classification of voxels into outer-surface, inner-surface, and surface categories, which enhances occupancy and TSDF predictions. The method employs a coarse-to-fine strategy and separates the occupancy branch from the TSDF branch to mitigate mutual interference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IOAR achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, including ScanNet, ICL-NUIM, and TUM-RGBD.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The classification of inner and outer voxels is novel and leads to superior quantitative results, particularly near surfaces.
- The method is evaluated on large, popular datasets with satisfactory baseline comparisons, demonstrating robust performance.
- The provided ablation study reinforces the efficacy of the proposed module.

Weaknesses:
- The impact of classifying inner and outer surface voxels is not entirely clear, particularly regarding the claimed performance gains.
- The novelty of the coarse-to-fine strategy is limited, as it closely resembles previous frameworks.
- Some discrepancies exist between numerical values in the text and tables, which require clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 4.3 to better articulate the significance of the inner and outer voxel classification. Additionally, please provide details on inference time and consider conducting further ablation studies to explore the effects of the multi-resolution scheme compared to a single-resolution implementation. We also suggest addressing the discrepancies in numerical values between the text and tables for consistency. Finally, consider weighting the losses in Equation (9) and clarify the rationale behind the occupancy ground truth range.
