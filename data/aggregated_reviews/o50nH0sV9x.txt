Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the first exploration of certifiable robustness in Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) by proposing a unified definition of robustness and introducing Randomized Edgedrop Smoothing (RES). The authors establish criteria for evaluating and certifying robustness, demonstrating that certified robustness can be preserved in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments across seven real-world datasets indicate that RES-GRACE achieves state-of-the-art performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-motivated, addressing the lack of certification in current robust GCL methods.
2. The theoretical analysis supports the robust performance of the proposed encoder in downstream tasks.
3. The presentation is clear, with easily digestible figures and supportive numerical experimental results.

Weaknesses:
1. The choice of baselines for comparison is insufficient; the authors should include recent GCL baselines such as RGCL and GLCC.
2. The motivation for using $\mathbf{v}^+$ instead of $\mathbf{v}$ in Eq. (3) is unclear, and the terminology regarding "positive samples" in section 4.1 is confusing.
3. The paper lacks a comparative analysis between RES and existing edge drop augmentation techniques, which could clarify the advantages of the proposed method.
4. There are numerous typos and grammatical errors that require careful proofreading.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind using edgedrop smoothing in GCL. Additionally, the authors should provide explanations for the performance discrepancies observed between the RES-backbone and the raw graph backbone. To strengthen the paper, we suggest including comparisons with recent GCL baselines and conducting a broader range of adversarial attack methods to assess the robustness of the proposed framework. Lastly, we advise a thorough proofreading to correct grammatical errors and enhance overall presentation quality.
