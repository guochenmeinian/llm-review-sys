Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method called Audio-Visual Mixture of Experts (AVMoE) for audio-visual learning, utilizing both unimodal and cross-modal adapters to enhance parameter-efficient transfer learning. The authors propose a lightweight router that dynamically assigns weights to these adapters based on task requirements. The effectiveness of AVMoE is demonstrated across multiple audio-visual tasks, although the novelty of the technique is questioned due to similarities with existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is simple yet effective, achieving state-of-the-art results across various tasks.
- The writing is clear and the proposed architecture is intuitive, showing performance improvements while using fewer parameters.

Weaknesses:
- The technique's novelty is limited, with minimal differences from prior works, particularly in architecture and design.
- The evaluation framework is restricted to the chosen tasks, and the paper lacks demos and code.
- Important details regarding hyperparameter choices and the effectiveness of the router are inadequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the unimodal adapter's functionality, possibly by including figures to illustrate its operation. Additionally, we suggest providing demos and code to enhance accessibility. The authors should also include a more comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art methods, particularly regarding inference costs and training times. Clarifying the rationale behind hyperparameter choices and discussing the similarities and differences with related works like LAVISH would strengthen the manuscript. Finally, addressing the minor writing issues and ensuring all relevant results are included in the main text would enhance the overall presentation.
