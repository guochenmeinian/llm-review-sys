Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a benchmark for uncertainty quantification (UQ) disentanglement, evaluating 17 UQ methods primarily on classification tasks using ImageNet and CIFAR10. The main finding indicates that no method effectively disentangles aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. The benchmark also highlights challenges in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and the difficulties of estimating aleatoric uncertainty.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The focus on disentangled uncertainty is a significant strength.  
- The extensive evaluation of various UQ methods and aggregation strategies is commendable.  
- The paper is well-written, providing useful insights and clear conclusions from the experimental study.

Weaknesses:  
- The use of rank correlation as a measure for uncertainty disentanglement quality is non-standard and may not adequately reflect the complexities involved.  
- Clarity issues arise from the dense information presentation and the organization of sections, making it challenging to follow.  
- The benchmark is limited to classification tasks and primarily relies on the information-theoretic formulation, neglecting other potential formulations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by restructuring sections for better flow, possibly merging the Limitations and Conclusion sections and splitting the conclusion into paragraphs. Additionally, we suggest providing more detailed explanations of the rank correlation metric and its relevance to uncertainty disentanglement. Including other datasets beyond ImageNet and CIFAR10 could enhance the benchmark's applicability. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore the Gaussian logits formulation and address the potential impact of Monte Carlo approximations on the observed correlations between uncertainties.
