### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative approach to generating and evaluating mathematical conjectures by leveraging large language models (LLMs) in conjunction with the GAP computer algebra system, focusing on group theory and solubilizers. The authors utilize ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude to generate conjectures, subsequently testing them on non-solvable groups. The study highlights the potential of LLMs in mathematics, particularly in conjecture generation, and provides a comparative analysis of the performance of different models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper explores a novel application of LLMs in mathematics, specifically for conjecture generation.
- A clear methodology is presented for generating and pruning conjectures using LLMs and computational tools.
- The comparative analysis of multiple LLMs offers insights into their respective strengths and weaknesses.
- The focus on solubilizers ensures originality in the generated conjectures.
- The approach has practical implications for assisting mathematicians in exploring new areas.

Weaknesses:
- The study's limited scope to group theory and solubilizers may restrict generalizability to other mathematical areas.
- The relatively small sample size of 430 unique conjectures may affect the statistical significance of the findings.
- There is a lack of a clear framework for evaluating the quality and novelty of the generated conjectures.
- The absence of human expert validation for the conjectures raises concerns about their significance and novelty.
- The discussion on practical applications and broader impacts is insufficient, lacking exploration of how this approach could transform mathematical research practices or influence related fields.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation framework by providing a clearer method for assessing the quality and novelty of the generated conjectures. Involving human mathematicians to evaluate the conjectures could enhance the study's relevance. Additionally, we suggest expanding the discussion on the potential real-world applications and broader implications of their work, particularly how this AI-driven approach could impact mathematics education and research workflows. Finally, addressing the diversity of generated conjectures and the limitations of the approach in a more quantitative manner would strengthen the paper.
