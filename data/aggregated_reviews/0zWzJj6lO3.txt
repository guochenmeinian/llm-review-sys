Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents GOVernance of the Commons SIMulation (GOVSIM), a generative simulation platform designed to study strategic interactions and cooperative decision-making among large language model (LLM) agents. The authors investigate sustainable resource sharing through various LLMs, revealing that most agents fail to achieve sustainable cooperation primarily due to communication deficits and a lack of long-term consequence consideration. The study emphasizes that "Universalization"-based reasoning significantly enhances sustainability in agent actions. Additionally, the authors introduce the original GPT-4 model and provide new results that demonstrate its contributions to the study, presenting aggregate performance metrics across different scenarios. Their goal is not to identify a "best" model but to explore systematic patterns in agent behavior and performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of GOVSIM is innovative, addressing a critical gap in the literature on AI safety and multi-agent interactions.
- The paper provides comprehensive analyses and a variety of experiments across multiple resource-sharing scenarios, offering valuable insights into cooperative capabilities.
- The introduction of new performance metrics, including Survival Rate (q), enhances the clarity of model evaluations.
- The use of multiple quantitative metrics and subskill analyses provides a comprehensive view of agent performance.
- The authors commit to sharing their research results, including the simulation environment and agent prompts, fostering further research in this area.
- The integration of ethical reasoning into agent decision-making reflects a forward-thinking approach.

Weaknesses:
- The resource-sharing scenarios are relatively simplistic, potentially limiting the insights applicable to real-world resource management complexities.
- The findings may not generalize well to more complex environments, particularly those involving mixed human-AI interactions.
- The analysis of negotiation-related discussions lacks depth, leaving questions about the underlying reasons for cooperation.
- The lack of detailed explanations for model performance discrepancies, particularly between Claude-3 variants, raises concerns about the robustness of conclusions.
- There is an over-reliance on current LLMs' capabilities, which may overestimate their strategic reasoning and negotiation skills.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the complexity of the scenarios in GOVSIM to better reflect real-world resource management challenges. Incorporating human participants in the study could provide valuable insights into LLMs' interactions with human decision-makers. Additionally, we suggest that the authors conduct more robust testing by introducing disturbances across different rounds to evaluate agents' adaptability. A deeper analysis of the performance differences between models, particularly for Claude-3 variants, and the underlying reasons for cooperation failures is essential. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to revisit the complexity of scenarios to ensure they yield meaningful insights into cooperative dynamics and to provide a more in-depth analysis of negotiation-related discussions to clarify their impact on cooperation. Finally, we suggest including a detailed analysis of the relationship between model outputs and training data to address concerns about data leakage and overfitting.
