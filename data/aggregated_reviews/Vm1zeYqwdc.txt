Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework called "Diffusion Hyperfeatures" for extracting per-pixel feature descriptors from multi-scale and multi-timestep feature maps generated by diffusion models, aimed at semantic keypoint correspondence tasks. The authors claim superior performance on the SPair-71k benchmark compared to existing approaches, asserting novelty in establishing semantic correspondence with diffusion models. However, reviewers express concerns regarding the sufficiency of quantitative and qualitative analyses to support these claims. While the framework is designed to enhance the internal representations of diffusion models, its performance may be influenced more by the backbone networks than the proposed method itself.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel approach to consolidate and extract features from all intermediate layers of diffusion models, contributing to its originality.
- The authors provide a solid rebuttal and extensive new experiments, addressing some reviewer concerns.
- The exploration of feature representations learned at different layers and timesteps is noted as interesting and informative.
- The paper shows improved performance compared to existing supervised methods, which is acknowledged by some reviewers.
- It references relevant literature and evaluates the framework thoroughly, demonstrating high quality in methodology and results.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a detailed comparison with existing methods that extract feature descriptors from diffusion models, which would help establish its novelty.
- The evaluation is limited to two datasets, raising concerns about the completeness of experiments.
- There is insufficient analysis of experimental results, including quantitative metrics and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.
- The computational complexity section lacks specific metrics, such as memory footprint and run-time measurements, which are necessary for a comprehensive understanding of the method's efficiency.
- The generalization of the framework is only partially explored, with limited evaluation across diverse datasets.
- The methodology description is high-level, lacking details on the architecture of the feature aggregation network and specific techniques used.
- Potential limitations and future directions are not discussed, reducing the depth of the research.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with existing methods by providing a more detailed analysis of how their approach differs and potentially outperforms them. To enhance the novelty aspect, we suggest providing more persuasive quantitative and qualitative analyses that clearly differentiate their contributions from existing works. Incorporating a broader set of baselines and ablation studies would clarify the source of performance improvements, particularly in relation to the diffusion model's features. A thorough evaluation of experimental results, including quantitative metrics and visual assessments, would strengthen the paper. Additionally, enhancing the computational complexity section by including detailed metrics such as memory footprint and run-time statistics is essential. Exploring the framework's performance across a broader range of datasets and real-world scenarios would enhance its robustness. Finally, a clearer and more detailed description of the methodologies employed, including the architecture of the feature aggregation network, is necessary, along with a discussion of potential limitations and future directions to add depth to the research.
