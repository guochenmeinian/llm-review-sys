Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Coupled Oscillator Networks (CONs), which extend the concept of coRNNs by utilizing symmetric generalized forces to define a potential energy expression for energy shaping control methods. The authors prove that the model is asymptotically stable and input-to-state stable under certain conditions. The performance of CONs is shown to be comparable to state-of-the-art methods. The network is applied alongside a variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn low-dimensional representations of soft robot dynamics, and a PID controller with energy shaping is designed for state control. However, the method may not be effective for nonholonomic systems due to differing physical constraints and stability characteristics. The authors also assume full observability and the Markov property, which may not apply to partially observable or non-Markovian systems, particularly those with hidden states or delayed observations. Furthermore, the current formulation fails to account for time-dependent material properties relevant in certain soft robots and deformable objects. The main contribution lies in the novel network structure that leverages potential energy expressions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The article is well-written, with detailed and clear explanations of all steps.
- The approach of splitting the dynamics into linear and nonlinear parts for solution computation is original.
- The new network structure facilitates energy-based control methods, potentially leading to significant applications.
- The method is innovative and addresses specific dynamics in certain systems.

Weaknesses:
- Theorem 1 is perceived as trivial since it discusses the coupling of passive systems, which are inherently stable, limiting the theoretical contribution.
- A misleading statement regarding PID controller drawbacks is noted, as it inaccurately describes a PD controller.
- The main contribution is primarily the network structure; the VAE and controller are established methods, necessitating a more thorough discussion on CONs' performance and limitations beyond soft robotics datasets.
- The method is likely ineffective for nonholonomic systems due to differing constraints and stability characteristics.
- The assumption of full observability and the Markov property limits applicability to partially observable and non-Markovian systems.
- The method does not capture significant time-dependent material properties in soft robots and deformable objects.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical contributions by providing more substantial insights into Theorem 1 and addressing its perceived triviality. Clarifying the misleading statement regarding PID controllers is essential. Additionally, we suggest that the authors elaborate on the performance and limitations of CONs, particularly in contexts beyond soft robotics, and include inference time for different methods in Table 1. We also recommend that the authors address the limitations of the method with respect to nonholonomic systems and explore modifications to accommodate partially observable and non-Markovian dynamics. Lastly, incorporating mechanisms to account for time-dependent material properties would enhance the robustness of the proposed approach and better frame the method's strengths and weaknesses.
