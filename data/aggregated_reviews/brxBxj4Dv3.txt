Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents NoisyGL, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) under label noise conditions. The authors implement 17 methods (10 Graph Label Noise (GLN) and 7 Label Noise (LLN)) and assess their performance across eight datasets, revealing insights into the impact of graph structure and noise types on GNN performance. The NoisyGL library is introduced to facilitate future research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- NoisyGL provides a standardized framework for evaluating GNNs under label noise, promoting transparency and reproducibility.
- The benchmark includes a diverse range of GLN and LLN methods, ensuring robustness and generalizability of findings.
- The paper is well-organized, with rigorous experimental design and clear presentation of results.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a theoretical analysis of the problems addressed.
- There is a need for more diverse datasets, particularly heterogeneous graphs, to broaden the evaluation scope.
- The computational requirements for running the experiments and scalability measures for larger graphs are not discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis of the problems addressed in the benchmark. Additionally, consider including more diverse datasets, especially heterogeneous graphs, to enhance the evaluation. Clarifying the computational requirements for the experiments and detailing the scalability measures for larger graphs would also strengthen the paper. Furthermore, we suggest adding a section on the software-side of the benchmark, including information on "standardized backbones" and how users can easily add new methods. Lastly, addressing minor grammatical errors and enhancing the clarity of certain descriptions, such as pair noise, would improve the overall readability.
