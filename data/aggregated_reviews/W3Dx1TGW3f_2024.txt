Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a general approach for bilevel optimization where the lower-level component is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The authors propose the Hyper Policy Gradient Descent (HPGD) algorithm for solving bilevel contextual MDPs (BO-CMDP) and prove its convergence. The method simplifies the lower-level problem to a best response function using entropy-based reinforcement learning (RL), facilitating a closed-form solution. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method through experiments in a four-room environment and connect their framework to various applications, including meta-RL and economics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The problem setting of bilevel optimization in RL is crucial for the community.  
- The authors provide a detailed theoretical analysis and prove the convergence of HPGD.  
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with interesting applications motivating the proposed formulation.  

Weaknesses:  
1) The proposed methods may only apply when lower-level components have a closed form, limiting their generalizability.  
2) Experiments are primarily conducted in a four-room environment, lacking tests in more complex scenarios like meta RL or economic models.  
3) Proposition 9 closely follows established work, limiting its theoretical contributions.  
4) The paper contains several typos and lacks clarity in some assumptions and proofs.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their methods by conducting experiments in more complex environments, such as meta RL or economic models, to validate their effectiveness. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the assumptions made in the paper, particularly regarding the stepsize requirements and norms used in the proofs. Addressing the identified typos and enhancing the theoretical contributions would also strengthen the paper.
