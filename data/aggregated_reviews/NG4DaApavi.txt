Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents two new algorithms, Boltzmann Tree Search (BTS) and Decaying Entropy Tree Search (DENTS), aimed at enhancing exploration in Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) beyond the conventional Upper Confidence Bound for Trees (UCT) policy. The authors address the convergence issues of Maximum ENtropy Tree Search (MENTS) by introducing modifications that ensure both BTS and DENTS converge to the optimal policy as the number of trials increases. The empirical evaluation demonstrates that both algorithms perform comparably or better than existing baselines in toy problems and significantly outperform them in a 9x9 Go tournament. Additionally, the paper explores the properties of environments that enhance the effectiveness of BTS and MENTS, particularly in scenarios with large delayed rewards and trap states, as exemplified by the Frozen Lake environment. The authors propose that environments with dense reward signals may render entropy-based exploration unnecessary, making BTS more suitable. A comparative table of MENTS, DENTS, and BTS is planned for inclusion in the appendix to clarify their strengths and weaknesses.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively identifies and explains the convergence issues associated with MENTS, using illustrative examples such as the D-chain problem.
- The proposed modifications to MENTS are intuitive and well-articulated.
- The theoretical underpinnings are robust, supported by extensive proofs, and the empirical results validate the improvements of BTS and DENTS over baseline methods.
- The paper identifies key properties of environments that favor the use of BTS and MENTS.
- The inclusion of a comparative table enhances clarity regarding the algorithms' strengths and weaknesses.
- The authors demonstrate responsiveness to reviewer feedback by planning to incorporate additional experiments and discussions.

Weaknesses:
- The rationale for increasing exploration during planning could be articulated more clearly, particularly in relation to UCT's application in real-world action selection.
- The choice of using simple regret as a metric instead of cumulative regret requires further justification, especially in light of computational costs.
- The contributions of BTS and DENTS may be perceived as incremental extensions of MENTS rather than groundbreaking innovations.
- The paper lacks explicit mention of the specific properties of environments in the experimental or discussion sections.
- There is a need for clearer delineation of the baseline model (PUCT) in the context of the experiments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the motivation for enhanced exploration during planning, particularly emphasizing the context of UCT's application in real-world scenarios. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify their choice of simple regret as a metric, potentially referencing the discussions in Tolpin & Shimony et al. to strengthen their argument. It would also be beneficial to provide a concise comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of MENTS, DENTS, and BTS to facilitate clearer understanding. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the discussion section by explicitly mentioning the specific properties of environments that are more suitable for BTS and DENTS. Lastly, including experiments comparing the PUCT model with KataGo would provide a clearer baseline for readers, and addressing the notation inconsistencies in equations while enhancing the clarity of certain sections would improve the overall presentation of the paper.
