Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a benchmark and methodology for calculating the properties and design of photonic structures, specifically through FDTD simulations of nanophotonic structures relevant to solar cells, EM shielding, and anti-reflective coatings. The authors propose objective functions for maximizing absorption and evaluate various optimization algorithms over a parametric space covered by over 2 million simulations. Additionally, the paper introduces a new dataset and benchmark for nanophotonic structures, aiming to bridge the gap between materials science and machine learning. The authors provide detailed computational costs for simulations and have implemented an abstract class to facilitate the addition of new structures and materials. While the paper aims to contribute datasets and benchmarks for the design of nanophotonic structures, concerns about its fit for the conference and the clarity of its contributions are noted.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written, responsive to the conference topic, and presents a sound methodology.  
- A significant number of geometric configurations have been simulated, providing a comprehensive framework.  
- The dataset and benchmark are novel and fill a gap in nanophotonics research.  
- The authors provide detailed computational cost metrics and a clear structure for future extensions.  
- The implementation of an abstract class allows for easy addition of new structures and materials.  
- The repository is well-structured, and the source code is well-documented.

Weaknesses:  
- The impact of the dataset is limited, and the relationship to prior work on datasets for nanophotonics simulation is inadequately discussed.  
- The benchmarks are fairly limited, with few methods tested and no hyperparameter tuning.  
- The paper lacks clarity regarding how the developed simulation compares with other related work, such as Meep, and the advantages of the proposed framework remain unclear.  
- There are issues with the clarity of the relationship between various metrics (E, B, T, A, R) for non-experts.  
- The paper initially included unnecessary background information on electromagnetism, which has since been revised.  
- There is a lack of clarity regarding the accuracy and calibration of the simulation pipeline.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the relationship between E, B, T, A, and R for non-experts. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed discussion on how their framework compares with existing tools like Meep, including advantages in computation and accuracy. It would be beneficial to expand the benchmarks tested and tune hyperparameters to gauge the difficulty of the tasks more effectively. We also suggest that the authors clarify the contributions of their dataset in relation to prior work and consider including a maintenance plan for the repository to enhance its utility for future researchers. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors expand the dataset to include more materials and geometries, as well as address the concerns regarding the simulation pipeline's accuracy. Lastly, it would be beneficial to provide a compelling account of how the dataset can be utilized by other researchers, enhancing its practical value, and clarify their stance on the potential for future extensions of the dataset, rather than stating it is "out of scope."
