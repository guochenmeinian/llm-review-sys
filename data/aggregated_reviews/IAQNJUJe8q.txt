Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents PepGLAD, a novel latent diffusion model for full-atom peptide design, addressing challenges in full-atom modeling and diverse binding geometry. The authors propose a receptor-specific affine transformation to project raw Euclidean space into a standardized one, ensuring physical symmetry. They also introduce a benchmark dataset created from PDB examples with a proper train/test split, which is beneficial for the field.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The construction of a benchmark dataset with a proper train/test split is commendable and often overlooked in related work.
- The novel Geometric Latent Space maintains advantages of both Latent and Geometric Diffusion for efficiency and interaction modeling.
- PepGLAD achieves full-atom generation, marking a significant improvement over previous methods focused on backbone-only modeling.
- The proposed evaluation metrics demonstrate that PepGLAD outperforms existing models.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset size (6105 non-redundant complexes) is small for deep learning and the complexity of the task, raising concerns about its ability to capture the conformation space adequately.
- The introduction and explanation of the receptor-specific affine transformation lack clarity, particularly regarding its application to peptides and binding site distributions.
- The conditioning method of pockets is not thoroughly explored, potentially leading to issues due to the differing levels of abstraction between geometric latents and pocket coordinates.
- The model's reliance on an additional classifier may complicate the architecture unnecessarily.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction regarding the necessity of providing the binding site rather than the whole protein structure. Additionally, please clarify the argument for the affine transformation and its implications for bond lengths in different orientations. It would be beneficial to explore the explicit interaction modeling in geometric latent space more thoroughly, as this is a key advantage over standard latent space. 

We suggest augmenting the dataset to enhance its size and diversity, and consider providing more context on what constitutes a good RMSD in practical terms. Lastly, addressing the limitations of the method, particularly regarding the reliability of in silico evaluations and the potential for data leakage in binding site definitions, would strengthen the paper.
