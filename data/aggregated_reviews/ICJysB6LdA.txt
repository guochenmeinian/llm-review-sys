### Key Points
This paper presents the Paths-over-Graph (PoG) method, which integrates Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance reasoning capabilities in multi-hop and multi-entity tasks. PoG employs a three-stage dynamic exploration and pruning strategy, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across multiple KGQA benchmarks. The authors clearly articulate their motivation and methodology, demonstrating significant performance improvements over previous methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The experimental results robustly support the paper's claims, showcasing PoG's effectiveness in multi-hop reasoning and multi-entity problems.
- The integration of KGs into LLM reasoning is a meaningful contribution, addressing existing gaps in the literature.
- The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with self-explanatory figures that enhance understanding.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a direct comparison of processing time between PoG and other methods, which is crucial given the potential impact of LLMs' parallel processing capabilities.
- There is insufficient differentiation between PoG and existing methods like ToG, raising questions about its novelty.
- The evaluation metrics are limited to Hits@1, neglecting more comprehensive metrics such as F1, and the datasets used are not fully leveraged.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the novelty of PoG by explicitly detailing how it fundamentally differs from existing methods like ToG. Additionally, we suggest providing a time-based comparison of PoG against other baselines to address concerns regarding processing efficiency. It would also be beneficial to include more comprehensive evaluation metrics beyond Hits@1, such as F1, to better assess the method's performance. Lastly, consider simplifying the figures or providing clearer explanations in their captions to enhance reader comprehension.
