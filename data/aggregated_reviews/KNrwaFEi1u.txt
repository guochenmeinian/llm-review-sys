Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a benchmark for evaluating multi-object hallucinations in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) through the introduction of Recognition-based Object Probing Evaluation (ROPE). The authors explore how LVLMs respond to multiple object prompts and provide empirical findings, indicating that existing models may rely on shortcuts to generate hallucinated responses. The study includes a detailed analysis of nine factors influencing multi-object hallucination.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. **Novelty**: The exploration of multi-object hallucination in LVLMs is a fresh perspective, contrasting with the predominant focus on single-object hallucination in existing literature.  
2. **Thorough Analysis**: The paper conducts an extensive examination of various factors contributing to multi-object hallucination, supported by numerous experiments.  
3. **Interesting Findings**: The authors identify significant instruction formats that induce hallucination, suggesting that scaling up models alone may not mitigate the issue.

Weaknesses:  
1. **Missing Evaluations**: The paper lacks evaluations of existing single-object hallucination mitigation methods, such as OPERA or RLHF techniques, which are crucial for validating the proposed multi-object benchmark.  
2. **Limited Real-World Significance**: The experiments are conducted under a narrow inference setup, focusing on a specific instruction format and limiting output tokens to objects, which raises questions about the broader applicability of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by incorporating existing single-object hallucination methods to assess their performance on the proposed multi-object benchmark. Additionally, we suggest discussing the potential real-world implications of the findings more thoroughly, particularly how the benchmark could be applied in diverse scenarios beyond the specific setup used in the experiments. Including a baseline method for mitigating multi-object hallucinations and conducting latency analysis would also enhance the comprehensiveness of the study.
