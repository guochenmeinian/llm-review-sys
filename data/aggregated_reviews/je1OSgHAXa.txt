### Key Points
This paper presents a novel silicon photonic circuit designed for 1D convolution over discrete time-step input signals. The circuit employs Mach-Zehnder Interferometers, allowing for N-coefficient convolutions when chained. The authors theoretically describe the circuit's transfer function using scattering matrices, and they integrate the convolution circuit into PyTorch, enabling direct training of circuit parameters without conversion from standard convolutional layers. The study evaluates the impact of phase shifter noise and quantization levels, demonstrating that a model with low noise and 8-bit quantization can achieve higher test accuracy than a full-precision floating-point reference CNN.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors propose a novel silicon photonic circuit for 1D convolution.
- The functionality is well articulated through text and equations.
- The circuit's operation is successfully replicated in PyTorch, with direct training of circuit parameters.
- The approach achieves accuracies close to those of reference CNNs under low noise conditions.

Weaknesses:
- There is no concept presented for integrating this circuit into a larger neuromorphic photonic system, raising questions about its scalability.
- The reliance on D/A and A/D converters may lead to high power consumption, particularly for 2D convolutions requiring digital buffers for partial sums.
- Critical details about the silicon photonic circuit, such as size, technology, noise characteristics, and energy estimates, are missing.
- The comparison to existing work on photonic convolutions is limited and could benefit from a more thorough discussion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by providing additional details about the hardware implementation, including circuit dimensions and measurements. Clarifying the circuit's capability to process L-size input signals over L timesteps for an (L-K+1) size output signal would enhance understanding. Additionally, discussing the integration of this circuit into a larger neuromorphic photonic system, including its operational structure and scalability, is essential. A more comprehensive comparison with existing photonic convolution solutions would also strengthen the paper.
