Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents learning methods that offer theoretical guarantees for point-wise predictions in challenging scenarios, particularly in the context of adversarial attacks and distribution shifts. The authors propose robustly-reliable learners that either provide a prediction with a reliability region or abstain from making a prediction, ensuring correctness within the defined reliability region. The paper contributes to the understanding of reliable learning by establishing connections between reliability and various adversarial loss functions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a significant theoretical contribution to reliable learning, addressing critical scenarios impacted by adversarial attacks and distribution shifts.
- It includes intuitive illustrations and well-supported claims through extensive proofs, enhancing clarity and understanding.
- The algorithms proposed can be efficient for real-world applications, and the concept of reliability radius is readily understandable.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on the realizable case limits the applicability of the results, as this assumption may not hold in practical scenarios.
- The paper is dense and challenging to read, with many theoretical results presented without sufficient context or examples, particularly in Section 4.
- The discussion on the probabilities in Theorem 3.3 lacks clarity regarding their practical significance, and the limitations of the "safely-reliable" notion are not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the readability of the paper by first presenting the main ideas and results in simpler scenarios before generalizing to more complex cases. Additionally, further discussion on the implications of the realizable assumption in relation to distribution shifts would enhance the paper's relevance. Quantifying the probabilities in Theorem 3.3 would provide clearer insights into their practical utility. Lastly, including more examples to illustrate the differences between reliable and safely-reliable notions would strengthen the paper's arguments.
