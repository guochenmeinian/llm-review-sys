Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel algorithm for equivalence testing between two continuous distributions under approximate differential privacy. The authors adapt the algorithm from Diakonikolas et al. to ensure differential privacy, addressing challenges such as the inability to resample new points for estimating $\ell_2$ distances and the sensitivity of data shifts. The algorithm employs Poisson-drawn subsamples and a coupling argument using Bernoulli random variables to mitigate these issues. The paper also discusses the sample complexity required for the algorithm to output correct results with high probability, providing theoretical guarantees on the number of samples needed.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper contributes to the development of differential privacy hypothesis testers, presenting the first algorithm for continuous distributions.
- The exposition of the algorithm is clear, and the authors effectively clarify deviations from the original proof technique.
- The theoretical guarantees provided are sound, and the proofs are well-explained.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation lacks clarity in defining the privacy notion, particularly the concept of "neighboring datasets," which may confuse readers.
- There is insufficient discussion on the rate attained by the method, particularly regarding its optimality compared to existing literature.
- The writing quality could be improved, with several typographical errors and ambiguities in the algorithm's description.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their presentation by explicitly defining the notion of "neighboring datasets" early in the paper. Additionally, a broader discussion on the optimality of the rates attained by the algorithm, including comparisons with existing results for continuous distributions, would strengthen the contribution. The authors should also consider providing a more detailed explanation of the algorithm in plain English alongside the pseudocode to enhance accessibility. Finally, a thorough proofreading to correct typographical errors and improve clarity is essential.
