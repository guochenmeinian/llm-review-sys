Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for enhancing diversity in human-agent collaboration tasks through cross-play rewards and introduces a mixed-play training paradigm to optimize this process, referred to as the "handshake." The developed agent, CoMeDi, demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline agents in the OverCooked game. The authors also explore generating diverse conventions by balancing self-play and cross-play performance, avoiding handshake issues through a mixed-play bonus/penalty.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and provides detailed appendices and code, enhancing the clarity of algorithms and experiments.
- It addresses a significant problem in ad-hoc team play within human-agent collaboration research.
- The experimental validation of self-play, cross-play, and mixed-play is thorough, showcasing the effectiveness of the CoMeDi approach.

Weaknesses:
- The CoMiDi agent's performance appears unintelligent in scenarios with non-stationary human behavior, raising questions about its adaptability and training diversity.
- The experimental section lacks comparisons with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods like FCP and HSP, which could strengthen the proposed methods.
- User studies primarily focus on expert human partners, leaving unaddressed questions about performance with novices and overall user preferences.
- The evaluation of the algorithm is limited to a single OverCooked grid, which may not represent its effectiveness across varied environments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the adaptability of the CoMiDi agent by addressing its performance in scenarios with novice players and clarifying how it resolves issues with non-stationary behaviors. Additionally, we suggest conducting comparisons with SOTA methods such as FCP and HSP to solidify the proposed approach. It would be beneficial to expand the discussion of user studies to include evaluations with human partners of varying skill levels and preferences. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to evaluate the algorithm across the full OverCooked suite to ensure robustness and generalizability. Lastly, we recommend providing more insights into the scalability of the proposed method in complex environments and clarifying the selection process for the tunable parameters in mixed-play scenarios.
