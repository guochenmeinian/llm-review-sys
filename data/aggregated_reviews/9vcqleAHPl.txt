Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a few-shot learning approach for Whole-Slide Image (WSI) classification, building on the Tip-Adapter framework. The proposed method incorporates a cache branch for knowledge retrieval from few-shot instances and a prior branch utilizing CLIP and GPT-4V to enhance predictive performance. Additionally, the authors introduce a novel dual-tier few-shot learning paradigm, featuring a cache model that allows for learnable labels and features, addressing the challenges of utilizing WSI data effectively and managing the large size of WSIs. Experimental results on two WSI datasets demonstrate the method's superiority over the original Tip-Adapter and Tip-Adapter-F, achieving performance close to fully supervised learning with minimal labeled instances. The method, referred to as FAST-CONCH, significantly outperforms existing models like CONCH in terms of average bag-level classification AUC.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Originality: The paper explores the few-shot learning paradigm in WSI classification, an under-researched area in computational pathology.
- Significance: The approach shows potential for high performance with limited labeled data, addressing the labor-intensive nature of pixel-level WSI annotation.
- Quality: The experimental design is robust, with comprehensive evaluations confirming the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
- Innovation: The dual-tier few-shot learning paradigm and cache model effectively tackle the challenges of WSI data utilization and size, leading to substantial improvements in classification performance.

Weaknesses:
- Writing Quality: The manuscript requires substantial clarity improvements, with several errors and undefined terms noted throughout.
- Limited Technical Contribution: Key elements of the proposed method appear to be adaptations of the existing Tip-Adapter framework, lacking significant novelty.
- Insufficient Comparisons: The paper does not adequately compare with important vision-language models in computational pathology, such as PLIP and CONCH, which are crucial for validating the proposed method's performance.
- Clarity in Rebuttal: Some responses in the rebuttal lacked clarity, leading to inefficiencies in communication, and did not fully capture the reviewers' concerns.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the writing quality by addressing the identified errors and enhancing clarity throughout the manuscript. Additionally, the authors should clarify the technical contributions of their approach, particularly in distinguishing it from Tip-Adapter. It is essential to include comparisons with relevant vision-language models like PLIP and CONCH to substantiate the method's significance. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors provide detailed explanations of the implementation for few-shot WSI classification and analyze the impact of randomly selected few-shot instances on performance stability. Lastly, we encourage the authors to improve the clarity of their responses in the rebuttal to ensure that all reviewer concerns are addressed more effectively and to incorporate the important suggestions and questions raised by reviewers into the final version of the paper. Making the annotated dataset publicly available would also enhance the research impact of this work.
