### Key Points
This paper investigates whether the entropy of the listener's gaze in face-to-face conversations adheres to the law of entropy rate constancy (ERC). The study focuses on participants describing board games without using game equipment, utilizing OpenFace for gaze information extraction. The analysis reveals that Perplexity increases with conversation length. The authors propose a computational pipeline to analyze eye-gaze patterns and correlate them with speech entropy, contributing novel methodologies to the field.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research is the first to investigate gaze behavior in relation to ERC, providing a novel perspective.
- The methodology is well-explained, ensuring reproducibility of results.
- The paper presents a potentially interesting pipeline linking eye-gaze data with speech.

Weaknesses:
- The study's reliance on a single type of dialogue limits the generalizability of findings.
- The criteria for excluding outliers appear arbitrary, lacking adequate justification.
- The results are somewhat inconclusive, and the practical significance of the findings is not sufficiently articulated.
- Dialogue position and gaze sequence alignment require more in-depth analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by incorporating multiple dialogue types. Additionally, the authors should provide a clearer justification for the exclusion of outliers and enhance the analysis of dialogue positions and gaze sequences. It would be beneficial to include more comprehensive explanations of the models used, rather than solely referencing other works. Finally, the authors should clarify the reliability and generalizability of their results, particularly in relation to Figure 4.
