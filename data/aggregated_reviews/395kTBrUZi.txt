### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to continuous location embedding in satellite imagery, addressing challenges of spatial and semantic continuity. The authors propose the SatCLE framework, which includes a geospatial refinement strategy and a causal refinement strategy to mitigate out-of-distribution (OoD) query problems and environmental confounders. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art geospatial embeddings across various downstream tasks, including population density prediction and land vegetation classification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The manuscript is well-structured and clearly articulates the motivation and problems addressed.
- The proposed SatCLE framework introduces innovative methods to enhance spatial and semantic continuity in geospatial embeddings.
- Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation contains inaccuracies and unsupported claims, leading to questions about the validity of the proposed solutions.
- The experimental design lacks comprehensiveness, and some visualizations do not effectively communicate the results.
- There is insufficient clarity regarding the challenges addressed and the implementation details of the proposed methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the challenges addressed by labeling them explicitly in the manuscript. Additionally, please provide detailed descriptions of Figures 4 and 7 to enhance reader understanding of the results. It would be beneficial to demonstrate how the performance of SatCLE is influenced by the quality of satellite imagery. An ablation study should be included to assess the impact of accurately identifying causal patches on the performance of the causal refinement strategy. Furthermore, please clarify the discrepancies regarding the parameters mentioned in the equations and ensure that all claims are adequately supported by evidence.
