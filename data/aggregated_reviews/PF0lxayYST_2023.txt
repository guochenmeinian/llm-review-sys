Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of algorithm performance under distribution shifts in tabular data, distinguishing between \( Y|X \) shifts and \( X \) shifts. The authors utilize five datasets to analyze performance across over 86,000 model configurations, revealing that algorithm rankings vary with shift patterns and that the relationship between source and target performance is not strongly linear. They propose a technique to identify covariate regions where \( Y|X \) shifts are most significant and utilize this technique to create interventions that enhance model transfer in these regions. The findings indicate that \( Y|X \) shifts primarily drive performance degradation, with a small validation set from the target distribution aiding transfer. Additionally, the authors introduce a new metric, 'Dom. Ratio', to analyze source-target pairs based on performance degradation and elaborate on the DISDE method for distribution shift decomposition.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Effectively distinguishes between \( Y|X \) shifts and \( X \) shifts, providing qualitative and empirical motivation for their importance.
- Addresses a critical issue in real-world ML deployment, offering datasets, algorithm comparisons, and non-algorithmic methods for shift management.
- The benchmarking of numerous distribution shift methods and model configurations is impressive.
- Includes effective figures and a detailed appendix that enhances understanding.
- The authors have effectively restructured the introduction to provide a clearer roadmap and motivation for their work.
- A comprehensive discussion of limitations has been added, enhancing the transparency of the study.

Weaknesses:
- The organization of the paper is jumbled, making it difficult to follow the roadmap and key contributions.
- Limited discussion on the relation to prior work and the implications of findings on existing benchmarks.
- Claims of representativeness regarding selected shifts and datasets lack clarity and justification.
- The practical and ethical implications of collecting data from the target distribution are insufficiently addressed, particularly concerning marginalized communities.
- Some sections still lack clarity, particularly around the taxonomy of datasets and settings, which may confuse new readers.
- Clarification is needed on whether "Average Accuracy" refers to a micro or macro-average, and the notation and terminology used in certain equations may not be standard.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper's organization by providing a clearer roadmap in the introduction, outlining the key questions and contributions in a structured manner. Specifically, add more discussion on the relation to prior work and the limitations of existing benchmarks. Clarify the "Choice of Domain" section to explain how demographic and time/space shifts relate to one another. 

Additionally, we suggest integrating the limitations section into the main text rather than relegating it to the appendix, and addressing claims of representativeness by describing selected shifts as examples rather than asserting they are representative of all tabular datasets. 

We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the practical and ethical implications of collecting data from the target distribution, particularly regarding privacy concerns and the potential for predatory inclusion. Please clarify if "Average Accuracy" refers to a micro or macro-average and consider retiring the Adult dataset in favor of ACS Income. 

Lastly, we encourage the authors to expand on the connections between their recommendations and existing literature on active learning, causal relation learning, and feature importance algorithms, while also improving clarity around the taxonomy of datasets and settings. Introduce the concept of a shared distribution earlier in Section 3.1 to aid logical progression, and refine the notation in equations (3.4) and (3.5) for better comprehension and consistency in terminology throughout the paper.
