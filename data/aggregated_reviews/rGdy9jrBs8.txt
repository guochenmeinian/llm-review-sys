Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents UAV3D, a new dataset for single-agent and collaborative 3D perception in UAVs, synthesized using the CARLA environment with AirSim for UAV simulation. The dataset includes 1,000 scenes, each with 20 frames fully annotated with 3D bounding boxes for vehicles, and supports four 3D perception tasks: single UAV 3D object detection, single UAV object tracking, collaborative UAVs 3D object detection, and collaborative UAVs object tracking. The authors benchmark established methods on these tasks, providing baseline results. UAV3D is noted as the largest collection of RGB images and 3D box annotations compared to existing UAV datasets, enhancing compatibility for users.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces the largest UAV dataset available, supporting multi-agent and multi-view tasks.
2. It benchmarks both detection and tracking tasks, offering comprehensive evaluation metrics.
3. The dataset and code are accessible, facilitating further research.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of UAV3D is limited as previous work like CoPerception-UAV exists; the authors should clarify how their approach differs beyond data quantity.
2. The dataset lacks benchmarks for semantic segmentation, despite its potential utility.
3. The paper does not adequately discuss the limitations of synthetic datasets for real-world applications.
4. Some technical details, such as the vehicle categories and the use of a 3D voxel grid, require clearer explanations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the sim-to-real transfer process, including an experimental analysis of the challenges and effectiveness of transferring simulations to real-world applications. Additionally, demonstrating interactive tasks within the co-simulation framework would provide valuable insights into multi-UAV collaboration. It would also be beneficial to include basic benchmarks for semantic segmentation tasks and to clarify the differences between UAV3D and existing datasets, particularly CoPerception-UAV. Furthermore, enhancing the clarity of Figure 4 to better showcase performance differences among algorithms would improve the presentation of results. Lastly, a more thorough discussion of the dataset's limitations, particularly regarding its synthetic nature, is essential for understanding its practical applications.
