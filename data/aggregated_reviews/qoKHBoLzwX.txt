### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach within the Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) framework to enhance link prediction in graph-structured data. The authors propose decoupling the norm and cosine similarity in node embeddings to address limitations in existing VGAE models, where these components compete in explaining link probability. A hard expectation maximization learning method is introduced to differentiate the effects of node homophily and popularity on link formation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed D-VGAE model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in link prediction and achieves comparable results in node classification and clustering.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The observation in Figure 1, showing the norm of node embeddings increases with degree, is compelling.
2. The innovative concept of decoupling norm and angle in node embeddings under the VGAE model shows considerable promise.
3. The proposed method demonstrates effectiveness in link prediction tasks, outperforming baseline models.

Weaknesses:
1. The definition of node popularity is unclear and informal.
2. Insights from Figure 1 could be enhanced by integrating degree information to refine node embedding learning.
3. The approach heavily relies on assumptions about node popularity and homophily, necessitating a more comprehensive theoretical analysis to substantiate these claims.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Definition 1 regarding node popularity. Additionally, integrating degree information to refine node embedding learning would be advantageous. A more thorough theoretical analysis supporting the assumptions about node popularity and homophily is essential to strengthen the paper's arguments. Furthermore, we suggest providing a detailed explanation of the generation process and the rationale behind the choice of comparison methods in the experiments.
