### Key Points
This paper presents MassSpecGym, a large-scale high-quality MS spectra benchmark that standardizes three challenges with new evaluation metrics and a novel data split, facilitating robust molecular discovery and identification. The authors propose a comprehensive dataset of tandem mass spectra, comprising 231,000 spectra from 29,000 molecules, and define three new tasks for machine learning models: de novo molecular structure generation, molecule retrieval, and spectrum simulation. The study aims to lower barriers to entry in computational mass spectrometry by providing a well-curated dataset and rigorous evaluation protocols.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The submission introduces a diverse and standardized tandem MS spectrum dataset, addressing a critical need in the ML and chemistry communities.
- The rigorous approach to preprocessing and curation follows standard practices within the MS community.
- The paper formulates three canonical ML problems in tandem mass spectrometry and presents a strong evaluation approach.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed tasks lack clarity and formulation, particularly regarding the feasibility of directly generating molecule graphs from 2D MASS spectra.
- Missing baselines for the de novo molecule structure design task and insufficient discussion on the future work and gaps in current AI models.
- The number of tools tested for benchmarking is limited, and the authors did not mention any limitations in the conclusion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and formulation of the proposed tasks, particularly by providing empirical results or case studies to justify the feasibility of generating molecule graphs from 2D MASS spectra. Additionally, include more baselines for the de novo molecule structure design task and discuss the gaps in current AI models more thoroughly. It would also be beneficial to expand the range of models evaluated for molecule retrieval and diversify the metrics used for spectrum simulation. Furthermore, please provide detailed information on the number of spectra eliminated at each filtering step and assess the potential for data leakage in the dataset. Lastly, enhance the documentation of the GitHub repository to facilitate adoption and extension of the dataset.
