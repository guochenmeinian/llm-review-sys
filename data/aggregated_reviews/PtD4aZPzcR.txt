### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the density estimation problem, focusing on the trade-off between sample complexity, query complexity, and data structure space. The authors establish both a lower bound and an upper bound for the problem, utilizing the ‘list-of-points’ model of computation. Their theoretical findings are supported by experiments demonstrating improvements over prior methods. The paper also explores the implications of these bounds for algorithm development in density estimation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a significant problem in density estimation, providing a fundamental lower bound that enhances understanding and algorithm construction.  
- The writing is clear, and the results are tight, with effective experimental validation.  
- The statistical and computational trade-off results are insightful, indicating the near-optimality of existing literature.  

Weaknesses:  
- Some proof techniques are not entirely original, relying on prior work, though their adaptation is non-trivial.  
- The writing could be clearer in certain areas, particularly regarding the definitions of data structures and the implications of statistical-computational trade-offs.  
- The paper's focus on discrete density estimation may limit its broader applicability, and the novelty of the reduction from GapSS to URDE is unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their writing, particularly in explaining terms like “preserving polynomial data structure” and the implications of statistical-computational trade-offs. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more detailed discussion of the novelty of their techniques compared to existing bounds. It would also be beneficial for the authors to comment on the potential for extending their work to continuous density estimation settings, such as mixtures of Gaussians.
