### Key Points
This paper presents CoMix, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-task capabilities of models in comic analysis. CoMix integrates three existing datasets and introduces a new American comic-style dataset, ensuring diversity. It offers extensive annotations for tasks such as object detection, speaker identification, character re-identification, reading order, character naming, and dialogue generation. The benchmark introduces metrics like Hybrid Dialog Score for evaluating higher-level tasks. Baseline results reveal significant performance gaps between current models and human performance, indicating opportunities for advancements in comic understanding. The dataset, annotations, and evaluation server are publicly available to encourage further research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The quality of the work is exemplary, demonstrating a comprehensive approach to the challenges in comic analysis.
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written.
- The dataset contains a large volume of comic images with sufficient diversity and comprehensive annotations, making it a good benchmark for evaluating multi-modal understanding.

Weaknesses:
- The relatively small volume of data may limit the dataset's applicability in training.
- The dataset raises significant copyright concerns.
- The authors do not provide a clear technical gap regarding comic understanding compared to general visual understanding, and the ethical considerations associated with comic content require more attention.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset's volume to enhance its applicability in training. Additionally, we urge the authors to address copyright concerns more thoroughly and explore sustainable solutions for data hosting and access. A more detailed examination of potential biases in textual content within the comics is essential, particularly regarding gender representation and other demographic factors. Finally, clarifying the distinction between comic understanding and general visual understanding would strengthen the paper's contributions.
