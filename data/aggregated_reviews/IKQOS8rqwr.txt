Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents QuACK, an innovative framework that leverages Koopman operator theory to accelerate gradient-based quantum optimization and machine learning. The authors propose an alternating algorithm that efficiently predicts gradient dynamics, resulting in significant speed improvements for variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). The paper includes extensive experiments across various quantum computing applications, demonstrating QuACK's robustness and speedup, alongside a theoretical analysis of its stability, convergence, and complexity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. QuACK significantly accelerates gradient-based quantum optimization by predicting gradient dynamics, facilitating deployment on NISQ devices.
2. Extensive experiments validate speedup across quantum Ising models, quantum chemistry, and quantum machine learning, including verification for quantum natural gradients.
3. Theoretical analysis of QuACKâ€™s stability, convergence, complexity, and speedup is provided.

Weaknesses:
1. The formula $\Theta(t_{d+1})\approx K\Phi(\Theta(t_0))$ lacks theoretical support, as the Koopman operator is defined differently.
2. An additional experiment on NISQ devices is necessary to validate QuACK's feasibility in realistic scenarios.
3. The performance of QuACK may heavily depend on hyperparameters n_sim and n_DMD, which introduces potential computational burdens and stability concerns, particularly under noise conditions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical justification for the formula presented on page 5. Additionally, conducting an extra experiment on NISQ devices would strengthen the validation of QuACK's applicability. It would be beneficial to provide a more in-depth discussion regarding the sensitivity of QuACK to hyperparameters and noise, addressing potential stability issues. Clarifying the relationship between n_sim and m, and ensuring all relevant references are included, will enhance the paper's comprehensiveness. Furthermore, we suggest revising the font size in Figure 1 for better readability and considering the removal of Corollary 5.4 due to redundancy.
