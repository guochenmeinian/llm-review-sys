### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for causal reasoning that simplifies large structural causal models (SCMs) through operations such as consolidation and partitioning. The consolidation allows for the modeling of a subset of endogenous variables while still supporting all possible interventions, and partitioning enables endogenous variables from one sub-model to act as exogenous variables in another. The authors discuss potential complexity reductions and provide examples, including modeling tool wear on a milling machine and planning policies for a platformer game.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
* The paper clearly articulates its contributions and relates them well to existing work, justifying their relevance.
* Arguments are built formally and intuitively, presenting meaningful results and constraints.
* The examples effectively illustrate the benefits of the proposed framework.
* Contributions are likely to be relevant to researchers focused on large-scale causal modeling.

Weaknesses:
* Some arguments are vague or explanations incomplete.
* Formal notation is occasionally unclear.
* There are errors or omissions in explanations at several points.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definition of possible interventions, particularly in Definition 1. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed derivation of how to extract a consolidating causal mechanism from a toy SCM. We suggest that the authors clarify the notation used in Definition 2 and ensure that the distinction between sets $\textbf{E}$ and $\textbf{E}'$ is more explicit. Furthermore, we recommend addressing the notational irregularities noted in section 3 and ensuring that the explanation of "explicit computation" in Figure 2 is clearer. Lastly, we encourage the authors to propose a concrete algorithm for compressing causal equations, as this is a key contribution of the work.
