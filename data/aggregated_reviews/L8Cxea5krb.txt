### Key Points
This paper presents the first Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) dataset for Galician, a low-resource language, and introduces a pre-processing method termed "verbal indexing." The authors evaluate their method on both Galician and Spanish, aiming to enhance the accuracy of semantic role identification. The study emphasizes the significance of SRL in understanding verbal predicates and aims to contribute to the field of NLP by providing resources for underrepresented languages.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The creation of a novel dataset for Galician fills a significant gap in NLP resources for low-resource languages.
- The introduction of "verbal indexing" offers a fresh perspective on semantically parsing complex sentences.
- The application of transfer learning demonstrates relevance to current research trends in NLP.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset's size and diversity may be insufficient for deep learning models, potentially limiting its linguistic richness.
- The novelty of the "verbal indexing" method is questioned, as it appears similar to existing practices in the literature.
- There is a lack of detailed analysis regarding model failures and challenges, which could provide valuable insights for future improvements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the generalizability of the "verbal indexing" method, particularly its applicability to languages with different linguistic structures. Additionally, the authors should provide more details on the diversity of the Galician SRL dataset in terms of genres, styles, and sources to ensure it captures a broad spectrum of the language. A deeper analysis of where the models struggled or failed would enhance the paper's insights. Furthermore, we suggest including comparisons with recent multilingual state-of-the-art SRL works to strengthen the evaluation section and clarify the novelty of the verbal indexing method in relation to existing approaches.
