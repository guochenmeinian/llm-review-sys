Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents "trajdata," a unified interface for trajectory forecasting datasets, integrating popular datasets like SDD, UCF/ETH, Waymo, and Lyft. The authors aim to standardize trajectory data representation and HD map information, facilitating easier comparison and evaluation across datasets. The paper includes a comprehensive analysis of existing datasets, providing insights into agent diversity, trajectory variety, and agent density, which can guide future research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of trajdata simplifies dataset handling, allowing researchers to focus on algorithm design rather than data processing.
- It supports multi-dataset benchmarking and agent-centric batch generation, aligning with current research interests.
- The analysis of existing datasets is thorough, offering valuable insights for researchers.

Weaknesses:
- The authors have not demonstrated experimental results of existing methods using the trajdata interface, which raises concerns about the validity of data modifications.
- The unified interface does not yet incorporate sensor data, limiting its application for perception research.
- There is no clear system for adding new datasets to trajdata, and the overhead of using the unified API compared to individual dataset APIs is not addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the trajdata interface by incorporating sensor data to broaden its utility for the AV research community. Additionally, we suggest providing a clear system for users to add new datasets and addressing the overhead of using the unified API compared to individual dataset APIs. Furthermore, enabling users to select data splits for testing/training based on statistical scene descriptions would enhance flexibility. Lastly, we encourage the authors to include experimental results demonstrating the performance of existing methods on the trajdata interface to validate their modifications.
