Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for achieving idempotent learned image compression (LIC) using right-inverse transforms, which allows for more flexible and expressive transformations. The authors argue that invertibility is sufficient but not necessary for idempotence, detailing the use of right-reversible atomic transformations, including convolution and quantization. The work introduces a novel approach to codec re-compression stability and demonstrates state-of-the-art rate-distortion (RD) performance among idempotent codecs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides an interesting theoretical proof that idempotence can be relaxed to right-reversibility.
- It achieves state-of-the-art RD performance and presents a well-organized description of the right-reversible atomic transformations.
- The authors include an ablation study that highlights the significance of each contribution.

Weaknesses:
- The analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed framework is insufficient, lacking detailed cost analysis for its components.
- First-time compression RD performance is notably lower than that of modern LIC methods, necessitating further analysis for improvement.
- Limited comparisons with non-idempotent codecs and insufficient discussion of the framework's limitations, particularly regarding preprocessing assumptions.
- The transition between function and matrix notation is not smooth, and the description of blocked convolutions is confusing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the transition from function notation to matrix notation and provide a more detailed explanation of the blocked convolution. Additionally, we suggest including a comprehensive analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed framework and enhancing the discussion on the limitations, particularly regarding the preprocessing assumptions. It would also be beneficial to include comparisons with non-idempotent codecs to better contextualize the performance of the proposed framework.
