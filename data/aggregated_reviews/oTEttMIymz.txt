Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a 3D Gaussian Splatting method for rendering novel views from sparse inputs, utilizing a pre-trained keypoints matching network for dense point initialization, a consistent loss derived from warped binocular stereo images, and an opacity penalty strategy to refine Gaussian points. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LLFF, DTU, and Blender datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The dense points generated from the pre-trained keypoints matching network significantly enhance initialization for 3D Gaussian Splatting with sparse inputs.
2. The introduction of consistent loss from generated binocular views adds valuable constraints in sparse scenarios.
3. The reported results outperform existing methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation behind the opacity penalty strategy is unclear, particularly regarding how it guides Gaussian points closer to the scene surface. The lack of ablation results for varying configurations of the coefficient $\lambda$ raises concerns.
2. The method's reliance on binocular stereo consistency as a regularization technique lacks novelty, as similar strategies have been employed in prior works. The choice of a horizontal sampling space is also questioned, with suggestions for exploring more diverse sampling methods.
3. The paper does not adequately address occlusion issues introduced by disparity-based warping, which could significantly impact performance.
4. The dense initialization's sensitivity to the matching network and its impact on overall performance require further investigation, including comparisons with random initialization methods.
5. Experimental results lack clarity, with discrepancies noted between reported and actual results, and insufficient labeling in visualizations complicates comparisons.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the opacity penalty strategy's motivation and provide ablation studies for different values of $\lambda$. Additionally, the authors should consider comparing their method against generalizable approaches and include computational performance metrics to highlight speed differences. An analysis of the influence of hyperparameters, particularly $d_{max}$ and $\lambda$, on performance across datasets would strengthen the paper. Furthermore, including depth maps from other methods for comparison and ensuring that experimental results are clearly labeled will enhance the paper's credibility. Finally, addressing occlusion mitigation strategies and providing more comprehensive ablation studies would significantly improve the manuscript.
