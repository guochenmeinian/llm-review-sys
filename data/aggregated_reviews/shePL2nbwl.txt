Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel observation in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL), demonstrating that agents can learn effective policies even with incorrect reward signals. The authors argue that this resilience is due to the pessimistic nature of offline RL algorithms and the biases inherent in data collection, leading to a 'survival instinct' that allows agents to remain within the data distribution. The study identifies conditions under which offline agents can achieve near-optimal policies, suggesting that the reward signal can be largely disregarded if the dataset is appropriately biased.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The originality and quality of the paper are strong, with a well-executed combination of formal proofs and empirical validation.
- The paper is well-written, with a thorough appendix that enhances transparency and clarity in experimental settings.
- The findings are likely to have a significant impact on the offline RL community, particularly regarding benchmark tasks.

Weaknesses:
- There are several typos and minor errors throughout the paper that need correction.
- The argument regarding length bias lacks clarity, and the authors do not convincingly establish it as a primary cause of the observed phenomenon.
- Missing experiments to validate claims about the intrinsic safety of offline RL and the effects of various reward labels.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the argument surrounding length bias and provide more evidence to support its significance. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion on the potential impact of adversarial reward signals on offline agents and exploring the implications of their findings in multi-agent settings. It would be beneficial to address the societal impacts of offline RL in the limitations section and to correct the identified typos throughout the manuscript.
