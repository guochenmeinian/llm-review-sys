### Key Points
This paper presents the Motivation-Aware Session Planning (MASP) framework, which aims to optimize session planning across heterogeneous social platforms using the HeterBERT model. The authors discuss the connections between session planning, session recommendation, and personalized route planning, and validate their approach through experiments on three public datasets. However, the motivation for introducing this new problem is questioned, particularly in light of existing session-based recommendation systems and the capabilities of conversational LLMs like ChatGPT.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a novel task in session planning and provides a clear discussion of its relationship to related fields.
2. The writing is generally clear and fluent.
3. The proposed method includes task-specific improvements over conventional BERT architecture.
4. Code availability during the review phase enhances transparency.

Weaknesses:
1. The theoretical foundation of the HeterBERT model is weak, with insufficient comparative analysis against traditional BERT.
2. The paper lacks an in-depth exploration of computational bottlenecks for large-scale applications.
3. Generalization capabilities of the MASP framework across different social platforms are not adequately discussed.
4. User privacy protection measures and compliance considerations are not addressed.
5. The framework does not account for long-term changes in user behavior.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical foundation and comparative analysis of the HeterBERT model with traditional BERT. A more structured format in Section 2, including bolded headings or subsections, would enhance clarity. The authors should also explore potential bottlenecks in the computational complexity of the Multi-Constraints Session Generation (MCSG) for real-time applications. A discussion on the generalization capability of the MASP framework across various social platforms is necessary, along with addressing user privacy protection and compliance considerations. To strengthen the evaluation, we suggest conducting more experiments and including additional baselines that utilize motivations or intentions, as well as case studies demonstrating the necessity of motivations in session planning. Finally, the authors should consider the implications of biases introduced by prioritizing attributes based on occurrence frequency and predefined constraints.
