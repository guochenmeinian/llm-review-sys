Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CSLR (Cross-Linguistic Code-Switching Lip Reading), a bilingual dataset for lip reading in code-switched scenarios, comprising approximately 85K facial videos and their transcriptions. The authors propose a baseline pipeline achieving English word error rates (WER) as low as 49.05% on code-switched data and character error rates (CER) as low as 20.25% on monolingual Chinese data. The dataset is the first of its kind to explore code-switching in lip reading, facilitating research in multilingual contexts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is novel and significant, being the first to focus on code-switching in lip reading, thus serving as a benchmark for future research.
- The authors provide a thorough evaluation of several baseline methods, demonstrating the potential of combining existing lip reading techniques with code-switching ASR methods.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a detailed comparison with monolingual dataset blending, which is claimed to be inaccessible without supporting citations.
- The motivations for architectural choices in baseline methods are poorly justified, with insufficient citations to support their effectiveness.
- The dataset's division into 3-second frames limits contextual information, complicating word prediction in lip reading.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison to monolingual dataset blending by providing a detailed analysis and supporting citations. Additionally, the motivations for architectural choices in the baseline methods should be clearly articulated, with appropriate references to the code-switching ASR literature. The authors should also clarify the rationale behind the 3-second frame division and its implications for context utilization. Furthermore, a more comprehensive discussion on societal impacts, including privacy concerns and language biases, would enhance the paper's depth. Lastly, including human performance metrics and a detailed error analysis would provide valuable insights into the dataset's challenges and limitations.
