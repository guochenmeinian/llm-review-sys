Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel prior named Diversified Block Sparse Prior, aimed at enhancing sparse Bayesian learning methods for block sparse settings. The authors utilize an EM algorithm and dual ascent for parameter estimation, establishing convergence to true parameters in noiseless conditions. The method is motivated by compressed sensing theory and demonstrates robustness against prior specification of block information through modeling intra-block covariance and inter-block correlation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-structured, making it accessible for readers.  
- The method is intuitive, with a clear description of the EM algorithm and dual ascent, supported by theoretical justification.  
- The authors provide impressive computational results, showcasing the method's effectiveness across various applications.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper fails to reference established Bayesian sparse regression methods, such as the horseshoe prior, spike-slab LASSO, and hierarchical normal-gamma hyperpriors, which are critical for contextualizing the contribution.  
- The theoretical results on local minima do not significantly enhance understanding of the algorithm.  
- The current theoretical guarantees are limited to noiseless settings, lacking exploration of implications in noisy environments.  
- The illustrations and theoretical findings are poorly motivated and difficult to understand, detracting from the overall presentation quality.  
- The method may be sensitive to initialization due to the use of EM for fitting, which is not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by incorporating discussions of existing Bayesian sparse regression methods, emphasizing the strengths of the Bayesian approach in quantifying uncertainties. Additionally, we suggest enhancing Section 4.2 with qualitative insights derived from theoretical results. The authors should also explore the implications of their method in noisy settings and clarify the robustness of their approach when block structures are misspecified. Improving the clarity of illustrations and theoretical explanations is essential, as is addressing potential sensitivity to initialization directly within the paper. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide more experimental results that analyze the impact of sample complexity and the ratio of observations to sparsity.
