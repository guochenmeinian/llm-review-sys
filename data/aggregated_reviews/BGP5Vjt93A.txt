Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SidechainDiff, a diffusion model focused on the torsion angles of protein sidechains to predict the mutational effects on protein-protein binding. The authors also introduce DiffAffinity, which leverages learned representations from this model to enhance predictions of binding affinity changes (∆∆G). The work is significant in structural biology, particularly for evaluating the impact of antibody variants on antigen binding. The authors demonstrate that DiffAffinity consistently outperforms existing approaches, such as RDE and FlexDDG, across various evaluation metrics, including case studies related to SARS-CoV-2. The paper provides a detailed analysis of the model's performance on independent testing sets, highlighting significant improvements in correlation coefficients and computational efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces innovative methods (SidechainDiff and DiffAffinity) that address the important problem of predicting amino acid mutation impacts on binding.
- DiffAffinity consistently outperforms RDE and FlexDDG in multiple metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness.
- The authors have addressed previous concerns by retraining their model with different data splits and including additional comparisons.
- The computational efficiency of DiffAffinity is notably superior to DDGPred.
- The submission is technically sound, providing a clear explanation of the methodology and showcasing its performance.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental validation is limited to one antibody-antigen system (SARS-CoV-2 RBD), raising concerns about the model's generalizability.
- The evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 mutations relies on limited data, which may diminish the robustness of the experimental setting.
- The manuscript lacks sufficient comparison to existing literature on Riemannian diffusion models, which could clarify the novelty and implications of the proposed methods.
- The presentation of the method and network architecture details is inadequate, making it difficult for readers to fully understand the approach.
- Important baseline comparisons and hyperparameter tuning details are missing, which weakens the evaluation's robustness.
- The reliance on previously validated variants for antibody screening may diminish the perceived contribution of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the manuscript by addressing the following points:
1. Clarify the relationship between the proposed diffusion process and existing methods, particularly regarding the perturbation kernel and its sampling.
2. Provide additional details about how samples \(X_t\) and scores \(s_t\) are obtained in equation (7).
3. Enhance the presentation of the network architecture in the main text and appendix, including how the score of the chi angles is predicted.
4. Include comprehensive baseline comparisons, particularly with traditional methods like FlexDDG, and clarify the hyperparameter tuning process.
5. Expand the evaluation to include multiple antibody-antigen systems to assess the model's generalizability.
6. Conduct wet-lab experiments to support the findings on SARS-CoV-2 mutations, enhancing the credibility of the results and demonstrating practical applicability.
7. Provide a more comprehensive discussion on the limitations of the current dataset and the implications for generalization.
8. Justify claims made in the paper, particularly regarding performance comparisons, and ensure that metrics used for evaluation are appropriate and clearly defined.
9. Address orthographic errors and improve the overall clarity and organization of the manuscript to enhance readability.
