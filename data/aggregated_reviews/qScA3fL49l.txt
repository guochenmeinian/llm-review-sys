Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents LIGHTSEQ, a novel approach for distributed training of long-context large language models (LLMs) by parallelizing along the sequence dimension rather than partitioning attention heads, as seen in Megatron-LM. Key contributions include a memory-efficient exact attention algorithm called DISTATTN, an innovative activation checkpointing strategy, and empirical evaluations demonstrating significant training efficiency and memory advantages. The authors motivate their approach with theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, achieving up to 2.01x speedup compared to Megatron-LM.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach is model agnostic, allowing for training on longer contexts and achieving up to 2x speedup on long sequences.
- The innovative load balance scheduling is highly optimized for causal language modeling.
- Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency of LIGHTSEQ across various model sizes and settings.
- The proposed methods are compatible with memory-efficient attention techniques like FlashAttention.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental analysis lacks scalability insights, particularly regarding performance on multiple nodes.
- There is insufficient comparison of model quality, raising concerns about potential regressions in training quality.
- The paper's target application scope is unclear, particularly regarding its applicability beyond long-context cases.
- Several minor textual errors and misprints detract from the overall clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental scope, explicitly addressing the applicability of LIGHTSEQ beyond long-context cases and on multiple GPU nodes. Additionally, we suggest including a model quality comparison to assess potential regressions in training effectiveness. Enhancing the visualization of DISTATTNâ€™s load-balance scheduling in Figure 1 would also aid in understanding. Finally, addressing the minor textual errors and expanding the experimental evaluation to include other models like OPT or GPT-XL would strengthen the paper.
