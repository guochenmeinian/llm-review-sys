### Key Points
This paper presents a method to mitigate named entity-related hallucinations in abstractive summarization through an adaptive margin ranking loss function and two alignment methods: entity-sentence alignment and entity-reference alignment. The authors conduct experiments on the CNNDM and XSum datasets, demonstrating improvements over baseline models in automatic evaluation scores.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work addresses a significant issue in improving factuality in summarization.
- The proposed adaptive margin ranking loss function and alignment methods are novel contributions.
- The experiments are well-documented, providing clarity on methodology.

Weaknesses:
- The improvements over baseline models are not substantial and are based on a limited sample size of 100, raising questions about the significance of the results.
- The choice of BART-base as the sole baseline model is insufficient, given its age and the availability of more advanced architectures.
- The evaluation process lacks rigor, particularly in the classification of entity hallucinations and the generalizability of the findings to other domains.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by conducting analyses on the full test sets to verify the robustness of their results. Additionally, we suggest incorporating more diverse baseline models, such as T5-small or FactPEGASUS, to strengthen comparisons. Clarifying the methodology for constructing entity clusters and their references would enhance understanding. Furthermore, we advise that the authors provide a more detailed classification of intrinsic entity hallucinations to better assess the effectiveness of their proposed methods.
