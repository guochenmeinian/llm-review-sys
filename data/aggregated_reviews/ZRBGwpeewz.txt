Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of box-simplex games, focusing on bilinear min-max optimization problems constrained by box and simplex conditions. The authors propose a novel algorithm that computes an $\epsilon$-approximate saddle point in time $O(nnz(A) \cdot L \cdot \log(d)/\epsilon)$, improving upon Sherman's method by eliminating logarithmic overhead. Additionally, the authors extend their work to box-spectraplex games, providing a first-order algorithm for these generalized games. The paper also connects area convexity with relative Lipschitzness, facilitating a clearer understanding of the relationship between these concepts and classical extragradient methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and accessible to non-experts, bridging the gap between area convexity and standard convexity tools.
- The proposed algorithm improves runtime complexity for box-simplex games, contributing to the state-of-the-art in first-order algorithms.
- The authors provide a rigorous analysis of their algorithms, with sound proof sketches and a clear connection to existing literature.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation could be clearer, as the main text and supplementary material differ significantly, making it challenging to follow.
- There is a lack of concrete algorithmic implementation and benchmarking in the main submission.
- The paper does not adequately discuss limitations or potential negative societal impacts, nor does it provide a detailed comparison with previous results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by ensuring consistency between the main text and supplementary material. Providing pseudocode for the proposed extragradient algorithm would enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest including a detailed comparison with previous results to contextualize the improvements claimed. Addressing the limitations of the work and discussing potential societal impacts would also strengthen the paper. Finally, incorporating experimental evaluations on real-world or synthetic datasets would provide empirical evidence of the proposed approach's effectiveness.
