### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive survey of research on retrieving multimodal information to augment generative language models, focusing on various modalities such as images, code, structured knowledge, audio, and video. The authors propose that retrieval-augmented generation with multi-modality is an important emerging method, particularly relevant with the rise of large language models. They analyze over 140 recent papers, establish connections between different works, and discuss future research directions, including multimodal reasoning and knowledge indexing.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a timely, structured, and comprehensive overview of retrieval-augmented generation with multi-modality.
- It offers a thorough analysis that will be beneficial for both the NLP and multimodal communities.
- The organization and writing quality enhance reader understanding.

Weaknesses:
- The paper could provide more analysis on the purpose and benefits of different modalities, such as the role of knowledge graphs in reducing hallucinations.
- The definition of multimodality may need clarification, particularly regarding the inclusion of structured knowledge as multimodal information.
- Some sections deviate from the main focus, potentially causing confusion, and the distinction of when enhanced information is retrieved requires careful consideration.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the purpose and benefits of different modalities, specifically addressing how various modalities contribute to generation quality. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the definition of multimodality and explicitly discussing the academic debate surrounding its classification. To enhance coherence, we advise revising sections that deviate from the main theme and carefully considering the stages of information retrieval in relation to enhancement. Finally, we encourage the authors to include missing references relevant to the broader discussion of retrieval-augmented generation.
