Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an energy-based generative framework for modeling elementary particle behavior, facilitating the generation of High Energy Physics events akin to those at the LHC and enabling anomaly detection, particularly for QCD jets. The authors introduce techniques for effective learning of energy functions and propose an architecture that captures permutation invariant interactions among particles. They also present metrics for evaluating the generation quality of EBMs, demonstrating their utility in detecting anomalies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a timely and interesting problem, showcasing the application of EBMs in particle dynamics.  
- It is well-written, with experiments that convincingly demonstrate the model's efficacy in generating data and detecting anomalies.  
- The introduction effectively motivates the research, and the methodology includes innovative modifications over prior work.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks clarity in conveying technical details, making it challenging to understand the energy-based model training procedure and the scientific problem.  
- The novelty of the methodology is limited, primarily focusing on applications of EBMs rather than introducing significant theoretical advancements.  
- There is insufficient discussion on how improvements in methodology translate to enhanced event detection at the LHC.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the technical details, particularly in the explanation of the energy-based model training and the scientific context. Specifically, please clarify the terms used in equation 2 and provide more information on the anomaly detection task, including definitions of signal versus background events. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion on the correlation between the learned energy function and real physical energy, and consider structuring the energy function with ground truth physical energy functions. It would also be beneficial to enhance the readability of Table 2 and provide higher resolution for the equations in Figure 1. Lastly, we encourage the authors to highlight the foundational papers that inform their approach to aid reader comprehension.
