### Key Points
This paper presents the potential of integrating AI into neuroscience research, challenging traditional hypothesis generation methods. The authors argue that due to the brain's complexity and the availability of large-scale data, AI could transform the generation of both implicit and explicit hypotheses in neuroscience.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a relevant issue in neuroscience, highlighting the limitations of traditional methods and proposing the innovative integration of AI.
2. The authors effectively discuss various AI techniques, including uninterpretable models and symbolic regression, providing a comprehensive view of their applications in neuroscience.
3. The paper is accessible to researchers from non-neuroscience backgrounds, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration that could lead to significant innovations.
4. By exploring underutilized avenues, the authors aim to facilitate collaboration between AI and neuroscience communities, potentially advancing both fields.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a clear implementation roadmap or guidelines for effectively integrating AI tools into neuroscience research.
2. There is a need for feedback or perspectives from experienced neuroscientists to enhance credibility and provide a multidimensional viewpoint.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by providing a potential roadmap or guidelines for integrating AI tools into neuroscience research. Additionally, including feedback from seasoned neuroscientists would enhance the credibility of the proposed integration and offer a more comprehensive perspective. More practical insights, examples, and discussions on challenges would also add depth to the paper.
