### Key Points
This paper presents an evaluation setup for large language models (LLMs) that assesses their ability to track situational changes in dialogue. The authors propose a synthetic box-moving environment to test ChatGPT's situational understanding, revealing that the model struggles to maintain coherent states over time due to non-persistent in-context memory and hallucinated updates. The paper contributes to understanding the limitations of ChatGPT and emphasizes the need for improved situational tracking abilities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The evaluation setup is carefully designed, effectively measuring basic capabilities while providing insights into fundamental dialog capabilities.
- The paper is well-written and organized, with detailed discussions that offer value for future research.
- The fine-grained error analysis enhances understanding of model performance dynamics and state transitions.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity on whether the code will be made public for replication and further evaluation.
- Implementation details of the synthetic environment are insufficient, raising reproducibility concerns.
- The focus on ChatGPT limits the generalizability of findings to other models, and the differences between evaluation metrics, Step-EM and State-EM, are not clearly articulated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the public availability of the code to facilitate replication. Additionally, please provide more detailed implementation instructions for the synthetic environment to enhance reproducibility. It would be beneficial to include a broader evaluation of other chat models to strengthen the generalizability of the findings. Lastly, we suggest clarifying the distinctions between the evaluation metrics, Step-EM and State-EM, to avoid potential misunderstandings.
