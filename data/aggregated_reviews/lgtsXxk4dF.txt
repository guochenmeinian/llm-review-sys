Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on clustering $n$ items into $k$ clusters using an oracle that indicates the number of ground-truth clusters in any subset $S$ of items. The authors propose non-adaptive algorithms aimed at minimizing sample complexity. Key contributions include:
1. Randomized non-adaptive algorithms for constant $k$ that require:
   - $O(n k \log \log n \log k)$ queries for arbitrary subset sizes.
   - $O(n k \log n \log \log n)$ queries when $|S| = O(\sqrt{n})$.
2. Randomized non-adaptive algorithms for general $k$ that require:
   - $O(n \log n \log k (n/s + \log s))$ queries for subsets of size at most $s$.
3. An $\Omega(\min(n^2 / s^2, n))$ lower bound for any non-adaptive algorithm querying subsets of size at most $s$.

The algorithms operate in polynomial time and also address cases with roughly balanced clusters and scenarios allowing adaptive rounds, improving logarithmic dependencies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is comprehensive, presenting optimal query complexity results across various settings.
- The algorithms are well-motivated, with clear high-level intuitions enhancing understanding.
- The results represent a significant step towards addressing the research gap in non-adaptive clustering with subset queries.

Weaknesses:
- A primary concern is the feedback model; the oracle only returns the number of clusters in $S$, raising questions about practical applicability and potential efficiency gains if clusters were returned directly.
- The paper defers many details to the appendix, lacking high-level summaries in the main text, which could enhance clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the feedback model by addressing why the oracle does not return the actual clusters in $S$, as this could impact query efficiency. Additionally, we suggest including more details in the main paper regarding:
1. The algorithmic changes that lead to improved query complexity for the roughly balanced case.
2. A clearer explanation of the "extra round of adaptivity."
3. A dedicated paragraph outlining the research gaps left open by their work to aid reader comprehension.
