Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DiverseMixup, a Mixup data augmentation technique aimed at enhancing the out-of-distribution (OOD) detection capabilities of classifiers trained using the Outlier Exposure method. The authors provide a theoretical analysis supporting their approach and demonstrate its superior empirical performance compared to existing methods. The study emphasizes the importance of diversity in auxiliary OOD datasets for effective OOD regularization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is novel, competitive, and straightforward to implement compared to other OOD data augmentation techniques.
- The paper is well-written and easy to understand, with extensive experiments across multiple OOD detection benchmarks.
- The empirical results outperform state-of-the-art methods, and the authors provide a robust theoretical foundation for their approach.

Weaknesses:
- There are critical flaws in the theoretical analysis, particularly regarding the definitions and assumptions related to $h^*_{ood}$ and $h^*_{aux}$, which lead to confusion.
- The choice of how ImageNet-1k is split into ImageNet-200 as ID while using the remaining data as OOD appears arbitrary.
- The paper does not sufficiently clarify the differences from existing literature that theoretically analyzes auxiliary outliers and proposes complementary algorithms based on Mixup.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of definitions, particularly for $h^*_{ood}$ and $h^*_{aux}$, to avoid confusion in the theoretical demonstrations. Additionally, we suggest addressing the arbitrary choice of data splitting in the empirical evaluations and clarifying how their work differs from existing literature on auxiliary outliers. Finally, ensure that the assumptions for the Universal Approximation Theorem are clearly stated in the main paper, not just in the proof, to enhance the theoretical rigor of the manuscript.
