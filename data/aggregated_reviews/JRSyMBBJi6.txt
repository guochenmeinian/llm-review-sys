Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents UltraQuery, a foundation model designed for zero-shot logical query answering over incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs). It addresses the challenge of unseen entities and relations by generalizing the foundation model of knowledge graph completion, Ultra. Experiments demonstrate that UltraQuery, trained on FB15k-237, achieves competitive performance across 22 out-of-distribution KG datasets and can effectively answer logical queries without additional training.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of UltraQuery represents a significant advancement in the ability to answer logical queries over unseen KGs, showcasing impressive performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
2. The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with solid discussions and experiments that support the foundation model's effectiveness.
3. Extensive experiments validate the model's strong generalization capabilities across various datasets and query types.

Weaknesses:
1. Concerns arise regarding the novelty of the proposed methods, as the zero-shot capability appears to stem from the existing Ultra model, reminiscent of previous extensions like NBF-NET to GNN-QE.
2. The paper lacks a detailed description of the ULTRA method and its adaptation to the foundation model, which obscures the contribution beyond the existing framework.
3. The complexity introduced by inductive reasoning may pose scalability challenges for very large KGs, and the absence of formal theoretical results limits the strength of the empirical findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the novelty and contributions of UltraQuery by providing a detailed description of the ULTRA method and its specific adaptations. Additionally, we suggest including an analysis of the model's performance under varying conditions, such as different graph sizes and query complexities. Furthermore, addressing the scalability of UltraQuery, particularly in relation to large KGs, would enhance the practical applicability of the model. Lastly, consider exploring the use of features from entities and relations, such as attributes and types, to potentially improve performance through fine-tuning.
