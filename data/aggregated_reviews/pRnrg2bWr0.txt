Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a dataset comprising images of 64 different objects captured under various controlled lighting conditions using a light stage setup with 72 cameras. The dataset aims to facilitate the evaluation of inverse rendering methods for relighting and novel view synthesis, addressing the scarcity of real data for such evaluations. Baseline experimental results for several tasks are included, demonstrating the dataset's utility.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
- The dataset features a large number of accurately calibrated images with controlled lighting, which is crucial for validating methods trained on synthetic or real data.
- The light stage setup allows for efficient data acquisition, resulting in a dataset with diverse objects and materials.
- The complexity of the light patterns used surpasses that of other datasets, enhancing its applicability.

**Weaknesses:**
- The dataset is limited in the number of objects, which, while larger than previous datasets, could benefit from a broader selection.
- The experiments lack comparisons with synthetic data to illustrate the advantages of real data.
- There is insufficient discussion of the dataset's limitations, particularly regarding the ideal lab environment versus real-world scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset by expanding the number of objects included and providing justifications for their selection. Additionally, conducting experiments with synthetic data could demonstrate the importance of real data. It is essential to include a dedicated section discussing the dataset's limitations, particularly the implications of capturing in a controlled environment. We also suggest clarifying the experimental settings, such as the number of lights and camera specifications, and ensuring that all relevant references to prior work are included. Finally, addressing the clarity of technical details, such as the calibration process for color consistency across different cameras, would enhance the paper's overall quality.
