Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for achieving interventional fairness using partially known causal graphs, specifically through a min-max optimization framework. The authors propose a technique for estimating propensities and checking possible parental sets, ultimately computing the interventional distribution via back-door adjustment. The method is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving fairness and accuracy without requiring exact causal graphs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper extends existing methods to maximally oriented PDAGs (MPDAGs) and introduces a novel approach for learning fair models based on the worst-case violation of interventional fairness.
- The theoretical foundation is robust, building on established results while providing rigorous analysis.
- Clarity is enhanced through well-structured lemmas and practical applications using both synthetic and real-world data.

Weaknesses:
- The applicability of the proposed method is limited, as it relies on the existence of parent nodes for sensitive attributes, which are often absent in many datasets.
- The approach heavily depends on the accuracy of the CPDAG and generated propensity scores, raising concerns about its robustness in the presence of inaccuracies.
- Certain sections lack clarity, such as the rationale for transforming undirected edges and the definition of 'direct causal information set.'

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the applicability of their method by exploring its use in more general causal inference scenarios where treatment nodes may have parent nodes. Additionally, addressing inaccuracies in CPDAGs and providing clearer explanations for ambiguous statements would enhance the manuscript's clarity. It would also be beneficial to include baselines from prior works that address fairness in causal effect estimation. Lastly, we suggest that the authors elaborate on the implications of their method in classification problems, as well as clarify the computational complexity of their approach.
