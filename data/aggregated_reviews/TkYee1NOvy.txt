### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the agenda-setting function of social media, specifically focusing on how issues and frames in news articles shared on Reddit evolve from production to consumption over a 16-year period. The authors analyze 3.8 million news articles, employing standard machine learning techniques to derive social and partisanship scores for 35 detected issues and 14 frames. The study reveals that social media exhibits higher polarization in issues compared to traditional media, with a notable shift in partisanship from production to consumption. Additionally, while frames are shared in a co-partisan manner, their polarization decreases from production to consumption.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research question is significant and relevant to the community.
- The methodology is sound, and the results are insightful and well-presented.
- The comprehensive dataset allows for the examination of longitudinal trends in news consumption and production.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks novel methodologies for data handling and measuring the agenda-setting function, relying on well-known techniques.
- Arbitrary choices in the analysis affect results, and a robustness analysis is necessary to demonstrate the dependency of findings on these choices.
- The presentation of results lacks a clear take-home message, appearing more as a collection of observations rather than a cohesive narrative.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of key concepts such as agenda-setting, issues, and frames by providing in-depth definitions in the Introduction. Additionally, including general statistics about the analyzed data, such as changes in news volume over time and the distribution of article scores, would enhance the understanding of representativeness. We suggest that the authors consider using z-scores for both social and traditional partisanship for consistency. A more focused presentation of results, highlighting the most significant conclusions, would strengthen the paper. In the Related Works section, a comparative discussion on agenda-setting and framing would be beneficial. We also strongly suggest a comparison between issues and frames, potentially utilizing a heatmap to illustrate correlations. Lastly, reconsidering the necessity of the vote filter in the production analysis and improving the clarity of figures, particularly the y-axis in Figures 3 and 5, would enhance the overall presentation.
