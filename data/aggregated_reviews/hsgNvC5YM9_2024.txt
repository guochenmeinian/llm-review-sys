Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension to rectified flow through the introduction of Constant Acceleration Flow (CAF), which utilizes optimal transport to match samples from two distributions. The authors propose Initial Velocity Conditioning to initialize the acceleration field for solving the ODE governing the flow. The method addresses the issue of crossing flow trajectories and demonstrates improved performance on synthetic distributions and CIFAR-10, showing enhanced flow quality and trajectory straightness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The introduction of Constant Acceleration Flow is a novel contribution to the field.  
- The paper effectively summarizes the approach with pseudo-code for two algorithms.  
- Experimental results visually support the motivation and demonstrate improved performance on CIFAR-10.  
- The ODE framework and forward Euler solver facilitate comprehension of the methodology.  
- A comparison with alternative methods is provided in Table 1.

Weaknesses:  
- The improvement in quality comes at the cost of increased computational complexity, with no justification for its significance or potential for broader application.  
- The initialization process and its impact on results are inadequately explored, particularly regarding the reliance on a pre-trained generative model for initial samples.  
- There is no theoretical basis provided for why constant acceleration is superior to constant velocity in flow generation.  
- The claim of reflow as a novel contribution is questionable, as it has been previously proposed in rectified flow.  
- The paper lacks a detailed discussion of the CIFAR-10 experimental setup and its relevance to real-world applications.  
- Minor typographical errors are present, and the limitations section should be moved to the main text.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the computational cost associated with CAF and discuss its potential for wider adaptation in real-world tasks. Additionally, the authors should explore alternative methods for initializing the velocity field that do not rely on a pre-trained generative model. A theoretical justification for the superiority of constant acceleration over constant velocity should be included. The authors should also clarify the relationship between their work and existing methods, particularly regarding reflow and coupling preservation. Expanding the empirical evaluation to include additional datasets would strengthen the findings. Lastly, addressing minor typographical errors and relocating the limitations section to the main paper would enhance clarity and presentation.
