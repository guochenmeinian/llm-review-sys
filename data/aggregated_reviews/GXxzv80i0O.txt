### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of illicit goods promotion on Twitter, utilizing a large dataset of over 12 million posts collected over six months. The authors developed two novel tools, the PIP Hunter and PIP Analyzer, to identify and classify Posts of Illicit Promotion (PIPs) across various categories and languages. The findings reveal that illicit promotion tactics are widespread, employing strategies such as benign hashtags and jargon to evade detection. The implications underscore the need for enhanced content moderation on social media platforms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research addresses a timely and critical issue regarding illicit goods promotion on social media.
- The dataset is substantial, providing a broad overview of the scale of illicit promotion.
- The methodology, including the multimodal classifier, is well-designed and offers valuable insights into evasion tactics.

Weaknesses:
- The definitions of illicit service categories in Table 2 are vague and could benefit from clearer definitions and sub-categories.
- The implications section lacks actionable insights, and there is no discussion of limitations or future work.
- The paper does not include evaluation metrics for the PIP Hunter, making it difficult to assess its effectiveness in distinguishing between benign and PIP content.
- The findings are somewhat unsurprising and lack novelty, with a focus on descriptive statistics rather than deeper insights.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definitions in Table 2 and consider including sub-categories for illicit services. Additionally, the implications section should be expanded to provide actionable insights for addressing the issue of illicit promotion. We suggest including a dedicated section on evaluation metrics for the PIP Hunter, detailing its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Furthermore, a comparison with existing systems would enhance the paper's contributions and contextualize the novelty of the proposed tools. Lastly, we encourage the authors to analyze more recent datasets to ensure the relevance of their findings.
