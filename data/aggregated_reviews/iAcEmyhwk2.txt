Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a generalized marginal sensitivity model (GMSM) for causal sensitivity analysis under unobserved confounding, extending existing models such as the Marginal Sensitivity Model (MSM), Continuous-treatment CMSM, and Longitudinal LMSM. The authors derive sharp bounds for various causal effects, including conditional average treatment effects (CATE) and mediation analysis, and provide an algorithm for estimating these bounds. The framework accommodates discrete, continuous, and time-varying interventions, and the authors claim a novel interpretation of the marginal sensitivity model via structural causal models (SCMs).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The method is solid and well-explained, with theoretical and experimental evidence supporting its claims.  
- The paper is well-organized and presents complex material clearly.  
- The inclusion of mediation analysis is a significant contribution to causal sensitivity models.  

Weaknesses:  
- The generalization of the MSM, CMSM, and LMSM may not be practically useful, as the weighting function appears contrived and does not adequately consider nominal propensity.  
- The paper lacks a discussion of alternative models, such as the $\delta$MSM, and does not sufficiently compare results with previous methods, particularly in Table 1.  
- The experimental section relies heavily on synthetic benchmarks without incorporating well-known semi-synthetic datasets like IHDP, which could demonstrate the method's effectiveness in real-world scenarios.  
- There are ambiguities in the notation and definitions related to hidden confounders and the assumptions underlying the theoretical results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the weighting function, clarifying its natural interpretation and relevance to sensitivity models. Additionally, the authors should consider including comparisons with existing algorithms for bounding non-identifiable queries, such as those by Zhang and Bareinboim, and Duarte et al. We suggest incorporating semi-synthetic benchmarks like IHDP to validate the proposed method against established results. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to address ambiguities in the definitions and assumptions related to hidden confounders and to streamline the presentation of the introduction for clarity.
