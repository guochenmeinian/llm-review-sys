Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents differentially private scalable kernel ERM and KME algorithms, extending prior work in the field. The authors propose a DP K-means Nyström approximation for obtaining an orthonormal basis and corresponding random feature map, which are then utilized in kernel ERM and kernel mean embedding algorithms. The paper includes both theoretical and empirical evaluations, demonstrating the performance and superiority of the proposed methods over existing approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Thorough discussion on background and comparison with prior works.
- Detailed theoretical proofs for the proposed approach.
- Experimental evaluation of the proposed methods, showcasing their novelty and practicality.
- Important observations regarding the relationship between kernel matrix approximation error and the k-means problem.
- Addressing practical issues such as scalability and the ability to use general kernels.

Weaknesses:
- The quality of the Nyström approximation is dependent on the DP-K-means method, which is based on an existing library.
- The empirical evaluations are somewhat limited in scope, particularly regarding the datasets used.
- The equal privacy budget allocation between the Nyström approximation and linear ERM appears arbitrary, and a more advanced approach may be needed.
- The utility of the Nyström kernel embedding for single tasks may be lower compared to algorithms dedicated to specific tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical evaluations by including a broader range of datasets to better demonstrate scalability. Additionally, we suggest providing a detailed comparison of the complexities of the proposed algorithms versus existing methods, particularly regarding time/sample complexity as it scales with dataset size and dimensionality. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore a more sophisticated approach for privacy budget allocation, as indicated by Theorem 1 and 4, to enhance performance. Lastly, clarifying the choice of distribution Q for landmark points and its impact on results would strengthen the paper.
