### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework, SoGo, aimed at enhancing spoken language understanding (SLU) through code-switched sentences in a zero-shot cross-lingual setting. The authors propose saliency-based word substitution and token-level alignment strategies to improve semantic coherence and grammatical accuracy. Their method demonstrates superior performance on the MultiATIS++ benchmark across nine languages, validated through robust experimentation and ablation studies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach is novel and well-articulated, utilizing task-level saliency for word substitution and hidden-state-based alignment effectively.
- The results indicate significant performance improvements over baseline models, and the methods are easy to understand and reproduce.
- The paper includes solid experimentation and analysis, validating results across multiple SLU tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The method lacks clarity in certain aspects, and the token-level alignment is similar to existing work without adequate acknowledgment.
- There is a need for more qualitative analysis to illustrate the advantages of the proposed techniques over previous baselines.
- The applicability of the method to low-resourced languages is questionable due to its reliance on dictionary quality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method section, particularly regarding the token-level alignment, and acknowledge its similarities to prior work. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the code-switched sentence generation technique on other tasks to enhance generalizability. Incorporating qualitative examples would strengthen the paper by providing concrete evidence of improvements. Lastly, consider addressing the implications of dictionary quality on the method's applicability to low-resourced languages, potentially exploring unsupervised dictionary generation techniques.
