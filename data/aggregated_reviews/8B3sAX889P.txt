Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the MPI framework aimed at improving phenotype imputation by leveraging multi-modal biological data through a view decoupling strategy. The authors propose a novel approach that quantizes biological data to identify latent factors, creating correlation graphs for both biological and phenotype data. They employ a cross-view contrastive knowledge distillation technique to enhance imputation accuracy. Extensive experiments validate the model's superiority over existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a critical healthcare issue by integrating omics data with clinical data, demonstrating novelty and practical relevance.
2. The model is user-friendly and extendable to various data modalities, with a well-structured framework that aids understanding.
3. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies showcase the model's effectiveness in leveraging omics data for improved imputation performance.

Weaknesses:
1. The model's complexity necessitates a discussion on time complexity and computational efficiency for each component.
2. The rationale for selecting patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias needs clarification, along with the model's applicability to other cohorts.
3. The choice of recent models like M3Care, Graph, and MUSE for comparison is not justified.
4. The inclusion of multiple loss functions in the model requires clearer representation in the figures and pseudocode for better understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the model design by providing a detailed justification for the choice of residual quantization and conducting additional experiments to compare its effectiveness with other denoising methods. Additionally, a discussion on the applicability of the model to other modalities and the rationale for focusing on proteomics and metabolomics would enhance the paper. We suggest including general graph neural models as comparative methods in the experiments and conducting an ablation study to substantiate claims regarding the ranking loss. Finally, adding variance to the ablation study results and clarifying the structure of the V4 model would improve the overall presentation.
