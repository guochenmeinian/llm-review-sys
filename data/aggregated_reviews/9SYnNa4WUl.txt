### Key Points
This paper presents RulePrompt, a novel approach for weakly supervised text classification that integrates logical rules and prompting pre-trained language models (PLMs). The methodology includes rule-mining and iterative pseudo-label refinement to enhance classification performance. The authors claim that RulePrompt outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several datasets, although comparisons with PESCO are notably absent. The paper emphasizes the need for more comprehensive evaluations across diverse datasets to substantiate its claims.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a method that combines logical rules with PLMs is innovative and enhances weakly supervised text classification.
- Comprehensive experiments demonstrate RulePrompt's effectiveness, consistently outperforming existing methods on popular datasets.
- The methodology is well-articulated, making it accessible despite its complexity.

Weaknesses:
- The absence of comparisons with PESCO and a limited number of datasets hinder a full assessment of the proposed method's advantages.
- The claim of using logical rules is misleading; the approach primarily relies on frequent words and word pairs for text similarity.
- The paper contains grammatical issues and could benefit from clearer writing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison by including PESCO and additional datasets to provide a more robust evaluation of RulePrompt's performance. Additionally, please clarify the use of logical rules in your methodology, as the current description lacks justification for its novelty. We suggest providing representative examples of generated rules to illustrate their effectiveness. Furthermore, addressing the grammatical issues and enhancing the clarity of the writing will significantly improve the paper's readability. Finally, consider discussing the sensitivity of your method to support thresholds and the implications of computational complexity with larger datasets.
