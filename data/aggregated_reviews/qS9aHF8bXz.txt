Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the VP-learning algorithm aimed at addressing offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) using general function approximations. The authors prove finite sample complexity under mild assumptions and avoid minimax optimization through a duality formulation previously identified. The algorithm shows promise in both theoretical guarantees and practical implementation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The VP-learning algorithm provides finite sample guarantees under a mild single policy concentrability assumption, enhancing ease and stability of implementation compared to previous offline RL algorithms.
- The paper is well-organized, clearly written, and offers a thorough theoretical analysis.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical framework does not significantly depend on goal-conditioned RL, leading to potential confusion regarding the paper's motivation.
- A critical flaw in Proposition 3.2 undermines the validity of the derivations, as it incorrectly asserts strong duality, affecting the overall claims.
- The lack of empirical results to support the theoretical claims raises concerns about the practical performance of the modified algorithm.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the motivation for focusing on goal-conditioned RL, providing more insights into its specific challenges. Additionally, addressing the flaw in Proposition 3.2 is crucial to support the paper's claims. We also suggest including empirical results to demonstrate the performance of the VP-learning algorithm compared to GoFAR, as this would strengthen the paper's contributions. Lastly, simplifying the notation by viewing GCRL as a special case of RL could enhance clarity for readers.
