### Key Points
This paper presents a novel speculation decoding method called SpecExec, designed to enhance the performance of large language model (LLM) inference on consumer-level GPUs through an offloading scenario. The authors propose using speculative execution, a technique from CPU architecture, to improve speculation decoding by constructing a large draft tree of potential continuations with a draft model, which are then verified in parallel by the target model. The experiments demonstrate that SpecExec achieves speedups of up to 18.7x, enabling the LLaMA-2 70B model to generate up to 20 tokens per iteration.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a clear and specific problem, focusing on the bottleneck of offloading in LLM inference on consumer GPUs.
- SpecExec is robust for non-deterministic requests and shows extendability by potentially adopting other variants of the single-source shortest path (SSSP) problem.
- Empirical results indicate impressive speedup over existing methods, with a solid analysis of inefficiencies in speculative decoding.

Weaknesses:
- Despite targeting consumer-level GPUs, the highest speedup is observed on the A100 GPU, a datacenter-level model, raising questions about practical applicability.
- Token throughput remains slow due to offloading, and using a 4-bit quantized 70B model without speculative decoding may be more practical for A100 GPU.
- The paper lacks clarity in experimental results, particularly regarding the distinction between base and chat models, and the applicability of SpecExec in scenarios without offloading.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of experimental results, particularly in distinguishing between base and chat models in tables and figures. Additionally, the authors should justify the applications or user cases that necessitate the use of offloading schemes. It would be beneficial to include diagrams illustrating the working process of SpecExec for better understanding. Lastly, the authors should address the performance of SpecExec in speculative inference systems without offloading to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
