Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the efficacy of formal specifications, specifically Signal Temporal Logic (STL), for human validation of autonomous systems. The authors differentiate between *verification* and *validation*, asserting that validation is inherently human-centered and subjective. The main question addressed is whether active learning methods can enhance human performance in validating formal specifications. A comprehensive user study (n=55) is conducted, comparing three groups: no active learning (control), active learning without feedback (AL-NF), and active learning with feedback (AL-WF). The findings indicate no significant improvement in validation accuracy with active learning, although it does increase user engagement and reduce frustration, particularly among participants with lower STEM experience.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper correctly identifies that most human users struggle to validate system behaviors using formal specifications, raising an important question about the potential of active learning methods to improve this capability.
2. The experimental results provide valuable insights, revealing no significant improvement in validation accuracy with active learning, which prompts further research into bridging human learning theories and formal specification methodologies.

Weaknesses:
1. There is a mismatch between the claims in the introduction regarding the suitability of formal specifications for explaining human-centered goals and the focus of the experiments, which measure users' ability to infer the achievability of formally specified goals. This misalignment complicates conclusions about the efficacy of formal specifications in validating higher-level goals.
2. The introduction and related works sections lack discussion on state-of-the-art techniques for enhancing the validation process of formal temporal specifications, such as translation to natural language and hierarchical specifications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the alignment between the introduction's claims and the experimental focus by discussing the mismatch in the introduction or later sections. Additionally, we suggest that the authors include a review of existing techniques that enhance the interpretability of temporal logic specifications, such as those mentioned in the related works, to provide a more comprehensive context for their study. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the rationale for requiring human supervision in the validation process and to address the criticism regarding the interpretability of STL more thoroughly.
