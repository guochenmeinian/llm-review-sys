### Key Points
This paper presents an approach to enhance coherency and reduce hallucinations in text generated by Transformer language models (LMs) by adapting Cache-LM for both decoder-only and encoder-decoder architectures. The authors propose a novel contrastive learning objective and a discriminative training criterion with a max-margin loss to improve performance across various tasks, including semantic analogy, open-ended generation, abstractive summarization, and data-to-text generation. Empirical results indicate that LMs equipped with this caching mechanism achieve better factuality and coherency while maintaining text diversity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The methodology is innovative and well-motivated, with a clear rationale and logical soundness.
- The proposed method robustly improves coherence in text generated by mid-sized Transformer models.
- Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate significant improvements across multiple tasks.
- The paper is coherent, easy to read, and includes supplementary code for reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- The distinction between Cache-LM and pointer networks is insufficiently addressed, with similarities noted that require further clarification.
- The reliance on older models like GPT-2 and BART limits the evaluation; newer models such as LLaMA should be included.
- The benefits of the proposed method may diminish as LMs grow larger, raising questions about its effectiveness in such contexts.
- Some technical definitions and assumptions in the equations, particularly regarding lambda_{i,j}, may be overly simplistic.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the distinction between Cache-LM and pointer networks by providing a more detailed explanation of their differences. Additionally, consider including performance evaluations of more recent LLMs like LLaMA to strengthen the baseline comparisons. Clarifying the assumptions made in the equations, particularly around token probabilities and the definition of terms, would enhance the paper's rigor. Lastly, addressing the diminishing returns of the proposed method with larger models would provide a more comprehensive understanding of its applicability.
