Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework for designing differentially private (DP) algorithms for graph clustering using the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) and metric clustering with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). The authors propose efficient $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differentially private algorithms that significantly improve upon existing quasi-polynomial time algorithms, achieving polynomial time performance. They also establish a lower bound demonstrating the optimality of their privacy guarantees. The algorithms leverage a connection between robustness and privacy, formalizing a method to transform robust estimation algorithms into private ones.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well-written and addresses fundamental clustering problems, providing novel DP algorithms that advance the field. The lower bound illustrates the optimality of the privacy guarantees for the SBM algorithm. The techniques for translating robust estimation algorithms to DP algorithms are intuitive yet nontrivial, suggesting potential extensions to other estimation algorithms.

Weaknesses:  
The paper lacks experimental validation, focusing primarily on theoretical contributions. Additionally, it would benefit from a brief discussion on why the current framework does not achieve $(\log k)^{c+1/2}$ separation in polynomial time. The writing quality needs improvement, with some notation and algorithmic environments not clearly displayed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their writing, ensuring that all notation is correctly displayed and that algorithmic environments are properly referenced. It would be beneficial to clarify the comparison with the work of Kothari-Manurangsi-Velingker by outlining both similarities and differences at the beginning of the paper. Additionally, we suggest adding more discussion of terms appearing in bounds from classic non-private settings to aid reader comprehension. Explicitly incorporating the notion of privacy in theorem statements and providing more intuition about model parameters would enhance the paper's accessibility.
