### Key Points
This paper presents an uncertainty-aware empirical Bayes-based ranking framework named EBRank, targeting the unbiased learning-to-rank problem with a focus on exploitation bias. EBRank employs a non-behavior feature-based prior model for relevance estimation, updating this with observed user behaviors and incorporating an uncertainty-aware exploration strategy. Experiments on three datasets (MQ2007, MSLR-10k, and MSLR-30k) demonstrate that EBRank outperforms state-of-the-art ranking algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses the significant issue of exploitation bias in learning-to-rank systems, proposing a novel empirical Bayesian approach.
2. The evaluation methodology is rigorous, utilizing multiple public datasets and strong baselines.
3. The proposed method shows substantial performance improvements over existing algorithms.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper does not adhere to the submission template, lacking essential elements such as CCS concepts and proper formatting, which affects readability.
2. The structure could be improved for clarity, with some sections presenting dense information that obscures understanding.
3. The evaluation relies heavily on clicks as user behavior data, neglecting other interaction types that could influence ranking decisions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper's presentation by adhering to the submission template, enhancing formatting, and ensuring consistent styling in tables. Additionally, we suggest reorganizing the content for better clarity, particularly in the experiment section, and including a conclusion section. The authors should justify the choice of gamma = 0.995 in the evaluation of Cum-NDCG and apply statistical corrections, such as Bonferroni, to ensure reported results are statistically significant. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to extend their evaluation to other datasets, like the Istella datasets or Yahoo! webscope, and to provide a detailed discussion on the scalability and computational efficiency of EBRank in large-scale applications. Lastly, we recommend elaborating on how EBRank handles new items or items with sparse user interaction data and addressing potential limitations when applied to various user behaviors beyond clicks.
