Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method to enhance Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) by incorporating local Lie-point symmetry through an additional symmetry loss term. This term encourages orthogonality between the PDE and symmetry transformations, aiming to improve solution accuracy. The authors demonstrate the method's effectiveness on the 1D heat and Burgers equations, showing better performance, particularly in low-sampling scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach is theoretically motivated and leverages established mathematical principles, making it a novel contribution to the field.
- The execution is innovative, utilizing Lie algebra theory effectively within the PINN framework.
- The experimental results indicate improved data efficiency and accuracy.

Weaknesses:
- The method requires analytical computation of symmetries, which could be challenging and time-consuming.
- The experimental evaluation is limited to simple PDEs, raising questions about the method's applicability to more complex equations.
- The contribution lacks clarity, as it heavily relies on existing mathematical theories, and the improvements observed are marginal compared to the computational effort involved.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contribution by explicitly stating the novelty of their work and providing supporting evidence. Additionally, conducting a more thorough ablation study to explore the effects of varying loss term weights would be beneficial. We suggest including comparisons with state-of-the-art PINN models and data augmentation techniques to better contextualize the results. Furthermore, addressing the mathematical presentation for clarity and consistency, particularly regarding the definitions and notations used, is essential. Lastly, exploring the automation of symmetry computations using computational algebraic software could enhance the method's practicality.
