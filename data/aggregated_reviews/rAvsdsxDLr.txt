### Key Points
This paper presents a model named BREAK, designed for fake news detection by integrating graph and sequence representations to address broad-range semantic modeling challenges. The model employs a fully connected graph to capture comprehensive semantics and utilizes dual denoising algorithms to mitigate structural and feature noise. BREAK operates under a bi-level optimization framework, with the inner layer focusing on structural denoising and the outer layer diversifying semantic features through KL divergence. Experimental results indicate that BREAK significantly outperforms existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear presentation of the bi-level optimization framework and effective experimental validation.
2. The proposed model introduces innovative concepts such as Inner Semantic Structure Denoising and Outer Semantic Feature Denoising, which address common noise issues in existing methods.
3. The authors provide reference code, enhancing the reproducibility of their work.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the proposed method is questionable, as it combines existing concepts without sufficiently articulating core differences from prior work.
2. The rationale for using KL divergence over other similarity measures is not explained, and the paper lacks theoretical analysis in the Approach section.
3. There is insufficient exploration of failed detection cases, leaving gaps in understanding the model's limitations.
4. The experiments appear unfair due to the use of pre-trained models without adequate justification, and comparisons to additional state-of-the-art detection models are lacking.
5. The paper contains numerous typos and logical issues in writing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the articulation of the novelty of their method, clearly distinguishing it from existing approaches. Additionally, the authors should provide a detailed explanation of the necessity of denoising and the rationale for using KL divergence as a similarity measure. We suggest including a theoretical analysis in the Approach section and exploring the reasons behind performance gains and failures in detection cases. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to justify the use of pre-trained models in their experiments and to include comparisons with more state-of-the-art detection models. Lastly, we advise the authors to thoroughly proofread the paper to address typos and logical inconsistencies.
