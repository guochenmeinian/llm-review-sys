Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on Graph Injection Attacks (GIAs) targeting text-attributed graphs, introducing three attack designs: Vanilla Text-level GIA (VTGIA), Inversion-based Text-level GIA (ITGIA), and Word-frequency-based Text-level GIA (WTGIA). The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of text-level perturbation in GIAs and highlight the defensive role of Large Language Models (LLMs). WTGIA is noted for its significant attack potential while maintaining understandability, making this a timely investigation into the vulnerabilities of text attributes in graphs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper provides a thorough investigation into the role of text manipulation in graph injection attacks, emphasizing the importance of text attributes in graphs.
2. WTGIA achieves commendable attack performance with understandable text perturbation.
3. The authors conduct comprehensive experiments addressing the research questions, and the theorem presented offers a clear theoretical foundation.

Weaknesses:
1. The embedding-text-embedding process lacks clarity, and the impact of different embedding models on performance is not sufficiently discussed.
2. The term "interpretability" is used in a manner that diverges from its common meaning in explainable AI, leading to potential confusion; it would be better to replace it with "understandability."
3. The paper does not adequately explore the robustness of the proposed GIAs against more sophisticated defenses beyond LLM-based methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the embedding-text-embedding process and discuss how different embedding models may affect performance. Additionally, we suggest replacing "interpretability" with "understandability" to avoid confusion. The authors should also provide references for cited works and clarify the observed performance trends in Figure 5. Expanding the discussion on the practical implementation of these attacks in real-world scenarios, including scalability and computational costs, would enhance the paper's relevance. Finally, exploring the integration of multiple defense strategies could provide more robust protection against text-level GIAs.
