Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for optimizing risk under uncertainty by utilizing Dirichlet Processes, enhancing robustness in modeling uncertainty within the data-generating process. The authors propose a robust risk criterion that integrates Bayesian nonparametric theory and smooth ambiguity-averse preferences, demonstrating theoretical guarantees and practical applications through simulated and real datasets. The method is linked to existing economic decision-making literature and empirical risk minimization techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution by incorporating Dirichlet Processes into robust optimization, which is novel and well-suited for the addressed problem. The empirical results indicate the proposed method's superiority over standard L2 regularization methods. The writing quality is generally high, and the background information provided is informative and accessible.

Weaknesses:  
The communication of the implications of placing a prior on the data-generating process, rather than on parameters, is insufficiently clear. The results discussion is overly condensed, lacking adequate exposition for the experiments. There are several minor typographical errors and some major issues regarding the clarity of theoretical statements, particularly in Lemma 3.2 and Theorem 3.3. Additionally, the computational cost of the proposed method may limit its applicability in high-dimensional settings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the implications of their prior construction, particularly regarding the transfer of existing intuitions to this new approach. The results discussion should be expanded to provide more detailed analysis and context for the experiments, rather than condensing six experiments into a single page. We suggest addressing the identified typographical errors and ensuring consistency in the theoretical statements, particularly in Lemma 3.2 and Theorem 3.3. Furthermore, the authors should consider discussing the scalability of their methods for larger datasets and the interpretability of the trained Dirichlet Process object.
