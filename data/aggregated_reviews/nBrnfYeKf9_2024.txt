Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Rad-NeRF, a framework designed to enhance NeRF performance by decoupling the training process in the ray dimension and addressing training interference in complex and occluded scenes. The authors propose an ensemble of sub-NeRFs trained with specific rays containing valid information, utilizing a soft gate module to dynamically assign gating scores. Additionally, the framework incorporates depth-based mutual learning to improve rendering consistency and mitigate depth ambiguity. The architecture employs a hash-table-based representation combined with a mixture-of-experts (MoE) technique. Experiments across five datasets demonstrate that Rad-NeRF outperforms existing Instant-NGP-based methods and various state-of-the-art frameworks, achieving better rendering performance with minimal additional parameters.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The innovative approach of decoupling training in the ray dimension effectively mitigates interference from invisible rays, leading to improved rendering accuracy.
- The introduction of a soft gate module allows for dynamic allocation of rays, enhancing adaptability and generalizability without manual rules.
- Depth-based mutual learning contributes to rendering consistency and reduces depth ambiguity, improving geometric modeling accuracy.
- The empirical evaluation shows broad effectiveness, including quantitative improvements and scalability studies across various scene types.

Weaknesses:
- Concerns regarding the novelty of the approach, as it bears similarities to Switch-NeRF and is viewed as an incremental advancement primarily combining existing techniques without substantial innovation.
- The motivation behind the proposed method lacks clarity, particularly in the context of occlusion and aliasing.
- The marginal performance improvements raise questions about the method's robustness compared to existing techniques like MipNeRF360.
- The methodology may inadvertently encourage convergence among MLPs, potentially leading to overfitting.
- The paper lacks theoretical analysis, which is a significant limitation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation section by discussing both occlusion and aliasing in detail. Additionally, consider revising Figure 1 to include both PDF and CDF curves for better representation. To enhance the methodology, we suggest incorporating 3D position information into the soft gating input to potentially reduce overfitting. Furthermore, a more in-depth analysis of the gating function, including visualizations of gating scores across different viewpoints, would strengthen the validation of the proposed approach. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide additional experimental results demonstrating the integration of Rad-NeRF with ZipNeRF to showcase its performance benefits more clearly and to improve the theoretical analysis of their method, discussing this as a limitation in future work.
