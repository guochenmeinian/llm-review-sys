Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents AlpacaFarm, a simulation framework designed for developing large language models (LLMs) with human feedback. The framework utilizes LLMs like GPT-4 to generate synthetic feedback, which is significantly cheaper than human annotation, and evaluates model performance through win-rate comparisons against baselines. The authors validate AlpacaFarm by demonstrating that the performance rankings derived from synthetic feedback closely align with those obtained from human evaluations. The framework also benchmarks reference methods, emphasizing the importance of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and the advantages of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Clarity: The paper is well-written and effectively communicates its key ideas.
- Significance: AlpacaFarm has the potential to serve as a valuable resource for developing and evaluating LLMs with limited budgets.
- Originality: While the novelty is somewhat constrained due to prior work in synthetic feedback generation, the integration of these concepts is still meaningful.

Weaknesses:
- Some hyper-parameter choices, such as the ratio in Question 1, lack justification.
- The framework's effectiveness is under-explored when the baseline model closely resembles the annotator LLMs.
- The paper primarily focuses on LLaMA-based models, raising questions about the generalizability of the findings to other models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for hyper-parameter choices, particularly the 25% random label flip rate, by providing empirical evidence or rationale. Additionally, it would be beneficial to explore the framework's performance when the baseline model is similar to the annotator LLMs. Including experiments with various models for both evaluation and feedback simulation could enhance robustness. We also suggest incorporating human evaluations to further validate the findings and discussing the limitations of AlpacaFarm in greater detail, particularly regarding its applicability to existing NLP benchmarks.
