### Key Points
This paper presents a Transformer-based system for generating live updates for soccer matches from tweets, utilizing the T5 model as its backbone. The authors propose a binary classifier to control the number of updates and reduce redundancy by considering preceding updates. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on J-League tweets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The topic of live update generation is interesting and has potential for expansion to other areas.
- The method is straightforward and the data construction approach is beneficial for the community.
- The evaluation method is comprehensive, including significance testing.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments lack sufficient baselines, making it challenging to compare the proposed system's performance.
- The performance of the best method remains low, and the task's difficulty is not clearly explained due to the absence of an upper bound evaluation.
- There is ambiguity regarding the term "preceding update" and the nature of reference updates.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including additional baselines to facilitate performance comparisons. Clarifying the definition of "preceding update" and providing examples of reference updates would enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explain the rationale behind using a single T5 architecture when the weights are not shared, and consider evaluating the performance of applying Dusart et al. 2021 to their dataset.
