### Key Points
This paper presents the StructGP model, designed for clinical time series data that is often irregularly sampled. StructGP effectively addresses challenges associated with non-uniform data using continuous-time Gaussian processes. The incorporation of a Directed Acyclic Graph structure enables the modeling of ordered conditional dependencies, which is crucial for causal inference in clinical applications. The authors provide a well-structured methodology, including relevant formulas and a sound evaluation through simulations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written, clear, and easy to follow, with appropriate technical language.  
- StructGP can handle irregularly sampled data and learn both the direction and strength of dependencies.  
- The proposed method is innovative, particularly in its differentiable definition of acyclicity for structure learning.  
- Simulations demonstrate promising accuracy results.

Weaknesses:  
- Precision is low at 0.71%, indicating a risk of overfitting and misleading conclusions due to false positive dependencies.  
- The model assumes that observed time series capture the full dependency structure, potentially leading to bias from unmeasured confounders.  
- The NOTEARS-based optimization is efficient for small to medium graphs but may incur significant computational costs for larger datasets.  
- The method's performance may be sensitive to data scaling and does not address scalability to very large datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the precision of the model to reduce false positive dependencies and mitigate the risk of overfitting. Additionally, addressing the impact of unmeasured confounders on dependency structures would enhance the robustness of StructGP. To alleviate computational burdens, the authors should explore optimization strategies that scale effectively with larger datasets and clarify how the method can be adapted for very large clinical time series data.
