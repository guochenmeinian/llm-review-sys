Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a technique called iterative data balancing, aimed at adjusting data distributions to align with predefined marginal distributions, which can reduce variance in model predictions. The authors emphasize its application in self-supervised learning (SSL) and demonstrate that iterative rebalancing enhances zero-shot learning performance and decreases variance among empirical marginals with multiple iterations (k>1). The paper establishes non-asymptotic bounds on variance reduction and discusses the implications for various tasks, including image-caption pair matching and self-supervised clustering.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper offers theoretical contributions, including the derivation of non-asymptotic bounds that quantify variance reduction through the data balancing technique.  
- Empirical studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed method across different tasks.  
- The approach has potential applicability in training foundation models.

Weaknesses:  
- The range of experiments is limited, lacking diversity in tasks which could enhance generalization.  
- The reliance on predefined (uniform) target marginal distributions raises questions about robustness to non-uniform marginals.  
- The iterative nature of the technique may impose significant computational demands, and the paper lacks a thorough discussion on how this overhead is affected by large datasets or models.  
- Clarity issues exist regarding the connection between examples and formalism, and the experiments' contributions to the main results are not explicitly articulated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the diversity of experiments to include a broader set of tasks, which would enhance the generalization of findings. Additionally, the authors should address how their method performs with non-uniform target marginals and discuss the implications of inaccuracies in specifying target marginals on empirical results. It would be beneficial to include comparisons with existing variance reduction methods and to clarify the connection between the theoretical framework and practical examples. Finally, we suggest simplifying the extensive theoretical content to improve accessibility and explicitly linking experimental results to the main claims of the paper.
