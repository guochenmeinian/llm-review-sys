Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents VITRON, a universal vision LLM designed for comprehensive understanding, generating, segmenting, and editing both images and videos. The authors propose a hybrid method that integrates discrete textual instructions with continuous signal embeddings, enhancing the model's capabilities across various visual tasks. A cross-task synergy module is introduced to optimize the sharing of fine-grained visual features, and extensive experiments demonstrate the model's effectiveness across 12 visual tasks evaluated on 22 datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for creating a universal generalist model is clear and aligns with current trends in AI.
- The framework effectively integrates state-of-the-art visual specialists, enabling performance across a wide range of vision-language tasks.
- The hybrid instruction-passing mechanism ensures precise information transfer, enhancing the model's functionality.
- The extensive experiments validate the proposed method's performance, showing improvements across multiple tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a comprehensive literature review, particularly regarding existing generalist models like HuggingGPT and Visual ChatGPT.
- Clarity is needed on the advantages of VITRON over these existing models.
- Some symbols and terms require further explanation, such as those in Table 3.
- The necessity of certain components, like the Video Segmentation module's Region results, is not well justified.
- The paper's structure could be improved for better comprehension of the system's components and interactions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by including a comparative analysis with existing models like HuggingGPT and Visual ChatGPT. Additionally, providing intuitive demonstrations of the hybrid message-passing mechanism would clarify the roles of textual instructions versus continuous embeddings. The authors should also include detailed prompt templates for the instruction tuning datasets and clarify the symbols used in the tables. Addressing the necessity of certain components and ensuring consistency in data formats will enhance clarity. Finally, including baseline comparisons with training-free models and presenting results of specialist models in the experimental tables will provide essential benchmarks for evaluation.
