Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on uncertainty quantification in regression models, specifically focusing on individual calibration for predicting model quantiles. The authors propose simple nonparametric calibration methods that are computationally efficient and statistically consistent, aiming to advance theoretical analyses by integrating nonparametric and parametric techniques. They establish upper and lower bounds for calibration error and address the curse of dimensionality. However, the paper lacks sufficient engagement with existing literature, particularly in the area of conditional conformal prediction.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and organized, providing solid theoretical results and extensive empirical evaluations.
- The proposed methods demonstrate effectiveness and novel ideas in the context of regression calibration.

Weaknesses:
- The authors show insufficient familiarity with prior works in conditional conformal prediction, failing to adequately cite relevant literature, which undermines the novelty of their contributions.
- The proposed methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality and rely on strong assumptions, with experiments conducted only on low-dimensional UCI datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve their literature review by incorporating relevant works on conditional conformal prediction, such as those by Romano et al., Feldman et al., and others, to contextualize their contributions. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments on high-dimensional datasets to demonstrate the applicability of their methods in more complex scenarios. The authors should also clarify the requirements for the kernels used in their algorithms and explore the impact of varying the split proportion in their calibration methods. Finally, we advise reorganizing the introduction for clarity and possibly creating a dedicated "Related Work" section to enhance the paper's structure.
