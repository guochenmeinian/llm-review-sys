Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DiffPack, a torsional diffusion model designed to predict the conformation of protein side-chains based on their backbones. The authors propose an autoregressive approach to generate torsional angles, training separate diffusion models for each angle to improve accuracy. DiffPack demonstrates significant enhancements in angle accuracy on benchmark datasets and improves side-chain predictions in the AlphaFold2 model.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and clearly describes the DiffPack model, effectively contextualizing it within existing literature.
- The technical contributions include a torsional diffusion model that respects covalent bond constraints and an autoregressive generation of torsional angles, leading to state-of-the-art performance in side-chain predictions.

Weaknesses:
- The method lacks a metric for assessing the overall conformational plausibility of generated structures, which is crucial for ensuring reliability in downstream applications.
- There is insufficient comparison of model run times between DiffPack and other methods, such as Attenpack and force field-based approaches, which would help evaluate practical applicability.
- The technical contributions are largely incremental, with many ideas already explored in previous works, and some modifications lack clear justification and differentiation from existing methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the model's transition between atomic coordinates and score predictions, possibly by adding more explanatory text or figures. Additionally, the authors should include a metric for overall conformational plausibility and provide a detailed comparison of model run times with other methods. Clarifying the differences between their annealed temperature sampling and existing techniques, as well as addressing the limitations of their approach, would strengthen the paper. Finally, including a table of run times for different deep learning baselines and ensuring accurate representation of results in tables would enhance the paper's rigor.
