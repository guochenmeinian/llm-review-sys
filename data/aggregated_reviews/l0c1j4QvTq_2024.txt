Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DACER, an actor-critic algorithm that integrates the inverse diffusion process as a policy representation for online reinforcement learning. The authors propose a method for estimating the entropy of the diffusion policy using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), which aims to balance exploration and exploitation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that DACER outperforms baseline algorithms like DSAC and PPO in terms of average final return and trajectory diversity entropy, particularly in complex MuJoCo tasks such as Humanoid-v3 and Ant-v3. Notably, DACER achieves competitive performance against established reinforcement learning algorithms, especially in tasks requiring multimodal action distributions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is novel, combining online actor-critic techniques with diffusion models.
- DACER demonstrates superior performance in complex tasks, achieving higher average returns and entropy compared to baseline algorithms.
- The integration of multimodal strategies is a significant contribution to the reinforcement learning community, addressing a current gap in the literature.
- The authors provide comprehensive experimental results and methodological clarity, enhancing the credibility of their claims.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks comparisons with other algorithms employing multimodal policies, which is crucial for contextualizing its contributions.
- The entropy scheduling approach based on approximated GMM is viewed as heuristic rather than well-motivated.
- There is no clear demonstration of the advantages of multimodality in the results, and the computational efficiency of the method is questionable, with training times reported to be slower than those of baseline algorithms.
- The presentation is noted to be somewhat sloppy, with issues such as unclear figure captions and small text in plots.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison of DACER with other algorithms that utilize multimodal policies to better contextualize their results. Additionally, we suggest clarifying and justifying the entropy scheduling method to strengthen its theoretical foundation. Including a clear demonstration of where multimodality provides a tangible benefit would enhance the paper. It would also be beneficial to provide full learning curves across all benchmark tasks in the main body of the paper to enhance confidence in the reported results. Furthermore, we recommend providing a detailed discussion on the computational costs associated with DACER, including comparative wall clock times with baseline algorithms. Lastly, we suggest clarifying the definitions in equations and ensuring that figure captions are descriptive and accurate, as well as addressing the limitations of the method more thoroughly in the main text rather than relegating them to the appendix to enhance the paper's overall clarity and impact.
