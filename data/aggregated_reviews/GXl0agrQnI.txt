### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to compressing graph convolutional networks (GCNs) through Topologically Consistent Magnitude Pruning (TCMP), which maintains structural integrity during high pruning rates. The method demonstrates improved performance in skeleton-based action recognition compared to standard magnitude pruning, particularly under significant pruning conditions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The TCMP method effectively preserves topological consistency, preventing disconnections in pruned networks.
- It enhances generalization capabilities even at high pruning rates, addressing weaknesses of traditional pruning methods.

Weaknesses:
- Validation is limited to a single dataset, necessitating broader evaluation.
- The concepts of accessibility and co-accessibility lack rigorous theoretical analysis and proper references.
- The manuscript contains minor errors, such as a missing equation number and typos.
- Additional efficiency metrics like inference time and memory usage are not included.
- The justification for the chosen dataset is unclear, and comparisons with other topology-aware GNN pruning methods are absent.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the manuscript by addressing the missing equation number on page 4 and correcting typos, particularly the reference to the equation in line 148. The authors should validate their method on additional datasets and tasks to confirm findings and enhance generality. We also suggest providing a theoretical foundation for the concepts of accessibility and co-accessibility, along with relevant references. Including additional efficiency metrics such as inference time and memory usage would better quantify real-world benefits. Finally, justifying the choice of the video recognition dataset or evaluating on general graph datasets like Cora and Reddit would strengthen the paper.
