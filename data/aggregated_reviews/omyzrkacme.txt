### Key Points
This paper presents a two-player game with externalities, where one agent (upstream) affects the other (downstream). It formulates this scenario as a multi-armed bandit problem, examining whether standard bandit learning algorithms can achieve socially optimal outcomes through conditional payments. The authors introduce the concept of hindsight rationality into the Coase Theorem framework, allowing players to adapt strategies over time. The paper demonstrates that, under certain assumptions, sublinear regret can be achieved relative to the socially optimal outcome.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The work effectively applies well-known economic theories, expanding the Coase Theorem by incorporating hindsight rationality, which enhances its theoretical foundation.  
- The proposed algorithm achieves sublinear regret for any no-regret upstream policy, providing a robust guarantee for the downstream agent's learning process.  
- The paper is well-written and presents a clear framework, contributing novel insights into the learnability of externalities in economic interactions.  

Weaknesses:  
- The theoretical framework lacks empirical validation, limiting its practical applicability.  
- The narrow focus on a two-player bandit setting raises questions about the generalizability of the findings to more complex multi-agent scenarios.  
- The mathematical notations can be difficult to follow, which may hinder comprehension of the results.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical validation of their theoretical framework to enhance its real-world relevance. Additionally, a comprehensive discussion on the challenges of implementing the proposed approach in practical settings would provide valuable insights for policymakers. We also suggest clarifying the mathematical notations to ensure they are accessible and easier to follow. Finally, exploring the applicability of their findings in broader multi-agent contexts could strengthen the paper's contribution.
