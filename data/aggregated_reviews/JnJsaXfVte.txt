Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of various architectural choices for training models on data with subjective variance among annotators, specifically focusing on argument quality classification. The authors propose a continuum from 'annotator agnostic' models, which aggregate labels, to 'annotator specific' models that explicitly model each annotator. Key contributions include the introduction of this continuum, its application to argument quality, and the finding that 'hybrid' models yield the best performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and well-documented.
- The approach is sound, supported by reasonable baselines, and the findings regarding model performance are interesting and valuable.
- The study provides sufficient support for its claims and reports state-of-the-art results.

Weaknesses:
- Limited scope and novelty, as the study is conducted on two datasets from the same domain using existing approaches.
- The criteria for determining the best architecture are loosely explained, lacking clarity in terms of concreteness, validity, and innovation.
- The novelty of the proposed approach is not clearly articulated, and comparisons to existing work are insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of how their analysis differs from previous work on learning from disagreement, particularly in relation to existing taxonomies and models. Additionally, we suggest incorporating a discussion of 'soft label' approaches, which have shown effectiveness in similar contexts. Clarifying the criteria for selecting the best architecture and providing more details on handling noise in multi-annotated corpora would also enhance the paper's rigor. Lastly, addressing the practical implications of their models in real-world applications would strengthen the overall contribution.
