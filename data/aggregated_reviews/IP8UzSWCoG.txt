### Key Points
This paper presents two algorithms, CTS-G and CL-SG, for sleeping semi-bandits, accompanied by theoretical guarantees. The authors provide lower and upper regret bounds, addressing a significant gap in the literature where no instance-independent bounds for TS-based approaches existed. The algorithms are supported by strong theoretical derivations and numerical results, although the bounds are not tight.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The algorithms are well presented and fill a notable gap in the existing literature regarding TS bounds.
- Theorem 2, which restricts randomness through a single random seed, is a surprising and non-trivial analysis.
- The simulated experimental setting effectively supports the theoretical claims made.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks recent algorithm benchmarks, such as LBINFV (2023), limiting performance comparisons.
- The number of trials used to generate the regret plots and confidence intervals in Figures 1 and 2 is unclear.
- There is insufficient discussion on the practical applicability and limitations of the proposed algorithms.
- Although the impact of the parameter Gamma is discussed, there is no conclusion on its optimal value.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including more recent algorithms as benchmarks to enhance performance evaluation. Additionally, clarifying the number of trials for the regret plots and confidence intervals would strengthen the analysis. We also suggest providing a more detailed discussion on the practical applicability of the algorithms and their limitations in real-world scenarios. Finally, the authors should conclude on the optimal value of the parameter Gamma, which is crucial for the algorithms. An expanded Section B in the full version of the paper would also be beneficial.
