### Key Points
This paper presents an anaphor-assisted framework for document-level relation extraction (DocRE) that leverages pronouns to capture fine-grained interactions between entities. The authors construct a document graph to jointly utilize co-reference and anaphora information, employing an attention-based graph convolutional neural network for dynamic learning of the graph structure. The introduction of evidence verification as an auxiliary task aids in filtering irrelevant information. The experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on widely-used datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed methods exhibit commendable performance and improve results on DocRED and Re-DocRED datasets.
2. The paper is well-written, with a clear and logical structure, making it relatively easy to understand.
3. The study provides sufficient support for its major claims and introduces innovative concepts, such as anaphor nodes and edges.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper does not adequately highlight the proposed methods and innovations in the introduction.
2. The experiments lack a focused analysis of the proposed graph structure related to anaphora, and the ablation of the anaphora node is not included.
3. The presentation could be improved, particularly in clarifying the impact of the evidence assistance coefficient β on model performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by summarizing the innovations of the paper more clearly. Additionally, it is essential to include an analysis of the proposed graph structure concerning anaphora in the experiments, along with an ablation study of the anaphora node. Clarifying how the anaphor nodes are obtained and the implications of the evidence assistance coefficient β in Figure 5 would enhance the paper's clarity. Finally, providing more details on the method used to obtain the anaphora nodes would strengthen the presentation.
