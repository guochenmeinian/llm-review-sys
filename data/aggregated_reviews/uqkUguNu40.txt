Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel graph data augmentation method called FGWMixup, which integrates the interaction between graph structure and node features. The authors formulate this as an optimal transport problem using the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) distance to find a "midpoint" graph between two source graphs. They introduce a relaxed FGW solver to enhance computational efficiency and validate their approach through experiments on five datasets with various GNN architectures, demonstrating improved performance over existing methods. The authors emphasize the importance of runtime comparisons and acknowledge that FGWMixup requires extensive hyper-parameter tuning and validation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces an innovative graph mixup method that effectively combines graph structures and features.
- The comprehensive evaluation on multiple datasets and GNN backbones showcases the robustness of FGWMixup.
- The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing performance gains while maintaining low variance.
- The authors provide a compelling rebuttal that addresses most reviewer concerns, leading to improved ratings.
- The theoretical analysis provided strengthens the credibility of the proposed method and addresses efficiency concerns.

Weaknesses:
- The computation efficiency of FGWMixup remains unclear, particularly in comparison to other methods; detailed analysis of time complexity is needed.
- The theoretical aspects of the paper require further development to enhance the understanding of new mixup schemes based on optimal transport (OT).
- The experimental results are based on small datasets, limiting the generalizability of findings; inclusion of larger datasets is necessary.
- The paper lacks qualitative analysis regarding the semantic meaning of synthetic graphs, and the impact of hyperparameters on performance is not sufficiently addressed.
- Some reviewers noted the need for clearer indications of related appendix contents in the main text and the limitations of the current implementation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the computational cost analysis for FGWMixup, including comparisons with baseline methods. Additionally, conducting experiments on larger datasets, such as the OGB benchmark, would enhance the applicability of their findings. To provide more insights into the synthetic 'midpoint' graphs, including real samples and qualitative analyses is essential. Furthermore, a thorough discussion on the effects of hyperparameter tuning, particularly the choice of the beta distribution parameter 'k', should be included to guide users in practical applications. We also suggest that the authors improve the clarity of the runtime table by explicitly stating that it corresponds to the total runtime of FGWMixup on CPUs without parallelization. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore adaptive optimization on $\mu$ more thoroughly in future work, as it presents an interesting avenue for enhancing the method's performance.
