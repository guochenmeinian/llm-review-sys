Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel dataset for 3D interacting hands, which aims to provide diverse and realistic image appearances along with large-scale ground-truth 3D poses. The authors propose a two-stage dataset construction process: the capture stage, involving real images with precise 3D annotations, and the relight stage, which generates realistic images. They argue that their dataset addresses significant challenges in the field, such as the lack of diverse and realistic image appearances for 3D hands, and highlight its potential contributions to the 3D human community. Experiments indicate that the dataset can enhance the performance of 3D interacting hand reconstruction compared to existing datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is large-scale and offers a unique combination of synthesized images with accurate 3D annotations, enhancing realism and applicability for various applications, including AR/VR.
- It contributes a comprehensive analysis of previous works, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses, and demonstrates a clear understanding of the limitations of existing datasets.
- The introduction is clear and well-motivated, effectively setting the stage for the research, and the experiments conducted are satisfactory, indicating the dataset's utility for pre-training models.

Weaknesses:
- The realism of the dataset's appearance is questioned, as it is described as only "middle" quality and not sufficiently close to in-the-wild images.
- Some inaccuracies in Table 1 regarding two-hand interactions and misleading references are noted, and concerns regarding the novelty and practicality of the dataset remain unresolved.
- The dataset lacks guidance on effective utilization and does not provide a website for benchmarks and visualizations, with some reviewers calling for more concrete examples of better alternatives.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the realism of the dataset's appearance to better align with in-the-wild images. Additionally, please correct inaccuracies in Table 1 regarding two-hand interactions and clarify the distinctions between datasets. We suggest providing error analysis for 2D/3D joint detection and 3D scans, as well as including guidance on how to effectively utilize the dataset and a website for benchmarks and visualizations. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to improve the clarity of their dataset's novelty by explicitly addressing concerns regarding its practicality and the potential for alternative datasets. Finally, consider elaborating on the implications of their dataset for real-world applications, particularly in the context of pre-training models with synthesized data.
