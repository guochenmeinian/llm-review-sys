### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for one-step retrosynthesis using probabilistic template-free models, demonstrating superior performance over other template-free methods in single-step retrosynthesis and round-trip accuracy. The authors introduce the Markov Bridge into Retrosynthesis Planning, characterizing the distribution of reactants and products. The experiments conducted show significant improvements across multiple benchmarks, although the method's novelty is questioned in relation to MEGAN.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Clear derivation of formulas and understandable figures.
- Novel introduction of the Markov Bridge framework for characterizing reactant and product distributions.
- Extensive experiments demonstrating significant outperformance of template-free models in single-step retrosynthesis prediction.

Weaknesses:
- The paper only addresses template-free prediction for `Reaction type unknown`, neglecting `Reaction type given as prior`, as seen in MEGAN's Table 2.
- The discussion in Appendix A.5 and Table 4 regarding the Forward Bridge's performance is confusing, as the expected correlation with Retro Bridge is not evident.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the representation of the K-dimensional one-hot vectors. Additionally, a more thorough analysis explaining why Retrobridge achieves better round-trip accuracy compared to other methods would enhance the paper. The authors should also provide an assessment of the time-complexity of inferences for their method in comparison to the evaluated methods. Finally, addressing the unexpected performance differences between Forward Bridge and Retro Bridge in the discussion would improve clarity.
