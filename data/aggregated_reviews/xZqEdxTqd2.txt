### Key Points
This paper presents BENO, a neural network-based approach for solving elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) with diverse boundary conditions and shapes. BENO employs graph neural networks (GNNs) to manage boundary and interior source terms, while utilizing transformers for global geometry encoding. The specific architecture demonstrates promising results, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and generalization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method achieves superior accuracy in solving complex elliptic PDEs.
2. It effectively handles various boundary shapes and inhomogeneous boundary conditions, making it applicable to real-world problems.
3. BENO shows robust generalization capabilities, accommodating unseen boundary shapes.
4. The method maintains grid independence between training and testing spaces, enhancing generalizability across different resolutions.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks clarity on how BENO addresses different boundary conditions, such as Neumann or Robin.
2. There is limited exploration of its applicability to PDE types beyond elliptic ones.
3. The complexity of the method could hinder accessibility for practitioners, particularly since the second GNN appears to offer minimal benefits.
4. A comparative analysis with neural operator methods, such as FNO, across different grid resolutions is missing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding how BENO handles various boundary conditions, including Neumann and Robin. Additionally, exploring the applicability of BENO to non-elliptic PDEs would broaden the method's scope. Simplifying the architecture could enhance accessibility for practitioners, especially considering the limited contribution of the second GNN. Finally, we suggest including comparisons with neural operator methods like FNO across different grid resolutions to provide a more comprehensive assessment.
