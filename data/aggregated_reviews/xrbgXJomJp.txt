Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel algorithm, Multi-agent Inverse Factorized Q-learning (MIFQ), which extends the inverse soft-Q learning framework to cooperative multi-agent settings. The authors propose using mixing networks for centralized training with decentralized execution, enabling effective learning of local and joint value functions. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that MIFQ outperforms existing methods across various environments, including SMAC-v2 and MPE.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of MIFQ represents a significant contribution to the field of imitation learning.
- The paper is well-organized and provides a sound theoretical analysis.
- Empirical results across multiple challenging environments show robust performance improvements over baselines.

Weaknesses:
- The assumption of access to global state information is unrealistic for practical applications, limiting the algorithm's utility.
- Some methodological claims lack justification, particularly regarding the shortcomings of independent versions of IQ-learn.
- The experimental analysis is shallow, primarily describing results without deeper insights.
- Clarity issues exist, such as the late introduction of key concepts like IGC and the vague definition of the joint policy equivalence.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the practical applicability of their algorithm by addressing the unrealistic assumption of global state access. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the shortcomings of independent IQ-learn more explicitly and provide a more thorough analysis of experimental results, including the recovery of ground truth rewards and addressing performance discrepancies. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to enhance the clarity of their definitions and the organization of the paper to improve flow and comprehension.
