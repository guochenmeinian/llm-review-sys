Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies the partial identification capabilities of neural causal models (NCMs), specifically their ability to approximate the interval of causal queries, $\theta(\mathcal{M}) \in [\underline{F}, \overline{F}]$. The authors develop results demonstrating that, under ideal conditions with oracle knowledge of exogenous distributions, NCMs can approximate any structural causal model (SCM) if the appropriate architecture and regularization are applied. The necessity of regularization is emphasized, as it prevents the observational likelihood from being modeled well while the interventional distribution diverges. The theory accommodates general scenarios involving confounders and mixed-type data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- This work addresses the intriguing question of whether NCMs can effectively perform causal partial identification.
- The developed theory is general, sound, and intuitively coherent.
- The study of mixed-type data is a notable contribution, rarely explored in existing literature.
- The requirement for regularization in NCMs to approximate SCMs is an interesting finding.

Weaknesses:
- The practical implications of the theory are unclear, as it relies on knowing the exogenous distribution, which is typically unknown.
- Some assumptions, such as global Lipschitz-continuity, may be overly restrictive in practice.
- The presentation is dense, with non-standard definitions and insufficient examples, making it less accessible to a broader audience.
- The experimental section is brief and lacks comprehensive settings, an ablation study, and thorough result analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the accessibility of the paper by providing more examples of constructing canonical representations for simple SCMs and their corresponding NCM architectures. Additionally, we suggest offering a more precise explanation of Figures 1 and 5, including details like the number of layers in the blocks and notation elements. It would also be beneficial to include the code for the proposed method and to ensure that a conclusion section is present in the main text. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the assumptions and discuss examples where these assumptions hold or fail, as well as to provide proof sketches or an overview of the proof strategy to enhance understandability.
