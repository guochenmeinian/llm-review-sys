Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Yo'LLaVA, a novel approach for personalizing Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to understand user-specific concepts, such as a user's pet. The authors propose a method that learns latent tokens to encode personalized subjects using a limited number of images, enabling personalized visual and textual interactions. The methodology involves freezing all parameters except for the new tokens and classifier head, employing hard negative mining to enhance training. The experiments demonstrate that Yo'LLaVA significantly outperforms baseline models, including LLaVA and GPT-4o, with strong quantitative and qualitative results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Novelty in addressing the personalization of LMMs, filling a significant gap in current capabilities.
- Strong performance demonstrated through quantitative results and comparisons with concurrent works.
- Clear methodology and effective use of qualitative and quantitative analyses to validate the approach.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation is limited to specific tasks; broader testing across diverse scenarios is needed.
- Scalability concerns regarding the model's ability to handle multiple personalized subjects and frequent updates.
- Uncertainty about whether a separate model is needed for each instance or if multiple instances can be trained together.
- Lack of a small human evaluation to further validate the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including a broader range of tasks and real-world scenarios to strengthen their claims. Additionally, discussing the scalability of Yo'LLaVA in handling multiple personalized subjects and the implications of frequent updates would be beneficial. Clarifying whether a separate model is necessary for each instance or if multiple instances can be accommodated together would enhance the understanding of the method's applicability. Finally, conducting a small human evaluation would provide further validation of the proposed approach.
