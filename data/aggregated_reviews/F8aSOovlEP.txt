Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel task called Multi-Event Causal Discovery (MECD), aimed at uncovering causal relationships in long videos with multiple events. The authors propose the Video Granger Causality Model (VGCM), which employs a mask-based event prediction model inspired by the Granger Causality method, along with front-door adjustment and counterfactual inference techniques. The paper introduces a dataset of 1107 lifestyle videos curated from ActivityNet, demonstrating that VGCM significantly outperforms existing models like GPT-4 and Video-LLaVA in causal inference tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant gap in video reasoning tasks by focusing on multi-event causal discovery, reflecting real-world scenarios.
- The VGCM framework integrates advanced causal inference techniques, which are well-justified and theoretically sound.
- Empirical results indicate substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art models, showcasing the robustness of the proposed approach.
- The creation of the MECD dataset, with detailed annotations, is a valuable contribution to the field.

Weaknesses:
- The MECD dataset is limited in size, with only 1107 samples, making comprehensive evaluation challenging. A broader variety of video sources is recommended.
- Comparisons with other state-of-the-art video-language models are lacking, which could enhance the analysis.
- The paper lacks sufficient technical depth in certain sections, particularly regarding the Granger Causality method and causal inference techniques.
- The complexity of the VGCM framework may hinder implementation and replication by other researchers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset size by sourcing videos from a wider variety of platforms, such as YouTube, and consider including a validation set. Additionally, we suggest incorporating comparisons with other state-of-the-art models, such as Video-Llama and InstructBLIP, to provide a more comprehensive analysis. It would be beneficial to include a brief overview of the Granger Causality method in section 4.1 and enhance the technical explanations in sections discussing the Event Granger Test and causal inference techniques. Furthermore, providing detailed information about the architecture of different encoders, training hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics would facilitate better reproducibility of the results.
