### Key Points
This paper presents a framework, SHaRe, aimed at enhancing social recommendation performance by addressing low homophily in social connections. The authors propose a graph rewiring approach that eliminates low-homophily edges and introduces high-homophily edges based on user embedding similarity. The method employs contrastive learning to improve correlations among user embeddings and is designed to be compatible with various social recommendation models. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of SHaRe through experiments on three datasets, showing consistent but modest improvements over baseline methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research direction of enhancing social recommendations through a data-centric approach is novel and promising.
- The SHaRe technique is straightforward and technically sound, with clear presentation of its components.
- The experimental results are thorough and compelling, supported by an effective ablation study.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed method lacks depth in underlying theory and technical complexity.
- The distinction between SHaRe and standard collaborative filtering approaches is unclear, raising questions about its novelty.
- Improvements in experimental results are relatively small and need validation for statistical significance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical foundation of the proposed method to enhance its technical depth. Additionally, the authors should clarify how SHaRe differs from standard collaborative filtering techniques and consider empirical comparisons against such methods. It would be beneficial to validate the significance of the improvements observed in the experiments and to discuss the limitations of SHaRe, including potential noise in the rewired graph. Finally, addressing missing literature and providing a more detailed analysis of experimental results would strengthen the paper.
