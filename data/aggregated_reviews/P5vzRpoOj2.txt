Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to data poisoning defenses by introducing a temporal threat model that considers the "birthdate" of training examples. The authors propose two metrics—earliness and duration—to assess the timing of attacks and their impact on model robustness. They introduce a baseline defense mechanism called temporal aggregation, which aims to provide provable temporal robustness against data poisoning, even when attackers can inject an unrestricted number of poisoned samples. Additionally, the authors discuss how attackers can generate slightly more poisoning samples than current defenses can tolerate, emphasizing the practical feasibility of poisoning a small percentage of training data. The paper also explores the implications of the lethal dose conjecture in relation to the sample complexity of test samples, suggesting that certain samples may be more vulnerable to manipulation. Empirical validation is conducted using a benchmark derived from the News Category dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces an interesting and novel temporal threat model for data poisoning.
2. The metrics of earliness and duration effectively represent the temporality of data poisoning.
3. The temporal aggregation defense is a straightforward yet compelling concept.
4. The empirical evaluation provides a benchmark for assessing temporal robustness.
5. The authors are open to revising statements for clarity, ensuring that the audience accurately understands the contribution.
6. The discussion of existing literature effectively supports the claims regarding the feasibility of poisoning samples.

Weaknesses:
1. The practicality of the proposed threat model requires further evaluation, particularly regarding realistic attack scenarios.
2. The evaluations are incomplete, lacking diverse attack strategies and benchmark datasets.
3. The novelty of the temporal aggregation defense needs enhancement, as it may not sufficiently address all attack scenarios.
4. The empirical results raise questions about the effectiveness of the defense, particularly in cases with a high number of poisoned samples.
5. Some statements in the introduction may lead to confusion regarding the nature of the poisoning samples discussed.
6. There is a need for more precise explanations of how the lethal dose conjecture applies to the paper's context.
7. The authors have not fully addressed potential countermeasures for scenarios where attackers bypass temporal defenses.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the practicality of the temporal threat model by providing more context on scenarios where attackers can afford to inject numerous poisoned samples. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on the capabilities and limitations of potential attackers to clarify the attack scenarios. To strengthen the evaluation, we suggest including more benchmark datasets and considering time series data for a more comprehensive assessment of temporal data poisoning. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore alternative defense strategies, such as validation set testing and ensemble learning, to enhance the robustness of their proposed defense. We also recommend improving the clarity of the introduction by explicitly stating that attackers can generate slightly more samples than what is tolerable by current defenses, rather than an arbitrarily high number of poisoning samples. Additionally, please provide more precision on how existing works substantiate the claim that attackers can easily poison more samples than current defenses can tolerate. It would be beneficial to clarify the application of the lethal dose conjecture in the context of sample complexity. Lastly, we encourage the authors to discuss potential countermeasures for scenarios where attackers have already bypassed temporal defenses, including both detection-based and newer techniques for locating poisoned samples post-attack.
