Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to adversarial attacks in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), analyzing various attack strategies including reward poisoning, action poisoning, and a combination of both across white-box, grey-box, and black-box settings. The authors propose an attacker model that manipulates rewards and actions to guide agents towards a target policy or maximize cumulative rewards. The paper provides theoretical insights into the efficacy of these attacks, demonstrating limitations of singular action or reward poisoning and introducing mixed attack strategies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant problem in MARL, contributing original insights into adversarial attacks.
- It is clearly written and easy to follow, with a comprehensive overview of attack modalities.
- The consideration of various attack settings adds depth to the analysis.

Weaknesses:
- The related work section lacks a comprehensive review of existing literature, particularly on similar problems.
- There is a notable absence of numerical results in the main body, which would strengthen the arguments.
- The paper does not discuss attack detection or provide empirical evaluations of the proposed strategies.
- The optimality of the proposed upper bounds is not thoroughly examined.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section by providing a more thorough review of existing literature on adversarial attacks in MARL. Additionally, we suggest including more numerical results in the main text to enhance the credibility of the findings. It would also be beneficial to discuss attack detection mechanisms and conduct empirical evaluations of the proposed strategies in real-world or simulated environments. Furthermore, addressing the optimality of the upper bounds and discussing practical considerations for scalability beyond the tabular setting would strengthen the paper. Lastly, we encourage the authors to include a discussion on the limitations of their work, particularly regarding the assumptions made in the theoretical analysis.
