Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper addresses the ID-OOD trade-off in ensemble-based methods under the pretrain-finetune regime. The authors propose an adaptive ensemble method that determines ensemble coefficients based on the feature distance between test samples and a zero-shot failure set. This method has a theoretical foundation and consistently enhances OOD generalization performance compared to vanilla ensemble baselines across various scenarios. Additionally, the study introduces Variance Reduction Fine-tuning (VRF), which employs sample-wise ensembling to improve both ID and OOD accuracy, validated through experiments on ImageNet and associated distribution shifts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents a significant research problem relevant to foundation models, with a straightforward and reasonable proposed method.
- The proposed method shows consistent performance improvements in various distribution shift setups, supported by intuitive theoretical justifications and extensive qualitative and quantitative analyses.
- VRF effectively combines outputs from zero-shot and fine-tuned models using instance-specific weighting coefficients, enhancing performance.

Weaknesses:
- The method requires access to the entire training dataset and distance computations during inference, limiting its applicability in resource-constrained environments.
- The theoretical analysis lacks implications regarding the relative generalization error compared to non-ensemble-based fine-tuning methods and does not include comparisons with more advanced methods.
- VRF incurs higher inference costs due to the need for multiple forward passes and lacks a thorough analysis of these costs, raising concerns about its efficiency compared to existing methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the theoretical and practical computational complexity of VRF, particularly regarding space and time. Additionally, the authors should consider extending evaluations to more datasets beyond ImageNet to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method. A thorough comparison with advanced fine-tuning and ensemble methods is essential to assess the effectiveness of VRF. Furthermore, exploring a broader range of values for the hyperparameters $a$ and $b$ would provide deeper insights into their impact on performance. Lastly, including a detailed analysis of the inference costs associated with the proposed method would enhance the paper's clarity and applicability.
