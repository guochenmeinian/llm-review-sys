### Key Points
This paper presents a method for monitoring machine learning model performance over time without requiring extensive labeled data, addressing the challenge of performance monitoring under temporal distribution shifts. The authors propose Incremental Uncertainty-aware Performance Monitoring (IUPM), which quantifies uncertainty and queries labels only when necessary. The approach innovatively leverages optimal transport and combines performance estimation with uncertainty quantification for temporal shifts, potentially impacting fields where retraining or labeling is costly.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Innovative use of optimal transport.
- Combines uncertainty quantification with selective labeling to reduce monitoring costs.
- Empirical results demonstrate improvements over existing baselines.
- Addresses a practical problem in model deployment.

Weaknesses:
- Assumes gradual distribution shifts, limiting application in scenarios with abrupt or unpredictable changes.
- Limited exploration of high-dimensional real-world datasets beyond MNIST, raising questions about performance in complex data.
- Potential computational overhead for large-scale or real-time applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the exploration of IUPM's performance with abrupt changes in the dataset, quantifying the boundary cases for effective gradual shifts. Additionally, we suggest discussing the method's applicability to higher-dimensional data and providing insights into its computational complexity and scalability. It would also be beneficial to conduct a more comprehensive experiment on the trade-offs of matching on different layers, as mentioned in lines 129-132, to guide real-world applications better. Lastly, adding a discussion on the implications of the experimental results, particularly why IUPM outperforms existing methods and identifying scenarios where it may struggle, will strengthen the paper's contribution.
