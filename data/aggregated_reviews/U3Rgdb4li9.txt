Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for designing sequential indirect experiments aimed at estimating targeted scientific queries in complex, nonlinear environments with potential unobserved confounding. The authors formulate the problem as sequential instrument design, utilizing instrumental variables and minimax optimization to estimate upper and lower bounds of causal effects. The proposed method iteratively tightens these bounds through adaptive strategies, demonstrating efficacy in synthetic experiments compared to non-adaptive baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses an important problem in scientific discovery where direct intervention is often impractical, focusing on targeted sequential indirect experimental design.
- It presents a flexible approach that accommodates nonlinear, multi-variate, and confounded settings, with a sound formulation as sequential underspecified instrumental variable estimation.
- The authors develop closed-form estimators for bounds under certain conditions, enhancing the method's applicability.

Weaknesses:  
- The theoretical results may not be practically useful for real-world problems, particularly regarding the method's handling of non-convex optimization and assumptions on the loss function.
- The experiments are limited to low-dimensional synthetic settings, raising questions about scalability and performance in higher dimensions or real-world applications.
- The reliance on several tuning parameters raises concerns about practical implementation, as the selection process appears subjective and time-consuming.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the practical applicability of their theoretical results by addressing the following:  
- Provide more intuitive theoretical explanations of the differences between convex and non-convex optimization in their settings, and clarify the assumptions on the loss function.
- Extend experiments to higher dimensions and include real-world data analysis to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
- Conduct thorough studies on the impact of tuning parameters, offering guidelines on how their choice affects the method's performance, as the current selection process seems too subjective.
