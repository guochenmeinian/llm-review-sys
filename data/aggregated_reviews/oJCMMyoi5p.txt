### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of QUIC performance over fast Internet connections, revealing that QUIC underperforms compared to HTTP/2 due to high receiver-side processing overhead. The authors conduct extensive testing across various web browsers, applications, and network scenarios, including video streaming and web page loading. The findings highlight the impact of system-level parameters and the unique design features of QUIC, particularly its reliance on UDP.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper uncovers a significant performance gap between QUIC and HTTP/2, particularly in fast network environments.
- It employs a robust experimental design, testing across multiple browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) and applications, enhancing the credibility of the results.
- The analysis includes practical scenarios, providing valuable insights for real-world applications.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a detailed examination of the effects of QUIC's specific mechanisms, such as stream control, multiplexing, and FEC.
- There is insufficient exploration of the relative impact of various factors contributing to the performance gap, particularly the role of UDP and ACK mechanisms.
- The discussion on delayed-ACKs and their implications is not adequately contextualized within existing literature.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of QUIC's architecture by including a comparison with TCP/HTTP/2 in the background section to enhance reader understanding. Additionally, further measurements regarding the influence of QUIC's special mechanisms, such as stream control and multiplexing, would be beneficial. Clarifying the CPU usage measurement methodology in Figure 6 and discussing the impact of different packet sizes on CPU usage and transmission speed would strengthen the paper. Finally, addressing the novelty of the findings in relation to existing literature on delayed-ACKs and offloading would provide clearer insights into how this work contributes to the field.
