Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a blind image restoration method called BIR-D, which utilizes a pre-trained diffusion model and an adaptable convolutional kernel to dynamically simulate degradation during the diffusion process. The authors propose an empirical formula for an adaptive guidance scale, enhancing restoration accuracy. The method shows strong performance across various restoration tasks, including deblurring and low-light enhancement, but the validation of proposed modules is questioned.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The authors propose a non-training strategy for blind image restoration that achieves state-of-the-art performance without additional prior knowledge.  
2. The adaptive guidance scale is a novel and effective approach to improve restoration fidelity.  
3. The experimental results demonstrate robustness across multiple image restoration tasks.

Weaknesses:  
1. The introduction and degradation function design are confusing, particularly regarding the notation and the rationale behind the noise estimation.  
2. The reliance on a pre-trained model raises concerns about the claim of not using prior knowledge, suggesting the need for additional ablation studies without it.  
3. The ablation study lacks depth, with insufficient visualizations and theoretical analyses of the guidance scale and degradation function.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction and the degradation function design, specifically addressing the notation and the noise estimation rationale. Additionally, conduct comprehensive ablation studies across all benchmarks without the pre-trained model to validate the proposed method's effectiveness. Enhance the analysis and visualization of the degradation function and the adaptive guidance scale's behavior during the denoising process, including theoretical insights into their performance trends.
