Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Modulated Neural ODEs (MoNODE), which enhance traditional Neural ODEs by incorporating static and dynamic modulator networks to separately model time-invariant and dynamic variables. The authors validate MoNODE across various dynamical systems, including synthetic examples and real datasets, demonstrating improved interpretability and long-term predictability compared to standard NODEs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed MoNODE framework is simple, principled, and easily integrable into existing NODE models.
- The experimental results indicate that MoNODE provides more interpretable latent dynamics than NODE, attributed to the explicit separation of static and dynamic variables.
- The framework shows better generalization capabilities for new dynamic parameterizations and long-term forecasting.

Weaknesses:
- The time-invariance of the modulator prediction network is only assured for a fixed time horizon, raising concerns about its effectiveness over arbitrary time spans.
- The experimental examples are limited to relatively simple dynamical systems, leaving uncertainty about MoNODE's performance on more complex chaotic systems.
- The paper lacks a comparison with relevant prior work that also addresses the factorization of latent space into content and motion variables.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the validation of time-invariance by providing empirical evidence, such as visualizing the constancy of modulator variables over time. Additionally, conducting an ablation study to assess MoNODE's performance when $T_z < T_e$ would clarify its applicability. It would also be beneficial to explore the effectiveness of MoNODE on chaotic dynamics, such as the Lorenz system, and to compare the use of averaging versus max pooling in the modulator networks. Finally, including visual descriptions and intuitive interpretations of the extracted modulator variables would enhance the clarity of the framework's contributions.
