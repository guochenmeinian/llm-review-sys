Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for learning generalizable task abstractions in artificial neural networks by constraining neuron dynamics. The authors propose that neuron-like properties such as non-negativity, faster timescales, and regularization facilitate fast task adaptation and compositional generalization. They provide a detailed analysis of learning dynamics and replicate findings in more complex settings, including human-like learning characteristics. The model aims to address catastrophic forgetting by using subnetworks and a gating mechanism that activates only one subnetwork at a time, trained on nonshuffled data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work offers extensive analyses of model behavior and learning dynamics, contributing to the understanding of fast adaptation.
- The model effectively parallels human cognition, supported by theoretical and empirical evidence.
- The simplicity of the model enhances its accessibility, and the experiments, particularly in section 5, demonstrate how specialization emerges from hyperparameter tuning.

Weaknesses:
- Some architectural choices, such as the number and size of subnetworks, appear tuned to the system, raising concerns about generalizability.
- The paper's structure deviates from typical norms, with related work and experiment details relegated to the appendix, making it challenging to grasp the main results.
- The model's applicability to real-world tasks is questionable, particularly if it relies on orthogonal input tasks, which could limit its utility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental setup in the main text, ensuring that results are adequately explained. It would be beneficial to explore additional image recognition tasks beyond permuted MNIST to assess the model's robustness. Additionally, we suggest that the authors elaborate on the regularization constraints in more accessible language and provide clearer links to detailed explanations in the appendix. Finally, addressing the potential limitation regarding the orthogonality of tasks would strengthen the paper's claims and broaden its applicability.
