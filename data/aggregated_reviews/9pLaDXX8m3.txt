Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel visual localization method that leverages Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to reduce the need for extensive pose and depth labels in training scene coordinate regression networks. The authors propose generating pseudo-groundtruth depth labels using a NeRF trained on a set of calibrated images, allowing for a coarse pose estimation that is subsequently refined through image-based visual servoing (IBVS). The method demonstrates robustness in visual servoing despite coarse pose errors and is evaluated against state-of-the-art localization techniques across multiple datasets, showcasing competitive performance while utilizing fewer labeled images. The authors plan to include critical details regarding the amounts of training data in the main paper, which is essential as data efficiency is a key argument for their approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The approach to reduce data requirements for training scene coordinate regression networks is innovative and addresses a significant challenge in visual localization.
2. Utilizing NeRF to produce pseudo-groundtruth 3D labels is insightful and contributes to the field.
3. The paper effectively compares its method against relevant state-of-the-art works, showcasing its contributions.
4. The authors have effectively addressed reviewer concerns and improved the clarity of the writing.
5. The inclusion of quantitative experiments and comparisons with baselines strengthens the argument for data efficiency.
6. The robustness of the method to large pose errors is demonstrated.

Weaknesses:
1. The writing lacks clarity in several sections, requiring multiple readings for comprehension, and contains several typos that detract from the overall presentation.
2. The claim of requiring fewer labeled images lacks empirical support, as no experiments demonstrate the effect of gradually reducing training images on performance.
3. The method's reliance on NeRF may introduce rendering artifacts that affect pose estimation, and the paper does not adequately address the implications of this.
4. The comparison with iNeRF was not conducted due to limited rebuttal time, which could have provided additional insights.
5. The DSAC family results were not reported, which is surprising given their relevance as state-of-the-art methods.
6. The term "navigation prior" is not standard and requires clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing throughout the paper, ensuring that technical derivations are explicitly detailed to enhance reader understanding. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments that gradually reduce the number of training images to substantiate claims regarding data efficiency. It would also be beneficial to clarify the role of NeRF in the pose refinement process and consider comparing the proposed IBVS approach with optimization techniques similar to those used in iNeRF for the final pose refinement step. Furthermore, we recommend clarifying the definition of "navigation prior" to ensure it is well understood by readers. We also suggest conducting an ablation study to explore the necessity of the separate coordinate regression network for depth estimation, particularly in relation to the depth provided by NeRF. Lastly, addressing the rendering quality and its impact on the method's performance, particularly in challenging scenes, would strengthen the paper, along with including a systematic evaluation of the comparison with iNeRF in future work.
