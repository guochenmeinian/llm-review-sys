### Key Points
This paper presents a novel dataset on single-cell gene expression across multiple cell lines and drugs, alongside a detailed account of a competition conducted on its earlier version. The authors emphasize the dataset's quality control and study design, making it a valuable resource for the computational single-cell analysis community. The dataset is complemented by a live benchmark for predicting perturbational outcomes, which engaged over 1,000 teams, providing insights into methodological baselines and lessons learned.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Very clearly written and well-structured.
- Justifies every step in the dataset creation and competition design.
- Introduces a scientifically rigorous dataset with comprehensive perturbation screens and a novel significance estimation metric.
- Provides valuable insights from the competition and a list of submitted models.

Weaknesses:
- Lacks a comprehensive summary of effective model designs and data processing strategies from top-performing solutions.
- The evaluation method based on regressing p-values may be suboptimal; the biological significance of exact p-values is questionable.
- Some descriptions, such as the "distance between observations of the same compound," are confusing and require clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of ambiguous statements, particularly in line 148 regarding "the distance between observations of the same compound." Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed summary of what works in model design and data processing based on the top solutions from the competition. Furthermore, consider reframing the perturbation task to address the broader implications of predicting responses for new molecules based on existing data. Lastly, creating the consortium mentioned and generating more data would enhance the dataset's impact.
