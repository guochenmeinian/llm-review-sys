Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Treeffuser, a nonparametric method for modeling output distributions in regression problems using diffusion models and gradient-boosted trees (GBDTs). Treeffuser generates a distribution over the response variable given an input vector, demonstrating flexibility and effectiveness across various datasets. The authors find that their method can learn non-standard distributions and produce accurate probabilistic predictions, as evidenced by experiments on toy examples, real-world datasets, and a case study.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The experimental results showcase Treeffuser's effectiveness on complex examples and real-world tabular regression datasets, outperforming existing methods.
- The paper is well-written and presents the core ideas clearly.
- The approach is flexible and nonparametric, capable of modeling any response distribution, particularly valuable for tabular regression problems.
- Treeffuser performs well with default hyperparameters.

Weaknesses:
- Generating samples requires solving a stochastic differential equation, which can be computationally expensive with many predictions.
- The paper lacks complexity and empirical runtime analysis, which would aid practitioners in evaluating the method's applicability.
- Comparisons to other methods could be enhanced, particularly regarding the tuning of critical hyperparameters and the potential benefits of kernel density estimation (KDE).
- Clarity regarding the novelty of the contribution and the specific diffusion setup is insufficient, leading to questions about the method's distinctiveness compared to existing approaches.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contribution by explicitly distinguishing between novel aspects of their diffusion setup and existing methodologies. Additionally, we suggest providing a more comprehensive empirical comparison with recent methods in Section 5.3 to strengthen the experimental validation. Including complexity and empirical runtime analyses would also be beneficial for practitioners. Finally, addressing the questions regarding negative log likelihood results and the performance comparison with iBUG would enhance the paper's depth.
