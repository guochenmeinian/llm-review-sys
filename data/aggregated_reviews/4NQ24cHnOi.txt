Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a polynomial-time algorithm for estimating edge density in Erdos-Renyi and inhomogeneous random graphs under node-level differential privacy. The authors propose a robust approach that achieves optimal error rates, utilizing a sum-of-squares method and an exponential mechanism based on the framework established by Hopkins et al. The algorithm's error is bounded by terms that account for both privacy and robustness, demonstrating significant advancements in the field.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The theoretical results are robust, providing optimal error bounds for both Erdos-Renyi and inhomogeneous graphs.
2. The use of the sum-of-squares method in conjunction with privacy-robustness reduction is sophisticated and innovative.
3. The paper is well-written, with clear and technically correct theorems.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a thorough discussion and comparison with relevant work, particularly Chen et al.'s results on private graphon estimation.
2. The problem formulation assumes independent edge selection, which may not reflect real-world graph structures.
3. The algorithm's complexity may hinder practical implementation due to the advanced tools employed, such as semidefinite programming.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related work, particularly addressing how their proof techniques differ from those in Chen et al. Additionally, we suggest elaborating on the challenges faced in designing the sum-of-squares algorithm for edge density estimation to clarify its novelty. It would also be beneficial to explore the implications of non-independent edge selections in real-world applications and consider extending the algorithm to estimate other graph statistics beyond edge density.
