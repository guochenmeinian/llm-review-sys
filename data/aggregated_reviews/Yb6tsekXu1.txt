### Key Points
This paper presents a method to predict molecular properties using an SE(3)-invariant molecular fingerprint generated via Vietoris-Rips persistent homology. The authors demonstrate that SE(3) invariance is crucial for accurate predictions and that gradient boosting methods outperform state-of-the-art graph neural networks (GNNs) on MoleculeNet benchmarks. The empirical results indicate that the proposed method achieves higher prediction accuracy and effectively incorporates chirality while quantifying uncertainties.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The experiments are well-executed and comprehensive, covering various molecular property prediction tasks.
- The importance of chirality sensitivity is well-motivated, and the theoretical guarantee of SE(3) invariance is sound.
- The proposed gradient boosting method significantly outperforms baseline methods, including GNNs.
- The paper includes extensive additional experiments and discussions that enhance the main findings.

Weaknesses:
- The main text lacks sufficient theoretical background for a general audience, with several undefined notations and missing definitions, making it less accessible.
- The importance of stability in theorem 4.3 is not adequately elaborated, and the process for obtaining MPPH fingerprints needs clarification.
- The Bayesian ensemble is only applied to MPPH; it is unclear if incorporating SGLB could improve baseline methods.
- The discussion on MPPH's performance in lipophilicity prediction is inconsistent with its reported MSE error.
- The wording in line 125 may inadvertently reveal the authors' identity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the main text by simplifying complex derivations and ensuring it is more accessible to a broader audience. Additionally, please provide clear definitions for all notations and elaborate on the significance of stability in the context of existing methods. We suggest including a brief discussion on how MPPH fingerprints are obtained and exploring whether incorporating SGLB could enhance baseline performance. Finally, consider adding metrics that compare distributions to better demonstrate the advantages of uncertainty estimation beyond active learning.
