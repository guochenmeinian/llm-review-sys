Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to understanding 4D environments through the introduction of the 4D Panoptic Scene Graph (PSG-4D). The authors propose PSG4DFormer, a model designed to predict panoptic segmentation masks, track these masks over time, and generate corresponding scene graphs. They have developed a high-quality PSG-4D dataset, comprising 3K RGB-D videos with one million frames, each annotated with 4D panoptic segmentation masks and dynamic scene graphs. The paper also illustrates a real-world application of dynamic scene understanding by integrating a large language model into the PSG-4D system.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper formulates a new problem, annotates a novel dataset, and provides simple baselines, potentially advancing future research and applications in robotic systems.
2. The dataset selection and construction pipeline is detailed and reasonable.
3. The paper is well articulated and easy to comprehend, with the incorporation of a large language model as a viable addition.

Weaknesses:
1. The Experimental section lacks clarity regarding which components of the pipeline are most promising for future research focus. The ablation study provides some insights, but more detailed analysis is needed.
2. The novelty of the 4D-PSG is limited, as it appears to be a simple extension of existing 3D scene graph concepts. The proposed PSG4DFormer is also seen as a straightforward combination of existing models.
3. The dataset's sample size and relationship labels are limited, which may restrict practical application. Additionally, the experiments are limited to one baseline, necessitating stronger comparisons.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the Experimental section by providing a more detailed analysis of the components within the PSG4DFormer model and their individual contributions to performance. Additionally, we suggest that the authors include experiments to substantiate the potential applications of the 4D-PSG, as well as provide a stronger baseline for comparison. Furthermore, enhancing the dataset's diversity and expanding the number of relationship labels would significantly improve its practical applicability.
