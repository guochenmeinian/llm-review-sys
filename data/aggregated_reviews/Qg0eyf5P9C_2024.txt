Aggregated Review:
**Key points**  
We note that the paper introduces a method for mining scenes of interest from extensive unlabeled ego-centric driving logs, utilizing CLIP's embeddings for open-vocabulary querying. The relevance of this work to our workshop is significant.

**Strengths and weaknesses**  
We find the approach to be clever and effective in addressing the challenges of open-vocabulary querying. However, we believe the presentation of the paper requires further refinement to enhance clarity and impact.

**Suggestions for improvement**  
We suggest that the authors focus on polishing the paper's presentation to improve its overall quality.
