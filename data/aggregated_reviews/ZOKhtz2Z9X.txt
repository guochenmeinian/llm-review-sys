Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to automated information design, where a sender strategically reveals information to influence a receiver's actions. The authors propose a neural network architecture, HAIDNet, to model human behavior that deviates from Bayesian rationality. The framework optimizes both sender and receiver behaviors by learning receiver preferences from existing data when analytical approximations are not feasible. Through extensive experiments, including real-world human interactions, the authors demonstrate that HAIDNet can effectively optimize information communication, achieving results close to optimal in various settings and outperforming less data-driven baselines in smaller-scale problems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The experiments with real human subjects provide a significant contribution, demonstrating the practical applicability of the proposed method.
- The setting of information design is scientifically interesting, and the application of deep learning to this area is innovative.
- The paper is accessible even to those unfamiliar with automated information design, with clear motivations and a solid introduction to Bayesian persuasion.
- The relaxation of the Bayesian rationality assumption and the demonstration of a data-driven approach using machine learning is a significant contribution, particularly as it applies to real human participants.
- The learning-based approach, which employs a small MLP, allows for quicker training while still achieving good approximations of optimal solutions.

Weaknesses:
- The assumption of Bayesian rationality is mischaracterized as a limitation of prior works, which primarily focused on different aspects of information design.
- The exact contributions of the paper are somewhat unclear, particularly regarding the novelty of using a neural network to solve Eqn 2.
- There is uncertainty about the existence of prior ML approaches in this field, necessitating a more detailed description of the ML setup.
- The scalability of HAIDNet is questionable, as it requires full policies as input, which may not be feasible in larger problem instances.
- Key components, such as the input size and architecture of the neural network, require further elaboration to clarify scalability and generalization issues.
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion on the performance of the HAIDNet policy and the differences in learned policies under varying conditions.
- The ethical implications of using data-driven models of human behavior raise concerns about potential negative societal impacts, including exploitation of human biases.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the assumption of Bayesian rationality and its relevance to their work. Additionally, the authors should emphasize the assumptions related to the independence of receivers and their differing priors. To address scalability concerns, we suggest discussing potential strategies for adapting HAIDNet to larger problem instances. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions by providing a more in-depth discussion of the ML setup, including:
1. A detailed description of the neural network input, its size, and how it scales with problem instances.
2. An exploration of the architectures considered for this problem.
3. An analysis of how the approach can scale beyond tabular representations.

Furthermore, we encourage the authors to expand on the ethical implications of their research, particularly regarding the exploitation of human biases and the potential for negative societal impacts. More absolute performance measures for the HAIDNet policy should be included, along with a qualitative discussion of the learned policies. Finally, we advise clarifying the boosting and aggregation approach mentioned in the paper and reconsidering the necessity of including certain demographic information in the supplementary materials.
