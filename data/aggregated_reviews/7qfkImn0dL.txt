Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach, SynTO, for few-shot black-box optimization by utilizing synthetic pretraining and in-context learning. The method is evaluated through comprehensive experiments, demonstrating competitive performance across various benchmarks. SynTO employs synthetic functions generated via Gaussian processes with a radial basis function kernel, allowing for effective adaptation to downstream tasks using few-shot data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is applicable to real-world optimization tasks and shows generalizability across multiple scenarios.
- Pretraining with synthetic data is innovative and raises fewer ethical concerns compared to real data.
- The writing is clear, and the experimental section provides valuable insights into the method's performance and design choices.

Weaknesses:
- SynTO's reliance on large amounts of unlabeled data may lead to unfair comparisons with methods using limited labeled data.
- Performance in some settings appears inferior despite the additional unlabeled data.
- The justification for using Gaussian processes with an RBF kernel lacks depth, and the paper does not adequately define the concepts of "diversity and challenging" in the context of task generation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the necessity of large unlabeled datasets and clarify how SynTO compares to existing few-shot learning methods. Additionally, we suggest conducting ablation studies to identify which components of SynTO contribute to its performance superiority. It would also be beneficial to provide a more thorough analysis of the choice of Gaussian processes, including comparisons with other synthetic data generation methods. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the role of the VAE in the architecture and ensure that the terminology used is precise to avoid confusion.
