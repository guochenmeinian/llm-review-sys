### Key Points
This paper investigates Adverse Drug Event (ADE) extraction, focusing on drug safety reports. The authors present BioDEX, a large dataset of medical papers paired with drug safety reports, and propose a sequence-to-sequence approach for extracting key information to populate safety reports. They evaluate this approach using a subset of BioDEX, referred to as the Report-Extraction dataset, while also exploring the performance of pretrained language models in few-shot and fine-tuning settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant medical application, contributing a valuable dataset for ADE research.
- The experimental setup is well-defined, and the test scenario mimics real-world applications.
- The methodology is robust, and the code for dataset creation and experiments is available for reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- The formulation of the Report-Extraction task as a sequence-to-sequence task may not be the most appropriate; a combination of classification for attributes like seriousness and patient sex could be more effective.
- The evaluation metric is confusing, with unclear definitions and a lack of detailed performance breakdown for each attribute.
- The color coding in figures is ambiguous, hindering comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the evaluation metric and provide a detailed performance breakdown for each attribute to enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest that the authors consider a combination of classification and sequence-to-sequence approaches for the Report-Extraction task. Clarifying the color coding in figures and including a sidebar for better interpretation would also be beneficial. Lastly, addressing the motivation for framing the task as a sequence-to-sequence problem more robustly would strengthen the paper.
