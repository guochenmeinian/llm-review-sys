Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel image watermarking technique that injects signals into both the frequency and pixel domains, specifically targeting the detection of AI-generated images. The authors propose a Robust, Agile plug-and-play Watermarking (RAW) framework that enhances adaptability and computational efficiency, achieving provable guarantees on the false positive rate (FPR) even under adversarial attacks. The method is noted for its simplicity, leading to faster watermarking speeds compared to existing techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides certified error guarantees against a range of attacks, a valuable contribution to the watermarking literature.
- RAW demonstrates improved watermarking speed and robustness while maintaining image quality.
- Experimental results indicate enhancements in adversarial robustness and speed.

Weaknesses:
- A comparison against more recent watermarking techniques is lacking, particularly in Table 4, which does not include performance results against state-of-the-art methods.
- The paper does not comprehensively analyze performance against image manipulations, and it is unclear if hyper-parameters for attacks were maximized.
- The survey of existing works is incomplete, missing numerous frameworks for diffusion models.
- The method's reliance on a single watermark key limits its application, and it is not specifically designed for AI-generated images.
- The experimental evaluation lacks comparisons with baselines for the SDXL model and is limited in image quality metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison against more recent watermarking techniques, particularly including performance results (i.e., AUROC) against methods such as TreeRing, Trustmark, and RoSteLAS. Additionally, it is crucial to provide a comprehensive analysis of performance against image manipulations, including the use of image quality metrics like PSNR and SSIM, and to clarify the hyper-parameters used for various attacks. The authors should also enhance the "Related Works" section to include relevant literature on watermark frameworks for diffusion models and consider providing a visual overview of the proposed method. Finally, addressing the limitations of using a single watermark key and optimizing the watermark based on $L_0$ instead of $L_{raw}$ would strengthen the paper.
