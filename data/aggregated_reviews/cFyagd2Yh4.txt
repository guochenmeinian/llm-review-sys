### Key Points
This paper presents a new dataset for benchmarking large language models (LLMs) on their compliance with harmful demands in the medical field, based on the Principles of Medical Ethics from the AMA. The authors demonstrate that several models fine-tuned for medical purposes comply with unethical requests and show that reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) based on their dataset improves model performance. The paper emphasizes the necessity of this benchmark and outlines the dataset's creation and underlying principles.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an important topic, raising awareness about the lack of safety tuning in medical LLMs compared to generic models.
- The results are comprehensive, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- The approach of using jailbreaking attacks to generate negative examples is innovative and grounded in real-world standards.

Weaknesses:
- The naming convention and terminology used may not accurately reflect the scope of the work, as it focuses primarily on ethical behavior rather than comprehensive medical safety.
- The conclusions do not convincingly demonstrate how the benchmark improves models already tuned for safety, and the analysis of false refusals is lacking.
- The methods for data curation and prompt generation are not sufficiently detailed, raising concerns about the dataset's coverage and potential biases.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the terminology used, possibly replacing "medical use safety" with "ethical" or "responsible" to better reflect the focus on ethical behavior. Additionally, the authors should include a discussion on how this benchmark can enhance models already performing well on generic safety benchmarks, emphasizing unique challenges in medical safety. 

To enhance the quality of research, the authors should provide more detailed explanations of prompt generation and the testing of principles of medical ethics. They should also discuss the implications of false refusals and evaluate model performance before and after fine-tuning. Finally, including a maintenance plan for the dataset and addressing the limitations of the benchmark in detail would strengthen the paper.
