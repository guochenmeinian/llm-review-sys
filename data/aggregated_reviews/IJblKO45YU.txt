Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies the role of representation learning in goal-conditioned behavioral cloning methods, particularly focusing on representations produced by sequence models. The authors propose a statewise approach that first trains a sequence model to generate representations, which are then used as additional inputs to an MLP, outperforming end-to-end methods. Additionally, the paper presents a method for goal-conditioned predictive coding (GCPC) aimed at improving decision-making in offline reinforcement learning. The authors argue that their approach generates "implicit plans," defined as goal-conditioned latent representations that can be decoded into sequences of states and actions to reach specified goals. This model's ability to generate these plans enhances long-horizon decision-making, as evidenced by performance improvements in various tasks, particularly in Antmaze. The paper includes detailed ablation experiments to investigate how these representations should be learned, notably finding that actions should not be included in the learning process.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- **Originality**: The paper provides a fresh perspective on popular RL methods, emphasizing the importance of design decisions rather than merely proposing a new method.
- **Quality**: The experiments are thorough, investigating representation learning and including a range of standard benchmarks.
- **Clarity**: The abstract, introduction, and related work sections are well-written, effectively motivating the problem and providing useful visual aids.
- The authors provide a clear definition of "implicit plans" and demonstrate their model's capability to generate these plans, supported by quantitative results.
- The revised limitations section effectively outlines specific failure cases and potential solutions, such as introducing reward bootstrapping to mitigate harmful behaviors in datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments section is unclear, particularly regarding different masking strategies, which are not explicitly defined.
- Claims about implicit planning lack clarity; a more structured experimental setting is needed to substantiate these claims.
- The definition of "planning" remains ambiguous, leading to confusion about the claims of implicit planning, which need stronger empirical support.
- The argument regarding the non-Markovian nature of Antmaze is criticized, as the fixed position of obstacles suggests that the (x,y) position alone should suffice for decision-making.
- Some writing aspects are confusing, and there are several minor technical issues that need addressing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experiments section by explicitly defining different masking strategies. To strengthen claims about implicit planning, we suggest constructing experiments that differentiate between planning-based and planning-free methods. Additionally, we advise revising the writing for clarity, particularly in defining terms and ensuring consistency in notation. We also recommend improving the clarity of the definition of "planning" to avoid ambiguity and ensure it aligns with established concepts in the field. Furthermore, we suggest conducting further experiments to substantiate claims regarding implicit planning and its effectiveness. It would be beneficial to revise the paper to remove all instances of "plan/planner/planning" from the main text and to relocate the discussion of implicit planning to the appendix for better clarity. Finally, we encourage the authors to include a thorough analysis of the choice of the number of rollouts for each scenario and to provide a comparative analysis of the metrics used in their evaluations.
