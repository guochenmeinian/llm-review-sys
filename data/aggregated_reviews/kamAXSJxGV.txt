Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Bayesian framework for determining the differential privacy (DP) budget \(\epsilon\). It examines the worst-case multiplicative and additive gaps between prior and posterior probabilities of distinguishability, contextualizing disclosure risks into two components: the presence of an individual's data and the identification of sensitive features. The authors propose that data owners create risk profiles reflecting acceptable privacy risks, which can be translated into a DP budget through optimization or a closed-form solution. The paper includes examples of risk profiles and outlines the DP budget required under varying prior probabilities of distinguishability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a crucial issue in differential privacy by proposing a method for determining the appropriate DP budget.
- Decomposing disclosure risk into the risk of detecting inclusion and inferring sensitive attributes enhances understanding of various DP budgets' impacts.
- The framework offers flexibility in modeling acceptable disclosure risk profiles and includes a closed-form expression for deriving a compliant DP budget.

Weaknesses:
- The shift from fixing the budget constant \(\epsilon\) to fixing a disclosure risk profile complicates decision-making for data owners, requiring them to define or estimate prior probabilities.
- The decomposition of privacy risk into multiple parts has flaws, such as the potential for creating insecure mechanisms based on subgroup choices.
- The paper lacks clarity on how to derive reasonable risk profiles for complex situations and does not adequately address the extension of the framework to \((\epsilon, \delta)\)-DP.
- The improvement over the naive baseline \(\epsilon = \log(r)/2\) is not sufficiently highlighted, raising questions about the utility of the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how to derive reasonable risk profiles for complex scenarios and provide a straightforward methodology for setting the DP budget. Additionally, the authors should explore the extension of their framework to \((\epsilon, \delta)\)-DP and ensure that the improvement over the naive baseline is prominently discussed in the main text. Addressing these points will enhance the paper's applicability and comprehensibility.
