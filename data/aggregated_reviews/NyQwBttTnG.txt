Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on Markov signaling games, proposing a learning system that utilizes the signaling gradient and an extended obedience constraint to train a sender to achieve desirable equilibriums. The authors validate their SGOC algorithm through experiments on two toy problems, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to other learning methods. The paper addresses the complexities of multi-agent reinforcement learning in mixed-motive environments, focusing on how a sender can influence a receiver's behavior through crafted messages.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper tackles an important problem in multi-agent contexts, contributing novel ideas through the SGOC algorithm.  
- It provides a clear formulation of the agent-interaction framework and supports its claims with empirical results.  
- The originality of considering mixed-motive environments is noteworthy, as it has received limited attention in the field.  

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty of the Markov signaling game is unclear, and its practical applicability remains questionable.  
- The assumption that the sender has full access to the receiver's policy and observations is problematic, particularly in non-cooperative scenarios.  
- Several technical aspects, such as the meaning of biased policy gradient and the necessity of certain algorithmic constraints, require further clarification.  
- The paper lacks a comprehensive discussion of related works, particularly in comparison to established multi-agent communication algorithms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the novelty and practical significance of the Markov signaling game. A thorough discussion of related works, including comparisons with state-of-the-art multi-agent communication algorithms like TarMAC and ATOC, should be included. Additionally, the authors should address the feasibility of the sender's access to the receiver's information, especially in conflicting interest scenarios. Clarifying the implications of the signaling gradient on non-stationarity and providing a detailed explanation of the biased policy gradient would enhance the technical rigor of the paper. Finally, a more in-depth exploration of the challenges associated with building a reputation system could significantly strengthen the paper's contributions.
