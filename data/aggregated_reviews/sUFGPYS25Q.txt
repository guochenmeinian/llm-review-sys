Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on selective rationalization, proposing a Minimum Conditional Dependence (MCD) criterion to identify causal rationales, addressing the limitations of the commonly used maximum mutual information (MMI) criterion. The authors argue that MCD circumvents spurious correlations by focusing on causal relationships. The experiments primarily utilize the BeerAdvocate and HotelReview datasets, demonstrating competitive results against established baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The causal framework introduced is novel, and the use of d-separation effectively addresses MMI's flaws.
- MCD shows improved rationalization performance compared to existing methods.
- The paper is well-written and presents a compelling motivation for the research.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks novelty, as the causalities in rationalization have been extensively discussed in prior works, and the proposed method closely resembles existing approaches without adequate comparison.
- The datasets are limited, and the authors do not explore the effectiveness of MCD on multi-classification tasks or include widely used datasets like ERASER.
- There is insufficient discussion on the limitations and potential societal impacts of the work, and the treatment of related works is superficial.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their work by providing clearer distinctions between their approach and existing methods, particularly those referenced in the review. Additionally, the authors should include more diverse datasets, such as ERASER, to validate the effectiveness of MCD across different contexts. It would be beneficial to provide examples demonstrating how MCD extraction avoids spurious correlations and to discuss the implications of the worst predictive performance observed. Finally, a more thorough literature review should be conducted to address the identified gaps in related work.
