### Key Points
This paper presents the ELITE framework, which addresses real-time inference challenges in online continual learning (CL) for resource-constrained devices through device-cloud collaboration. The authors propose a model zoo on the cloud and task-oriented model selection for on-device inference, along with a latency-aware online model fine-tuning technique. Evaluations on five datasets demonstrate that ELITE achieves a 16.3% increase in inference performance and reduces response latency by up to 1.98 times compared to state-of-the-art solutions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a comprehensive approach to real-time inference in online CL, showcasing significant improvements in accuracy and latency.
- The methodology is well-structured, with clear explanations of the model zoo and fine-tuning strategies.
- The innovative concept of device-cloud collaboration effectively addresses resource constraints.
- Extensive evaluations on diverse datasets enhance the credibility of the findings.

Weaknesses:
- Certain technical aspects, such as specific algorithms for model selection and fine-tuning, require more detailed explanations.
- The complexity of the framework may hinder practical implementation without additional guidance or code examples.
- The use of technical jargon may challenge non-expert readers.
- The novelty of the approach is somewhat limited as it builds on existing concepts in multi-task learning and model fine-tuning.
- Practical implementation may face challenges related to communication latency and cloud resource availability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of technical explanations, particularly regarding the specific algorithms used for model selection and fine-tuning. Additionally, providing detailed implementation guidelines or code examples for the ELITE framework would aid practitioners in understanding and applying the approach. 

We suggest that the authors elaborate on the practical application scenarios for the framework, particularly in relation to time-varying task streams. Addressing the impact of communication latency on performance and exploring strategies to mitigate potential delays would also enhance the paper's relevance.

Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the scalability of the ELITE framework with an increasing number of tasks and models, and to discuss how it handles extreme resource constraints. Insights from any real-world applications or deployment scenarios would be valuable, as would mechanisms for adapting to highly variable task streams and incorporating user feedback.

Lastly, we recommend that the authors address security and privacy concerns related to data transmission between devices and the cloud, and outline future directions for research and potential improvements to the ELITE framework.
