Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to generalizing the expressivity of message passing neural networks (MPNNs) to the graphon case. The authors aim to quantify representation differences using metrics such as the Prokhorov and unbalanced Wasserstein metrics, establishing bounds on MPNN representations. They demonstrate that similar MPNN outputs correspond to close graphon metrics, extending previous results known only in discrete settings. Empirical validation shows competitive performance of untrained MPNNs on graph-level tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work establishes a significant theoretical connection between GNN representations and graph similarity, enhancing understanding of GNN expressivity.
- Empirical results effectively support the theoretical claims.
- The paper refines existing results on metrics and MPNN outputs, addressing a relevant research direction.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation and conclusions regarding untrained GNN experiments are unclear, particularly how they relate to prior conclusions.
- The analysis focuses on the case of feature-less graphs, which may limit applicability.
- The experimental section lacks clarity and motivation, particularly regarding the role of hidden dimensions and the choice of datasets like TUDataset, which may be too small for robust evaluation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation and implications of untrained GNN experiments, explicitly connecting them to previous findings. Additionally, consider expanding the analysis to include graphs with features, as this could enhance the practical relevance of the work. We suggest using more structurally diverse datasets, such as ZINC or OGB, to strengthen the experimental evaluation. Furthermore, please clarify the connection between the theoretical framework and the experimental results, particularly regarding the role of hidden dimensions and the implications of the Lipschitz properties discussed.
