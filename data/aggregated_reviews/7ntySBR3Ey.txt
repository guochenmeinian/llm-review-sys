Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an energy-efficient scheduling problem that incorporates predictions regarding job release and processing times. The authors propose a learning-augmented algorithm that achieves (1+\epsilon) consistency and bounded robustness, with a focus on minimizing total energy costs while considering a subadditive job cost function. The main contributions include a theoretical framework for the algorithm, a ratio function dependent on prediction error, and performance verification using real datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The submission is well-structured and clearly written, providing sufficient intuitions to aid understanding of the algorithm. The proposed learning-augmented algorithm is applicable to various problems, offering insights into the integration of classical online and offline algorithms.

Weaknesses:  
The paper lacks a comprehensive comparison between the proposed framework and existing works, leaving the effectiveness of the framework in specific applications unclear. Additionally, the generality of the considered problem raises concerns about the potential for polynomial time algorithms. The prediction error model is viewed as unnatural, and the assumption of 100% accuracy for job predictions is criticized for being overly strict.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the competitive ratio formula in Theorem 3.4, potentially simplifying it even at a slight loss of guarantees. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion on how to compute the error function given two instances, as it is crucial for training predictors. Providing examples or citations for the ONLINE and OFFLINE algorithms mentioned would enhance understanding, and a plot illustrating the dependence on prediction error could clarify the results. Lastly, we encourage the authors to consider codifying their proofs in proof assistant software to enhance the rigor and reliability of their theoretical contributions.
