Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of the limitations of classical empirical risk minimization (ERM) in capturing invariant measures of dynamical systems, particularly focusing on chaotic maps. The authors propose that incorporating Jacobian information during training enhances the reconstruction of invariant properties. They validate their approach using various neural flow operators on benchmark chaotic systems and provide theoretical insights into why Jacobian matching can lead to statistically accurate models. Furthermore, the paper explores the intersection between nonlinear dynamics and machine learning, specifically focusing on practical methods for learning physical measures of chaotic dynamics through supervised learning. The authors introduce dynamical systems and ergodic theory as tools for analyzing and understanding generalization in this context.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors address a significant problem regarding the failure of classical ERM to capture invariant measures, providing a theoretical framework using ergodic theory.
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a clean mathematical formulation targeting generalization in ODE models.
- The originality of the work lies in the novel explanation of generalization for Neural ODEs and the empirical validation of their theoretical claims.
- The authors demonstrate a strong engagement with the review process, leading to substantial improvements in their work. Their focus on the intersection of nonlinear dynamics and machine learning is timely and relevant, contributing to both fields.

Weaknesses:
- A major limitation is the reliance on the Jacobian of the dynamical map, which is often unavailable in practice, raising questions about the applicability of the proposed method.
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion of its limitations and does not adequately connect theoretical findings to practical real-world applications.
- Some sections, particularly Section 4, could benefit from clearer explanations regarding the stochastic and deterministic components of the VAE architecture.
- The review does not explicitly mention any weaknesses or areas needing improvement, which may indicate a lack of critical feedback on specific aspects of the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 4 by explicitly detailing the assumptions regarding stochastic and deterministic elements in the VAE architecture. Additionally, addressing the practical implications of their theoretical findings would enhance the paper's relevance. It would be beneficial to include comparisons of the Jacobian matching loss with the more common method of unrolling dynamics to evaluate performance differences. Finally, we suggest that the authors provide a more comprehensive discussion of the limitations of their approach, particularly regarding the estimation of Jacobians from data without ground truth knowledge. Furthermore, improving the clarity of their methodology and results would enhance understanding for a broader audience, and providing more detailed examples of how dynamical systems and ergodic theory are applied in their analysis would strengthen the paper's contributions.
