Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DIFT, a method for establishing correspondences using pretrained diffusion models without additional training or fine-tuning. The authors propose adding noise to an image to simulate the diffusion process and extracting feature maps from the U-Net of the model. By computing cosine similarities between these feature maps, the authors demonstrate effective semantic, geometric, and temporal correspondences across various tasks. The results indicate that the method outperforms existing approaches, even without task-specific training.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The discovery of emergent correspondences from diffusion models is novel and opens new research avenues.
- The method is simple and yields strong performance on standard benchmarks for semantic, geometric, and temporal correspondence.
- The writing is clear and the results are convincing, showcasing the reliability and flexibility of the features extracted.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks detailed evaluations of runtime and computational complexity, which are crucial for assessing real-world applicability.
- Important implementation details, such as image and feature map sizes, are insufficiently addressed, impacting the reproducibility of results.
- The method's reliance on nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces raises concerns about computational efficiency.
- There is limited introspection into the feature extraction process and how the diffusion model yields effective correspondences.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on runtime and computational complexity to clarify the method's practicality in real-world applications. Additionally, please provide more detailed implementation specifics, including image sizes and feature map dimensions, to enhance reproducibility. We suggest including a comparative analysis with modern baselines and addressing potential limitations of the HPatches dataset for evaluating geometric correspondence. Lastly, consider exploring the extraction of features from multiple layers of the diffusion model to build a feature pyramid, which could enhance the method's performance across various tasks.
