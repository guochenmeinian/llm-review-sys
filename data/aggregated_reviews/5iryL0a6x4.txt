### Key Points
This paper presents MoleCULEs, a method for generating 3D molecular conformers that explicitly minimize predictive uncertainty. The authors assess model performance in predicting drug-target binding and highlight promising future directions, such as protein property prediction. While the current assessment is suitable, additional comparative studies and tasks could enhance the evaluation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well-written, convincingly motivated, and exceeds the workshop's standards, warranting acceptance. 

Weaknesses:  
There is a need for more assessment tasks and comparative studies to strengthen the evaluation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by incorporating additional assessment tasks and conducting comparative studies to enhance the robustness of their findings.
