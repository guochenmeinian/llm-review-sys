Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new benchmark for evaluating Dutch models across nine NLP tasks, including four newly created ones. The authors propose a metric called Relative Error Reduction (RER) to compare model performance against a baseline, BERTje. The study includes a thorough comparison of monolingual and multilingual models, revealing insights into the nature of pre-training that could enhance future performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The benchmark is well-constructed and tested extensively with existing language models, providing valuable insights for future research.
- The paper is well-written, logically structured, and includes meaningful analysis of the tasks and models.
- The inclusion of Abusive Language Detection is significant, as it is absent from existing benchmarks like GLUE.

Weaknesses:
- The rationale for using RER as a comparative metric lacks clarity, particularly regarding its intuitive understanding and what the correlation measures.
- The regression analysis does not adequately explain how the choice of pretraining language influences model performance.
- Some tasks lack clear reporting of accuracy, and there are inconsistencies in task descriptions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the explanation regarding the RER metric and its correlation. Additionally, we suggest providing insights into how the choice of pretraining language impacts performance. It would also be beneficial to ensure that all tasks have clearly reported accuracy and to maintain consistency in task descriptions. Including actual metrics for the BERTje baseline would enhance understanding of the comparative results. Lastly, addressing the typographical and grammatical errors noted in the reviews will improve the overall presentation of the paper.
