Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel task called "Re-identify Any Animal in the Wild" (ReID-AW) aimed at developing a ReID model capable of recognizing any unseen wildlife category. The authors introduce the Wildlife-71 dataset, the first cross-category ReID dataset, which encompasses 71 different wildlife categories and includes over 100K images. They propose a universal re-identification model, UniReID, which utilizes a dynamic prompting mechanism and integrates visual and textual features from large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to enhance adaptability. The authors argue that their approach, while not reliant on large datasets, offers significant social merits in wildlife conservation, particularly in endangered population monitoring and migration pattern analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a new and practical task, expanding the scope of re-identification beyond traditional categories like humans and vehicles.
2. The Wildlife-71 dataset is extensive, surpassing existing ReID datasets in size and includes a diverse range of wildlife categories.
3. The integration of visual and textual features in the proposed model demonstrates innovative use of modern technologies and has potential social implications, particularly in conservation efforts.

Weaknesses:
1. The dataset is criticized for its limited size in terms of unique identities, with only 2,671 identities, raising doubts about its effectiveness for the proposed task.
2. The novelty of the proposed method is questioned, as it appears to rely heavily on existing techniques without offering substantial new insights.
3. Experimental results show only marginal improvements over established methods, indicating insufficient validation of the proposed approach.
4. Concerns remain regarding the usability of the system in real-world scenarios and the effectiveness of LLMs in enhancing the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset by significantly enlarging it, ideally by a factor of 100, to enhance its utility for the ReID task. Additionally, we suggest focusing on developing more novel methodologies rather than relying on established techniques, particularly in the context of the proposed model's architecture. We encourage the authors to conduct more comprehensive experiments, including robust comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and a broader range of test categories, to substantiate their claims of performance improvements. Furthermore, clarifying the process for generating category-specific prompts for unseen IDs would strengthen the methodological rigor of the paper. Addressing the concerns about the usability of the ReID-AW task in realistic settings, particularly regarding the variability of animal appearances over time, would enhance the paper's impact. Lastly, providing insights into the computational complexity of the proposed method and its practical applications would further improve the overall contribution of the research.
