Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents OptGNN, a graph neural network architecture designed to capture optimal approximation algorithms for various combinatorial optimization problems, including Max-Cut and Max-3-SAT. The authors establish that polynomial-sized message-passing GNNs can replicate the optimal approximation capabilities of traditional algorithms based on semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations under the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC). The framework provides provable bounds on optimal solutions and demonstrates effectiveness through empirical studies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written, with clear motivation and a strong theoretical basis.
2. OptGNN represents a significant innovation, effectively integrating message-passing updates with SDP relaxations to yield high-quality approximate solutions.
3. Extensive evaluations, including out-of-distribution tests and ablation studies, validate the robustness of OptGNN.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a comprehensive analysis of how well OptGNN scales with increasing graph sizes and complexity.
2. The theoretical guarantees depend on the unproven UGC, which may limit the certainty of the results.
3. There are multiple typos and inconsistent notations that detract from the writing quality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing by addressing typos and inconsistencies in notation. Additionally, we suggest providing a detailed analysis of OptGNN's scalability with larger graphs and more complex problems, including practical limitations regarding computational resources. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the adaptability of OptGNN to new combinatorial optimization problems and to discuss potential future research directions.
