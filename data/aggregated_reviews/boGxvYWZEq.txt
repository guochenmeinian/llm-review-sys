Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Regression-based Analytic Incremental Learning (RAIL), which employs a recursive ridge regression-based adapter to learn from a sequence of domains while preventing forgetting. It introduces the Cross-domain Task-Agnostic Incremental Learning (X-TAIL) setting, allowing evaluation on both seen and unseen domains without domain identity hints. The authors theoretically prove RAILâ€™s absolute memorization capabilities and demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance in both X-TAIL and Multi-domain Task-Incremental Learning (MTIL) settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of the X-TAIL setting is a significant contribution, addressing the limitations of existing methods that rely on domain information.
2. RAIL's use of traditional machine learning techniques for continual learning is innovative, and its ability to mitigate the forgetting problem is noteworthy.
3. The paper is generally well-structured and easy to follow, with clear figures and equations that enhance understanding.

Weaknesses:
1. The omission of the CIFAR-100 dataset raises questions about the method's performance on this benchmark.
2. The reliance on learned class labels for identifying out-of-distribution samples may lead to label leakage.
3. Some parts of the paper, particularly the introduction and explanations of the proposed method, lack clarity, making it difficult for readers to grasp the concepts without consulting the appendix.
4. The evaluation of the proposed method on few-shot settings in MTIL is insufficient, as it has not been tested on the full data setting.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction and provide more illustrative figures to aid reader comprehension. Additionally, the authors should address the missing CIFAR-100 dataset in their benchmarks and clarify the rationale behind its exclusion. To enhance the robustness of their findings, we suggest evaluating the proposed method on the full data setting as done in previous works. Furthermore, a detailed comparison of the primal and dual forms of ridge regression, including their performance differences and computational complexities, should be included to provide a comprehensive understanding of their advantages and disadvantages.
