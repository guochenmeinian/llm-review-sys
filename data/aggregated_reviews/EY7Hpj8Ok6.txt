Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the context-lumpable bandit problem, where $S$ contexts and $K$ actions can be grouped into $r \leq \min\{S,K\}$ partitions with identical mean rewards for actions within the same group. The authors propose algorithms for learning an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy and minimizing regret, achieving sample complexity bounds of $\tilde{O}(r(S+K)/\varepsilon^2)$ and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{r^3(S+K)T})$, respectively. The results are claimed to be more general than prior work, accommodating arbitrary context distributions and contextual low-rank bandits.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The results provide significant contributions and improve upon prior work.
2. The paper employs a careful adoption of multiple techniques and presents interesting ideas.
3. A thorough overview of similar problems in the literature contextualizes the work, justifying its originality.
4. The techniques used in algorithm design and analysis are nontrivial and of independent interest.

Weaknesses:
1. The significance of the results is unclear given the existing literature on contextual multi-armed bandits (CMAB), particularly regarding the tight regret bounds under minimal assumptions.
2. The assumption that contexts can be lumped into $r$ groups is unrealistic in practice, as $r$ is typically unknown.
3. The practicality and efficiency of the algorithm lack validation through experiments, particularly in identifying lumped groups for near-optimal arms.
4. The paper primarily addresses stochastic contexts, while adversarial contexts are more common in practice.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review to include a discussion of existing results, particularly those in [1], to clarify the significance of their findings. Additionally, the authors should consider providing examples of known $r$ and explore ways to relax the assumption of its knowledge. We suggest conducting experiments to validate the practicality and efficiency of the proposed algorithm, demonstrating its ability to identify correct lumped groups for near-optimal arms. Finally, addressing the potential for a gap-dependent regret bound in the context of their algorithm would enhance the paper's contributions.
