Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework, DiffVL, for soft-body manipulation that integrates a user-friendly GUI for task specification with a large language model (LLM) to translate natural language instructions into optimization programs. The authors propose using human annotations to define sub-goal states within task videos, thereby generating a rich learning signal for manipulation tasks. The study evaluates its effectiveness across six fundamental deformable object manipulation skills and introduces a dataset, SoftVL100, containing 100 diverse tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The innovative use of natural language for task specification lowers the barrier for annotation and enhances accessibility for non-expert users.
- The combination of LLM and differentiable physics presents a significant advancement in tackling complex long-horizon tasks.
- The paper is well-organized and clearly presented, with a thorough experimental section, including an ablation study.

Weaknesses:
- The approach requires substantial human input for task annotation, which may limit scalability and flexibility in handling unseen states.
- There is a lack of evaluation on the robustness of trajectory generation and no discussion of failure cases, particularly those related to LLM translation.
- Some citations are missing, and there are typographical errors, such as "smapling" instead of "sampling."

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation section by conducting more comprehensive tests to validate the robustness of trajectory generation and to include discussions on failure cases. Additionally, providing more details on the initial trajectory calculation and refinement process would enhance clarity. It would also be beneficial to include more snapshots of the rollouts to illustrate the differences between initial and final trajectories. Lastly, addressing the limitations regarding the reliance on human annotations and exploring potential automation in the annotation process could strengthen the paper's contributions.
