Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the transferability of unlearnable examples (UEs) across supervised and self-supervised contrastive learning paradigms. The authors propose two methods, AUE (Augmented Unlearnable Examples) and AAP (Augmented Adversarial Poisoning), which utilize strong data augmentations to achieve unsupervised unlearnability. The proposed methods demonstrate efficiency and effectiveness across various datasets, outperforming existing techniques in achieving worst-case unlearnability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed methods are more efficient than existing contrastive learning approaches involving UE generation, leveraging supervised learning with strong data augmentation.
- The simplicity and effectiveness of the methods are notable, particularly the finding that strong data augmentation is crucial for contrastive learning.
- Comprehensive experiments validate the capability and efficiency of the proposed attacks.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the findings is diminished as alignment and uniformity metrics are derived from existing works, and the proposed methods do not significantly address these gaps.
- The technical contributions appear limited, lacking a systematic exploration of data augmentation's potential.
- The performance differences between AUE and AAP across low- and high-resolution datasets raise questions about the relationship between adversarial training and contrastive learning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their findings by exploring the implications of alignment and uniformity metrics more deeply. Additionally, a more systematic investigation into the power of data augmentation is necessary to enhance the technical contributions of the paper. We suggest conducting ablation studies to clarify the differences between supervised and contrastive unlearnable examples and to provide a theoretical analysis of the effectiveness of data augmentation across various scenarios. Finally, addressing the brittleness of the proposed methods under diffusion-based purification would strengthen their practical applicability.
