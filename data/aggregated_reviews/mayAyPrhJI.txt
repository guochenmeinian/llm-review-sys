Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new method, ReinMax, for approximating gradients of parameters in generating discrete random variables, specifically focusing on the multinomial softmax parameterization. The authors establish that the straight-through (ST) estimator serves as a first-order approximation of the true gradient and propose ReinMax as a second-order approximation using Heun's method, which avoids the need for calculating second-order derivatives. The empirical evaluation demonstrates that ReinMax outperforms existing methods such as Straight-Through Gumbel-Softmax and Gumbel-Rao Monte Carlo across various tasks, including polynomial programming and generative modeling. Additionally, the paper formally establishes the ST estimator as a first-order approximation in the general multinomial case and adheres to the experimental design of existing studies, focusing on small-scale problems for controllability and resource efficiency while including results from a real-world application to showcase ReinMax's potential.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The theoretical analysis is well-articulated, providing a novel perspective on the ST estimator and its relation to first-order approximations.
- ReinMax shows significant performance improvements with minimal computational overhead, validated through comprehensive experiments across different application domains.
- The formal establishment of the ST estimator as a first-order approximation is a significant contribution.
- Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of ReinMax, demonstrating improvements over existing methods.
- The paper is well-organized, with clear mathematical formulations and a thorough background.

Weaknesses:
- The derivation of key equations, particularly Equation (6), lacks clarity and may not be valid as presented. The authors should clarify the vanishing term and the derivation process.
- The design choices behind ReinMax, especially the mixing of $\pi$ and $D$ in Equation (7), are not well-explained, leading to potential confusion.
- The empirical evaluation primarily focuses on toy problems, raising questions about the applicability of ReinMax in more complex, real-world scenarios.
- The focus on small-scale problems may limit the generalizability of the findings.
- Clarity and presentation could be enhanced in the final version.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the derivations, particularly for Equation (6) and the rationale behind the design choices in ReinMax. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the clarity and presentation of the paper in the final version, utilizing the extra space available to improve understanding. Expanding the empirical evaluation to include more complex datasets and real-world applications would strengthen the paper's contributions and address limitations related to the focus on small-scale problems. It would also be beneficial to provide a clearer discussion on the limitations of the proposed method, including its applicability to other parameterizations beyond the softmax. Lastly, we suggest including an explanation of the method's name, "ReinMax," to enhance reader understanding.
