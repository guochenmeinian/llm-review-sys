Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for low-level vision tasks, including denoising, object removal, frame interpolation, and super-resolution, that operates without requiring external training data. The authors propose a method that optimizes neural network modules using the internal statistics of videos at test-time. The VDP model, which includes a frame encoder and decoder, utilizes a combination of reconstruction loss, a novel spatial pyramid loss, and a variational loss to enhance video quality. The framework is evaluated on multiple datasets, demonstrating competitive performance against existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed framework is intuitive and eliminates the need for training data, making it practical for various video enhancement tasks.
2. Extensive evaluations across multiple tasks provide strong evidence for the generality and effectiveness of the approach.
3. The paper is well-structured and easy to read, with clear experimental results supporting the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
1. The framework lacks novelty, as similar concepts have been explored in prior works, and the loss functions used are not original.
2. The experimental setup is weak, with limited quantitative metrics (only PSNR and SSIM) that may not align with human perceptions of quality, and the choice of tasks may not optimally showcase the framework's strengths.
3. The model's performance is dependent on the specific video content, raising concerns about generalization and the potential for cherry-picked results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their work by incorporating more original loss functions or methodologies. Additionally, the authors should enhance the experimental evaluation by including a broader range of quantitative metrics, such as FID, IS, and LPIPS, and consider user studies to better assess perceptual quality. It would also be beneficial to include comparisons with strong pretrained generative models to substantiate the claims regarding the external data-free paradigm. Finally, addressing the limitations related to the model's performance on complex video dynamics and high-resolution content would strengthen the paper.
