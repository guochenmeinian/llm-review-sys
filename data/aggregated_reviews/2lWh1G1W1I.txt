Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DOSTransformer, a transformer architecture designed for predicting the density of states (DOS) of crystalline materials by incorporating energy levels as an input modality. The model utilizes cross-attention layers to connect material and energy representations and introduces learnable prompts to capture structure-specific interactions. Experimental results indicate that DOSTransformer outperforms existing methods like graph networks and E3NN across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach innovatively formulates DOS prediction as a multi-modal learning problem, enhancing performance compared to prior models that focus solely on material inputs.
- The architecture is well-designed, effectively leveraging cross-attention and prompt-guided self-attention to capture complex relationships.
- Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate the model's effectiveness, supported by ablation studies that highlight the contributions of various components.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty is somewhat limited, with a core ablation study missing; the major innovation of using energy levels as input lacks robust performance validation against existing methods.
- Comparisons with previous crystal neural networks are absent, which undermines the argument for the proposed method's significance.
- The datasets used for experiments are simplistic, limiting the evaluation of the method's potential on more complex, realistic applications.
- The prompt-based method's comparison with one-hot encoding raises concerns about fairness, and the analysis of learned prompts is insufficient to establish their physical relevance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of the work by including a comprehensive ablation study that validates the performance of using energy levels as input against existing methods. Additionally, we suggest incorporating comparisons with established crystal neural networks to better demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach. Expanding the datasets to include a wider variety of material types and structures would enhance the evaluation of the method's applicability. Furthermore, clarifying the implementation details regarding the irreducible representations used in E3NN and addressing the fairness of the prompt versus one-hot encoding comparison would strengthen the paper. Lastly, providing more context on the implications of DOS predictions for downstream applications would benefit a broader audience.
