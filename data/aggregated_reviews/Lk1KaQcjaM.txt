### Key Points
This paper presents a benchmark for anomaly detection in natural language processing (NLP), incorporating four existing datasets and three newly proposed ones. The authors categorize anomaly detection into four aspects: Syntactic, Semantic, Pragmatic, and Stylistic, and evaluate various methods on these datasets. The study aims to address existing challenges in anomaly detection by providing a comprehensive suite of datasets and evaluation metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The establishment of a new benchmark and the introduction of three new datasets demonstrate significant contributions to the field.
- The paper is well-written and aligns with the conference theme, showcasing considerable research effort.
- The inclusive approach to covering various linguistic levels enhances understanding of anomaly detection in NLP.

Weaknesses:
- The effectiveness of the proposed model is questionable due to the limited number of datasets for certain aspects, particularly Stylistic.
- Methodological weaknesses exist, such as the inappropriate use of user-defined parameters in benchmarking unsupervised methods.
- The evaluation metrics are not comprehensive, and the performance of some methods lacks clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the necessity of the new datasets and clarify their advantages over existing datasets. Additionally, it is crucial to specify the text representation techniques used in anomaly detection, as this significantly impacts performance. The authors should also address the anomaly ratio in the datasets and provide a more comprehensive evaluation by including additional metrics beyond AUROC, such as F1 score. Lastly, we suggest enhancing the presentation of results in the main paper rather than relegating them to the appendix, and ensuring that hyperparameter choices for neural network methods are clearly explained.
