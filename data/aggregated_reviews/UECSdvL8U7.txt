### Key Points
This paper presents an extensive evaluation of intrinsic and extrinsic bias in vision and language (V&L) models, examining the effectiveness of fine-tuning on gender-neutral data. The findings indicate that V&L models exhibit bias, with no clear causal link between intrinsic and extrinsic bias. Additionally, gender-neutral fine-tuning can enhance fairness. The study is notable for investigating whether biases in pretrained models transfer to downstream applications and for analyzing the impact of additional pretraining on gender-neutral data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, easy to follow, and provides a comprehensive literature review.
- It introduces and clearly defines intrinsic and extrinsic biases, offering valuable insights through case studies of three V&L models.
- The experimental design is robust, with clear communication of results supporting the authors' claims.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the paper is questionable, as it does not introduce new bias metrics or mitigation methods.
- Several important notations lack clarity, particularly in sections discussing intrinsic bias and bias amplification.
- The paper does not sufficiently discuss the reasons behind the observed benefits of additional pretraining on gender-neutral data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of notations, particularly the definitions of g_i and T in the relevant sections. Additionally, we encourage the authors to expand the discussion on the reasons for the benefits of extra pretraining steps on gender-neutral data. Furthermore, addressing the limitation of focusing solely on gender bias and considering intersectionality in bias research would strengthen the paper. Lastly, we suggest revising the terminology in the abstract regarding the "causal link" to more accurately reflect the independence of intrinsic and extrinsic biases.
