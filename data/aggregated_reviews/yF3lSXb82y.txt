### Key Points
This paper studies the representation degeneration problem in cross-modal retrieval and proposes a method called INVGC, which effectively separates representations by increasing distances between data points. The authors also introduce an advanced graph topology structure, LOCALADJ, to enhance the method's efficiency. Extensive empirical results validate the effectiveness of INVGC and LOCALADJ in improving retrieval performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper extends the representation degeneration problem into the cross-modal retrieval context, addressing an important and practical issue.
- The proposed method is simple yet effective, as demonstrated by experimental results.
- The overall structure is clear, and the motivation is well-articulated.
- Solid experiments, including thorough ablation studies, support the claims made.

Weaknesses:
- The mathematical notations are confusing, with inconsistencies in the use of symbols, such as $n$ referring to different concepts in various sections.
- The theoretical framework has flaws, particularly regarding the interpretation of the $\delta_{deg}$ score and its implications for retrieval performance.
- The experimental details are insufficiently explained, including the parameter search range and model selection process.
- The practicality of the experimental setting needs further clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of mathematical notations to avoid confusion, ensuring consistent definitions throughout the paper. Additionally, we suggest revising the theoretical framework to address the counterintuitive aspects of the $\delta_{deg}$ score. The authors should provide more detailed explanations of the experimental setup, including parameter search ranges and model selection criteria. Finally, clarifying the practicality of the experimental setting will enhance the paper's overall impact.
