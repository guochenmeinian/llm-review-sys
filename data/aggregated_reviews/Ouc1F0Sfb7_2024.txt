### Key Points
This paper presents the Pandora's Box Gittins Index (PBGI), a cost-aware acquisition function that connects cost-aware Bayesian Optimization (BO) with the Pandora's Box problem. The authors provide theoretical justifications and empirical results demonstrating PBGI's competitive performance against traditional acquisition functions. The work addresses both budget-constrained and cost-per-sample optimization scenarios, highlighting the relevance of cost-aware approaches in practical applications. Additionally, the authors propose a method for automatically tuning the parameter $\lambda$ in Bayesian optimization settings where evaluating the true objective function is computationally expensive. This tuning scheme involves running Bayesian regret experiments across a range of geometrically spread $\lambda$ values to identify the optimal $\lambda$ for the desired budget. The authors clarify the complexities of handling noisy observations, suggesting that this topic is better suited for future work. They also discuss the use of the EIPC algorithm within the BoTorch framework, addressing its theoretical limitations and empirical performance, while emphasizing the importance of discussing the strengths and weaknesses of baseline algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The connection between cost-aware BO and the Pandora's Box problem is innovative and insightful.
- The proposed tuning method for $\lambda$ is theoretically principled and addresses a significant computational bottleneck.
- The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of complex concepts, particularly in sections 3.1 and 3.2.
- The authors provide a clear rationale for their normalization approach, enhancing the applicability of their algorithm across different problems.
- The experimental evaluation covers a diverse range of tasks, showcasing the robustness of the proposed method.
- The authors offer detailed responses to reviewer comments, indicating a willingness to improve clarity and presentation.

Weaknesses:
- The justification for the algorithm's effectiveness is insufficiently discussed, particularly regarding the impact of the cost function's posterior dynamics.
- The treatment of unknown costs and their implications for consistency is not sufficiently clear, raising concerns about the assumptions made.
- The arbitrary fixation of hyperparameters such as the lengthscale $\kappa$, $\lambda$, and $\beta$ weakens the experimental results and their interpretability.
- The experimental design lacks consideration of straightforward solutions for making UCB and TS cost-aware, which could mislead readers regarding the state of the art.
- The experiments are conducted in a noiseless setting, which may not reflect real-world scenarios where noise is prevalent.
- The claim of EIPC's widespread use lacks empirical support, leading to suggestions for its removal from the manuscript.
- Some figures and their captions do not adequately convey the necessary details, which could confuse readers.
- The justification for the term "dynamic" in the decay parameter lacks clarity, and the empirical evidence for tuning parameters is considered insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the algorithm's justification, particularly addressing how the cost function's posterior dynamics may affect performance. Additionally, we suggest improving the clarity of their assumptions regarding unknown costs, particularly how they relate to the consistency of the algorithm. Conducting an ablation study to explore the relationship between the lengthscale $\kappa$ and the dimensionality of the function domain would strengthen the contribution. We recommend providing a principled method for calibrating the parameters $\lambda$ and $\beta$, as this is crucial for the practical application of PBGI. Furthermore, evaluating PBGI in a noisy setting would enhance the robustness of the findings and applicability to real-world problems. We also suggest including discussions on straightforward cost-aware adaptations of UCB and TS in both the discussion and experiments to avoid potential misinterpretations. To strengthen their claims regarding the advantages of tuning $\lambda$, we encourage the authors to provide more comprehensive numerical evidence, including confidence intervals. Lastly, we advise the authors to consider removing the statement about EIPC's widespread use if they cannot substantiate it with empirical data, and to improve the clarity of figure captions by explicitly indicating where detailed descriptions can be found.
