### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of code-switching corpora, focusing on the representativeness of training and evaluation data. The authors define "representativeness" across various dimensions, including location, domain, register, socio-demographics, and data selection/filtering. They critically survey existing practices in code-switching research, highlighting the shortcomings in data collection and preparation. The paper also includes empirical results on location-based variation and proposes a checklist for future dataset development.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an important issue regarding the unrepresentative nature of current code-switching datasets.
- It provides a comprehensive overview of existing practices and a concrete checklist for improving future data collection.
- The authors define "representativeness" in a nuanced manner, supported by relevant sources.

Weaknesses:
- Many claims lack sufficient empirical evidence and analysis, particularly regarding the impact of representativeness on system performance.
- The paper's structure is disjointed, making it difficult to follow the central argument and contributions.
- There is limited context provided on language coverage and the needs of multilingual users.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical support for their main claims, particularly regarding the relationship between representativeness and system performance. More nuanced conclusions should be drawn, controlling for other factors influencing performance. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the paper's structure to better delineate its contributions and arguments, possibly by clearly listing the contributions in the introduction and differentiating sections more effectively. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide more context on the needs and preferences of multilingual users to strengthen their argument for the necessity of representative datasets.
