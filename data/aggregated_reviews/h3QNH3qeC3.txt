Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for generating controllable images with multiple subjects by learning a residual token embedding to customize subject representations. It utilizes a layout prior for spatial guidance in subject arrangement, demonstrating effectiveness across various experimental settings. The authors propose a text-embedding preservation loss to facilitate the combination of subject tokens, addressing issues of object neglect and attribute confusion in multi-subject generation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method effectively generates customized subjects using a simple and efficient residual token embedding approach.
- The text-embedding preservation loss is a notable design that enhances the combinability of multiple subject tokens.
- Layout guidance provides fine-grained control over subject arrangement, improving scalability and reducing conflicts.

Weaknesses:
- The maximum number of subjects handled is limited to six, raising questions about performance with more subjects.
- The reliance on predefined layouts may render comparisons with existing methods unfair, as those methods do not use such layouts.
- The absence of quantitative results for ablation studies and clarity on the term controlling the text-embedding-preservation loss is concerning.
- The paper lacks a thorough exploration of limitations, particularly regarding the potential societal impact of generated content.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how layouts are integrated into the model, particularly during denoising steps. Additionally, the authors should provide quantitative results for the ablation studies and discuss the limitations of their method more comprehensively, including the societal implications of customizable image generation. It would also be beneficial to clarify the baseline used in experiments and ensure consistency in the presentation of results, particularly in figures.
