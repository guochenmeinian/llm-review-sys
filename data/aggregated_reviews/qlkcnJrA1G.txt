### Key Points
This paper presents Pontus, a sketch-based system aimed at efficiently detecting persistent items in high-speed data streams. The authors propose a novel persistence tracking strategy utilizing a flag-based design (arrival flag $F$ and collision decay flag $R$) to enhance accuracy and memory efficiency while minimizing hash collision impacts. Experimental results across various datasets validate the method's effectiveness, demonstrating its applicability in web security and management contexts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The problem addressed is significant for network security and system performance optimization.  
- The manuscript is well-organized, clearly written, and includes extensive experimental validation.  
- The proposed method optimizes the sketch data structure and updating mechanism, showing high effectiveness across different metrics and datasets.  

Weaknesses:  
- The initialization process in Algorithm 1 is confusing; $P$ and $K$ should be initialized once for all windows, while $F$ and $R$ flags need updates at each window's start.  
- The impact of parameters like the number of rows $d$ and fingerprint length on performance is not sufficiently analyzed.  
- The evaluation lacks comparisons with baselines such as LTC and PISketch for a comprehensive performance assessment.  
- The paper does not adequately discuss potential application scenarios in the web field or limitations of the proposed algorithms.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Algorithm 1 by clearly defining the initialization process for $P$, $K$, $F$, and $R$. Additionally, providing an experimental analysis of the influence of parameters like $d$ and fingerprint length would enhance the paper's depth. Including comparisons with LTC and PISketch as baselines would offer a more comprehensive evaluation. Furthermore, we suggest discussing potential application scenarios in web contexts and addressing the limitations of the proposed algorithms to strengthen the manuscript.
