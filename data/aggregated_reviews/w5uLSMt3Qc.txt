### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the usefulness of super-resolution (SR) for gaze estimation, demonstrating that certain SR models enhance gaze estimation performance. The authors propose a novel method for appearance-based gaze estimation by training a lightweight gaze estimation model on a super-resolution backbone, which significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) while requiring less training data. The methodology is well explained, with clear details on experiments, datasets, and configurations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well written, structured, and clear.
- The exploration of SR for gaze estimation is interesting, with thorough evaluation and control for confounding factors.
- The methodology is well supported by comparative experiments achieving SOTA results.

Weaknesses:
- The comparison is limited to only two SR models, which could be expanded.
- Performance numbers are only provided for 20% of the data, lacking broader context.
- Some background information in the methodology section is unnecessary and detracts from the focus.
- Limitations of the study and potential future directions are not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison by including more than two super-resolution models. Additionally, providing performance numbers for a larger dataset would enhance the analysis. Including a figure to illustrate the proposed approach would aid reader comprehension. The authors should also clarify the definition of “small portion” in the caption of Table 5. Furthermore, we suggest adding a section on the limitations of the study and a more extensive description of potential future directions. Lastly, consider removing extraneous background information from the methodology section to maintain focus.
