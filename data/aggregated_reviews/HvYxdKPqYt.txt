### Key Points
This paper presents a plug-and-play detection-and-reasoning module for Chinese spelling check (CSC), named DR-CSC. The authors decompose the CSC workflow into three subtasks: detection, reasoning, and searching, which allows for the integration of external knowledge and enhances interpretability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of the proposed module, which is compatible with existing non-autoregressive CSC models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The decomposition of the CSC task into three subtasks improves interpretability and allows for the incorporation of external knowledge.
- The method section is well-articulated and clear, and the experimental analysis is sufficient and convincing.
- The proposed DR-CSC module shows good potential in enhancing the performance of existing models.

Weaknesses:
- The purpose of Figures 1 and 2 is unclear, leading to confusion regarding the CSC task and the roles of various elements.
- The improvements observed in experiments are not significant, and the scope of errors addressed is limited to phonological and morphological errors.
- The analysis of the three subtasks is overly simplistic, and the portrayal of the "multi-task" aspect lacks clarity.
- The proposed plug-and-play feature may not function effectively with pure PLMs, raising questions about its practical utility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Figures 1 and 2 by providing explicit explanations of the icons, colors, and their roles in the CSC task. Additionally, we suggest conducting further experiments with a broader range of datasets to validate the effectiveness of the DR-CSC module. The authors should also consider providing a more detailed analysis of the three subtasks to better understand the reasons for improvements and potential areas for enhancement. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore the application of their method in low-resource scenarios and to clarify the implications of using multi-task learning versus a pipeline approach.
