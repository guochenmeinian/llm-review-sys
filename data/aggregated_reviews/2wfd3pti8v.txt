Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for estimating efficient influence functions, termed Monte Carlo Efficient Influence Functions (MC-EIF), which operates under mild assumptions. The authors propose that MC-EIF simplifies statistical estimation for high-dimensional models, achieving optimal convergence rates and consistency without complex manual derivations. The method is validated through both theoretical and empirical results, demonstrating its applicability within probabilistic programming workflows.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well-written, with a clear motivation and sound theoretical results. The convergence results are convincing, and the method is flexible, allowing for easy integration with existing efficient estimators. The authors provide a non-asymptotic error bound and demonstrate that MC-EIF outperforms existing methods without sacrificing accuracy.

Weaknesses:  
The notation is unclear, particularly in the Problem Statement where P and Q are used interchangeably. The assumptions, especially 3.1-3.3, lack interpretability and discussion, which detracts from the practical applicability of the method. Additionally, the time cost of the method in high-dimensional settings is not adequately addressed, and some experimental settings are not clearly specified.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of notation, particularly in the Problem Statement, to avoid confusion between P and Q. A discussion of the assumptions, especially regarding their interpretability and implications, would strengthen the paper. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors include a comparison of the time cost of their method against existing approaches, particularly in high-dimensional scenarios. Additionally, providing clearer details on experimental settings, such as the values of $D$, $p$, and $F$, would enhance the reproducibility of the results. Finally, we encourage the authors to incorporate real data experiments to validate the applicability of their method beyond synthetic datasets.
