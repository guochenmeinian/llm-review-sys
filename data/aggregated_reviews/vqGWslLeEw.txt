Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, ReBRAC, which integrates various design elements from existing methods like TD3+BC and BRAC. The authors focus on hyper-parameter choices such as network layers, LayerNorm, batch size, and discount factor, conducting extensive experiments to demonstrate the method's strong empirical performance across 51 datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on D4RL and V-D4RL benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper features comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, providing valuable insights into the impact of different design choices.
- ReBRAC demonstrates strong empirical performance and is well-structured, making it easy to read.
- The work contributes to the offline RL community by revisiting and enhancing a minimalist baseline method.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the proposed method is limited, as it primarily combines existing techniques without introducing significant new insights.
- Some assertions regarding technical details of BRAC are incorrect, and the marginal improvements from certain components, like the critic penalty, raise questions about their contributions.
- The paper lacks detailed analyses of the added components and their specific impacts on performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their contribution by providing deeper analyses of the design elements rather than merely presenting them. Additionally, clarifying the differences between ReBRAC and existing methods, such as SAC-RND, would enhance the paper's clarity. We also suggest including tuning logs for baseline methods and providing comparisons under a unified set of hyperparameters to address concerns regarding the tuning effort. Lastly, addressing the missing implementation details for vision-based tasks and correcting any inaccuracies related to BRAC would strengthen the manuscript.
