Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an empirical study of self-supervised learning (SSL) focusing on the clustering characteristics of SSL representations. The authors analyze how these representations cluster based on sample, class, and super-class labels, particularly using the VicReg method on the CIFAR-100 dataset. The findings indicate that SSL representations exhibit clustering properties related to various label hierarchies, primarily influenced by the regularization term in VicReg. Additionally, the paper includes an extensive evaluation of various SSL methods across multiple datasets, notably the ImageNet dataset, and reveals strong clustering behavior as training progresses. The results support the authors' hypotheses that SSL methods significantly enhance the clustering process.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and organized, making it easy to follow.
- It addresses an important problem in understanding SSL representations and provides both qualitative and quantitative results.
- The inclusion of the ImageNet dataset and various SSL methods strengthens the manuscript's contributions and relevance to the field.
- The authors provide specific numerical results for different SSL methods, demonstrating their effectiveness.
- The empirical observations support the claim that SSL functions as a clustering algorithm for feature space.

Weaknesses:
- The originality of the work is limited as similar analyses have been previously explored, reducing its novelty.
- The experimental setup is narrow, focusing solely on VicReg and the CIFAR-100 dataset, which does not adequately reflect the broader SSL landscape.
- The paper lacks comparisons with other SSL methods and datasets, particularly the widely used ImageNet, which diminishes the significance of its findings.
- The inability to share visual representations of results during the review process limits the clarity of findings.
- Some reviewers express concerns about the complexity of the task with more classes, which could affect the interpretation of results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the breadth of their experimental evaluation by including additional SSL methods and datasets, particularly ImageNet, to enhance the generalizability of their conclusions. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors clarify their claims regarding the invariance loss and its implications across different SSL methods. To strengthen the paper's contributions, consider discussing the relevance of findings to a wider range of SSL techniques beyond VicReg. Additionally, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their findings by including visual representations of results in the final version of the paper. Lastly, we suggest measuring the NCC of a backbone trained on Flowers and tested on Flowers, compared to a backbone trained on ImageNet, to explore the impact of better features on NCC performance, which could provide valuable insights into the relationship between dataset size and feature expressivity.
