### Key Points
This paper presents a novel mechanism for detecting word boundaries using connectionist temporal classification (CTC) predictions, aimed at addressing the length mismatch in speech-to-text translation. The authors propose a boundary predictor that assigns probabilities to speech representations, which are then utilized in a weighted shrinking process. The AdaTranS method is introduced as a direct approach to boundary prediction, improving performance and inference speed compared to existing techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method effectively addresses the speech-text modality gap and demonstrates superior performance on the MUST-C dataset.
- The paper is well-written and clearly motivated, making it accessible to readers.
- The architecture offers faster inference and lower memory usage compared to alternative methods.

Weaknesses:
- The innovation appears limited, with insufficient explanation of certain experimental phenomena, such as the benefits of closer lengths between speech and text representations.
- Important references to related work are missing, which hinders proper contextualization within the existing literature.
- The experimental settings and comparisons to state-of-the-art methods lack clarity and completeness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by including relevant references, such as Zhang et al. (2023) and Le et al. (2023), to better position their work. Additionally, clarifying the experimental settings, particularly regarding the ablation study and the incorporation of alignment objectives, would enhance the paper's rigor. We also suggest addressing the questions raised about the accuracy of the boundary predictions and the potential benefits of using pre-trained forced aligners. Finally, providing a more detailed explanation of the relationship between speech and text representation lengths would strengthen the theoretical foundation of the work.
