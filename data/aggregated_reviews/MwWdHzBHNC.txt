### Key Points
This paper presents a fine-tuning game model that captures the interactions between a general-purpose technology producer and domain specialists. It explores a two-stage process where players negotiate revenue sharing based on technology development and subsequently contribute to the technology's performance. The authors characterize various bargaining solutions under different objectives, particularly focusing on the implications of a unimodal utility function and polynomial cost functions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a significant and relevant area in AI technology adaptation, providing an interesting economic model for understanding the dynamics between generalists and specialists.  
- It is well-written and clear, making complex concepts accessible to a broad audience.  
- The originality of the approach fills a gap in existing literature by applying game theory to the fine-tuning of AI models.

Weaknesses:  
- The model's assumptions, particularly regarding linear revenue and polynomial cost functions, raise questions about its generality and sensitivity.  
- The paper lacks substantive insights and an extensive literature review on bargaining games, which could strengthen its theoretical foundation.  
- Some aspects of the model, such as the rationale for certain outcomes and the categorization of strategies, require further clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the characterization of cost functions that lead to unimodal utility and provide intuition on why maximizing technology performance results in a single agent's involvement in the development process. Additionally, addressing the assumption that both parties receive zero revenue in disagreement scenarios would enhance the model's realism. Clarifying the categorization of strategies, particularly regarding the dominance of contributor/free-rider roles over abstainers, is also necessary. Finally, including a more comprehensive literature review on bargaining games and exploring multi-round game scenarios could enrich the paper's contributions.
