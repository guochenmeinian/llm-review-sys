### Key Points
This paper presents "shapiq," an open-source Python package designed to compute Shapley Values (SVs) and Shapley Interactions (SIs) efficiently. The package consolidates state-of-the-art algorithms and offers an application-agnostic framework, including a benchmarking suite for evaluating SIs across 11 machine-learning applications. It supports various models and facilitates the explanation and visualization of feature interactions, aiming to extend the use of SVs and SIs in machine learning beyond traditional feature attributions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The package consolidates various state-of-the-art algorithms for computing SVs and SIs, making it a versatile tool for researchers and practitioners.
- The inclusion of a benchmarking suite with pre-computed games and ground-truth values allows for meaningful comparisons across different SI algorithms.
- The paper is well-written, presenting its motivation, methodology, and findings clearly.

Weaknesses:
- Figure 4 lacks detailed annotations and interpretations.
- The focus of the paper is primarily on feature interactions, which may overshadow other potential use cases for Shapley values, such as data valuation.
- Some sections, particularly dataset descriptions and model configurations, could benefit from additional detail for enhanced clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and focus of the paper by emphasizing the specific contributions of the library design and unification. Consider reorganizing the manuscript to shorten Section 2 and move more theoretical background to the appendix. Additionally, we suggest providing more detailed annotations for Figure 4 and clarifying the meaning of 'size' and 'order.' It may also be beneficial to explore the implications of the approximators on the properties of the Shapley value and to incorporate relevant considerations from related works, such as Zhou et al. (2023). Finally, enhancing the documentation with tutorials and improving parallelization could further benefit the package's usability.
