Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a differentiable clustering method based on minimum-weight spanning forests, integrating a novel partial Fenchel-Young loss to optimize clustering assignments. The authors demonstrate the method's effectiveness on various datasets in both supervised and semi-supervised settings, addressing challenges in learning through clustering. The approach allows for end-to-end training by smoothing the combinatorial clustering operation through stochastic perturbations, enabling gradient backpropagation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method effectively addresses the challenge of learning through clustering, demonstrating soundness and applicability in diverse scenarios.
- The introduction of a partial Fenchel-Young loss is a novel contribution, enhancing the theoretical framework.
- The paper is well-written, providing clear definitions and explanations that facilitate understanding.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental evaluation is limited to small-scale datasets like MNIST, raising concerns about scalability to larger datasets.
- Comparisons with state-of-the-art nondifferentiable clustering methods are lacking, making it unclear how the proposed method performs relative to existing approaches.
- The paper does not sufficiently clarify the settings for $M_\Omega$, which could aid readers in understanding the tasks better.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental evaluation by including larger and more complex datasets, such as CIFAR-10 or ImageNet, to better demonstrate the method's scalability and effectiveness. Additionally, we suggest providing a quantitative comparison with traditional clustering methods to highlight the advantages of the proposed approach. Clarifying the settings and generation of $M_\Omega$ in the experiments would enhance reader comprehension. Finally, we advise using standard terminology for matrices, such as "partition matrix" instead of "cluster membership matrix," to align with established conventions in the field.
