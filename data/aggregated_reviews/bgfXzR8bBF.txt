### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Representative Items Sampling Framework for Critiquing on Knowledge Graph Recommendation (RISC) and proposes a Weight Experience Replay (WER) approach to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. The authors incorporate knowledge graphs (KGs) in critiquing, enhancing flexibility through a plug-in setting. Extensive experimentation is conducted with clear research questions, comparing against state-of-the-art (SOTA) critique-based recommendation models to validate their claims.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
2. The problem of critiquing-based recommendation is of significant practical value.
3. The proposed plug-and-play component can be integrated into existing KG recommendation methods.
4. The representative items sampling and WER approaches are solid, with experimental results demonstrating their effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. Figures 5 and 6 are too small and unreadable.
2. There are few baseline models based on knowledge graphs; more diversity is needed to enhance generality.
3. The data statistics table lacks a description of the relationships in the knowledge graph.
4. Formula 11 contains errors, and there are grammatical issues throughout the paper.
5. The performance analysis of different baselines in Table 1 is lacking, and the optimal performance in Table 3 has not been bolded.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the term "verifiable" on line 346 and explain how their method addresses this issue. Additionally, the authors should adapt their work to leverage large language models (LLMs) for understanding user intents and critiques in natural language. We suggest enhancing the diversity of baseline models and providing a clearer description of the relationships in the knowledge graph. The authors should also correct the errors in Formula 11 and ensure that all figures are legible. Furthermore, we recommend including a detailed analysis of the performance of different baselines and bolding the optimal performance in Table 3. Lastly, addressing the grammatical issues and providing examples of critiquing in Section 4.1 would improve the overall quality of the paper.
