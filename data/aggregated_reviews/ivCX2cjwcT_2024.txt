Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for shared component analysis (SCA) in the context of multi-modal unpaired data, termed Unaligned SCA. The authors propose a min-max optimization framework inspired by adversarial loss in GANs to align probability distributions of embedded multi-modal data. The algorithm is adaptable to scenarios with single modality data or weakly supervised cases with some pairing. Theoretical analysis is supported by numerical simulations and applications in domain adaptation, multilingual information retrieval, and single-cell sequence analysis. Additionally, the paper rigorously explores the unaligned multi-domain problem structure, emphasizing its relevance to latent component analysis akin to ICA, PCA, and CCA. The authors acknowledge a terminology issue regarding "multi-modality" and agree to revise it to "multi-domain," committing to enhancing the clarity of their results and methodology in response to reviewer feedback.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work addresses a significant research area with broad applications, including explainability and semi-supervised learning.
- The method is flexible, functioning with completely unpaired data and benefiting from available pairing.
- Comprehensive documentation of parameters and inclusion of code enhances reproducibility.
- The paper addresses a significant gap in identifiability research within the context of unaligned multi-domain problems.
- The authors demonstrate a commitment to improving clarity and presentation based on reviewer feedback.
- Empirical results suggest the proposed method is effective.

Weaknesses:
- The empirical analysis is weak, particularly in multi-modal unpaired scenarios, with underwhelming results and potential issues related to the use of CLIP as a pre-processing step without consistent application across baselines.
- The theoretical analysis is difficult to follow, especially regarding the validity of assumptions for unpaired samples and the clarity of key equations.
- The paper lacks recent baseline comparisons, relying on outdated methods, and could benefit from clearer explanations of figures and assumptions.
- The paper lacks clarity for general readers, particularly regarding LMMs and 1-many translations.
- The reliance on pre-trained representations without sufficient justification may detract from identifiability claims.
- The complexity analysis and implications of using unbalanced data are not adequately discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical analysis by ensuring consistent pre-processing across all algorithms, ideally using a less powerful feature extractor than CLIP for fair comparison. Additionally, including results with more recent baselines would strengthen the evaluation.

For the theoretical analysis, we suggest clarifying the rationale behind key assumptions, particularly Assumption 1, and providing a more detailed explanation of how the theoretical claims hold for unpaired samples. 

We encourage the authors to enhance the clarity of figures and the overall presentation by addressing typos and improving the readability of proofs. A summary of results in the main text, rather than relegating them to the appendix, would also improve accessibility for readers.

Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by adding explanations about LMMs and 1-many translations in a "Preliminaries" section. It is crucial to clearly state the reliance on pre-trained representations and how this impacts identifiability claims. We suggest demonstrating the method's effectiveness on simpler datasets before applying it to more complex scenarios. An intuitive explanation of Theorem 1 should be included to enhance readability. Additionally, we recommend adding a discussion on the computational complexity of the proposed model and addressing how unbalanced data affects identifiability. Lastly, clarifying the benefits and challenges of extending the theory to more than two domains would strengthen the paper.
