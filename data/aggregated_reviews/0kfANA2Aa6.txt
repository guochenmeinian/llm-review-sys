### Key Points
This paper presents a method called NoTeNet for Dynamic Dependence Network (DDN) inference using multimodal data. The authors address challenges such as computational efficiency, prediction stability, and modality quality disparity by employing a tuning-free approach grounded in normalized mutual information. The experimental results indicate that NoTeNet outperforms existing methods, showcasing its potential as a high-quality contribution to the field.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The theoretical foundation is robust, with comprehensive proofs supporting the tuning-free nature of NoTeNet.
- The methodology is well-designed, incorporating normalized mutual information and kernel functions, which provide new insights into DDN inference.
- Extensive experimental validation demonstrates the method's effectiveness across synthetic and real datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The process description lacks clarity, which may hinder understanding.
- The paper does not sufficiently discuss potential limitations or scenarios where the method may underperform, particularly regarding the quality of auxiliary data.
- The theoretical proofs involve many symbols, which could benefit from being presented in a table format for improved readability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the process description to enhance reader comprehension. Additionally, a more in-depth discussion of the method's limitations and performance in edge cases, particularly with varying noise levels in auxiliary data, would be beneficial. We also suggest presenting the theoretical symbols in a table format to facilitate understanding. Finally, addressing the scalability of NoTeNet in high-dimensional settings and providing a reproducible code would strengthen the paper's contribution.
