### Key Points
This paper presents a novel algorithmic framework for efficiently computing saddle-points in bilinear zero-sum games, particularly when one dimension is exponentially large. The authors generalize the Ellipsoid Against Hope algorithm to compute exact linear $\Phi$-equilibria in polyhedral games, resolving an open question by providing the first polynomial-time algorithm for exact linear-deviation correlated equilibria in extensive-form games. The algorithm utilizes a "good-enough-response" oracle, which is sufficient for achieving exact equilibria.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper significantly extends the Ellipsoid Against Hope algorithm to a broader class of games, including extensive-form games.
- It offers a polynomial-time solution for computing exact $\Phi$-equilibria, marking a notable advancement in game theory.
- The framework is conceptually simpler than existing methods while being general enough to handle various types of equilibria.
- It addresses and resolves an open question regarding the polynomial-time computation of linear-deviation correlated equilibria.
- The theoretical foundations are robust, with clear definitions and a well-structured algorithmic framework.

Weaknesses:
- The polynomial-time algorithm may have a high degree, potentially limiting practical applicability for very large games.
- There is a lack of empirical validation or experimental results demonstrating the algorithm's performance on real-world datasets.
- The framework relies on specific assumptions, such as the polynomial utility gradient property, which may not hold universally.
- The paper's technical nature may hinder accessibility for readers without a strong background in game theory.
- There is limited discussion on how the proposed method compares with other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of efficiency and accuracy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and accessibility of the paper to broaden its appeal among the NeurIPS community. Additionally, including empirical validation or experimental results would strengthen the practical relevance of the proposed algorithm. We also suggest providing a more detailed comparative analysis with other algorithms to highlight the advantages of the proposed method. Furthermore, please elaborate on the reduction to the Correlator-Deviator game and clarify the transition from the summation inequality of lemma 4.1 to the individual parts' inequality, especially in the crucial section between lines 297 and 326. Lastly, addressing the limits of applying non-linear transformations and specifying the necessary transformation family for achieving a Nash equilibrium would enhance the paper's comprehensiveness.
