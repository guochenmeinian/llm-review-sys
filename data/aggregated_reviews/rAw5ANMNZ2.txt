### Key Points
This paper investigates baseline language variations in normal aging to understand cognitive changes, utilizing NLP tools and psycholinguistic metrics to analyze natural speech data. The authors aim to establish a normative benchmark for aging language, which could assist in assessing cognitive aging. The study evaluates linguistic variation in speech data by age and gender, employing standard NLP tools such as PoS tagging with the Stanford Parser and Penn Treebank tags adjusted for Singaporean English. The results corroborate existing findings on the effect of age on linguistic variation, particularly regarding "lexical concreteness."

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper effectively uses NLP tools to objectively analyze natural speech data, addressing the subjectivity of manual assessments. It provides a detailed year-by-year analysis of linguistic characteristics influenced by age and sex, and the methodology appears sound, contributing relevant insights to the field.

Weaknesses:  
The study excludes individuals older than 80 years and those with less than 13 years of education, potentially omitting valuable insights. While the approach reduces subjectivity, the choice and interpretation of psycholinguistic metrics may still introduce bias. Additionally, the findings may have limited generalizability beyond Singaporean English speakers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the study by including a comparison with existing studies on younger populations or those with cognitive impairments. Additionally, the authors should address how they anticipate the findings to generalize to other English-speaking populations or languages. It would also be beneficial to clarify how the audio recordings were standardized across participants to minimize environmental and technical variations.
