Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies the implicit bias of gradient flow in linear equivariant steerable networks for group-invariant binary classification. The authors demonstrate that these networks converge in the same direction as fully connected networks trained with data augmentation, achieving better margins and generalization bounds when the data distribution is group-invariant. The findings suggest an equivalence between data augmentation in non-invariant models and learning with steerable networks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a critical problem regarding the analysis of equivariant neural networks and contributes valuable theoretical insights.
2. It is well-written, organized, and presents its theories clearly, making it accessible to readers.
3. The findings provide a solid foundation for understanding the advantages of equivariant steerable networks in specific contexts.

Weaknesses:
1. The absence of empirical evaluations limits the paper's convincing power, as the analysis relies heavily on theoretical approximations.
2. The focus on linear cases restricts the applicability of the results; extending the analysis to nonlinear networks would enhance its relevance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including empirical evaluations to substantiate their theoretical claims, as this would significantly enhance the paper's impact. Additionally, we suggest extending the analysis to nonlinear networks, even if only through experimental evaluations, to broaden the scope of the findings. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the implications of Theorem 4.1 and Corollary 5.1, particularly regarding the equivalence of group averaging and data augmentation, and to address the relationship between their work and existing literature on generalization bounds for equivariant networks.
