Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method called ConPreDiff aimed at enhancing diffusion-based image synthesis by incorporating context prediction to improve neighborhood context during training. The authors propose using Wasserstein distance to model context as a probability distribution, thereby reducing computational complexity. The method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation on MS-COCO with an FID of 6.21 and is applicable to both discrete and continuous diffusion models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and the motivation for context prediction is clear and intuitive.
2. The method effectively reduces computational complexity while achieving significant improvements in FID scores for text-to-image synthesis and image inpainting.
3. Extensive experiments validate the proposed method's effectiveness across various diffusion models.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks unconditional generation results and detailed training and implementation specifics, which raises concerns about reproducibility.
2. Claims regarding improved semantic consistency and context preservation are not sufficiently justified, as visual comparisons with baselines are missing.
3. Some notations are misleading or undefined, leading to confusion regarding the methodology.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their claims by providing visual comparisons with baseline methods to substantiate assertions about semantic consistency. Additionally, including unconditional generation results would strengthen the paper's contributions. We suggest that the authors elaborate on training and implementation details to enhance reproducibility. Furthermore, addressing the misleading notations and providing clearer definitions would improve the overall presentation of the paper.
