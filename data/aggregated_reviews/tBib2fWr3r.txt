Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for analyzing privacy risk in deep leakage from gradients (DLG) attacks through the introduction of the Inversion Influence Function (I2F). The I2F quantifies how privacy risk metrics change with applied defenses to gradients, independent of model architecture or attack optimization methods. The authors demonstrate that the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix significantly influence the mean squared error (MSE) of recoveries, particularly noting that smaller eigenvalues can mitigate leakage risks. The evaluation is conducted using LeNet and ResNet18 on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, revealing that samples with large eigenvalues in the Jacobian are more susceptible to leakage. Additionally, the authors provide a thorough response to reviewer comments, expressing gratitude for the feedback and indicating their intention to revise the final paper based on the suggestions received, particularly emphasizing the inclusion of a more detailed discussion on batch normalization (BN) prior.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers an original framing of DLG attacks, utilizing established techniques to provide a new perspective.
- It presents a clear and well-structured analysis, with intuitive mathematical steps that enhance understanding.
- The simplicity and efficiency of the proposed I2F framework make it practical for real-world applications.
- The authors effectively address all reviewer concerns, demonstrating a commitment to improving the paper and indicating a collaborative approach to the revision process.

Weaknesses:
- The claims regarding the limitations of prior work by Fan et al. (2020) lack sufficient depth and comparison, potentially undermining the paper's novelty.
- The evaluation scope is limited, focusing on only two defenses and datasets, which may not comprehensively support the conclusions drawn.
- The applicability of the I2F framework in realistic scenarios is questioned, particularly regarding the necessity of batch normalization statistics for effective inversion.
- There is a lack of specific details in the responses regarding how the revisions will be implemented beyond the mention of BN prior.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with prior works, particularly addressing the claims about the generalizability of Fan et al. (2020). Expanding the evaluation to include additional defenses, such as gradient pruning, and exploring the impact of training iterations on MSE would strengthen the paper's conclusions. Furthermore, clarifying how the absence of batch normalization statistics affects the utility of the I2F framework in practical scenarios is essential. We also suggest that the authors improve the clarity of their responses by providing specific examples of how each concern will be addressed in the revisions. Additionally, elaborating on the planned discussion regarding BN prior would enhance the paper's depth. Lastly, consider incorporating alternative metrics for recovery quality to address potential limitations of solely using MSE.
