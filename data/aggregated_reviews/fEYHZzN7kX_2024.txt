Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Attraos, a novel model for long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) that integrates chaos theory, treating time series data as observations from high-dimensional chaotic dynamic systems. Attraos employs attractor invariance, non-parametric Phase Space Reconstruction, and a multi-scale dynamic memory unit to capture historical dynamics and forecast future states with significantly fewer parameters than existing models like PatchTST. Empirical results indicate Attraos' superior performance across various LTSF and chaotic datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides comprehensive experimental results and rigorous theoretical support for its claims.
- The application of chaotic theories to LTSF tasks is a novel and intriguing concept.
- The proposed method requires considerably fewer parameters than previous approaches.

Weaknesses:
- Many descriptions in the problem setup, methods, and theoretical analysis are confusing and difficult to follow, with sudden notations and potential typos. 
- The title may be misleading, as the key insight seems to stem from the Takens embedding theorem; clarification is needed in the title, abstract, introduction, and conclusion.
- Section A.1 of the appendix is largely copied from Wikipedia, with inconsistent notations.
- The paper lacks sufficient background introduction.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the problem setup, methods, and theoretical analysis to enhance understanding. If page limits are a concern, consider presenting a detailed version of the problem setup, background, analysis, and methods in the appendix. Additionally, we suggest revising the title to better reflect the insights derived from chaotic systems and ensuring that all notations are coherent throughout the paper. Furthermore, providing a complete architectural description and including error bars for numerical results would strengthen the presentation of findings. Lastly, we advise reworking any grandiose language to maintain a professional tone throughout the paper.
