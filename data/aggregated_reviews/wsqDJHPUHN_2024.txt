Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the learnware paradigm, which allows model developers to share trained models along with a model specification that represents the training data while preserving privacy. The authors propose the Reduced Kernel Mean Embedding (RKME) specification, demonstrating that it can protect training data against inference attacks while maintaining sufficient information for effective model reuse. The authors prove that RKME possesses three key properties: it does not contain original training data points, is robust against inference attacks, and preserves necessary information for learnware specifications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The results are novel and significant for the learnware community, particularly concerning the risks associated with disclosing model specifications without formal guarantees.
- The authors provide a clear introduction to the learnware problem and their contributions, with helpful figures illustrating trade-offs between different choices of $m$.
- The theoretical framework is comprehensive, with detailed proofs supporting the claims about data privacy and security against inference attacks.

Weaknesses:
- Clarity in Sections 3 and 4 needs improvement to make the content more accessible to a broader audience. The connection between core results and Theorems 3.4 and 3.5 is unclear, and a proof sketch should precede the key lemmas.
- Section 4 requires additional intuition behind Theorem 4.2, particularly regarding aspects not covered in Section 3.
- The paper lacks extensive empirical evidence to support the RKME specification's effectiveness in real-world scenarios and relies on assumptions about optimal data distributions and kernel functions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Sections 3 and 4 by first explaining the proof sketch before presenting key lemmas and their connections. Additionally, providing more intuition behind Theorem 4.2 would enhance understanding. To strengthen the paper, we suggest including empirical evidence demonstrating the RKME specification's effectiveness in practical applications and addressing how it compares to existing model-sharing infrastructures. Finally, clarifying the operational status of the Learnware market and its advantages over current systems would provide valuable context for the contributions made in this paper.
