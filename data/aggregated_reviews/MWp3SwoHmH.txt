Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents MCUFormer, a hardware-algorithm co-design framework aimed at deploying vision transformers on microcontrollers (MCUs) with limited memory. The authors propose techniques such as search space evolution for optimizing transformer architectures and constructing a compiling library for efficient memory scheduling. MCUFormer achieves a top-1 accuracy of 73.62% with only 329KB of memory, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the challenges of resource-constrained environments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper targets a significant research problem and presents a coherent method that shows promising results in accuracy and memory consumption.
- Extensive evaluation on multiple resource-constrained platforms and the ImageNet dataset supports the proposed method's effectiveness.
- The compiling library incorporates novel memory optimization techniques, contributing valuable insights to the field.

Weaknesses:
- Key details regarding speed comparisons and latency measurements are missing, which would enhance the demonstration of performance gains.
- The claim of a hardware-algorithm co-design lacks clarity, as the integration of hardware design appears minimal.
- The novelty of systematic optimizations is limited, with existing literature already addressing similar techniques.
- The complexity of the proposed search space evolution algorithm raises questions about its significance compared to simpler methods like model pruning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the hardware-algorithm co-design claim by explicitly detailing the hardware aspects involved. Additionally, including speed and latency comparisons in the evaluation would strengthen the paper's contributions. An ablation study to quantify the improvements from proposed techniques, such as low-rank decomposition, should be conducted. Furthermore, clarifying the differences between the proposed search space evolution algorithm and existing methods, along with providing more details on the search cost and memory constraints, would enhance the paper's rigor. Lastly, addressing minor writing issues and typos would improve overall presentation quality.
