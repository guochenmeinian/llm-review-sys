Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents FaceComposer, a unified framework for facial content generation that utilizes a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to facilitate text-conditioned face synthesis, editing, and animation. The model incorporates various conditions, including mask, PNCC, sketch, identity features, and Text2Face embeddings, and employs a temporal self-attention module to enhance dynamic content generation. The experimental results demonstrate the framework's superiority in synthesis quality across static and dynamic settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The framework's flexibility allows it to perform multiple tasks, enhancing computational efficiency by avoiding the need for separate modules.
- The authors have curated a comprehensive dataset of over 500 hours of high-quality talking face videos, which will be beneficial for future research.
- The application of PNCC as a condition in the diffusion model is a unique approach that adds value to the field.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed method lacks significant methodological novelty, with many components derived from prior works, and the key contributions remain unclear.
- The user interface is described as confusing, and the paper would benefit from a more focused discussion on the technical aspects rather than the interface.
- The evaluation metrics used do not adequately reflect mouth movement accuracy, and the performance of the model appears to degrade when masks are not utilized.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the user interface and consider removing the detailed interface description from the main paper to allocate space for additional experiments or ablation studies. Additionally, including comparisons with closely related methods such as StyleTalk would provide a more comprehensive evaluation. We suggest conducting further ablation studies to explore how the performance varies with the addition of each condition and clarifying the dataset's influence on the results. Finally, addressing the methodological novelty and including missing references would strengthen the paper's contributions.
