Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for generating high-fidelity synthetic trajectory data using a diffusion model, addressing the critical issue of limited publicly available and privacy-protected trajectory datasets in urban mobility analysis. The authors propose a comprehensive approach that generates synthetic GPS trajectories, aiming to provide a reliable alternative that maintains the essential characteristics of real-world data. They validate the practicality and accuracy of the synthetic datasets through case studies and comprehensive experiments comparing synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating their similarity. The authors have made their complete source code available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SynthTraj-code/, which includes detailed documentation to facilitate reproducibility.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
- The writing is clear, with logical flow and well-defined objectives.
- The method effectively synthesizes trajectory datasets while maintaining data distribution and properties similar to real datasets, thus addressing privacy concerns.
- The authors conducted comprehensive experiments demonstrating the similarity between synthetic and real datasets.
- The commitment to transparency through the availability of source code and comprehensive documentation enhances reproducibility.

**Weaknesses:**
- The paper lacks citations for claims regarding the Geolife dataset's widespread use.
- There is limited discussion on the design choices of the diffusion model, and insufficient details on forward noise and reverse denoising processes hinder reader understanding.
- The dataset generation based on real data may weaken the contribution, and the limitations of the method are acknowledged but not thoroughly addressed.
- There is an observed performance gap between synthesized and real-world datasets, and concerns regarding the clarity of the appendix and the initial lack of explicit mention of supplementary materials are noted.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the manuscript by:
1. Citing relevant research papers to support claims about the Geolife dataset's usage.
2. Providing additional details on forward noise and reverse denoising to enhance reader comprehension.
3. Clearly outlining the costs, benefits, and improvements of the synthetic dataset compared to real data to demonstrate its significant contribution.
4. Incorporating visualizations of performance metrics and differences between original and synthetic datasets to facilitate evaluation.
5. Ensuring the source code and model are readily available for reproducibility, as the current lack of access limits the review process.
6. Addressing potential simple errors in trajectories, such as cycles or loops, to ensure the quality of the generated data.
7. Enhancing the clarity of the discussion regarding the limitations of existing datasets and the specific contributions of their synthetic dataset.
8. Providing more evidence demonstrating how the synthetic dataset can benefit the community comparably to real-world datasets.
9. Ensuring that the appendix's location in supplementary materials is clearly indicated in the main text to avoid confusion.
