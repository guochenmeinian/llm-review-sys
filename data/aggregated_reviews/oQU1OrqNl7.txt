### Key Points
This paper presents a Hyperbolic Diffusion Recommender Model (HDRM) aimed at addressing anisotropic diffusion processes in recommendation systems. The authors propose leveraging hyperbolic space's geometric properties to enhance directional diffusion propagation, thereby preserving the topological structure of user-item interaction graphs. The effectiveness of HDRM is validated through extensive experiments across multiple datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work introduces a novel application of hyperbolic geometry to diffusion models, effectively addressing structural disparities in user-item graphs.
- Theoretical analysis is comprehensive, exploring clustering and normal distributions in hyperbolic space, supported by extensive proofs.
- The experimental results are detailed, with reproducible code and thorough ablation studies.

Weaknesses:
- The framework appears to be an incremental adaptation of previous models, raising questions about the necessity of hyperbolic components.
- The ablation study results suggest that HDRM's performance can be achieved without key components, conflicting with the model's claims.
- The training process is time-consuming, and the paper lacks details on execution time and training dynamics.
- Writing quality is inconsistent, with numerous typos and unclear notations that hinder comprehension.
- There is insufficient discussion regarding the potential amplification of biases and fairness issues in existing recommender systems due to HDRM's design.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing by addressing typos and notation inconsistencies, particularly in the framework figure and the definitions of parameters. Additionally, we suggest including a detailed explanation of the ablation study settings and the implications of the results. The authors should also provide a thorough analysis of the computational complexity associated with the reverse sampling process and the sensitivity of essential parameters. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore HDRM's performance under low-dimensional embeddings and trainable curvature settings to enhance the model's robustness and applicability.
