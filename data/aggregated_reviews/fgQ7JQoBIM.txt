### Key Points
This paper presents a novel task, conditional semantic textual similarity (C-STS), which modifies the traditional semantic textual similarity (STS) task by incorporating a specific condition for evaluating the semantic similarity between sentence pairs. The authors introduce the C-STS-2023 dataset, comprising 19K examples of $(s_1,s_2,c,y)$ tuples, where $s_1$ and $s_2$ are image captions, $c$ is a human-written condition, and $y$ is a human-annotated similarity judgment. Evaluations reveal that C-STS poses significant challenges even for top-performing models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The C-STS task is well-motivated and relevant to various NLP subfields, including IR, NLI, and RTE.
- The experiments are comprehensive, with detailed data collection and experimental setup provided.
- The paper is well-structured, easy to follow, and includes a solid set of baselines.

Weaknesses:
- The distribution of similarity judgments appears unbalanced, raising questions about the data collection process.
- Variability in individual annotators' response distributions could impact the reliability of the similarity judgments, and redundancy in annotation is limited.
- The train/validation/test split ratio is unconventional, and clarification on its standardization is needed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the balance of similarity judgments in the dataset to address the observed skew. Additionally, consider releasing anonymized annotator information alongside the dataset to facilitate research on response variability. It would also be beneficial to provide references supporting the chosen train/validation/test split ratio or clarify the rationale behind it. Lastly, we suggest renaming Section 7 to "Conclusion" and including an ethics statement to enhance the paper's completeness.
