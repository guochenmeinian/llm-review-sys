Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Bregman Plug-and-Play (PnP) image restoration algorithm designed to address under-determined inverse problems affected by Poisson measurement noise. The authors propose a "Bregman Score Denoiser," which is trained to handle noise with an exponential distribution, differing from the Gaussian noise used in previous PnP denoisers. The integration of this denoiser into iterative algorithms results in B-PnP and B-RED, both of which are shown to effectively deblur images and converge to fixed points under specific conditions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is technically sound and presents the Bregman PnP approach clearly, addressing a gap in the PnP framework with learnable priors.
- It provides a strong theoretical contribution, deriving general convergence conditions that extend previous works.
- The proposed method is well-motivated and evaluated across various blur kernels.

Weaknesses:
- The numerical results are not compelling, showing no significant improvement over existing methods, and comparisons with plain PnP approaches are limited.
- The convergence guarantees are questionable due to the lack of enforcement of the convexity condition, and the proposed method introduces additional hyperparameters that complicate practical implementation.
- The presentation is confusing, with references and technical details interspersed in a way that obscures the main arguments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by organizing references and technical details more coherently. Additionally, the authors should address the limitations of their method more explicitly, particularly regarding the lack of significant performance improvement over existing algorithms. It would be beneficial to include a more comprehensive comparison with plain PnP approaches and clarify the implications of the constraint $\lambda L_f < 1$ on their results. Finally, we suggest that the authors provide a clearer explanation of how the set C in equation (18) is determined and address the questions raised about the convexity assumption and the nonexpansiveness requirement.
