### Key Points
This paper presents the Inductive Cognitive Diagnosis Model (ICDM), a novel graph-based approach aimed at addressing the inductive cognitive diagnosis problem in web-based online education systems. The authors leverage a Student-Centric Graph (SCG) to infer students' mastery levels (Mas) efficiently, enabling immediate feedback without the need for model retraining. The study includes extensive experiments with real-world datasets, demonstrating the model's speed and competitive performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an important and relatively overlooked area, showcasing good originality and significance.
- Extensive experiments provide clarity on the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed model across various settings.
- Informative figures and detailed experimental results enhance reproducibility and understanding.

Weaknesses:
- The performance improvements in accuracy appear marginal and inconsistent, particularly in the inductive setting where ICDM-GLIF underperforms compared to ICDM-MIRT.
- The evaluation of inference speed is deemed unfair, as it does not account for the retraining capabilities of baseline models.
- Some contributions lack significant novelty, and the effectiveness of the proposed model compared to existing methods is not convincingly demonstrated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of mathematical notations, ensuring all terms are well-defined to enhance readability. Additionally, the authors should provide a more thorough interpretation of performance differences, particularly in the inductive scenario, and justify the preference for non-retraining approaches despite observed performance gaps. It would also be beneficial to explore the educational implications of the chosen metrics and consider conducting an online A/B testing evaluation to assess real-world applicability. Finally, we suggest creating a publicly accessible repository for the source code and providing more detail on the optimization process of the baselines to facilitate replication and fair comparison.
