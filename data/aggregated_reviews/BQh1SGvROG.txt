Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Adaptor Neural Cellular Automata (AdaNCA), a plug-and-play module designed to enhance the robustness and performance of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in image classification. The authors propose integrating Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) as intermediaries between ViT layers, which demonstrates significant improvements in robustness against adversarial samples and out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. The paper outlines three main contributions: (1) demonstrating AdaNCA's effectiveness in improving classification accuracy on clean, noisy, and OOD data; (2) introducing a novel "Dynamic Interaction" mechanism that optimizes computational efficiency; and (3) providing a systematic approach for selecting optimal ViT layers for AdaNCA insertion, supported by extensive analysis. The authors also compare AdaNCA with ViTCA, emphasizing their differing focusesâ€”robustness in image classification for AdaNCA and image reconstruction for ViTCA.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of NCA into ViTs is a novel approach addressing robustness issues in current architectures.
- AdaNCA shows improved robustness with minimal parameter increase, supported by thorough experimentation and analyses.
- Results indicate enhancements across eight robustness benchmarks and four different ViT architectures.
- The manuscript is well-written, with commendable effort in both the main text and appendix, providing valuable supplementary information.
- The authors have integrated suggested changes and conducted additional experiments, demonstrating responsiveness to reviewer feedback.

Weaknesses:
- The readability of Table 1 could be improved, as it lacks clarity on the metrics for adversarial attacks and OOD inputs.
- The argument for AdaNCA's competitive performance is limited, especially since it is tested on a downsampled version of ImageNet.
- The choice of baselines is questionable, particularly the exclusion of the ADL loss, which may mislead comparisons.
- The comparison between AdaNCA and ViTCA lacks sufficient justification for the claimed differences in structural design.
- Some assumptions regarding NCA robustness are incorrect or incomplete, and the motivations for Dynamic Interaction and its multi-scale variant are insufficiently addressed.
- The impact of dropout during training may confound the observed benefits of using more NCA steps, which could weaken the argument for NCA effectiveness.
- The scalability of AdaNCA to larger datasets and tasks beyond image classification remains untested.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Table 1 by specifying the metrics used for adversarial attacks and OOD inputs. Additionally, please clarify whether the results represent the single best trained model. We suggest including the original "TAPADL" results with the correct loss for completeness, as this is crucial for accurate comparisons. It would also be beneficial to explore the integration of the ADL loss into the modified model. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to investigate the performance of AdaNCA in other domains, such as object detection or segmentation, to assess its generalizability. We recommend enhancing the citation and comparison with related works, specifically addressing how ViTCA enhances ViT robustness. Additionally, clarify the assumptions regarding NCA robustness and provide a more detailed motivation for the Dynamic Interaction strategy, including comparisons with traditional concatenation methods. We suggest addressing redundancy in figures and providing explanations for key equations and concepts. Finally, we encourage the authors to comment on potential negative impacts of their approach in Section 6 and to provide deeper commentary on the ablation study results.
