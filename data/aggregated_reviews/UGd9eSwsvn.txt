### Key Points
This paper presents Zero-Shot Data Maps, a novel method for diagnosing large annotated datasets without model training, utilizing a single bi-encoder model with varying label descriptions. The authors compute confidence and variability for each data point, demonstrating that Zero-Shot Data Maps can approximate Training Dynamics maps while achieving up to a 14x speedup. The evaluation includes qualitative analysis and downstream tasks, indicating that this method is both efficient and practical for large datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is well-motivated, simple, and offers impressive results, enhancing practical scalability for large datasets.
- Comprehensive evaluation includes visual comparisons and downstream applications, such as data selection and error detection.
- The study provides sufficient support for its claims and contributes to understanding existing research directions.

Weaknesses:
- The method's reliance on subjective factors, such as label description phrasing and calibration, may impact its practical applicability.
- Clarity is lacking regarding the creation and assessment of label descriptions, which could affect the method's effectiveness.
- The evaluation of automatic error detection is limited to a single dataset, which may not robustly validate the method's effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the process of creating label descriptions and assess their quality to enhance understanding of the method's effectiveness. Additionally, an analysis to disentangle the effects of variability in label descriptions on the generated data maps would strengthen the paper's claims. Expanding the evaluation of error detection capabilities to include multiple datasets would provide a more robust validation of the method. Lastly, a detailed analysis of the computational complexity, considering both the number of labels and label descriptions, should be included to clarify the efficiency claims.
