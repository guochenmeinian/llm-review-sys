Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents GradOrth, a post-hoc out-of-distribution (OOD) detection method that utilizes orthogonal projections of gradients onto a lower-rank subspace relevant for OOD detection. The authors propose that the norm of this projection serves as an OODness score, with the method demonstrating strong empirical performance across various OOD detection tasks. The approach is computationally efficient, requiring only a small number of in-distribution examples to compute the necessary subspace.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and explores a novel aspect of OOD detection.
- GradOrth is easy to implement and shows impressive performance on multiple benchmark datasets.
- The authors provide relevant ablation studies that analyze the impact of different hyperparameters on the method's performance.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks comparisons with several competitive methods, such as DICE, GradNorm, and KNN, which could provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
- There is insufficient discussion regarding the selection and impact of the threshold $\epsilon_{th}$, which may affect model performance.
- The formulation of the approach is unclear, particularly regarding how gradients are calculated during inference, leading to confusion about the model's behavior.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the formulation, particularly how gradients are computed during inference, to enhance understanding of the model's behavior. Additionally, we suggest including empirical results comparing GradOrth with methods like DICE and GradNorm to provide a more thorough evaluation. It would also be beneficial to analyze the influence of randomness on the results and include a discussion on the robustness of the threshold $\epsilon_{th}$. Finally, we encourage the authors to address the limitations of their method in more detail, particularly regarding the sensitivity of results to the selection of in-distribution samples.
