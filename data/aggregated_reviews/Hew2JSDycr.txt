Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents BiScope, a novel algorithm for AI-generated text detection that utilizes logits from a text expansion task. The algorithm operates in three steps: segmenting the input text into two parts, generating completion prompts for context awareness, and training a binary classifier using features derived from logits. The authors demonstrate BiScope's effectiveness through extensive experiments across various datasets and LLMs, showing its robustness against paraphrasing attacks and competitive performance compared to existing methods like GPTZero.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a unique approach to AI-generated text detection, leveraging bidirectional logit information, which is a significant contribution given the rise of powerful LLMs.
- Comprehensive experiments are conducted on multiple datasets and LLMs, showcasing BiScope's robustness in both IID and OOD settings.
- The authors provide additional ablation studies, enhancing the understanding of the algorithm's performance.

Weaknesses:
- The OOD experiments are limited, potentially giving BiScope an unfair advantage over baselines that lack in-distribution training.
- The paper would benefit from including more baselines, particularly comparing BiScope to watermarking methods and newer detection algorithms like Binoculars.
- Additional ablation studies are needed to explore the impact of segment count and the performance of classifiers trained solely on feed-forward logits.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the OOD experimental design by incorporating both text domain and generative LLM shifts. Additionally, including comparisons with watermarking methods and newer algorithms would strengthen the paper. We suggest conducting further ablation studies to investigate the significance of segment count and the performance of classifiers trained on feed-forward logits without completion prompts. Furthermore, clarifying the dataset modifications and providing detailed descriptions of the datasets used would enhance the paper's comprehensiveness. Lastly, addressing the computational cost of feature extraction in the limitations section is essential for transparency.
