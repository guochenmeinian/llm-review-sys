Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for addressing miscalibration in deep learning models by introducing a Partitioned Calibration Error (PCE) framework. The authors propose partitioning the input space and fitting calibration functions to each group, which generalizes existing methods. The method is benchmarked on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to standard calibration techniques like temperature scaling.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed PCE framework offers a unified formulation for existing calibration methods, enhancing understanding.
- The method's ability to learn partitions using an extra linear layer + softmax allows for end-to-end learning, which is a valuable contribution.

Weaknesses:
- The mathematical presentation contains numerous technical errors, including inconsistencies in definitions and unclear derivations.
- The framing of the work is misleading, focusing on calibration improvements while neglecting the potential for enhancing individual posterior probabilities and fairness metrics.
- Improvements in calibration performance are marginal, with absolute differences in Expected Calibration Error (ECE) being minimal.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the mathematical rigor of the paper by explicitly stating necessary assumptions and clarifying definitions, particularly regarding Lemma 1 and Definition 2. Additionally, the authors should address the concerns about the theoretical underpinnings of their approach, particularly the distinction between \( p(y \mid x) \) and \( p(y \mid x, G) \). To enhance the paper's framing, we suggest that the authors emphasize the potential for improving individual posterior probabilities and fairness metrics rather than solely focusing on calibration. Finally, we encourage the authors to conduct further experiments with additional calibration methods to demonstrate the generalization ability of their partition calibration approach.
