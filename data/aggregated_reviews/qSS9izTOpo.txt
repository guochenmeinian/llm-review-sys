Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new approach to generalized fMRI-to-image reconstruction, focusing on incorporating image semantics and addressing semantic gaps during reconstruction. The authors propose utilizing a CLIP-based feature space to tackle the inside-space semantic gap and a structural information-guided diffusion model for the outside-space semantic gap. An adaptive strategy integrates semantic and structural information. Experiments are conducted on the GOD and NSD datasets, comparing against several existing baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well-motivated, with clearly described methodology components. The focus on semantics and addressing semantic gaps is compelling, and the adaptive integration with LDM is novel. The experiments are comprehensive, showing significant improvements, particularly on the GOD dataset. The ablation study effectively demonstrates the contributions of each methodology module.

Weaknesses:  
The authors only consider one baseline for comparison on the NSD dataset, and the performance metrics lack sufficient statistics. It is unclear whether training and testing are conducted separately per subject or simultaneously across all subjects. The paper's notations are confusing, making it difficult to distinguish between sets, matrices, and distributions. Additionally, the proposed method lacks a clear algorithm or pseudocode summary, and some sections require revision for clarity. There are also minor linguistic and typographical errors.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of notations to align with standard conventions for scalars, vectors, and matrices. Providing a summary of the proposed method in the form of an algorithm or pseudocode would enhance understanding. We suggest revising and reorganizing sections to improve the clarity of technical details. Additionally, addressing the insufficient comparisons and quantitative results, particularly in the ablation experiments, would strengthen the paper. Finally, we encourage the authors to discuss limitations more thoroughly and consider including a computational efficiency comparison of the models.
