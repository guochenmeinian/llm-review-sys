Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework for addressing ambiguities in image segmentation using the SAM model, leveraging the inherent properties of vision foundation models. The authors propose a conditional variational autoencoder to probabilistically model the inherent ambiguities, enabling SAM to generate diverse and reasonable segmentation outputs. They address several queries regarding their methodology, metrics, and datasets, emphasizing that most of the content was already included in the initial submission and appendix. Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness across various scenarios, particularly in medical imaging.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The work tackles a significant challenge in image segmentation, particularly in fields like medical imaging where ambiguous data is prevalent, contributing to the development of robust segmentation models.
2. The proposed method is innovative, utilizing vision foundation models for ambiguous segmentation, which is a significant contribution to the field.
3. The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of SAM's sensitivity to prompt variations, supported by detailed experiments and statistical evaluations.
4. The authors demonstrate a commitment to improving the clarity of their paper and addressing reviewer concerns.
5. The structure is clear, with well-defined methods and effective use of figures and tables to enhance understanding.

Weaknesses:
1. The framework is primarily tested on specific medical and synthetic datasets, lacking diversity in real-world datasets that may present different ambiguities.
2. Concerns arise regarding potential overfitting to the tested datasets, as evidenced by metrics in Table 6, suggesting possible bias in the test datasets.
3. The paper's writing structure is somewhat unclear, complicating readability and comprehension of the methodology.
4. The paper lacks clarity in several areas, making it difficult for readers to fully understand and reproduce the work.
5. Some definitions and explanations, such as "full granularity," are insufficiently detailed, which may hinder comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the diversity of datasets used for testing, incorporating various real-world scenarios beyond medical imaging to demonstrate the framework's generalizability. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the task setup to better align with existing literature on ambiguous segmentation, possibly by including a dedicated section for this purpose. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to enhance the clarity of the writing structure, particularly by consolidating the training and inference methods into a single section. Addressing the unclear statements and missing details regarding the methodology and evaluation metrics would significantly improve reproducibility and comprehension. Specifically, we recommend adding a definition and clarification of "full granularity" in Figure 1's caption and in the introduction. Including a sentence in Section 4.1 (Dataset, Line 230) to direct readers to more details in the appendix would be beneficial. Expanding Section A.2 in the Appendix (Dataset, after Line 500) with a sentence explaining how the ambiguous segmentation masks are created, along with a figure to clarify potential misunderstandings about spatial overlap, is also advised.
