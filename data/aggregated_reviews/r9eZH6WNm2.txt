Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method called MolGroup, which addresses the challenge of selecting auxiliary datasets to enhance the prediction of molecular properties in transfer learning, meta-learning, or few-shot learning contexts. The authors propose a routing-based mechanism that separates dataset affinity into task and structure components, optimized through a bi-level framework. The method demonstrates improvements in model performance across 11 target datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The problem addressed is significant, particularly in the context of drug discovery, where annotated datasets are scarce.
2. The paper is well-structured and clearly articulated, making it accessible.
3. The empirical study is comprehensive, and the proposed method shows a relative improvement in performance across various models.

Weaknesses:
1. The computational cost may be high with numerous tasks involved.
2. The correlation measures presented in Figure 3 are low, raising concerns about the effectiveness of the proposed method and the risk of negative transfer.
3. There is a lack of clarity regarding the calculation of affinity scores and the distinction between task embeddings and fingerprint similarities.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity in the manuscript, particularly in lines 65-68, to specify whether an affinity score is calculated or learned. Additionally, we suggest conducting an ablation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of meta-learning in the MolGroup method. It would also be beneficial to justify the choice of using learnable embeddings over Task2vec in line 187. Finally, addressing the low Pearson coefficients and the implications of potential negative transfer would strengthen the paper's arguments.
