Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents TrackIME, a framework for tracking points in video by leveraging a segmentation model to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. TrackIME achieves state-of-the-art performance on the TAP-VID dataset, significantly improving point tracking from instance motion through a combination of existing segmentation and point tracking models. The authors validate their approach with extensive experiments, demonstrating its ability to outperform previous methods while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, TrackIME enhances query point tracking for video segmentation by addressing limitations in accurately tracking intricate object parts. The authors propose three main components: search space pruning, trajectory aggregation, and progressive inference, which collectively improve tracking reliability and performance. The ablation study in Table 3 demonstrates that these components significantly reduce tracking failures and enhance performance metrics, particularly on intricate scales.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The proposed method achieves competitive results with low computational costs compared to TAPIR.  
2. The integration of a segmentation model for point tracking is a novel approach not previously explored in prior works.  
3. The framework shows substantial improvements in tracking accuracy and flexibility across various benchmarks.  
4. The paper effectively identifies and addresses limitations in existing methods, particularly SAM-PT.  
5. The proposed components are well-supported by empirical evidence from the ablation study, showcasing their impact on performance.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The main contribution of the proposed method is unclear, as using a segmentation model for point tracking appears intuitive and top-down.  
2. The performance improvement over SAM-PT is marginal, raising concerns about the model's overall tracking capability.  
3. The trajectory aggregation method is overly simplistic, as direct averaging does not account for common scenarios like rotations and scale changes.  
4. The discussion could further clarify how the proposed methods compare quantitatively with SAM-PT beyond the metrics provided.  
5. There may be a need for more detailed explanations of the implications of the results for practical applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the main contribution of TrackIME to distinguish it from existing methods. Additionally, we suggest improving the trajectory aggregation step by fitting an affine motion model to selected points, as this could enhance tracking performance. The authors should also address the inconsistencies in reported results compared to original papers, providing detailed explanations for these discrepancies to maintain credibility. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include a discussion on how TrackIME mitigates tracking failures, particularly in intricate object parts, and to ensure that all experimental parameters are clearly presented for reproducibility. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the comparison between TrackIME and SAM-PT by providing additional quantitative data that highlights the advantages of their approach. Lastly, we suggest elaborating on the practical implications of their findings to enhance the paper's relevance to real-world applications.
