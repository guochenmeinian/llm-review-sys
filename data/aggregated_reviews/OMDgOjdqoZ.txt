Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel training method for spiking neural networks (SNNs) that integrates both excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms, termed EICIL. The authors propose an iterative training approach that utilizes the time step of SNNs to train the same network with different methods, achieving an ideal excitatory-inhibitory ratio of 8:2, which enhances biological interpretability. The method demonstrates improved performance on datasets like CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 compared to traditional approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The combination of excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms represents an innovative breakthrough, enhancing the biological interpretability of SNNs.
2. The training method effectively utilizes the time characteristics of SNNs, allowing for local optimal iterative training.
3. The experimental validation of the 8:2 ratio shows improved accuracy over the traditional 1:1 ratio.

Weaknesses:
1. The writing lacks clarity and maturity, making the authors' ideas less accessible.
2. The paper only explores one combination of excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms, limiting the demonstration of the method's effectiveness.
3. The methods and neurons employed are basic, not reflecting the highest accuracy achievable in current research.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their writing to better convey their ideas. Additionally, consider introducing more combinations of excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms to strengthen the demonstration of the method's feasibility. It would also be beneficial to explore advanced methods or neurons to enhance the accuracy of the results. Finally, we suggest providing a clearer rationale for the design choices, particularly regarding the surrogate gradient and STDP mechanisms, and including a figure to illustrate the model configurations for better reader comprehension.
