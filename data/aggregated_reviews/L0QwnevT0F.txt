Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents architectural modifications to the conventional CNN framework by incorporating Fourier layers to achieve scale-equivariance and address the anti-aliasing problem during downscaling. The authors propose a discrete domain downsampling formulation and corresponding architectural changes, demonstrating zero scale-equivariance error through experiments on MNIST-scale and STL-10 datasets. The motivation for improved classification accuracy with higher-scale images is sound, and the proposed method is deemed novel and effective.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, precise, and easy to follow, with clear motivation and structured approach.
- The proposed method is original and effectively addresses the scale-equivariance issue, achieving zero scale-equivariance error.
- Results are competent, even under non-ideal subsampling conditions, and the approach may interest the broader ML community.

Weaknesses:
- The computational complexity of the proposed method is not adequately discussed, especially in comparison to less costly baselines.
- The method may not scale well to high-dimensional datasets like ImageNet or standard architectures such as ResNet50, which should be addressed.
- The paper lacks a Broader Impact section and a discussion of limitations, which are essential for understanding the societal implications of the work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on computational and time complexity, particularly in comparison to baseline methods. It is crucial to address the scalability challenges of their method for high-dimensional datasets and standard architectures. Additionally, we suggest including a section that clearly states the limitations of the work and a Broader Impact section to discuss potential societal implications. Minor text corrections should also be made for clarity, including rephrasing unclear formulations and addressing grammatical errors.
