Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the GREAT Score, a novel framework for evaluating the global robustness of machine learning models against adversarial perturbations using generative models. The authors establish a connection between local and global robustness, demonstrating that the classification margin provides a lower bound on robustness concerning L2 perturbations. Empirical validation across various benchmarks indicates a strong correlation with existing robustness evaluations while significantly reducing computational costs. Additionally, the paper includes a comprehensive ablation study comparing various search methods for temperature calibration, such as grid search, binary search, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms, conducted under consistent experimental settings. The results show that while the search methods yield slightly different optimal temperature values, they converge to the same ranking results, reinforcing the reliability of the GREAT Score calibration process.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The GREAT Score framework introduces an innovative method for global robustness evaluation using generative models, addressing a significant gap in the field.  
2. The paper is well-organized and clearly written, enhancing its accessibility.  
3. The proposed method offers substantial computational savings and can evaluate privacy-sensitive black-box models without accessing real data.  
4. The ablation study effectively addresses the reliability of the framework across different search methods, and consistent experimental settings enhance the validity of the comparisons made.  
5. The results demonstrate that different algorithms yield similar ranking outcomes, reinforcing the robustness of the calibration process.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The reliance on generative models raises concerns about their accuracy and the assumptions made regarding their performance, such as generating instances belonging to the conditioned class and approximating the true data distribution.  
2. The framework primarily focuses on L2 norm adversarial perturbations, lacking ablation studies for other norms like Lâˆž.  
3. The calibration process appears ad-hoc, relying on grid search, which may lack robustness and generalizability.  
4. There is insufficient discussion on the implications of using generative models trained on known datasets versus unknown distributions, particularly regarding GANs' ability to produce benign examples.  
5. The reduced iterations in the simulated annealing algorithm may limit its ability to find the global optimum, which could affect the overall conclusions drawn from the study.  
6. The decision to include the ablation study in the final paper is left to the authors, which may lead to uncertainty regarding its necessity.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the assumptions regarding the generative model and its implications for robustness evaluation. A more detailed discussion on the calibration process, possibly incorporating advanced optimization techniques, would strengthen the framework. Additionally, the authors should consider including ablation studies for other norms and provide a thorough analysis of the scalability of the GREAT Score framework with large datasets. Addressing the limitations of using generative models trained on specific datasets and their impact on robustness evaluation would enhance the paper's depth. Furthermore, we recommend improving the discussion on the trade-offs involved in reducing iterations for the simulated annealing algorithm, clarifying how this impacts the findings. Lastly, consider providing a stronger rationale for the inclusion of the ablation study in the final paper to enhance its perceived value.
