### Key Points
This paper presents a study on open-world relation extraction, particularly focusing on long-tailed relations and proposing the KNoRD method. The authors argue that long-tail relations are often explicitly expressed, leading to the development of a method that incorporates prompt-based training, semantically aligned representation, clustering with majority-vote bifurcation, and relation classification using DeBERTa. The KNoRD method is evaluated against several state-of-the-art baselines and shows significant performance improvements across three datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and clearly articulates its assumptions and claims.
- The proposed method demonstrates promising results, outperforming baselines on multiple datasets.
- The motivation for the KNoRD model is relevant to real-world data settings, and it has potential applications for generating weak data labels.

Weaknesses:
- The claim of a Generalized Relation Discovery setting lacks sufficient differentiation from prior work, particularly ARD, which requires more elaboration.
- The assumption of no distribution shift may be overly strong, as known relation classes may not appear in unlabeled data.
- The KNoRD method is limited to sentence inputs and requires human-annotated data, which complicates reproducibility due to numerous hyperparameters involved.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by adding a detailed explanation and comparison of the ARD work to clarify the differences in settings. Additionally, the authors should analyze the poor performance of ChatGPT and provide insights into the prompt design. Justifying the construction of novel classes and the choice of the 15% ratio is also essential. Furthermore, the authors should clarify how samples of long-tail relations are utilized in the problem statement and consider addressing the selection process for the top three tokens in relation representation. Lastly, we suggest that the authors evaluate the split ratio of known vs. novel relations based on actual frequency distributions to enhance the robustness of their approach.
