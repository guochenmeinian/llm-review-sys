Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for capturing the geometry, specular, and subsurface scattering appearance of 3D objects using a dataset of multi-view OLAT images. The authors propose a dual-model approach: a 3D Gaussian representation with a spatially varying BRDF for explicit surface representation and an implicit volumetric representation for subsurface scattering. This framework facilitates material editing, relighting, and novel view synthesis in real-time.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors plan to provide a multi-view OLAT dataset for subsurface scattering objects, which will significantly benefit the vision and graphics community.
2. The screen space shading algorithm enhances the view-dependent appearance quality of the reconstructed object.
3. The dual appearance models effectively reconstruct the geometry, BRDF, and subsurface scattering of 3D objects.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks references for diffusion-based SSS approximation models, such as Jensen et al. (2001) and Donner et al. (2005).
2. There is insufficient validation of intrinsic properties, making it unclear if the method accurately reconstructs these properties.
3. The relighting results are limited to novel views with single-light images, with no exploration of environmental lighting or multiple light sources.
4. The paper does not demonstrate changes in intrinsic properties between different objects.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the validation of intrinsic properties by providing ground truth information for comparison. Additionally, expanding the relighting results to include environmental lighting and multiple light sources would enhance the framework's applicability. It would also be beneficial to illustrate the change in intrinsic properties between different objects, such as from bunny to dragon. Lastly, addressing the missing references for diffusion-based SSS models and clarifying the experimental setup regarding camera exposure and image bit depth would strengthen the paper.
