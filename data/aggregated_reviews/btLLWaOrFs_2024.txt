Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a coarse-to-fine matching approach for point cloud registration, introducing a consistency-aware spot-guided transformer to ensure geometric consistency in coarse matches around overlapping regions. The authors propose a novel feature aggregation method through a spot-guided cross-attention mechanism, which addresses the issue of global cross-attention aggregating features from irrelevant regions. They also introduce a lightweight sparse-to-dense fine matching module for hierarchical pose estimation, avoiding optimal transport while maintaining scalability. The method incorporates local attention for refining transformations based on dense matching, ultimately improving pose estimation accuracy. The authors validate their method against state-of-the-art (SOTA) point cloud registration techniques on three benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance in registration accuracy, success rate, and time cost.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks, including challenging cases with low overlap, validate the proposed method's SOTA performance in registration accuracy and efficiency.  
2. The novel incorporation of geometric consistency enhances feature distinctiveness, outperforming traditional 3D descriptor methods.  
3. The spot-guided cross-attention effectively reduces false correspondences by focusing on local consistency.  
4. The proposed sparse-to-dense fine matching module is efficient and scalable for large-scale registration tasks.  
5. The writing is clear and easy to follow, with detailed explanations and additional experimental results addressing reviewer concerns.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The explanation of "third level" and "fourth level" in line 123 is insufficient and should be illustrated in Figure 1.  
2. The authors need to clearly state their contributions relative to existing work, particularly regarding concepts like "spot," cross-attention, and self-attention, which are also discussed in other methods.  
3. The generalizability of the proposed method should be discussed, particularly in comparison to description-based methods like SpinNet and YOHO when trained on indoor datasets and tested on outdoor cases.  
4. The methodology for obtaining overlap scores is inadequately explained and not illustrated in Figure 1.  
5. The performance on datasets with low overlap is subpar, raising concerns about the method's robustness in such scenarios.  
6. Some reviewers maintain their original ratings, indicating that not all concerns were fully resolved, and there is a lack of compelling reasons for reviewers to adjust their evaluations upward.  
7. The manuscript lacks critical references and visualizations for the spot-guided attention, which are essential for demonstrating the method's effectiveness.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Figure 1 by labeling the coarse and fine matching modules and ensuring that the sequence of methods aligns with the flow depicted in the figure.  
2. The authors should clarify the definition of "spot" in section 3.2 and provide explicit inputs and outputs for each module, particularly the Sparse-to-Dense Fine Matching module.  
3. We suggest that the authors discuss the generalizability of their method more thoroughly, particularly its performance when trained on the 3DMatch dataset and tested on outdoor datasets like ETH.  
4. The authors should provide more comprehensive evaluations, including comparisons of other metrics such as FLOPS, to substantiate claims of efficiency and scalability for real-time applications.  
5. We recommend making the code open-source to facilitate further research and validation of the proposed method.  
6. We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their methodology to ensure that all reviewers fully understand the significance of their contributions.  
7. Further experimental validation could strengthen the case for the proposed methods, potentially addressing any remaining concerns from reviewers.
