Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the first large-scale bitstream-corrupted video benchmark (BSCV) for video recovery, comprising 16,000 publicly available video clips. The authors propose a novel corruption model with three parameters that operates on the bitstream, enabling flexible dataset generation. The BSCV includes a video recovery framework (BSCVR) that demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) video inpainting methods through extensive experiments. Furthermore, the methodology directly manipulates video bitstreams, allowing for a more realistic representation of corruption compared to traditional methods that impose artificial error patterns. The authors emphasize the importance of understanding bitstream packet loss in various applications such as video conferencing and streaming, while also addressing the impact of start code and header corruption in NALUs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed benchmark is the first large-scale dataset specifically for bitstream-corrupted video recovery.
- The dataset, model, and related code are publicly available, facilitating reproducibility.
- The clarity of the presentations enhances understanding of the work.
- The methodology effectively incorporates corrupted content as input, enhancing recovery performance.
- The paper addresses a relevant and timely issue in video communications, making it suitable for the NeurIPS conference.
- The authors provide a comprehensive analysis of the consequences of bitstream corruption on video decoding.
- The proposed method demonstrates competitive performance metrics, particularly in SSIM and LPIPS, compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Weaknesses:
- The target application area may not align with the main focus of NeurIPS, suggesting it might be better suited for other conferences.
- The baseline method lacks clarity, and its novelty is limited, necessitating evaluation against more advanced video inpainting methods.
- The application value of the research is not sufficiently highlighted, particularly regarding practical implications for video quality enhancement.
- The dataset's construction is still somewhat simulated, and the authors should justify its differences from real-world scenarios.
- The discussion on corruption in start codes and headers is limited and requires further exploration.
- The performance of the proposed baseline is not as strong as that of existing methods like FGT and ECFVI.
- The computational demands of the proposed method may limit its accessibility for common researchers.
- The authors need to clarify the limitations of the existing methods they compared against.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the baseline method and provide more advanced video inpainting methods for evaluation. Additionally, the authors should justify the differences between the simulated dataset and real-world scenarios. Highlighting the practical application value of the research more explicitly, particularly in terms of how it can enhance video quality in real-world scenarios, would be beneficial. We suggest expanding the discussion on the implications of corruption in start codes and headers, including whether existing state-of-the-art methods can address these issues effectively. Incorporating higher-resolution videos, such as 1080P and 4K, would enhance the dataset's relevance. Furthermore, the authors should include metrics to demonstrate how their corruption model closely resembles real-world corruption patterns and address the flexibility of dataset construction by providing a wider variety of parameter settings. Finally, we recommend that the authors conduct a more systematic investigation into the effects of bitstream corruption and validate their findings with extensive experiments to strengthen their conclusions.
