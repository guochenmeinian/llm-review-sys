Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into hierarchical modularity in neural networks, focusing on boolean networks and their representation through multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). The authors propose metrics to assess modularity based on input separability and reusability of sub-functions, and they introduce a clustering method to identify modules in neural networks across various tasks. The effectiveness of their approach is demonstrated through experiments on boolean functions and the MNIST dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with clear motivations and a logical flow.
- It addresses an important scientific question regarding the structural properties of conventionally trained neural networks, contributing to network interpretability.
- The methodology combines iterative pruning and network analysis, providing a novel approach to uncover hierarchical modularity without prior knowledge of task hierarchy.

Weaknesses:
- The scope is somewhat limited, focusing on only two properties, with examples that may be too simplistic; larger-scale experiments would enhance the findings.
- The novelty of the contributions is not clearly articulated, and the authors should emphasize technical contributions and comparisons to previous works.
- There is limited discussion on the failures or limitations of the proposed methodology, which could provide valuable insights for further improvement.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the scope of their experiments by applying their method to larger-scale datasets, such as subsets from CIFAR100 or ImageNet, to better link findings to practical observations. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify their definition of reusability and consider encouraging modularity directly in training by adding Eq. (2) as a penalty. A more in-depth analysis of the methodology's limitations and challenges, particularly in cases of failure, would enhance the paper's robustness. Finally, addressing the readability of figures, especially Figure 5B1, would improve the presentation quality.
