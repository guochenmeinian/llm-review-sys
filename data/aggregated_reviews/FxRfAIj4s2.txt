Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a benchmark for evaluating the out-of-distribution (OOD) performance of neural image compression (NIC) models, utilizing spectral analysis to compare NIC with classical codecs like JPEG2000. The authors introduce a new dataset encompassing various distortions and tools for visualizing spectral biases, revealing that NIC models exhibit different spectral artifacts compared to traditional methods. Key findings indicate that NIC and classical codecs prioritize different frequency ranges and generalize differently under varying conditions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper proposes novel tools and benchmarks for analyzing NIC from an OOD perspective.
2. The findings provide valuable insights into the spectral biases of NIC models, which could inform future improvements.
3. The analysis is thorough, with detailed figures aiding comprehension.

Weaknesses:
1. The generalization of conclusions is questionable, as experiments primarily utilize the hyperprior model, which is outdated compared to more recent approaches.
2. The theoretical analysis lacks novelty and empirical validation, particularly regarding the classification of distortions and the evaluation of spectral properties.
3. The paper does not propose new methods to address the identified OOD issues, limiting its practical contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalization of their conclusions by incorporating comparisons with more recent and powerful models, such as transformer-based architectures. Additionally, we suggest expanding the discussion to include more widely used codecs like HEIF, AVIF, and VVC, as well as addressing the limitations of the spectral analysis, particularly regarding Gaussian noise classification. Finally, we encourage the authors to propose practical solutions for the OOD issues identified, enhancing the paper's contribution to the field.
