Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a large-scale dataset aimed at enhancing abstractive summarization in the biomedical domain by utilizing abstracts of cited articles alongside source articles. The authors propose a novel aggregation strategy that leverages the citation network to generate reference summaries. The study includes an in-depth analysis and a variety of baseline comparisons, demonstrating improvements with the proposed methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The introduction of a large-scale dataset is a significant contribution, particularly in the sparsely populated biomedical summarization space.  
- The approach of incorporating knowledge from cited abstracts is innovative and potentially beneficial for decoding relevant abstracts.  
- The authors achieved state-of-the-art performance and provided thorough experimental evaluations.

Weaknesses:  
- There are concerns regarding the extent to which citation information is utilized, particularly given the maximum input size of 1024 tokens, which raises questions about potential information loss.  
- The quality assurance of chosen articles in the aggregation process is unclear, with a need for analysis on the correlation between cited and source articles.  
- The choice of significance testing may be inappropriate; a paired test like the Wilcoxon signed-rank test could be more suitable.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity on how much information is lost at the token level during model input. Additionally, please provide an analysis of the correlation between cited articles and source articles to address potential quality concerns. We suggest discussing how longer input sequences are managed during encoding to ensure effective utilization of external knowledge. Finally, consider incorporating citation function information into the encoders to enhance the relevance assessment of cited papers.
