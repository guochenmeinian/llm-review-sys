Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an Efficient Latent Variable Modeling (ELVM) approach for knowledge-grounded dialogue generation, which integrates a query generator and a fixed off-the-shelf retriever. The authors propose that ELVM enables efficient training without annotated knowledge or explicit retrieval training, achieving state-of-the-art results on various datasets. However, the contribution of the method remains ambiguous, particularly regarding its novelty compared to prior work that has explored similar concepts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for the proposed method is intuitive and easy to understand.
- ELVM simplifies the training process by eliminating the need for annotated knowledge and explicit retrieval training.
- The experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution of the paper is unclear, as prior research has already addressed similar methodologies, such as joint training of query and response generators.
- The effectiveness of ELVM without pretraining is not validated, raising concerns about its performance compared to baseline models.
- Key metrics, such as Knowledge F1, are not evaluated, and the human evaluation lacks comprehensive baseline comparisons.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the specific contributions of ELVM, particularly in relation to existing methods. Additionally, the authors should validate the effectiveness of their method without pretraining and provide comparisons against models trained on R2C2-PT. It is also essential to include evaluations of key metrics like Knowledge F1 and to ensure that the human evaluation encompasses all relevant baselines. Finally, we suggest addressing potential concerns regarding the validity of the proposed formulas and the fairness of the experimental comparisons.
