### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method called **2D-TPE** (Two-Dimensional Table Positional Encoding) to address the limitation of existing approaches that flatten 2D tables into one-dimensional sequences, which disrupts spatial relationships and negatively impacts performance on table-related tasks. The authors propose using rotary positional embeddings to allow different token traversals, enhancing the understanding of tabular structures. The method is integrated into existing Transformer architectures and is evaluated across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating consistent improvements.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-organized, transitioning smoothly from foundational concepts to the proposed method.
2. The 2D-TPE method is insightful, simple, and effective in implementation.
3. Extensive experimental validation provides strong empirical support for the proposed approach.

Weaknesses:
1. The introduction of 2D-TPE may involve excessive computational overhead due to repeated self-attention computations, potentially doubling time complexity ($O(N^2)$). The experiments lack clarity regarding the evaluation of average per-example inference time and whether 2D-TPE can handle long tables effectively.
2. The applicability of 2D-TPE under variations in input formats, such as merged headers or empty cells, is uncertain.
3. The paper does not adequately address the scalability of the method to large datasets or those with high dimensionality, nor does it provide a detailed description of the datasets used.
4. The comparison with only a limited number of baselines raises concerns about the comprehensiveness of the evaluation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by providing pseudocode for dense sections and a more detailed description of the datasets used. Additionally, the authors should explore the scalability of 2D-TPE to larger and more complex tables, and address the potential computational overhead introduced by the method. It would also be beneficial to include comparisons with a broader range of state-of-the-art table understanding methods to strengthen the evaluation.
