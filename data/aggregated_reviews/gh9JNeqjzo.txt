Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel regularization technique for optimizing radiance fields using a closed-form estimation of spherical harmonic coefficients for view-dependent color. The authors propose to leverage this closed-form color to regularize NeRF training, aiming to improve geometry reconstruction while addressing shape and radiance ambiguity. The method shows empirical improvements in rendered depth maps across various datasets, demonstrating its applicability to different NeRF architectures.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a closed-form SH coefficient solver enhances the quality of NeRF-based models.
- The regularization technique is universally applicable to any NeRF method, providing a soft global view-dependent color regularization.
- The approach shows considerable improvement in handling non-Lambertian surfaces, despite some limitations.

Weaknesses:
- The term "volumetric-based" is misused; it should differentiate between "implicit" and "explicit" representations.
- Baseline results are inconsistent with official reports, necessitating a discussion on implementation discrepancies.
- The closed-form color-field solution is point-wise, potentially leading to suboptimal results regarding photometric loss.
- The theoretical basis for bias reduction using residuals is unclear, and the ablation study is limited to a single scene.
- The quantitative improvements are marginal, requiring significantly more training time and specialized implementation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of terminology by replacing "volumetric-based" with "implicit" and "explicit" representations. It is essential to address the discrepancies in baseline results and provide a thorough discussion on the reasons behind these differences. Additionally, we suggest exploring the impact of the closed-form color-field solution on photometric loss and providing a theoretical justification for the bias reduction strategy. Expanding the ablation study to include multiple scenes would enhance the robustness of the findings. Lastly, a more comprehensive evaluation of the computational overhead and the effects of varying SH degrees should be included to strengthen the paper's contributions.
