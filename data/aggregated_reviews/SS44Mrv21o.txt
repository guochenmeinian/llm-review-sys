Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents EARA, a finetuning technique for Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) that integrates Entity Alignment and Retrieval Augmentation to enhance language models. The authors demonstrate that EARA can be applied to various backbone models (BERT, BioBERT, BlueBERT) and achieves improved performance across three datasets. The method is noted for its effectiveness and model-agnostic nature, making it applicable in fields where entity alignment is crucial.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- EARA shows state-of-the-art performance on biomedical STS datasets, indicating its innovative methodological contribution.
- The technique effectively aligns entities in sentence pairs, enhancing model attention to important information.
- The authors provide reproducible results with relevant code and perform useful visualizations and sensitivity analyses.

Weaknesses:
- The paper suffers from clarity issues; sections are confusing and lack cohesion, particularly Sections 4.3.5 and 4.3.6.
- The experimental results lack significance testing, undermining the validity of the findings.
- The novelty of using FAISS for retrieval and the regularization of the attention mechanism is questioned, as these methods are not sufficiently innovative or explained.
- The reliance on older backbone models raises concerns about the credibility of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and cohesion of the paper, particularly in Sections 4.3.5 and 4.3.6, to better integrate these parts with the overall narrative. Additionally, please include significance tests to validate the experimental results. We suggest elaborating on the motivation for introducing the entity alignment matrix and its impact on performance, as well as supplementing the study with results from more recent backbone models. Finally, we advise refining the writing and presentation to enhance readability and ensure that all evaluations follow a clear progression of thought.
