Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Polyner, an extension of implicit neural representation for nonlinear inverse problems in polychromatic CT acquisition, aimed at reducing metal artifacts without requiring external training data. The authors derive a polychromatic forward model and introduce a novel loss function, demonstrating improved performance on out-of-domain datasets and clinical images compared to state-of-the-art supervised methods. The method is validated through experiments on multiple datasets, including synthetic and real-world data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The manuscript is clearly written and easy to follow, with original ideas well-motivated and appropriately discussed results.
- The theoretical foundation in Section 2.1 is robust, and the method shows significant clinical relevance.
- The method outperforms or matches supervised models without requiring training data, supported by comprehensive ablation studies.

Weaknesses:
- The lack of evaluation on real-world patient datasets limits the applicability of the findings.
- The focus on 2D fan beam CT may restrict the method's relevance; extending it to cone-beam CT would enhance its clinical applicability.
- The computational speed is a significant limitation, with reconstruction times being impractical for clinical use.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation of their method by including real-world patient data to validate its effectiveness in clinical settings. Additionally, exploring the extension of the method to cone-beam CT would strengthen its applicability. To address the computational speed issue, we suggest discussing potential optimization strategies to enhance efficiency. Lastly, consider using grayscale representations for CT images to improve readability and facilitate evaluation.
