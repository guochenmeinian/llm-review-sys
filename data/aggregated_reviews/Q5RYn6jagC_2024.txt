Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs), specifically GPT-4v and DALL-E-3, on multi-object reasoning tasks. The authors interpret the failures of VLMs in tasks such as counting and visual search as resulting from a lack of serial processing mechanisms, akin to the binding problem observed in human cognition. They hypothesize that VLMs, while capable of learning compositional representations, do not effectively utilize serial processing, leading to performance declines as the number of objects increases. The authors conduct experiments across four tasks, demonstrating that VLMs exhibit similar error patterns to humans under time constraints.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a cogent framework linking VLM failures to cognitive science, illustrating the relevance of human cognitive processes to machine learning models.
- The research methods are robust, with clear connections between theoretical questions and experimental results across various tasks and conditions.
- The proposed measures, such as feature entropy and the decomposed condition, are innovative and effectively address the binding problem in VLMs.
- The results are interpreted clearly, contributing valuable insights into VLM capabilities.

Weaknesses:
- Some methodological details are lacking, particularly regarding the prompts used in experiments and the parsing accuracy of scene descriptions by the language model.
- The variability in experimental conditions is limited, with insufficient diversity in object features across tasks.
- The paper does not adequately address the implications of using closed-source models, which may affect reproducibility and further investigations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their experimental methods by providing detailed explanations for the prompts used in different tasks and justifying their choices. Additionally, the authors should validate the accuracy of the language model's parsing in the scene description task, potentially including examples in supplementary materials. It would also be beneficial to enhance the variability of the experimental conditions by varying object sizes and shapes in the counting task and alternating colors in the visual search task. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors clarify the process of generating pairs in the visual analogy task and consider applying the decomposed condition to other tasks to strengthen their argument regarding its general applicability. Lastly, addressing the limitations related to the use of closed-source models would enhance the paper's robustness.
