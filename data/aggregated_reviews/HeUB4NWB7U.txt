### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative inductive learning approach for Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKG) called IndMKG, which addresses the limitations of traditional transductive models by enabling generalization to unseen entities and relations. The authors propose a model that generates adaptive embeddings using class-adaptive prototypes and non-specific structural embeddings based on meta-relations, demonstrating superior performance across various scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of an inductive learning framework for MMKG effectively handles unseen entities and relations.
2. The model shows significant performance improvements over baseline models in both inductive and transductive settings.
3. The manuscript is well-written and accessible, with sufficient experimental validation of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
1. The clarity of Figure 1(b) is lacking; combining different performance metrics in one bar plot may not be appropriate.
2. The paper does not adequately discuss the computational complexity or training time associated with the model.
3. There is insufficient analysis of how the model copes with noisy or missing multimodal data.
4. The nature of the datasets used in experiments is not fully disclosed, limiting the assessment of the model's applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Figure 1(b) by splitting it into three smaller graphs to enhance readability. Additionally, the authors should provide a detailed discussion of the computational overhead and training time associated with the model, as well as how it handles noisy or missing multimodal data. Including a more thorough analysis of the datasets and their structural properties would strengthen the evaluation. Furthermore, we suggest incorporating a discussion on future work in the conclusion to outline potential directions for further development of IndMKG. Lastly, consider comparing your approach with existing methods like BLP and RAILD to clarify IndMKGâ€™s relative strengths and limitations.
