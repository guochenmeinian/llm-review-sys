### Key Points
This paper presents a study of double auctions involving $N$ buyers and $M$ sellers trading goods, utilizing an average price mechanism. The authors aim to design a learning protocol that achieves sublinear regret concerning the average mechanism's outcome when agents declare their actual valuations. The proposed protocol involves agents maintaining confidence intervals for their valuations, with sellers bidding according to LCB and buyers according to UCB. The results indicate that the protocol yields $O(\log T/\Delta)$ regret for social welfare and $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret for agents in the optimal solution, with these results being tight.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study of economic problems from an online learning perspective is timely and relevant, with tight regret results and an elegant algorithm.
- The paper is well-written and organized, effectively motivating the problem and elucidating key analysis steps.
- It is the first paper to address repeated double auctions with unknown valuations, providing valuable insights into two-sided uncertainty.

Weaknesses:
- The algorithmic approach is straightforward and lacks substantial novelty.
- The definition of social welfare used in the paper requires clarification, as it differs from standard economic definitions.
- The experimental results are relegated to the appendix, which detracts from the main bodyâ€™s coherence.
- The proof techniques may not extend easily to more general settings, and the use of both instance-dependent and independent regret bounds is unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the social welfare definition, ensuring it aligns with standard economic literature. Additionally, consider integrating some experimental results into the main body to enhance coherence. We suggest making the proof outline more concise to allow space for simulation results. Furthermore, clarify the rationale behind using both instance-dependent and independent regret bounds, particularly in relation to individual and social regret. Lastly, addressing potential issues of collusion and platform disintermediation in real-world applications would strengthen the paper.
