Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method that utilizes text-to-image diffusion models as zero-shot classifiers, demonstrating their competitive performance against traditional models like CLIP. The authors propose a more efficient computation of a subset of the full scores matrix and validate the robustness of models like Imagen and Stable Diffusion against misleading textural cues. The study includes extensive experiments across various benchmarks, showcasing the models' capabilities in handling shape-texture conflicts and attribute binding tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The novel application of pre-trained diffusion models as zero-shot classifiers is a significant contribution.
2. The clear presentation of research findings makes complex ideas accessible.
3. The paper provides valuable insights into the models' behavior, particularly in handling shape-texture conflicts.
4. Techniques such as timestep weighting enhance classification reliability and efficiency.
5. Empirical results sufficiently support the conclusions drawn.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks theoretical discussion on why diffusion models excel in classification tasks.
2. There is a notable overlap with existing methodologies, particularly with "Your Diffusion Model is Secretly a Zero-Shot Classifier," which raises concerns about originality.
3. Certain parameters, such as cutoff_pval and the weighting function, are inadequately explored, leading to ambiguity.
4. The classification process remains slower compared to traditional models, and comparisons with other multimodal models are limited.
5. The analysis of results is weakened by the lack of models trained on the same datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical discussion regarding the performance of diffusion models in classification tasks. Additionally, addressing the overlap with existing methodologies by acknowledging and discussing the similarities and differences with "Your Diffusion Model is Secretly a Zero-Shot Classifier" would enhance the paper's originality. We suggest including a more thorough examination of the parameters used, particularly cutoff_pval and the weighting function, to clarify their impact on results. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to compare their models against more established multimodal models and to explore prompt engineering to strengthen their benchmarks. Lastly, conducting experiments on multiple diverse datasets would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of their methods.
