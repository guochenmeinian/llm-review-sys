Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for joint pose and NeRF optimization on in-the-wild image collections, addressing challenges such as transient occluders and varying illumination. The authors propose a candidate head for NeRFs that utilizes image-level representations to stabilize optimization when camera poses are inaccurate. The method integrates concepts from NeRF-W, BARF, and NoPe-NeRF, and employs DINO-based features for improved robustness. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing techniques like BARF on unstructured Internet images.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper tackles a significant and challenging problem in NeRF optimization under unconstrained conditions.
2. The proposed method is technically sound, incorporating effective strategies from existing literature, such as self-supervised image features and depth supervision.
3. The results show promising improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with thorough experimental validation.

Weaknesses:
1. The main contribution revolves around the problem setting rather than technical novelty, as the method combines existing frameworks with limited innovation.
2. The presentation is sometimes unclear, with figures not adequately referenced in the text and complex notation that can confuse readers.
3. The evaluation is limited to only four scenes, raising concerns about the method's robustness across diverse datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by ensuring all figures are referenced and explained in the main text. Additionally, it would be beneficial to discuss the limitations of the proposed method more comprehensively, particularly regarding optimization time compared to existing methods. We suggest conducting experiments on standard multi-view datasets to assess the robustness of the pipeline across various scenes. Furthermore, clarifying the motivation behind the "candidate embeddings" and simplifying the notation would enhance the paper's readability.
