Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of the training dynamics of deep neural networks (DNNs) through the lens of symbolic interactions, formulating the learning of interactions as a linear regression problem. The authors demonstrate a two-stage dynamic where DNNs initially focus on low-order interactions before progressing to more complex interactions, leading to overfitting. Empirical experiments validate their findings across various architectures.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and clearly motivated, with figures that enhance understanding.
- Mathematical theorems support the statements made.
- The novel link between underfitting-overfitting and the distribution of I_k is noteworthy.
- Extensive testing on various architectures strengthens the findings.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution is not fully articulated, particularly in distinguishing new insights from previous works.
- The presentation is challenging to follow, especially for those unfamiliar with the literature.
- Experiments on textual data are limited compared to vision tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity and readability in the presentation, particularly in summarizing relevant literature and explaining the mathematical framework. It would be beneficial to clearly delineate what is novel in this work compared to prior studies. Additionally, expanding the analysis to include a broader range of datasets, particularly in textual data, could enhance the comprehensiveness of the findings. We also suggest incorporating training loss in Figure 2 and addressing how the initial I_k distribution varies with different initialization scales. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore the possibility of analyzing the exact dynamics of interactions by considering specific neural network architectures and data models.
