Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for regret minimization in sequential decision-making under uncertainty, introducing the average-constrained decision-estimation coefficient (DEC) and the ANYTIME-E2D algorithm. The average-constrained DEC facilitates optimization of the information trade-off directly, while the ANYTIME-E2D algorithm is designed to improve performance in high-dimensional linear bandits. The authors provide empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and clearly articulates the characteristics of existing DECs.
- It identifies issues with current algorithms and proposes straightforward solutions.
- The authors present a specific procedure for obtaining regret upper bounds applicable to both discrete models and linear bandits.
- Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the DEC in high-dimensional settings.

Weaknesses:
- The originality and significance of the work compared to existing literature, particularly Foster et al.'s contributions, are unclear.
- The abstract and introduction may mislead readers regarding the applicability of average-constrained DEC results to high-dimensional linear bandits.
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion on the advantages of the proposed 'anytime' algorithm over traditional methods.
- The min-max problem in the E2D algorithm is inefficient to solve, requiring a dual variable search that could be problematic.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the abstract and introduction to accurately reflect the scope and applicability of their results. Additionally, providing a more compelling motivation for the 'anytime' algorithm and its advantages over the original E2D would enhance the paper's impact. The authors should also clarify the distinctions between their average-constrained DEC and existing DEC formulations, particularly in terms of contributions and practical implications. Finally, including comparisons with classical methods like UCB and Thompson sampling would strengthen the validation of their proposed algorithm.
