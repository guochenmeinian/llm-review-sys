### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of how AI models affect marginalized communities, specifically through outlier detection to identify groups distant from the "norm." The authors utilize a standard dataset and the Perspective API for outlier analysis, addressing intersectionality in NLP-based content moderation. Results indicate that text targeting these groups is particularly toxic, with lower model performance observed.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The approach to quantifying distance from the norm is innovative and relevant.  
- The paper is well-written, organized, and provides a solid background on the topic.  
- The experiments conducted are useful for grounding the findings and demonstrate a thorough analysis of the method.  

Weaknesses:  
- The dataset and methods lack sufficient detail, limiting reproducibility.  
- The novelty of the work is questioned, as it relies on a commercially available model and a single dataset.  
- The clarity of figures and the presentation of results could be improved for better legibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the description of the dataset, including specifics about its origin and the nature of the comments analyzed. Clarifying the "Disagreement-based outliers" vectors and the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) method would enhance understanding. Additionally, providing details on the parameter settings and the implications of the Bonferroni correction would strengthen the methodology. We suggest including results from additional models to substantiate claims and addressing the potential dual-use of the method in the discussion of ethical concerns. Finally, we encourage the authors to refine the figures for better readability and consider the implications of defining "norm" in their limitations section.
