Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for causal effect estimation by integrating experimental and observational data, focusing on "g-identifiable" causal effects. The authors propose a framework utilizing "g-mSBD" operators to develop a doubly robust estimator, which is theoretically sound and validated through simulation studies. However, the contribution is seen as incremental, extending prior work rather than introducing novel methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant problem with a theoretically sound solution.
- The proposed estimator shows promising experimental results and robustness.
- The organization and clarity of the introduction are generally well-executed.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation is dense and difficult to parse, particularly in sections filled with mathematical notation.
- There is insufficient discussion of the limitations of the method and practical challenges for g-identification.
- The title and framing are too broad, failing to convey the unique contributions of this work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by providing intuitive explanations after each definition, lemma, and proof. Additionally, running a clearer example through the algorithm would enhance understanding. The authors should also consider including a future work section to outline directions for further research. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors explicitly discuss the limitations of their method and provide guidance on practical applications. Lastly, we advise revising the title to better reflect the specific contributions of the paper and ensuring that relevant prior works are adequately cited throughout.
