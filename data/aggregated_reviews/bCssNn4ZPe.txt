### Key Points
This paper presents a solution to the challenge of solving linear systems, a fundamental issue in scientific computing, particularly regarding iterative linear system solvers like Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR). The authors propose that bandit algorithms can effectively recommend appropriate relaxation parameters ($\omega$) in an online learning context, where a sequence of T linear systems is encountered. They demonstrate that these algorithms can asymptotically match the performance of the best fixed $\omega$, and contextual bandit methods can utilize structural information, such as the diagonally shifted setting.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The application of bandit algorithms for sequentially selecting the SOR parameter is well-suited.  
- The paper is grounded in a robust theoretical foundation.  

Weaknesses:  
- There is a lack of empirical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of the bandit approach on real-world datasets.  
- The paper does not include an empirical analysis of additional running time.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by providing empirical evidence of the bandit's effectiveness on real-world datasets to demonstrate practical applications. Additionally, including an analysis of the additional running time would enhance the comprehensiveness of the study.
