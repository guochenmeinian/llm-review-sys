Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies the psychological impact of AI-generated explanations on different user groups, specifically focusing on content moderators dealing with anti-Asian hate. The authors investigate two types of NLP explanation formats: saliency maps generated by LIME and counterfactual explanations created using Polyjuice (based on GPT-2). They measure the impact using five metrics: classification accuracy, label time, mental discomfort, perceived workload, and stereotype activation. The results indicate that saliency map explanations lead to better task performance and less evidence of disparate impact compared to counterfactual explanations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper presents a novel investigation into the effects of explainable AI on specific user groups, particularly in the context of hate speech detection.
- It employs well-defined experiments that assess mental states and overall accuracy, demonstrating that saliency maps outperform counterfactuals.
- The authors justify the use of subjective metrics (discomfort, stereotype activation, perceived workload) by referencing established frameworks.

Weaknesses:
- The small sample size of 12 tweets raises concerns about the robustness of the findings.
- The scope is relatively narrow, focusing solely on anti-Asian hate, which may limit broader applicability and visibility.
- The selection of only two explanation methods lacks concrete justification, and stronger models could potentially yield better counterfactuals.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the robustness of their findings by expanding the sample size beyond 12 tweets and including additional forms of explanations, such as gradient-based or attention-based methods. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors replicate their study with other social groups to enhance the generalizability of their conclusions. Additionally, we advise improving the readability of figures, as the text in Figures 1 and 2 is too small.
