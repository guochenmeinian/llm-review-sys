Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for unsupervised feature selection and k-NN graph learning by minimizing Dirichlet energy, which is based on a k-NN graph computed from selected features. The authors utilize Gumbel Softmax to approximate discrete feature selection and Optimal Transport for constructing the k-NN graph. The method is designed to be interpretable and is validated through numerical experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is novel and well-justified, with thorough evaluations and clear presentation.
- The paper is well-structured, and the derivations are detailed.
- The inclusion of limitations and future directions enhances the paper's depth.

Weaknesses:
- The writing is densely packed, making it less accessible; clearer explanations of the method's intuition are needed.
- Limited novelty in the formulation, primarily combining existing works; the authors should better highlight their contributions.
- The experimental comparisons are insufficient, with a need for additional methods and larger datasets.
- The computational cost is high, particularly due to the sorting component, which could benefit from alternative differentiable sorting algorithms.
- The method does not scale well to large datasets and assumes continuous, low-dimensional features.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing to enhance accessibility and understanding of the method. Additionally, the authors should better highlight the novelty of their approach in Section 3. It would be beneficial to include more comparative methods and larger datasets in the experiments to validate the proposed method's effectiveness. We also suggest exploring alternative differentiable sorting algorithms to address the computational cost and discussing how the method could be adapted for non-continuous categorical features. Finally, a deeper explanation of the interpretability of the proposed method would strengthen the paper.
