### Key Points
This paper presents a novel vertical federated social recommendation method called P4GCN, which employs a sandwich encryption technique to protect user-side social networks. The approach separates the social domain from the interaction domain, allowing the interaction domain to utilize any graph recommendation method for user and item embeddings. Theoretical analyses ensure privacy protection, and experimental results demonstrate the model's effectiveness across multiple datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant problem in social recommendation.
- The proposed method is feasible and practical, with extensive analytical experiments validating its effectiveness.
- The sandwich encryption method shows promise for broader applications beyond the current context.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation and problem formulation lack clarity, with key terms inadequately defined.
- The experimental comparisons are limited to outdated methods, lacking recent baselines that could strengthen the findings.
- The paper does not provide sufficient detail on the decoder's role or the computational overhead of the sandwich encryption.
- The results' statistical significance is unclear, and the paper lacks reproducibility due to the absence of datasets and source code.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the problem formulation by defining key terms such as “party” and “social-data-fully-inaccessible.” Additionally, a concise summary at the end of the method section, including the complete formula for the P4GCN layer and updated backpropagation formulas, would enhance clarity. The authors should also provide a detailed explanation of how the model captures user-item relationships, particularly in the context of Figure 3. To strengthen the experimental section, we suggest including comparisons with more recent methods from the past two years and addressing the statistical significance of the results with variance or confidence intervals. Finally, a discussion on the decoder's significance and the computational overhead associated with the sandwich encryption would benefit readers' understanding.
