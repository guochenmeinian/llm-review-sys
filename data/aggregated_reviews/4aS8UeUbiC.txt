### Key Points
This paper presents a meticulous analysis of the problems with current DPOs and proposes an innovative solutionâ€”APO. The authors aim to mitigate reward-hacking by utilizing contrastive examples as \( y_l \) and \( y_w \). The article is noted for its high quality, originality, and excellent writing.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The authors provide a thorough analysis of existing issues in DPOs.  
- The proposed solution, APO, is innovative and addresses significant problems.  
- The writing quality is excellent.

Weaknesses:  
- Evaluations are limited to a single model (llama-3-instruct), which restricts the generalizability of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the robustness of their evaluations by testing the proposed solution across multiple models to enhance the generalizability of their findings.
