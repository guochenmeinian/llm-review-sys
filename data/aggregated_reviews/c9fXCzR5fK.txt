Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel dataset distillation method called SeqMatch, which aims to extract high-level features from later training trajectories. The authors identify a limitation in existing methods that condense low-level information from easy data while neglecting high-level information from hard data. SeqMatch introduces an optimization technique that generates multiple small sets of synthetic data, each capturing distinct knowledge from various training stages. The authors conduct experiments demonstrating SeqMatch's efficacy across several datasets, including CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, where it achieves performance improvements of **0.64%** on CIFAR10 and **0.59%** on CIFAR100. Additionally, SeqMatch-IDC has surpassed previous methods, achieving **51.9%** on CIFAR100.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The concept of condensing different sub-datasets for various training stages is innovative.
2. The proposed method does not incur additional computational costs.
3. The writing is clear and accessible.
4. The experimental results align with expectations, demonstrating the effectiveness of S3 in enhancing training performance.
5. The integration of synthetic data with the original dataset shows promise in distilling high-level information from hard data.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks evaluation metrics for certain settings, such as SeqMatch-IDC on datasets like CFAIR100, 50IPC, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet subset, making it challenging to assess SeqMatch's performance against other methods in these scenarios.
2. SeqMatch underperforms compared to the baseline method FTD on Tiny-ImageNet and ImageNet subset, raising concerns about its scalability to larger datasets.
3. An ablation study is missing, which would clarify the impact of the number of subsets, K, on SeqMatch's performance.
4. The caption of Table 1 is misleading regarding IDC's classification, suggesting a need for a more appropriate comparison.
5. There are citation inconsistencies in the appendix, and the absence of a reference section complicates source tracing.
6. The reproducibility checklist indicates "Yes," but no code is provided.
7. Some concerns regarding the direct addressing of challenges in distilling high-level information from hard data were initially raised but have since been partially resolved.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation metrics for SeqMatch-IDC on the specified datasets to facilitate performance comparison. Additionally, the authors should address the underperformance of SeqMatch relative to FTD and clarify the rationale for its selection in those cases. We suggest including an ablation study to investigate the influence of the number of subsets, K, on performance. Furthermore, we advise revising the caption of Table 1 for clarity and consistency in IDC's classification. The authors should also rectify citation inconsistencies in the appendix and provide a reference section. Lastly, we encourage the authors to include code to support reproducibility and improve clarity in the presentation of their findings, particularly in how SeqMatch addresses the challenges outlined in the motivation. Further exploration of the implications of SeqMatch operating in reverse could provide deeper insights into its performance enhancements.
