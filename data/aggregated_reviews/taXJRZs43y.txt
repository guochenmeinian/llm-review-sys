### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study on intertraining, analyzing how certain source datasets can enhance fine-tuning for various target datasets. The authors demonstrate that (1) the benefits of intertraining can be assessed independently of the target datasets, and (2) effective intertraining models can be identified through linear probing on MNLI. The research includes insights on dataset size and model architecture, proposing a ranking method for model selection based on empirical findings across 22 English classification tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an interesting and relatively unexplored problem with solid experiments across diverse datasets.
- It provides clear takeaways and model rankings that are valuable for practitioners.
- The writing is generally clear and well-structured, with thorough empirical evaluations.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks standard baselines for comparison against the proposed ranking method, which diminishes the clarity of its contributions.
- The overall contribution in relation to existing research is ambiguous, with inaccuracies in the authors' claims about prior work on intertraining.
- Some formatting issues and typos detract from the presentation, and the experiments focus primarily on common datasets, limiting generalizability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their model ranking method by incorporating standard baselines for comparison, such as LogME and MODEL SPIDER. Additionally, addressing the ambiguities in the paper's contribution to existing research by including relevant references would strengthen the work. To enhance the robustness of their findings, consider including a wider variety of test datasets and exploring generalization to visual or multimodal domains. Clarifying the implications of the reported MSE in Section 5 and adding a figure for regression would also aid understanding. Finally, we suggest correcting formatting issues and typos to improve the overall presentation of the paper.
