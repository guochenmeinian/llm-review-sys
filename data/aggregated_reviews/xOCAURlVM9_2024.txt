Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for open-set 3D object retrieval called the Hypergraph-Based Assembly Fuzzy Representation (HAFR). The authors propose the Isomorphic Assembly Embedding (IAE) and Structured Fuzzy Reconstruction (SFR) modules to integrate geometric and semantic consistency while addressing distribution skew for unseen categories. The authors construct three datasets—OP-SHNP, OP-INTRA, and OP-COSEG—to benchmark their approach, which demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The construction of three datasets with part-level annotations provides valuable resources for future research.
- The integration of part-level information using hypergraphs is a novel and promising direction.
- The methodology is clearly described, and the extensive experiments validate the proposed method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks visualization results and does not adequately explain complex equations, such as Eq 2 and Eq 4.
- There is insufficient discussion on the computational complexity and efficiency of the proposed methods.
- The framework does not address scenarios with varying numbers of parts per object, which could limit its applicability.
- The datasets may have limitations in category diversity and size, affecting generalization ability.
- The authors do not discuss the limitations and failure cases comprehensively.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of complex equations and provide visualizations to enhance understanding. Additionally, a discussion on the computational efficiency and complexity of the proposed methods is necessary. The authors should consider expanding the framework to handle varying numbers of parts per object and include experiments on public datasets to demonstrate generalization capabilities. Lastly, a comprehensive discussion on limitations and potential failure cases should be included to strengthen the manuscript.
