Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Occ3D, a novel benchmark for 3D occupancy prediction, which addresses the limitations of traditional 3D bounding boxes by providing a more detailed representation of object geometry. The authors introduce a rigorous automatic label generation pipeline and validate its effectiveness, benchmarking existing models and proposing the Coarse-to-Fine Occupancy (CTF-Occ) network, which demonstrates superior performance. The datasets, Occ3D-nuScenes and Occ3D-Waymo, comprise 40,000 and 200,000 frames respectively, covering various object classes and enhancing research in autonomous driving. The study emphasizes vision-centric methods due to their cost-effectiveness and rich semantic content, while also discussing technical aspects such as the coordinate system used, handling of dynamic objects, and the implications of dataset limitations, including the absence of z-axis translation in the nuScenes dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The motivation for the research is clear, addressing significant limitations in existing 3D perception methods.  
2. The datasets are constructed from diverse and prevalent autonomous driving datasets, enhancing their relevance.  
3. A comprehensive quality check using 3D-2D consistency validates the proposed dataset's effectiveness.  
4. The CTF-Occ network shows state-of-the-art performance, reinforcing the significance of the authors' contributions.  
5. The authors provide a well-structured response to reviewer comments, demonstrating a commitment to improving the paper.  
6. The inclusion of experimental results and detailed methodology, such as voxelization and feature extraction, adds technical depth.

Weaknesses:  
1. The paper lacks citations for several relevant camera-only 3D occupancy prediction methods.  
2. There is ambiguity regarding the coordinate system used for 3D occupancy ground truth in nuScenes.  
3. The benchmarked methods only utilize camera images, raising questions about the inclusion of LiDAR or radar inputs.  
4. The nuScenes dataset's lack of z-axis translation may lead to misalignment of point clouds, affecting label quality.  
5. The mapping of categories between Occ3D and panoptic nuScenes needs clarification regarding the inclusion of the "ignore" class.  
6. The paper lacks a detailed analysis of failure cases, which could provide insights into the limitations of the proposed algorithm.  
7. The choice of a relatively large voxel size may undermine the advantages of occupancy representation, raising concerns about potential trade-offs.  
8. There are unresolved issues regarding the licensing of the Waymo dataset, which could impact the dataset's usability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors improve the related work section by including relevant camera-only 3D occupancy prediction methods such as VoxFormer, OccDepth, and BEV-IO.  
2. The authors should clarify which coordinate system is used for the 3D occupancy ground truth in nuScenes.  
3. We suggest that the authors consider evaluating methods that utilize LiDAR or radar signals alongside camera images to enhance the benchmark's applicability.  
4. The authors should address the potential misalignment of point clouds due to the lack of z-axis translation in nuScenes metadata.  
5. We recommend that the authors clarify the motivation behind including the "ignore" class in the evaluation and its implications for the dataset's utility.  
6. We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of failure cases encountered by the proposed algorithm to present a comprehensive understanding of its limitations.  
7. We suggest including distinct and discernible patterns in the color schemes used in figures to enhance visual comprehension, especially for monochromatic printing.  
8. We encourage the authors to provide a trade-off table comparing different voxel sizes and their impact on performance.  
9. Lastly, we advise the authors to clarify the licensing implications of using the Waymo dataset to ensure compliance and transparency for users.
