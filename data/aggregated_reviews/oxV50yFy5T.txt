Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a benchmark (Lightning UQ Box) for the Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), focusing on two vision tasks and providing both theoretical and quantitative analyses of implemented UQ methods. The authors propose a framework for applying deep Bayesian techniques built on PyTorch and Lightning, offering a reference implementation of various Bayesian techniques under a unified API. The contributions include the implementation of UQ methods, modularity for code reuse, and comprehensive documentation to educate users about UQ.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The benchmark is well implemented, documented, and provides a comprehensive set of UQ approaches.
- The code quality is high, and the number of implemented methods is expansive.
- The paper is generally clear and well-written, with a thorough comparison to existing works.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed methods lack novelty, as they already exist in the literature, albeit not as a packaged solution.
- There are discrepancies in results, particularly between MVE and Deep Ensembles, which require further clarification.
- The application domains are niche, making it difficult to assess the methods' implementation and efficiency compared to prior benchmarks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of results in Table 3, particularly regarding the discrepancies between MVE and Deep Ensembles, and provide more explanations on the observed rankings. Additionally, we suggest that the authors apply their methods to simpler, well-known datasets and compare them against prior implementations to strengthen their claims. It would also be beneficial to describe a unifying umbrella of datasets to indicate where specific UQ methods might perform best. Finally, consider revising Table 1 to separate method types into a "Category" column for better clarity.
