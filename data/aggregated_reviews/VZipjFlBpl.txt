### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the similarities between brain activity and large language models (LLMs), focusing on the underlying reasons for these similarities. The authors investigate how different layers of LLMs align with brain functions, proposing a two-phase process of abstraction and prediction. They utilize metrics such as intrinsic dimensionality and surprisal, comparing these to fMRI data to support their claims. The methodology is robust, involving various models and thorough experimentation, and the paper is well-structured and engaging.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Strong methodology, including the use of different models and checkpoints to explore intrinsic dimensionality and brain-model alignment.
- Clear integration with LLM interpretability literature, providing evidence for phases in model learning.
- Well-written with effective graphics and contextualization of the problem.
- Novel contributions linking intrinsic dimensionality to brain activity prediction and the two-phase abstraction process.

Weaknesses:
- Limited fMRI data from only three subjects, which may affect generalizability.
- The focus on correlational relationships raises questions about the mechanisms behind alignment.
- Some sections, particularly in the discussion, could benefit from further clarification or expansion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the manuscript by including a brief description of the neural encoding model methods in the appendix or main text to enhance reader understanding. Additionally, if Figures 1C, E.2, and E.3 utilize Pycortex for visualization, please ensure the relevant paper is cited. Consider adding a table or brief descriptions for each LLM in the appendix to provide key information concisely. Lastly, please add an "Appendix Section" text label on page 7, as it appears to be missing.
