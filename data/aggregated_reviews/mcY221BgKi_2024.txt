Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents V2X-Graph, a novel framework for cooperative motion forecasting that utilizes trajectories from agents and vector maps as inputs. The authors evaluate V2X-Graph using the V2X-Seq dataset and introduce V2X-Traj, the first real-world dataset for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) motion forecasting, which includes scenarios with multiple autonomous vehicles and infrastructure. The results indicate that V2X-Graph achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, clearly introducing methods and detailing experiments.
- V2X-Graph effectively encodes multiple trajectories with map information and incorporates additional graphs for heterogeneous feature representations.
- The introduction of the V2X-Traj dataset provides valuable resources for studying V2X scenarios.

Weaknesses:
- The method overlooks critical inputs such as traffic lights, lane markings, and pedestrians, which may oversimplify the problem.
- The motivation for why perception completion is insufficient for cooperative motion forecasting is not convincingly articulated.
- The cooperative setting is limited to two vehicles, and scalability in complex environments is not thoroughly discussed.
- There is a lack of error analysis and consideration of communication delays or data loss in real-time applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the limitations of their approach, particularly regarding potential biases in the V2X-Traj dataset and the scalability of the V2X-Graph framework in dynamic traffic environments. Additionally, providing a more detailed comparison with existing GNN-based methods for motion forecasting would highlight the unique contributions of V2X-Graph. Clarifying the architecture overview and enhancing the writing for accessibility, especially in the methodology section, would also be beneficial. Finally, addressing practical challenges such as computational overhead and robustness in adverse conditions would strengthen the applicability of the proposed method.
