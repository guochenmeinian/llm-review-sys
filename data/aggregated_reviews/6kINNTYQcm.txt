Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on adversarial robustness for counting on distributed streams, where inputs may be adaptive based on previous outputs from a protocol across $k$ sites. The authors propose a protocol that achieves an additive $\alpha m$ approximation with $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{k}/\alpha)$ communication, demonstrating no overhead for adversarial inputs. The algorithm involves splitting inputs into blocks and notifying the central server upon surpassing a randomized threshold. A novel concept of partial differential privacy is introduced, which effectively handles generalization regarding sample and distributional accuracy, thus simplifying the analysis of the estimator.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces the problem of adversarial robustness to distributed streams and presents an algorithm that shows no overhead for the counting problem.
- It introduces the concept of partial differential privacy, proving significant generalization properties that may have independent interest.
- The summary of related work is comprehensive, explaining why existing techniques do not apply in this context.
- The relevance of adversarial robustness on streams is emphasized for both machine learning and theoretical communities.

Weaknesses:
- The communication cost is inaccurately stated as $O(\sqrt{k}(\log N)/\alpha)$; it should be $O(k+\sqrt{k}(\log N)/\alpha)$, with the improvement applicable only for $k>\frac{1}{\alpha^2}$.
- The rationale for why modifications to techniques from previous work [13] would not work is unclear.
- The paper lacks experimental validation, which is crucial given the claims of being the first robust tracking algorithm in this domain.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the accuracy of the communication cost statement to reflect the correct bounds. Additionally, it would be beneficial to clarify why natural modifications to the techniques of [13] are ineffective. We also suggest including experimental results to substantiate the claims made about the proposed method's robustness and effectiveness. Furthermore, a discussion on the limitations of the new partial differential privacy notion and its implications for real-world privacy should be included to enhance the paper's rigor.
