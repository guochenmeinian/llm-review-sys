### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach that concurrently learns object dynamics and object discovery from input video pixels. The authors propose segmenting objects and learning the physical dynamics of each through a mask encoder to capture object-centric representations. The method calculates the physical states of the objects using an ODE solver to predict future states. The approach shows commendable performance on two video datasets and is clear and straightforward, with potential applications in various fields such as AI for Science and Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces a novel method for joint learning of object dynamics and discovery.  
- It is clearly written and presents sufficient experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.  
- The method shows strong performance on video datasets, indicating its potential for various applications.  

Weaknesses:  
- The decision to use reconstruction loss without contrastive loss is not justified, despite the latter's potential benefits.  
- The applicability of the module in downstream tasks, particularly in MBRL, is not fully explored.  
- There is a lack of empirical results regarding multi-step prediction performance.  
- The method's adaptability to realistic scenarios involving multiple object interactions is unclear.  
- Evaluation against more complex datasets is not addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve their justification for opting for reconstruction loss over contrastive loss, considering its advantages in temporal and multi-object discovery contexts. Additionally, the authors should explore the module's applicability in downstream tasks, particularly in MBRL, to assess whether robust representation and dynamics modeling can enhance reinforcement learning performance. Providing empirical results on multi-step prediction performance would also strengthen the paper. Furthermore, we suggest investigating the method's adaptability to realistic scenarios with multiple object interactions, possibly by integrating additional modules like Neural Relational Inference (NRI) at the dynamics model stage. Lastly, we encourage the authors to evaluate their method against more complex and realistic datasets, particularly those related to embodied AI and multi-object interactive environments.
