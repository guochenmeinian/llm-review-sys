Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Equivariant Transformer Flow (ET-Flow) for generating high-quality molecular conformations from molecular graphs. The authors utilize rotational alignment, stochastic sampling, and chirality correction to enhance the flow matching framework. Modifications to the TorchMD-NET equivariant transformer architecture are made to parameterize the target vector field. Experimental results on the GEOM dataset indicate that ET-Flow performs well in conformation prediction and can predict ensemble properties effectively.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The writing is very clear, making the method easy to understand.
2. ET-Flow achieves state-of-the-art performance on molecular conformer generation benchmarks with fewer parameters and faster inference times, maintaining high accuracy.

Weaknesses:
1. The experiments on the GEOM dataset are insufficient to demonstrate the empirical performance of the framework; further experiments on large-scale datasets like OC20/OC22 are necessary.
2. The novelty of the work is limited, as it closely resembles existing methodologies, particularly the use of a transformer-based model. The authors should clarify the unique contributions of their approach.
3. The need for a post hoc chirality correction step indicates that the model does not inherently handle stereochemistry, which may pose challenges in practical applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical validation of ET-Flow by conducting additional experiments on larger datasets, specifically the OC20/OC22 datasets, to better assess performance. We also suggest including ablation studies focusing on the flow matching component to clarify the contributions of different elements of the model. Furthermore, the authors should enhance the discussion of the model's novelty and consider evaluating out-of-distribution performance and inference time to strengthen the paper's claims. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore data augmentation techniques to improve the diversity of generated conformations.
