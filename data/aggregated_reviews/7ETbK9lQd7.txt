Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on distributed mean estimation (DME) under communication and local differential privacy constraints, aiming for exact optimality rather than just order optimality. The authors propose a randomization mechanism, specifically the Random Rotating Simplex Coding (RRSC), which satisfies the necessary conditions for exact optimality. They demonstrate that a rotationally symmetric codebook is essential for achieving optimal mean squared error (MSE) while maintaining communication efficiency. Empirical results indicate that the proposed methods outperform existing approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors achieve exact optimality for the privacy-utility-communication tradeoffs in mean estimation, improving upon prior works that only achieved order optimality.
- The paper is technically sound, clearly written, and succinctly lays out its contributions.
- The proposed RRSC algorithm matches the necessary conditions for exact optimality and shows significant empirical improvements over state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Weaknesses:
- Some proofs contain errors or lack clarity, necessitating rephrasing or elaboration for better understanding.
- The design of k-closest encoding and its theoretical justification could be explored more deeply, particularly regarding the choice of k.
- The necessity of shared randomness for achieving exact optimality is not sufficiently discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their proofs and provide better justifications for key statements, particularly in Theorem 3.6. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include a discussion on why shared randomness is necessary for exact optimality. We also suggest that the authors address the notation and clarify the implications of the conditions for optimal DME schemes, particularly regarding the canonical setup. Finally, including a main theorem summarizing the results in the main results section would enhance the paper's coherence and impact.
