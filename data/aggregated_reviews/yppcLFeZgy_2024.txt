### Key Points
This paper presents MutaPLM, a framework designed to interpret and navigate protein mutations using protein language models. The authors propose multimodal protein-textual language models for understanding mutation effects and performing protein engineering, alongside MutaDescribe, the first large-scale protein mutation dataset with rich textual annotations. The framework employs a protein delta network for mutation representations and utilizes a transfer learning pipeline with a chain-of-thought strategy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper attempts to propose a general interpretable model for protein mutations.  
2. It compiles a mutation-text multimodal dataset, providing an excellent benchmark for future work.  
3. The MutaPLM framework is innovative, particularly in its explicit modeling of mutations and use of cross-modal transformers for feature integration.  
4. The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow, simplifying protein engineering for biologists.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The paper lacks clarity on whether PLM representations are residue-level or protein-level, raising concerns about the effectiveness for mutations with few residues.  
2. There is insufficient comparison with fine-tuned protein language models, which have shown effectiveness in downstream tasks.  
3. The necessity of textual annotations is not adequately justified, and the paper lacks a deeper discussion on the role of human-understandable notations.  
4. Evaluation methods are weak, employing baselines not specifically trained on mutations and lacking rigorous assessments of mutation explanations.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding the level of PLM representations used and address the implications for mutations with few residues. Additionally, the authors should include comparisons with fine-tuned protein language models like ESM-1 and ESM-2 to validate their approach. We suggest providing more practical mutation-related downstream task benchmark results, such as predicting changes in protein properties or PPI. Furthermore, the authors should enhance the discussion on the necessity of textual annotations and human-understandable notations, including a comparative analysis with existing methods. Finally, we advise the authors to improve the evaluation rigor by selecting stronger baselines and providing more detailed experimental methodologies to enhance reproducibility.
