Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of the implicit bias of gradient descent in two-layer ReLU networks under a clustered data distribution. The authors demonstrate that while the gradient flow leads to solutions that generalize well, these solutions are susceptible to adversarial examples. The analysis builds on previous works, notably extending the results of Vardi et al. by removing the orthogonality assumption and focusing on robustness in test data. The findings include that even in overparameterized networks, gradient flow does not converge to robust solutions, highlighting a significant gap between generalization and robustness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively builds on prior research, providing valuable insights into the generalization and robustness of two-layer neural networks.
- It presents a clear theoretical framework and proof ideas, making the complex content accessible.
- The literature review is thorough, and the results are significant, particularly the identification of non-robust solutions despite the existence of robust alternatives.

Weaknesses:
- The assumption of clustered data distribution is restrictive and may not reflect real-world scenarios.
- The hypotheses are overly stringent, raising concerns about their applicability in high-dimensional image spaces.
- The paper lacks empirical validation, such as toy experiments, to support its theoretical claims.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their results by relaxing the clustered data assumption to better reflect real-world distributions. Additionally, incorporating numerical experiments would strengthen the paper by demonstrating the non-robustness of the solutions. We also suggest providing a summary table of significant prior works to contextualize the contributions of this study. Lastly, clarifying the implications of the rich regime and exploring the extension of results to other activation functions would enhance the paper's depth.
