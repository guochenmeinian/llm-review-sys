### Key Points
This paper presents Context Steering (CoS), a training-free method designed to mitigate bias in large language models (LLMs). The authors propose a novel approach to utilize context, allowing for a continuous scale of context weight to tailor LLM responses. They demonstrate that CoS can enhance personalization and detect bias effectively, addressing significant societal concerns regarding fairness and ethics in AI.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The originality of CoS as a straightforward method for bias mitigation in LLMs.  
- The societal implications of the work, contributing to the ongoing discourse on fairness in AI.  
- Demonstration of the approach's effectiveness in personalizing LLM responses and detecting bias at human-like rates.  

Weaknesses:  
- Lack of discussion on the limitations of CoS, particularly regarding its impact on LLM inference capabilities and the tradeoff between bias mitigation and inference ability.  
- The organization of tables and visualizations, which could be better aligned with the relevant text for improved readability.  
- Insufficient clarity on the significance of tuning personalization strength and the need for empirical evidence showing user preference for personalized recommendations.  
- Absence of statistical inference in benchmark comparisons to validate improvements over other approaches.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the limitations of CoS, specifically addressing its potential impact on inference capabilities and the tradeoff involved. Additionally, we suggest restructuring the tables and visualizations to enhance readability by placing them closer to the relevant text. To strengthen the paper, the authors should provide empirical evidence demonstrating user preferences for personalized recommendations and conduct statistical inference when comparing benchmarks to substantiate the claimed improvements. Finally, a systematic exploration of when direct prompting versus the CoS-Bayesian inference strategy yields better accuracy would be beneficial.
