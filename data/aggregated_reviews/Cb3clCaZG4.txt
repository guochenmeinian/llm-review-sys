Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for graph classification called graph Bernoulli pooling (BernPool), which integrates node dropping and node clustering through a hybrid pooling paradigm. The authors propose a probabilistic approach that utilizes Bernoulli sampling to maintain diversity during downsampling while preserving graph topology. Empirical results indicate that BernPool outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing representative substructures.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The topic of graph pooling is significant in graph representation learning.
2. The writing is clear and the method is well-organized, making it easy to follow.
3. The proposed method shows remarkable performance improvements over previous techniques and is applicable to various GNN backbones.

Weaknesses:
1. The results appear unusually high, with concerns about the absence of a validation set and discrepancies in experimental settings compared to existing methods.
2. The complexity of the model does not convincingly justify the necessity of its intricate design choices, and the method's scalability may be limited.
3. The motivation for combining node dropping and clustering is vague, and the authors do not sufficiently explain the advantages of their hybrid approach.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind the hybrid pooling approach and provide a more detailed theoretical analysis of why Bernoulli sampling is superior to deterministic methods. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments on larger datasets to validate the effectiveness of BernPool and addressing the stability of the method by providing examples that illustrate the pooling process. Finally, including visualizations of real pooling results would enhance understanding and credibility.
