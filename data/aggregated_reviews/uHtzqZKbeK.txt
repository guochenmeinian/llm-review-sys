### Key Points
This paper investigates the enhancement of mathematical reasoning in LLMs through increased training data, introducing the Skywork-Math model series, which is fine-tuned on a synthetic dataset. The models demonstrate superior performance on mathematical benchmarks, surpassing earlier versions of GPT-4. The authors propose a two-stage SFT approach with data synthesis pipelines, revealing that scaling SFT data can significantly improve mathematical reasoning. The Skywork-Math models, with only 7B parameters, achieve competitive results against larger models, showcasing high accuracy and resource efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper presents a novel data scaling approach, contributing valuable insights for future research and industry applications.
- The Skywork-Math models achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on benchmarks like MATH and GSM8K, even with fewer parameters.
- The article is well-structured and easy to understand, with a substantial volume of experiments exceeding typical workshop standards.

Weaknesses:
- The initial pages contain minimal information, making it difficult to assess the paper's overall quality.
- Additional benchmarks are needed to broaden the applicability of the proposed method, particularly for evaluating reasoning ability.
- The methods section is brief, lacking clarity on the methodology and main contributions, and there is insufficient analysis of the limitations of the two-stage method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methods section by incorporating relevant content from Appendix B into the main body. Additionally, we suggest that the authors test their method on a wider range of mathematical benchmarks to evaluate reasoning capabilities more comprehensively. It would also be beneficial to analyze the limitations and trade-offs of the proposed two-stage method, particularly regarding the potential ceiling effect of increasing synthetic SFT data.
