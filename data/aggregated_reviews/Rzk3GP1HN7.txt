Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SwiftSage, an approach to solving interactive reasoning and planning tasks inspired by the dual-system theory of human cognition. SwiftSage combines a small seq2seq model (System 1) for fast intuitive planning and a large language model (LLM) (System 2) for deliberate reasoning, with a heuristic module facilitating the interaction between the two. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that SwiftSage significantly outperforms previous methods on various textual reasoning and planning tasks, particularly on the ScienceWorld benchmark.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a significant problem in interactive reasoning and planning, proposing a well-motivated combination of seq2seq models and LLMs.  
- The evaluation is comprehensive, convincingly showcasing the method's superiority in performance, efficiency, and exception handling.  
- The two-stage framework of intuitive and deliberate planning is intuitive and effectively implemented.  

Weaknesses:  
- Several related works are not mentioned, particularly those combining LLMs with classical planners and other dual-system approaches.  
- Claims regarding LLMs resembling System 2 in human cognition may be overstated and should be moderated.  
- The reliance on a heuristic for switching between modules raises questions about its robustness and generalizability to other tasks.  
- The motivation for conditions under which the model switches to the Sage module is unclear.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related works, particularly those that explore combining LLMs with classical planners and other dual-system approaches. We suggest moderating statements about LLMs as System 2, addressing the controversy surrounding this comparison. Additionally, we encourage the authors to clarify the conditions for switching to the Sage module and consider providing more robust alternatives to the current heuristic. Finally, we recommend investigating the sensitivity of the method to prompt engineering and exploring its generalizability beyond the ScienceWorld benchmark.
