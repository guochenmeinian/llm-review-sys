Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to Multi-Graded Relevance in a Generative Retrieval setup, addressing the limitations of prior work that focused on binary relevance. The authors propose a framework, GR2, which optimizes for relevance and distinctiveness of document IDs through a regularized fusion approach and a graded, constrained contrastive learning method. The methodology includes a pre-training setup for multi-graded relevance retrieval, and experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem of multi-graded retrieval in Generative Retrieval is significant and previously unexplored.
- Key challenges, such as achieving distinct but relevant document IDs, are well-identified.
- Proposed solutions, including regularized fusion and MGCC, are intuitive and well-formulated.
- Empirical results are robust, supported by thorough ablation studies and detailed discussions.
- The introduction of a pre-training framework shows promising results.

Weaknesses:
- The mathematical notation could be clearer, particularly in "Section 3: Preliminaries," which may hinder readability.
- Important baselines, such as ColBERT and dense retrieval models like Contriever and Tas-B, are missing from comparisons.
- Further experiments on contrastive learning aspects, particularly regarding negative sampling, are needed to strengthen the approach.
- The paper lacks error analysis, which is essential for understanding the limitations of the current method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of mathematical notation to enhance readability, particularly in "Section 3: Preliminaries." Additionally, including comparisons with important baselines like ColBERT, Contriever, and Tas-B would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method. We suggest conducting further experiments to explore the impact of different contrastive losses and negative sampling strategies. Lastly, incorporating an error analysis to identify common mistakes and their causes would provide valuable insights for future research directions.
