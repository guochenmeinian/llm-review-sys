### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach called "DISSC" (Discrete Self-Supervised Speech Conversion) for speaking style conversion in natural language processing. The authors propose a method that transforms prosodic features while preserving phonetic content and speaker identity. Key contributions include a formal definition of the speaking style conversion setup, new fine-grained offline evaluation metrics, and empirical results demonstrating DISSC's superiority over existing baselines. The inclusion of an ablation study highlights the model's control-ability in rhythm and pitch conversion.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed DISSC method advances speech synthesis techniques and offers an innovative solution for speaking style conversion.
- The paper provides a clear formal definition and introduces new evaluation metrics, enhancing the clarity and structure of the research.
- Comprehensive empirical results validate the effectiveness of DISSC, supported by both objective and subjective evaluations.
- The ablation study offers valuable insights into the model's behavior and control-ability.

Weaknesses:
- The paper notes that de-duplication may lead to slight content loss, impacting the quality of generated speech without thorough analysis or mitigation strategies.
- Results are based on limited datasets, lacking large-scale experiments that would strengthen the findings and insights into DISSC's performance.
- The method appears limited to a closed set of speakers, restricting its applicability to unseen speakers, which is crucial for real-world scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of content loss during de-duplication and discuss potential strategies to mitigate this issue. Additionally, conducting experiments on larger and more diverse datasets would enhance the validity of the findings. Finally, addressing the generalization capabilities of DISSC, particularly regarding unseen speakers, would significantly improve the practical utility of the proposed approach.
