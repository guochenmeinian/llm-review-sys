Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a unifying search space design framework for neural architecture search (NAS) using context-free grammars (CFGs), which enlarges the search space to potentially discover high-performance architectures without significantly increasing search costs. The authors propose a Bayesian Optimization method for hierarchical NAS, demonstrating that systems with hierarchical search spaces outperform previous NAS systems. They also introduce a flexible combinator grammar for specifying search spaces, allowing representation and extension of existing search spaces.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The focus on the search space issue is valuable, as it significantly influences the performance of NAS systems. The authors propose a novel method to enlarge the search space efficiently.
2. The application of context-free grammars to model the search space is innovative and allows users to create extensive search spaces through function composition.
3. The hierarchical search space is compatible with existing NAS methods, enhancing its utility.
4. The paper is well-written, with clear figures and descriptions that facilitate understanding.

Weaknesses:
1. Designing a search space using context-free grammars can be complex and may require significant experience. The authors should clarify how this method can be applied to other tasks and provide guidance on grammar design.
2. The discussion is limited to fixed-length problems, leaving unclear how the method applies to variable-length problems common in NLP.
3. The use of CFGs may lead to overlap with previous methods, and pruning, commonly used in CFG-based systems, is not addressed.
4. The improvement presented in Table 2 appears marginal, and the expressiveness of CFGs may limit the search to context-free languages, potentially excluding optimal architectures.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the search space design process using context-free grammars, including practical guidance for application in various tasks. Additionally, addressing the applicability of their method to variable-length problems would enhance the paper's relevance. It would be beneficial to discuss the limitations of CFGs in more detail and explore the potential for pruning within their framework. Lastly, including results on larger datasets, such as the full ImageNet, would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of their approach.
