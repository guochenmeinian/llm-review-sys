Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel regularization method termed 'Meta Generative Regularization' (MGR) aimed at enhancing generative data augmentation through a bi-level optimization framework. MGR comprises two components: pseudo consistency regularization (PCR) and meta pseudo sampling (MPS). The authors formalize the training process as alternating optimization between a primary classification model and a finder network that identifies latent vectors from generative models like StyleGAN. The approach seeks to maximize the utility of synthetic samples by employing PCR to regularize the feature extractor of the classification model, thereby improving generalization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The use of pseudo consistency regularization effectively addresses decision boundary distortions.
- The introduction of a finder subnetwork enhances classifier training and mitigates generator instability.
- The method demonstrates clear motivation and a coherent presentation, with solid experimental results indicating performance improvements across multiple datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of data-driven augmentation methods is questionable, as similar approaches exist (e.g., AutoAugment, Population Based Augmentation).
- The computational expense of the proposed method does not yield superior performance compared to simpler, hand-designed augmentation techniques.
- The experimental comparisons lack robustness, as they do not include essential baselines like CutMix and MixUp, nor do they adequately address the performance of the method on larger datasets.
- The method's transferability to other classification tasks is limited, and the effectiveness in sparse data scenarios remains unproven.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental design by including comparisons with strong baselines such as CutMix and MixUp, as well as other hand-designed augmentation methods. Additionally, the authors should explore the performance of their method on larger datasets like ImageNet to validate its effectiveness. It would also be beneficial to investigate the impact of training the classification model solely on synthetic samples generated by the finder network. Furthermore, we suggest incorporating augmentation in the latent space of the generative model to enhance the diversity of synthetic samples. Lastly, addressing the limitations regarding computational expense and transferability in a more detailed manner could strengthen the paper's contributions.
