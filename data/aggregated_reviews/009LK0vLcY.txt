Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents regression adjusted estimators for estimating the average treatment effect (ATE) under the Bernoulli design, demonstrating that using leverage scores and ridge regression adjustments can yield favorable finite sample variance bounds. The authors contribute to the ongoing debate regarding regression adjustment in randomized control trials and provide simulations that support their theoretical findings. Additionally, the paper presents unconditional bounds on the mean squared error in terms of $\delta$, discussing the implications of selecting an appropriate value for $\delta$, with a practical choice suggested as $1/\text{poly}(n)$, specifically $\delta=1/n^2$. The authors clarify the role of the constant $C$ in their analysis, indicating that it serves as an oversampling parameter necessary for the guarantees of leverage score sampling. The paper addresses the estimation of individual treatment effects (ITE) and ATE, emphasizing the integration of subsampling techniques with classical regression methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper offers finite sample variance bounds for ATE and ITE estimators, addressing a significant problem in causal inference.  
- The integration of leverage scores with regression adjustment is a novel approach that enhances the methodology.  
- The theoretical contributions are robustly presented with thorough proofs, reflecting a strong grasp of the technical tools involved.  
- The authors provide thoughtful responses and clarifications that enhance understanding of the paper's contributions.  
- The proposed choice of $\delta$ and the clarification regarding the constant $C$ are likely to improve the paper's relevance and adoption in the causal inference community.

Weaknesses:  
- The clarity and organization of the paper are lacking, making it difficult to follow the arguments and results.  
- The ambiguity in some theorems, particularly regarding conditional versus unconditional analysis, detracts from the overall soundness.  
- The presentation of the results is somewhat confusing, particularly regarding the necessity of the exact value of $C$.  
- Comparisons to existing methods, particularly the Gram-Schmidt Walk (GSW) design, are not sufficiently detailed, raising questions about the novelty and advantages of the proposed approach.  
- Some reviewers noted that not all points raised in previous reviews were addressed, particularly concerning inference methods.  
- The paper's technical density may hinder readability, as many essential details are relegated to the appendix.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by restructuring the paper to clearly identify the specific problems addressed and the corresponding solutions. Merging related sections and providing explicit remarks on the significance of theorems would enhance comprehension. 

We suggest deriving bounds on unconditional bias and variance to facilitate understanding within the causal inference community. Additionally, specifying the constant in Theorem 7 is crucial for the implementation of Algorithm 1, and we recommend setting $C = 3$ throughout the paper for simplicity.

We encourage the authors to provide a more thorough comparison with baseline approaches, including classical regression adjustment techniques, to clarify the advantages of their method. Furthermore, we recommend addressing all points raised in previous reviews, including the discussion of inference methods, to enhance the comprehensiveness of the paper. 

Finally, we recommend addressing the limitations of the proposed methods in real-world applications, as well as ensuring that all algorithms and terms are clearly defined within the main text to improve accessibility for readers.
