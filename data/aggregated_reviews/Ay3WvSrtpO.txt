Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm using the decision estimation coefficient (DEC) as a complexity measure. The authors propose an optimistic variant of the DEC framework, enhancing the estimation step in the estimation-to-decisions (E2D) algorithm. They demonstrate that this approach can achieve regret guarantees for a wide range of sequential decision problems, particularly for bilinear classes. The paper also discusses the limitations of the original DEC in achieving similar results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written, with excellent technical content and clear explanations.  
- It makes a significant contribution by extending the DEC framework to model-free RL, addressing previously unhandled classes.  
- The comparison of DEC variants is thorough and accessible, enhancing understanding of the proposed method.  

Weaknesses:  
- The rates derived for the algorithm are not particularly strong, with scaling from \(T^{2/3}\) to \(T^{5/6}\), and the authors could provide more insight into the sources of this limitation.  
- The paper relies heavily on existing works, leading to incremental contributions rather than novel results.  
- There is a lack of practical implementation discussion, raising concerns about computational efficiency and experimental validation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the implications of extending model-free algorithms to bilinear classes, clarifying their practical utility amidst numerous complexity measures. Additionally, addressing the computational efficiency of the DEC framework is crucial; we suggest including implementation details or experimental results to support the theoretical claims. Finally, a more thorough exploration of the relationship with constrained DEC techniques would strengthen the paper, either through results or a discussion of the challenges involved.
