### Key Points
This paper presents a hierarchy of $d$-order interaction measures through a family of tests based on factorizations of the joint probability distribution, generalizing to any order $d$. The authors define non-parametric tests to establish the statistical significance of these interactions and connect their approach to lattice theory to reduce computational complexity. They validate their method on synthetic data and a neuroimaging dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of their proposed tests, including Lancaster and Streitberg interactions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and addresses an exciting topic, introducing original results of broad significance.  
- The theoretical connections with lattice theory are novel and contribute to the derivation of interaction measures and statistical tests.  
- Empirical validation with both synthetic and real-world data supports the theoretical claims.

Weaknesses:  
- The computational complexity of the proposed methods remains a concern, particularly for larger datasets, as the number of terms is combinatorial.  
- The contribution of the paper is somewhat unclear, with some claims overlapping with previously published work.  
- The presentation lacks clarity in certain areas, particularly regarding the efficiency and accuracy of the permutation procedure.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by explicitly addressing the current practical limitations regarding data size for their methods. Additionally, the authors should better elaborate on the implications of their results for the HCP data to demonstrate the utility and motivation for their approach. Including a "Limitations" subsection would also enhance the paper's transparency. Furthermore, we suggest providing experimental characterizations of the efficiency and accuracy interplay in the permutation procedure, as well as addressing the significance of higher-order interactions in the context of their findings.
