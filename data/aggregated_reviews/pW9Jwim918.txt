Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method named ReMoDetect that utilizes reward models (RMs) for the detection of LLM-generated text (LGT). The authors demonstrate that existing RMs can effectively differentiate between human-written and machine-generated text. They propose two techniques: continual preference training and mixed human and LLM responses, to enhance the RM for LGT detection. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The study's premise is compelling, leveraging RMs that are already optimized for LLMs, making them a promising foundation for LGT detection.
2. The experimental results are impressive, showing effectiveness across multiple LLMs and domains.
3. The paper is well-organized and easy to follow, with a clear narrative from motivation to methodology.

Weaknesses:
1. The mechanisms behind performance improvements need further clarification, particularly how the proposed pairwise loss function differs from those in other LGT detection methods.
2. The authors validate the accuracy of only one RM after continuous training, which limits the scope of their claims. Additional experiments or a narrowed claim are necessary.
3. The reliance on RMs introduces a semi-white-box detection approach, which may inherently lead to performance improvements that should be addressed.
4. The method's effectiveness in scenarios where only the response is available, without the prompt, remains unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the mechanisms of the pairwise loss function and its differentiation from existing methods. Additionally, we suggest conducting further experiments to validate the performance across multiple RMs, rather than focusing solely on one. It would also be beneficial to address the implications of using RMs in a semi-white-box context. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore the effectiveness of their method in datasets without prompts and provide qualitative analyses of errors and improvements.
