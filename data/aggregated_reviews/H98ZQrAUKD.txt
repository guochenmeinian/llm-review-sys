### Key Points
This paper presents a machine learning framework that integrates optimal transport and variational autoencoders to tackle the spatial multimodal integration problem. The authors propose a method for deriving meaningful representations of spots on the Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) using single-cell spatial multi-omics data. The framework shows promise in enhancing understanding of complex biological systems and demonstrates significant improvements over baseline methods, particularly in LTARI across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The article provides a clear and concise explanation of technical aspects, making it accessible to a broad audience.  
- The integration of multimodal spatial data using optimal transport is innovative, and the experimental results are impressive, showcasing the method's effectiveness.  
- The mathematical robustness of the framework, particularly in optimizing the representation matrix, is well-articulated.  

Weaknesses:  
- There is a lack of in-depth discussion regarding the computational requirements and scalability of the proposed framework.  
- The absence of experiments applying the integrated data to downstream tasks, such as cell type classification or spatial gene co-expression networks, raises questions about the biological significance of the representations.  
- A direct comparison of baseline experiment conditions is missing, which is essential for confirming the impact of the proposed model.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the manuscript by providing a more detailed description of the training algorithm, potentially including pseudocode. Additionally, refining Figure 1 to include precise dimensional and architectural information would enhance reader comprehension. Conducting experiments on downstream tasks, such as cell type classification, would effectively illustrate the necessity of the proposed model. Furthermore, including a direct comparison of baseline conditions would clarify the relative performance of the framework. Lastly, a thorough discussion on the computational requirements and scalability is crucial for researchers interested in applying the model to large-scale datasets.
