### Key Points
This paper presents a prompt-based approach for the event coreference resolution (ECR) task, transforming it into a cloze-style Masked Language Model (MLM) task. The authors conduct an analysis comparing prompt tuning and fine-tuning, demonstrating the advantages of their method. They achieve near state-of-the-art results on a specific dataset while utilizing segment-level contexts instead of entire documents. However, the motivation for the prompt-based method is unclear, particularly in the introduction, and the performance improvement over the state-of-the-art is marginal at only 0.1 F1 score.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel methodology that integrates event type extraction with coreference prediction.
- It includes a comprehensive ablation study and a solid experimental setup.
- The design effectively merges ideas from previous works and serves as a basis for modeling other event features as cloze tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The introduction lacks motivation and reads more like a related work section, failing to clearly present the problem.
- The empirical results do not sufficiently justify the method's simplicity or its computational efficiency compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.
- The paper does not adequately address how new event types would be handled, representing a missed opportunity for broader applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction to better motivate the problem and clarify the significance of their approach. Adding a solid example of event coreference resolution would enhance understanding for readers unfamiliar with the topic. Additionally, the authors should provide justifications for using segment-level contexts and discuss the computational efficiency of their method compared to previous works. It would also be beneficial to address how their methodology could accommodate new event types. Finally, we suggest revising the paper for clarity, particularly in mathematical explanations and terminology, to ensure it is accessible to a broader audience.
