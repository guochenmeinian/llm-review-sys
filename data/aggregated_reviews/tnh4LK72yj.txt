Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal Learning Framework (CMuST) aimed at enhancing urban intelligence through task-level cooperation in spatiotemporal predictions. The authors propose a Multi-dimensional Spatio-Temporal Interaction network (MSTI) to model complex data interactions and a Rolling Adaptation training scheme (RoAda) to maintain task uniqueness while leveraging shared patterns. The framework is validated through extensive experiments across datasets from three cities, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper achieves the best or second-best results in most experiments, validating the feasibility of the proposed method.  
2. It introduces the first continuous multi-task spatiotemporal learning framework for joint modeling of tasks within the same spatiotemporal domain, which is a novel approach.  
3. The paper provides open access to data and code, enhancing reproducibility.  
4. The construction of benchmark datasets for three cities enriches the research field and provides a solid foundation for evaluating the framework's performance.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The authors did not provide details on how they processed the data for the proposed benchmark, which is considered a major contribution.  
2. The MTSI module heavily relies on the Attention mechanism from Transformers without appropriate citations, and its design lacks significant innovation.  
3. The paper does not adequately address the inconsistency issue of feature C across different task data, nor does it provide operational details for continuous task rolling.  
4. The handling of spatiotemporal dependencies is not novel, and the contribution of MSTI may be overstated.  
5. The experiments did not achieve the best results on all tasks, and the reasons for this should be analyzed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing intuitive definitions for multi-task and multi-domain concepts in the introduction. Additionally, we suggest including detailed explanations of the data processing methods used for the benchmark and addressing the inconsistency issue of feature C in the data representation module. It would also be beneficial to provide more experimental details regarding task rolling adaptation to avoid catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include more comparison baselines, particularly those relevant to unified spatiotemporal learning, and to clarify the novelty of their approach in handling spatiotemporal dependencies. Lastly, addressing the cold start problem in experiments would strengthen the paper's contributions.
