### Key Points
This paper presents WFCRL (Wind Farm Control with Reinforcement Learning), a suite of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environments designed for wind farm control. The authors propose interfaces with two simulators, FLORIS (static) and FAST.Farm (dynamic), facilitating transfer learning between different fidelity models. The work includes 10 wind farm layouts, detailing the state space, observation spaces, action spaces, and reward functions. The benchmark demonstrates the application of IPPO and MAPPO algorithms to optimize power production while considering turbine fatigue loads.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant challenge in wind energy optimization by providing a standardized, open-source platform for developing and benchmarking MARL algorithms.
- Clear and detailed descriptions of the simulators, wind farm layouts, and the MARL framework enhance the paper's clarity and accessibility.
- The inclusion of both power production and turbine fatigue loads in the reward function reflects real-world considerations, adding practical relevance.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a discussion on scalability issues inherent to MARL, particularly regarding centralized training and the curse of dimensionality.
- There is insufficient exploration of how to address wind speed uncertainties in MARL applications.
- Safety concerns regarding the deployment of MARL strategies in physical systems are not adequately addressed.
- The experimental section lacks a variety of baselines; additional comparisons with algorithms like COMA, QMIX, QTRAN, and RMA3C are needed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on scalability issues related to MARL and provide potential solutions for the curse of dimensionality. Additionally, addressing wind speed uncertainties in the context of MARL would strengthen the paper. It is crucial to include a thorough analysis of safety implications when deploying MARL strategies in real-world systems. We also suggest adding more baseline comparisons with recent MARL algorithms to enhance the experimental validation of the proposed methods. Furthermore, expanding on transfer learning strategies and results would significantly bolster the contributions of the paper. Lastly, improving the clarity of figures and tables, particularly regarding state space descriptions and notation consistency, would enhance the overall presentation.
