Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a conjugate Bayesian two-step change point detection method for Hawkes processes, utilizing data augmentation and a novel Gibbs sampler for efficient parameter updates. The authors demonstrate that their method outperforms existing baselines in both synthetic and real-world datasets, achieving superior accuracy and efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-structured, clearly written, and self-contained, with all symbols defined prior to use.  
- The experimental results indicate significant improvements over baselines, particularly on real-world datasets, with clearly described settings for interpretation.  
- The innovative use of Pólya-Gamma variables and marked Poisson processes contributes to the method's effectiveness and potential applicability beyond change point detection.  

Weaknesses:  
- Synthetic data results are less robust than those for real-world data, raising questions about statistical significance and variability.  
- The implementation details are insufficiently discussed; important figures and concepts should be included in the main content for clarity.  
- The method's Bayesian approach is limited to the first step, lacking a jointly Bayesian model for change point determination, which could enhance the model's intuitiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the synthetic data experiments by including a broader range of scenarios to strengthen the findings. Additionally, please provide a detailed explanation of the statistical significance of synthetic data results, including the number of runs used for averaging. We suggest moving critical implementation details and background information on Pólya-Gamma variables and marked Poisson processes to the main text for better accessibility. Lastly, consider exploring a jointly Bayesian model for change point detection to account for uncertainty more effectively.
