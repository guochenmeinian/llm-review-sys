### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretically sound method, the Dynamics-aware SDE Diffusion Generative Model (D^3GM), aimed at enhancing the stability and generalizability of inverse problem diffusion models. The authors rigorously analyze the temporal distribution discrepancy affecting transitionary score-based generative models and extend the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process to random dynamical systems (RDS). The proposed D^3GM integrates measure-preserving dynamics to address these discrepancies, guiding SDE diffusion towards stable solutions. Experimental results, particularly in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), demonstrate the framework's effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors provide a novel method (D^3GM) that integrates measure-preserving dynamics into SDE diffusion models, representing a fundamental contribution.
2. The extension of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process to RDS is innovative, enhancing understanding of instability issues in diffusion models.
3. The paper is well-structured, with clear logic and explanations of the theoretical framework.

Weaknesses:
1. The theoretical content may be challenging for readers lacking a strong mathematical background; additional explanations are needed.
2. The empirical study lacks visual comparisons and evaluations of sampled image quality, which would clarify the proposed method's performance relative to others.
3. The connection between the theoretical framework and its implementation is unclear, and there are no discussions on the selection of drift and diffusion coefficients.
4. Comparisons with similar implementations, such as DDBM and I2SB, are missing, raising concerns about the proposed methods' effectiveness against state-of-the-art approaches.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the theoretical sections by adding more explanations to make the content accessible to a broader audience. Additionally, we suggest including more visual comparisons and evaluations of image quality in the empirical study to better illustrate the performance of D^3GM. It would also be beneficial to clarify the connection between the theoretical framework and its implementation, as well as to discuss the selection criteria for drift and diffusion coefficients. Finally, we encourage the authors to include comparisons with more recent state-of-the-art methods to validate the effectiveness of their approach.
