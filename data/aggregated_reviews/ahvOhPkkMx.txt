### Key Points
This paper presents a method for quantifying model-agnostic goodness of fit (GoF) to facilitate comparisons between models. The authors propose a test statistic called Zipper, which addresses the degeneracy issue under the null hypothesis of equal goodness by splitting the test set into overlapping subsets. This approach allows for better utilization of limited test data and improves power over previous solutions. The paper discusses applications in specification testing, model selection, and variable importance assessments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The proposed method is sound and addresses a practical issue of limited test data effectively.  
2. The motivation for the Zipper test statistic is clear, and its benefits over predecessors are well-articulated through theoretical analysis.  
3. The algorithm is straightforward, enhancing its practical applicability.  

Weaknesses:  
1. Concerns exist regarding the novelty and significance of the contribution; further clarification is needed.  
2. The paper lacks self-containment, particularly in discussing referenced works and conditions in the appendix, which could hinder readability.  
3. The numerical experiments are not comprehensive enough to convincingly demonstrate Zipper's advantages over other methods.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the self-containment of the paper by providing informal discussions of the conditions referenced in the appendix and elaborating on the contributions of Williamson et al. to enhance clarity. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with other methods used in variable importance testing in the related work section. The authors should also consider making the numerical results more comprehensive by clarifying the presentation in Tables 1 and 2, and by providing both power and size results. Finally, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the variance estimator's role in power enhancement and to clarify the advantages of Zipper in comparison to baseline methods in their results.
