### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of knowledge graphs (KG) and knowledge sequences (KS) in the context of knowledge-grounded dialogues, aiming to compare their strengths and limitations. The authors conduct experiments using three different architectures across four datasets to evaluate the performance of these knowledge representations. They address three main questions: the comparative effectiveness of graphs versus sequences, the mutual adaptability of models and knowledge, and the performance of various knowledge forms in few-shot settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-structured and clearly presents its scientific goals.  
- The experiments yield valuable insights regarding the performance of different architectures and knowledge representations.  
- Findings indicate that knowledge graphs outperform generation quality and generalizability, while knowledge sequences excel in factual consistency.  
- The appendix contains an exhaustive set of experiments that enrich the study.

Weaknesses:  
- The writing is difficult to follow due to excessive abbreviations and confusing terminology.  
- The study relies on only three datasets, limiting the generalizability of its conclusions.  
- Dialog evaluation metrics used are outdated and do not correlate well with human judgment.  
- The paper lacks a discussion on various graph embedding approaches and their interplay with response generation systems.  
- Missing references to recent surveys on the topic detract from the paper's comprehensiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing by reducing abbreviations and providing clearer definitions for terms such as "autoregressive" and "knowledge sequence." Additionally, we suggest conducting statistical significance tests to strengthen claims regarding the superiority of dual encoder models. The authors should also consider incorporating a discussion on the role of prompting in response generation and explore various graph embedding approaches. Finally, we advise that the authors integrate key findings from the appendix into the main text to enhance the overall message of the paper.
