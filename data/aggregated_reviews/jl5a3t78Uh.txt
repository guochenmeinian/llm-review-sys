Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of various energy-based learning (EBL) algorithms, including contrastive learning (CL), equilibrium propagation (EP), and coupled learning (CpL), using deep convolutional Hopfield networks (DCHNs) across multiple datasets. The authors evaluate nine variants of EP and CpL, concluding that the centered variant of EP outperforms others. The study establishes state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for some algorithms while highlighting the limitations of EBL methods compared to modern neural networks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper provides a systematic comparison of different EBL algorithms, contributing to a robust understanding of their performance across various datasets.  
- The experiments are well-detailed, and the theoretical results support empirical findings, particularly regarding the superiority of certain EBL variants.  
- The work is well-written and organized, making complex concepts accessible.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks novelty, offering no new solutions for efficient energy design or learning.  
- There is insufficient discussion of recent works on energy-based models relevant to the topic, which could enhance the context of the research.  
- The theoretical results appear disconnected from the main findings, lacking a clear narrative connection.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the generalizability of their findings beyond DCHNs and large-scale data. Additionally, the authors should incorporate a discussion of recent relevant works on energy-based models, such as those by Grathwohl et al. (2019) and Nijkamp et al. (2019), to contextualize their research. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors clarify the implications of their theoretical results and establish a stronger connection to the empirical findings. Lastly, emphasizing the novelty of NEP, NCpL, and CCpL in the revisions would strengthen the paper's contribution.
