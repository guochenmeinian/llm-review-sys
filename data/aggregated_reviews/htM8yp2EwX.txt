Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a high-dimensional mediation analysis detection procedure that controls for false discoveries. The authors propose a local FDR-based method to identify mediators, utilizing a data-driven approach for estimating null densities and determining thresholds. The method is particularly relevant in contexts where a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) influences gene expression through methylation levels at CpGs. The authors demonstrate that their approach achieves high statistical power while maintaining good FDR control, outperforming existing methods in both simulation and empirical studies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The application of multiple testing in high-dimensional mediation analysis is compelling.
- The local FDR approach leverages across-dimensional information, with test statistics and thresholds estimated from data.
- The method is theoretically justified and empirically validated, showing improved power in identifying mediators.

Weaknesses:
- The paper is highly technical, lacking sufficient introduction and motivation regarding local FDR, its relevance in mediation analysis, and potential obstacles.
- The presentation is compressed, with many details relegated to the appendix, which may hinder reader comprehension.
- Some assumptions are unclear or appear overly strong, particularly regarding confounding and distributional requirements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by addressing key questions about local FDR, its significance in mediation analysis, and potential challenges. Additionally, enhancing the clarity of assumptions and providing a discussion on their implications would strengthen the paper. We suggest including a limitations section to outline the method's boundaries and conditions under which it may not perform optimally. Furthermore, revising the presentation to reduce density and ensure critical details are accessible would benefit reader understanding.
