Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a hierarchical distance structural encoding (HDSE) method that enhances graph transformers by incorporating hierarchical structural information. The authors propose using graph coarsening techniques to improve the model's performance on both node-level and graph-level tasks. The theoretical analysis indicates improvements in expressiveness and generalization, supported by empirical results across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The method is novel and integrates coarsening technology, making it easy to understand and implement.  
- The paper is well-organized, clearly written, and provides a theoretical guarantee regarding expressiveness and generalization.  
- Comprehensive experiments evaluate the model's performance on diverse graph types, with significant improvements noted on specific datasets.  

Weaknesses:  
- The complexity of the graph partitioning/coarsening preprocess may pose challenges.  
- Missing experimental results for certain models reduce the paper's convincingness.  
- The performance on large-scale heterophilic graphs remains untested, and the variability of results with different coarsening algorithms requires further discussion.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental settings, particularly regarding the use of different models with HDSE for graph-level tasks. Additionally, addressing the missing results in Tables 2 and 5 is crucial for enhancing the paper's credibility. To further validate the model's performance, we suggest conducting experiments on large-scale heterophilic datasets such as pokec, snap-patents, and wiki. Furthermore, a detailed discussion on the impact of different coarsening algorithms on performance should be included, along with a theoretical analysis of optimal hierarchical structural information.
