Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies the impact of downstream thresholding operations on continuous prediction scores, arguing that inappropriate thresholding can exacerbate or mitigate disparities in predictive performance across groups defined by protected attributes. The authors propose a causal framework to disentangle disparities in predictive scores from those introduced by thresholding. The paper introduces new notions of business necessity based on causal graphs and explores how thresholding affects fairness in binary decisions influenced by sensitive attributes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses the important issue of bias amplification in machine learning and decision-making pipelines.
- It presents interesting ideas that could have significant real-world policy implications, particularly through its technical definitions of business necessity.
- The study is relatively comprehensive, including decomposition, identification, proofs, and examples.

Weaknesses:
- The writing and presentation are often convoluted, making it difficult to evaluate the paperâ€™s claims. Key definitions, such as those in Definition 3, are unclear or incorrect.
- The paper lacks a detailed discussion on how thresholds are chosen, which raises questions about the generalizability of its claims.
- There is insufficient engagement with related literature on post-processing fairness methods and the impact of thresholding on decision-making.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their writing and presentation, particularly by revising Definition 3 to ensure it accurately reflects the intended relationships between weak and strong business necessity. Additionally, the authors should clarify the notation used in key definitions and theorems to eliminate ambiguity.

We suggest that the authors provide a more thorough discussion on how thresholds are selected, including an exploration of group-specific thresholds as proposed in the literature. An expanded comparison with existing fairness methods would enhance the paper's contribution.

Finally, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the limitations related to the assumptions of structural causal models, particularly concerning the margin complement and its implications for fairness in various contexts.
