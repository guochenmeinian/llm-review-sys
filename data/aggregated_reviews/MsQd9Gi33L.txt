### Key Points
This paper presents a new graph contrastive learning method, named ROSEN, aimed at addressing the limitations of existing approaches for heterophilous graphs. The authors argue that the encoder design and positive sample collection in current methods are inadequate for such graphs. ROSEN leverages the block diagonal properties of homophilous graph structures and incorporates a self-supervised structure inference module to generate discriminative node representations. The framework is theoretically grounded in the expectation-maximization algorithm and has been validated through extensive experiments on publicly available datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The research topic is significant and relevant to the graph machine learning community.  
2. The paper is relatively well-written and presents complex techniques in an accessible manner.  
3. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing remarkable performance improvements on heterophilous graphs.

Weaknesses:  
1. The presentation of the paper is poor, with numerous typos and unclear sections.  
2. The experimental analyses are insufficient, particularly regarding the robustness of the proposed model to noise.  
3. The theoretical analysis lacks intuitive interpretations, and the connection between the theorem and the model's performance is not adequately explained.  
4. The authors do not discuss existing works on self-supervised learning for heterophilous graphs, nor do they compare with methods using heterophily GNNs as backbones.  
5. The complexity and efficiency of the proposed method are not addressed.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and presentation of the manuscript, addressing typos and unclear sections. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion of existing self-supervised learning methods for heterophilous graphs and conducting comparisons with heterophily GNNs. The authors should provide more detailed experimental analyses, particularly regarding noise robustness, and include intuitive interpretations of the theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we advise the authors to clarify the implications of their method's complexity and efficiency, and to report selected hyperparameters used in their experiments. Lastly, we encourage the authors to consider testing their method on more realistic benchmarks, such as the Open Graph Benchmark.
