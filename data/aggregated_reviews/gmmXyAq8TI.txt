Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a memory-system-aware rematerialization method called Coop, which addresses memory fragmentation in tensor rematerialization for deep learning frameworks. The authors propose three new memory management methods: a sliding window algorithm, cheap tensor partitioning, and a recomputable in-place mechanism, which collectively enhance checkpointing with reduced computation overhead and memory consumption. Experiments demonstrate that Coop can achieve up to 2x memory savings compared to prior methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized and easy to follow.
- The perspective on memory fragmentation is novel and enhances gradient checkpointing.
- Results show significant improvements across eight neural networks.
- Implementation details are provided in the supplementary material.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks hardware specifications in Table 1, which is crucial for understanding cost density.
- The classification of tensors into "cheap" and "expensive" may oversimplify the continuous distribution of cost densities in computation graphs.
- The omission of end-to-end training time as an evaluation metric is a significant oversight.
- The discussion on static versus dynamic computation graphs is insufficient, particularly given the predominance of static structures in the experiments.
- The requirement for a specific type of memory allocator limits the method's applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve Table 1 by including hardware specifications and discussing arithmetic intensity. Additionally, consider expanding the classification of tensors beyond two categories to better reflect the continuous nature of cost densities. It is essential to include end-to-end training time as a critical evaluation metric. We suggest a more thorough discussion of dynamic computation graphs, particularly regarding the implications of unevictable tensors. Lastly, clarify the assumptions regarding the memory allocator's capabilities and explore alternative allocators that may not support the proposed method.
