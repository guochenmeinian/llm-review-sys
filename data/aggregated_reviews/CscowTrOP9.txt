Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Fourier-enhanced Implicit Neural Fusion Network (FeINFN) designed for Multispectral and Hyperspectral Image Fusion (MHIF). The authors propose integrating Fourier transformations within an Implicit Neural Representation framework to mitigate the loss of high-frequency information, a common issue in existing methods. Key contributions include transforming latent features into the frequency domain to enhance high-frequency details and introducing a complex Gabor wavelet activation function to improve feature representation and fusion. Experiments on two benchmark MHIF datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing approaches both visually and quantitatively.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Originality: The paper offers a novel solution to the MLP-ReLU high-frequency information loss by leveraging domain transformation.
- Quality: The arguments are supported by theoretical proofs and experimental evidence.
- Clarity: The organization and clarity of the content facilitate understanding.
- Significance: The proposed method has the potential to significantly impact the field of computer vision.

Weaknesses:
- Complexity: Certain methodological aspects, particularly theoretical proofs and implementation details, may be challenging for readers without additional clarification.
- Quality Metrics: The paper lacks explanations for the calculation methods of the four metrics (PSNR, SAM, ERGAS, SSIM).
- Experimental Section: The performance of the proposed method on other datasets or image fusion tasks is not addressed, which could enhance the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of complex methodology sections, particularly the theoretical proofs, to aid reader comprehension. Additionally, the authors should provide detailed explanations of the four quality metrics used in the experiments. It would be beneficial to include experiments on other datasets to evaluate the proposed method's versatility. Furthermore, addressing the questions regarding the Fourier transformation's contribution to performance improvements and the optimal bandwidth in Theorem 1 would enhance the paper's rigor. Lastly, correcting the editing errors noted in the reviews and ensuring consistent vertical axis scales in figures would improve presentation quality.
