### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of a Bayesian network framework for modeling correlations in agents' action selections within their joint policy. It builds on previous work that established global convergence to Nash equilibria under a tabular softmax policy parameterization, providing non-asymptotic convergence results. The authors articulate the problem setting and motivation effectively, contributing novel insights to the field.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The writing is clear, facilitating understanding for reviewers unfamiliar with prior work.
- The contribution is significant, addressing gaps in existing literature.
- The work is original and offers valuable theoretical insights for the specified setting.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a discussion on the complex bounds obtained, which could enhance readability and strengthen the case for the results.
- There is no empirical evaluation, which is noted as a limitation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the bounds obtained, particularly how individual variables influence them and provide practical recommendations based on these insights. Additionally, we suggest incorporating empirical evaluations to complement the theoretical findings. Lastly, we encourage the authors to define the quantity $V_{\bar{\pi}^i, \pi^{-i}}$ on line 59 and consider using more compact notation to enhance readability.
