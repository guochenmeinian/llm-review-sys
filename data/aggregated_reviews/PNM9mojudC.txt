### Key Points
This paper presents ATAT, an automated algorithm designed to infer a path across samples with varying morphologies from H&E stained images. This path is crucial for joint analysis with spatial transcriptomics, facilitating the exploration of significant biomedical questions. The authors propose a transition from a labor-intensive process to an AI-driven automatic method, demonstrating substantial potential for real-world applications. The workflow is well-articulated, and the machine learning model is appropriately trained and applied.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The method is applicable to new samples without extensive re-training and effectively handles batch effects.
2. The gene expression trajectory derived from ATAT can be validated against existing pathological knowledge.
3. The manuscript is clearly written, making it accessible even to researchers unfamiliar with pathological data.

Weaknesses:
1. The reliance on “minimum distance” in both Dijkstra path finding and tile alignment lacks a robust justification, as the authors do not provide concrete evidence for selecting the shortest path.
2. The results section would benefit from additional experiments; specifically, the standard deviations for aligned tiles at the same path point are not evaluated, which could enhance the validity of the findings.
3. The color map of the path should be revised, as the red color at both ends complicates figure readability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the use of “minimum distance” by providing concrete biological evidence for the selection of the shortest path. Additionally, we suggest including more experiments in the results section, particularly evaluating the standard deviations for aligned tiles at the same path point to strengthen the findings. Lastly, we advise changing the color map of the path to enhance figure clarity.
