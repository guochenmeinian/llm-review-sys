### Key Points
This paper presents the Prejudice-Volatility Framework (PVF) for studying bias and societal discrimination in large language models (LLMs). The authors define discrimination as consisting of a base prejudice against specific groups and a volatility arising from contextual variations of this prejudice. The framework distinguishes between prejudice risk from systemic bias and volatility risk from inconsistencies in outputs. The PVF is empirically tested on 12 LLMs, revealing significant gender and racial biases, and introduces metrics for assessing these biases.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The framework is well-defined and offers a nuanced analysis of discrimination by separating prejudice and volatility.
2. The empirical evaluation across various open-source models is robust and reveals important findings about biases in LLMs.
3. The mathematical definition of stereotype distribution is a significant contribution to the field.

Weaknesses:
1. The analysis primarily focuses on gender and racial biases, potentially overlooking other significant forms of discrimination.
2. Some figures and illustrations, particularly Figures 2, 3, and 4, are complex and difficult to comprehend.
3. The dataset construction and the clarity of the empirical results require further elaboration.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Figures 2, 3, and 4 by simplifying them and reducing the amount of information presented. Additionally, the authors should clarify the dataset used for fine-tuning LLama2 and provide excerpts from the datasets used in Tables 1 and 2 for better transparency. Expanding the discussion on the limitations of the framework to include other biases and the implications of using a single data source, such as Wikipedia, would enhance the manuscript. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors explore techniques to balance prejudice and volatility when multiple biases are involved, and consider including empirical results across various professions to enrich the analysis.
