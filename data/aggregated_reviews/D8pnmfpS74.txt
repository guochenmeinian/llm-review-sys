### Key Points
This paper presents a Unified Uncertainty Estimation (UCD) approach for cognitive diagnosis models, addressing uncertainty estimation in both traditional and deep learning models. The UCD method includes a unified objective function for mini-batch optimization, a derivative reparameterization approach for efficient training, and a differentiation between diagnostic and function parameters to decompose uncertainty into data and model aspects. The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations of methodology and experiments, although some technical details may challenge readers unfamiliar with Bayesian methods. The UCD approach demonstrates versatility and applicability through comprehensive experiments across various models and datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper provides a clear structure and detailed explanations of the methodology, mathematical derivations, and experimental setups.
2. UCD offers improved efficiency and is applicable to both traditional and deep learning models, filling a significant gap in the field.
3. The method is validated through extensive experiments, demonstrating robustness and reliability.

Weaknesses:
1. Certain aspects of the explanation of charts and formulas require clearer clarification for better reader comprehension.
2. The paper may lack innovation in its application of previously established Bayesian strategies and reparameterization methods.
3. The explanation of experimental results regarding model uncertainty is insufficiently clear, and experiments related to RQ4 could be further enriched.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the explanations surrounding model uncertainty and the experimental results in RQ2. Additionally, we suggest providing variance information alongside mean results in the experiments and highlighting better results in tables for easier comparison. Addressing minor errors, such as correcting "limited inefficiency" to "limited efficiency" and ensuring consistent labeling in figures and titles, would enhance the overall quality of the paper.
