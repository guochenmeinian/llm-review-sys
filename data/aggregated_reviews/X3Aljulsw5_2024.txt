Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel zero-order sampling algorithm, Zeroth-Order Diffusion Monte Carlo (ZOD-MC), aimed at sampling from arbitrary non-logconcave probability distributions using only the unnormalized density. The authors propose a rejection sampling technique to estimate scores in a reverse Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, supported by a convergence analysis under weak assumptions. They conduct numerical experiments primarily in low-dimensional settings, comparing ZOD-MC against recent denoising and MCMC approaches, demonstrating its superior performance at equivalent computational budgets. The authors provide practical guidelines for setting the hyperparameters of ZOD-MC, emphasizing the need for precise tuning. They acknowledge that ZOD-MC is limited to low-dimensional settings due to the curse of dimensionality inherent in rejection sampling and clarify the initialization process for SLIPS. The authors also address concerns regarding the sampling error and hyperparameter settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-structured, presenting motivations and algorithmic foundations logically.  
- The theoretical results, particularly Theorem 1, are clearly articulated.  
- The experiments address interesting cases of multi-modal distributions, showcasing the method's practical applicability.  
- The authors provide practical guidelines for hyperparameter tuning, enhancing applicability for practitioners.  
- The acknowledgment of complementary strengths and weaknesses between ZOD-MC and SLIPS fosters a balanced perspective.  
- The authors effectively address reviewer concerns and clarify methodological aspects, particularly regarding the initialization of SLIPS and score estimation error.

Weaknesses:  
- The comparison to related work is incomplete, notably missing the SLIPS method, which could provide a more comprehensive context.  
- The reliance on rejection sampling limits the method's applicability to low-dimensional settings, which is not sufficiently emphasized in the main text.  
- The numerical experiments lack details on hyperparameter tuning and do not adequately report variance or robustness across different settings.  
- The requirement for knowledge of local minima in the target distribution is not adequately highlighted, which may mislead readers regarding the method's applicability.  
- The low importance of score estimation for large \( t \) is not sufficiently emphasized, leading to potential confusion.  
- The manuscript lacks detailed methodological guidelines and ablation studies that could improve clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by including a comparison with SLIPS and other relevant methods such as AIS or SMC to provide a more comprehensive context. Additionally, we suggest clearly highlighting the limitations of ZOD-MC regarding dimensionality in the main text, rather than relegating it to the appendix. We also recommend adding a dedicated 'Limitations' section in the main text, as suggested by NeurIPS guidelines, to improve the visibility of ZOD-MC's limitations. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the requirement for local minima knowledge in the main body of the paper to avoid potential misunderstandings about the method's applicability. We encourage the authors to provide more detailed explanations of the hyperparameters used in their experiments, including the analytical formulas for \( T \), \( N \), and \( \gamma \), to enhance the reproducibility of their results. Lastly, it is crucial to highlight that ZOD-MC requires the use of 1st/2nd order methods for effective proposal distribution in the rejection sampling phase, as the current title and abstract may mislead readers regarding the methodology's nature.
