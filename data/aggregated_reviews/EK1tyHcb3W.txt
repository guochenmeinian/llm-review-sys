Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies the sample complexity of posted pricing problems in single-item auctions, where buyers arrive sequentially with valuations drawn from fixed distributions. The authors propose methods to derive sample complexity bounds for both revenue and welfare maximization tasks under independent and correlated settings. They provide nearly matching upper and lower bounds on sample complexity, showing a significant improvement over previous work by removing the dependence on the number of buyers, \( n \).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem of learning posted-prices auctions is of significant interest and has numerous applications.
- The results derived are almost tight and represent a clear mathematical contribution.
- The proofs, particularly for welfare maximization in independent valuations, are well-structured and elegant.

Weaknesses:
- The conceptual contributions feel somewhat incremental given the extensive prior work in optimal auctions.
- The results are limited to a simple setting of single-item auctions, and the running time for correlated distributions is exponential.
- The paper lacks a concluding discussion and experimental evidence to support practical implications of the theoretical results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation by clarifying terminology, such as replacing "policy" with a term more suitable for a single-shot setting. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include a concluding discussion that summarizes the implications of the findings. We suggest providing experimental evidence to illustrate how the theoretical bounds perform in practical scenarios. Furthermore, addressing how independent samples from bidders' valuations can be obtained in practice would enhance the exposition. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore alternative settings that could mitigate the \( \Omega(n/\epsilon^2) \) sample complexities incurred by their approach.
