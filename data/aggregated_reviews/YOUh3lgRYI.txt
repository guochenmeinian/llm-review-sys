### Key Points
This paper presents a dual learning framework for spatial image-to-text (SI2T) and text-to-image (ST2I) tasks, introducing a novel 3D scene graph (3DSG) representation to enhance spatial feature modeling. The authors propose a Spatial Dual Discrete Diffusion (SD3) system that effectively utilizes intermediate features from 3D→X processes to guide X→3D processes. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing T2I and I2T models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The dual learning framework with 3DSG representation is a novel approach that enhances 3D spatial feature modeling.
2. The Spatial Dual Discrete Diffusion framework is simple yet effective, leveraging intermediate features to improve performance.
3. Extensive experiments validate the method's effectiveness, showing competitive performance against previous models.

Weaknesses:
1. The methods compared in Table 2 are outdated; the authors should include comparisons with the latest state-of-the-art methods, such as DALLE-3 and Stable Diffusion series.
2. The authors should present failure cases to analyze the shortcomings of the proposed method, particularly regarding the reliability of the 3D scene graph in generating outputs.
3. There is a lack of clarity on the number of node categories in the 3DSG and how high-level spatial concepts are defined, necessitating further discussion.
4. The efficiency of the training process is a concern; a computational complexity analysis should be provided.
5. The reliance on human evaluation for spatial assessment could be complemented with automated techniques for a more comprehensive evaluation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparisons by including the latest state-of-the-art methods in their evaluations. Additionally, presenting failure cases would help analyze the limitations of the 3DSG outputs. The authors should discuss the definition of high-level spatial concepts and the compatibility of node sets among different scene graphs. A computational complexity analysis is necessary to address efficiency concerns, and incorporating automated evaluation techniques alongside human assessments would enhance the robustness of the evaluation.
