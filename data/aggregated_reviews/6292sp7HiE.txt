Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents FedSD2C, a novel one-shot Federated Learning (FL) framework aimed at enhancing communication efficiency, privacy preservation, and model performance. The authors propose a Core-Set selection method based on V-information to extract informative data, which is then perturbed using a Fourier transform before being transmitted via an autoencoder. Empirical results indicate that FedSD2C significantly outperforms existing one-shot FL methods, addressing issues of data heterogeneity and information loss.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The focus on one-shot FL is a promising direction for minimizing communication costs.
- The method protects data privacy by not sharing raw data.
- The use of V-information and Fourier transform perturbation is innovative.
- Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on a server-held autoencoder, which must be trained on client data, is a strong assumption.
- The paper lacks rigorous evaluation of privacy guarantees, particularly in relation to Membership Inference Attacks (MIA).
- Clarity in writing and presentation needs improvement, with essential details missing for understanding contributions.
- The communication overhead appears larger compared to other methods, requiring transmission of both the autoencoder and synthetic data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by explicitly defining the patches used in the Core-Set selection and detailing the datasets and models used in figures. Additionally, the authors should provide a rigorous demonstration of privacy preservation, potentially incorporating differential privacy guarantees. It would be beneficial to conduct ablation studies to evaluate the impact of each component of the proposed method, as well as to compare the effectiveness of Fourier and wavelet transforms in various scenarios. Lastly, addressing the capitalization and punctuation errors throughout the manuscript will enhance readability.
