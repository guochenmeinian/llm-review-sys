Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework for reducing labeling costs in 3D object detection using submodular optimization. The authors propose a two-stage algorithm: Gradient-Based Submodular Subset Selection (GBSSS) for selecting diverse and representative point clouds, and Submodular Diversity Maximization for Class Balancing (SDMCB) to ensure balanced label distribution. The method addresses data imbalance and varying difficulty levels, achieving state-of-the-art results on the KITTI and Waymo datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed active learning pipeline is intuitive and reasonable.
- The paper effectively addresses data imbalance and demonstrates high computational efficiency.
- Extensive experiments show superior results across various datasets, supported by ablation studies that validate the proposed algorithm.

Weaknesses:
- The performance gains compared to the baseline KECOR appear marginal, raising questions about the significance of the improvements.
- The paper relies solely on PV-RCNN as the baseline detector, lacking quantitative benchmarking against recent detectors like FocalFormer and PillarNet.
- There is insufficient detail on the generalizability of the proposed submodular functions to other datasets or tasks, and the computational efficiency claims lack specific data on resource usage.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the pipeline by including a visual representation of the proposed active 3D object detection process. Additionally, a more comprehensive evaluation against recent state-of-the-art detectors on established leaderboards like KITTI, Waymo, and nuScenes would strengthen the claims regarding the method's effectiveness. We also suggest providing specific data on computation time and resource usage to substantiate claims of high computational efficiency. Lastly, addressing the marginal performance gains and exploring the use of a broader range of labeled bounding boxes could enhance the robustness of the results.
