### Key Points
This paper presents a study on three significant problems in web-scale data stream processing: heavy hitter detection, heavy changer detection, and persistent item detection, focusing on sketch-based algorithms. The authors propose a novel algorithm called Stable-Sketch, which effectively detects these items with high accuracy and a small memory footprint. The theoretical analysis of Stable-Sketch's error bounds demonstrates its efficiency, while empirical evaluations show its superior performance compared to existing algorithms. The key technical novelty lies in utilizing multi-dimensional statistics, specifically bucket stability, for eviction decisions, leading to impressive results, particularly in low memory scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized and easy to follow.
- The problem is clearly defined, and the concept of "bucket stability" is novel.
- A comprehensive theoretical analysis supports the claims regarding error bounds.
- Extensive empirical evaluations validate the effectiveness of Stable-Sketch.

Weaknesses:
- The comparison in experiments is limited to methods from 2021, missing newer approaches.
- The update strategy for the stability statistic in Algorithm 1 requires further explanation.
- The datasets used are primarily from network traffic; additional data types could enhance evaluation.
- The SIMD optimization discussed may not align entirely with Algorithm 1, potentially causing issues.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental comparison by including more recent methods to provide a broader context. Additionally, the authors should clarify the update strategy for the stability statistic in Algorithm 1 to enhance reader understanding. Incorporating diverse datasets, such as web or text streams, could further validate the performance of Stable-Sketch. Finally, we suggest integrating references to the appendix into the main text to ensure the paper is self-contained and comprehensible.
