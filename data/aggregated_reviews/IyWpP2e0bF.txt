Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a block-coordinate optimization strategy for plug-and-play (PnP) methods to address blind inverse problems in imaging, validated through experiments in blind deblurring and parallel CS-MRI. The authors extend the theoretical convergence analysis of PnP methods with MMSE denoisers to their proposed BC-PnP framework. The method leverages pretrained denoisers for both signals and unknown parameters, ensuring convergence under specific conditions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is one of the first to extend PnP methods to blind inverse problems, demonstrating sound theoretical convergence properties.
- The method shows robustness and applicability across various imaging inverse problems, as evidenced by empirical results.
- The organization and clarity of the paper facilitate understanding, and the proposed method has significant potential for future research.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical contributions lack novelty, as the extensions to block coordinate updates and denoisers optimal only up to a constant error appear trivial.
- BC-PnP's reliance on close-to-ground-truth initialization for imaging operators raises concerns about its generalizability and computational feasibility.
- The experimental validation for blind deblurring is limited to Gaussian blur kernels, which may not reflect performance on more complex kernels.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty discussion by elaborating on the theoretical contributions of their work. Additionally, it would be beneficial to explore the convergence of BC-PnP without relying on close-to-ground-truth initialization strategies. We suggest including tests on more complex blur kernels to assess the scalability of the method. Furthermore, a comparative analysis with end-to-end architectures and a discussion on the computational complexity of PnP methods would enhance the paper's depth.
