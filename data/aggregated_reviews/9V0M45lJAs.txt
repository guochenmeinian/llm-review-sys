### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into variations in zero-shot multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) performance, identifying key factors such as English-centric translation capacity, vocabulary overlap, and linguistic properties. The authors introduce a new dataset, EC40, comprising 66M sentence pairs across 40 languages, to support their extensive experiments. The findings reveal that zero-shot translation directions exhibit lower performance and higher variations, with the authors arguing that the off-target problem is a symptom of inadequate performance rather than its root cause.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of the EC40 dataset is a significant contribution, providing a resource for further research.
- The paper conducts comprehensive experiments that offer valuable insights into the factors affecting zero-shot translation performance.
- The authors present a novel perspective by suggesting that the off-target issue is a symptom rather than the root cause of low performance.

Weaknesses:
- The identified factors of variation are intuitive and have been previously observed, lacking novel insights.
- Key concepts such as "spurious correlation," "off-target issue," and "correlation and regression analysis" are not adequately introduced, making the paper less accessible to non-experts.
- The relationship between high variation and low average zero-shot performance is not explored in depth.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction of key concepts to enhance accessibility for a broader audience. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the setting of the vocabulary overlap analysis, ensuring it is comprehensible and well-defined. The paper could benefit from a deeper exploration of the relationship between high variation and low performance, potentially discussing the underlying causes in more detail. Furthermore, we advise considering the use of COMET alongside string-matching metrics to strengthen the evaluation of translation quality. Lastly, we recommend moving some experimental results to the appendix to create space for enhancing the clarity of the main text.
