Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a tissue-specific transformer-based splicing prediction model, TrASPr, alongside a Bayesian Optimization algorithm (BOS) for RNA design. The authors demonstrate TrASPr's performance on RNA splicing data from mouse and human tissues, evaluate its ability to detect condition-specific regulatory elements, and utilize it as an oracle for BOS to generate desired RNA sequences. The authors clarify discrepancies in results due to different datasets used in their experiments, specifically between mouse and human data, and argue that their model outperforms the pre-trained DNABERT for tissue-specific predictions, although the reasons for this superiority remain unclear. The work aims to advance the prediction of splicing events and facilitate RNA design.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Originality: The paper utilizes recent advances in large language models (LLMs) to define a splicing prediction model, improving existing models by incorporating prior knowledge through dedicated features.
- Quality: The manuscript is well-written, presenting a thoughtful framework that combines expert knowledge and state-of-the-art computational models.
- Clarity: The authors provide thorough responses to reviewer comments, clarifying misunderstandings and addressing concerns, although some sections still lack clarity.
- Significance: The results are promising for utilizing LLMs in predicting splicing events and training RNA design models, marking an important step in the field.
- Acknowledgment of limitations: The authors acknowledge the limitations of DNABERT and provide quantitative performance metrics, enhancing the understanding of experimental results.

Weaknesses:
- Reproducibility: The authors claim reproducibility but do not provide code, which could enhance understanding and evaluation of the framework.
- Structure: While generally well-structured, the organization could improve, particularly by consolidating model implementation details and providing a more elaborate description of previous work.
- Evaluation: The explanation of performance degradation over the “Strict” test set is unconvincing, and further exploration of this issue is warranted.
- Minor issues: There are incomplete sentences, missing spaces after "TrASPr," and unreferenced figures that need attention.
- Need for further exploration: There is a need for further exploration of evolutionary algorithms, which could yield interesting results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve reproducibility by providing the code for their model. Additionally, we suggest reorganizing the paper to consolidate model implementation details and enhance the description of prior work relevant to the prediction task. It would be beneficial for the authors to further investigate the performance degradation observed in the “Strict” test set, potentially testing on alternative datasets for better insights. We also recommend improving the clarity of their writing and explanations to enhance reader comprehension. Lastly, considering testing evolutionary algorithms could provide valuable findings and contribute to the paper's impact. Addressing minor issues such as incomplete sentences and figure references will also improve the manuscript's readability.
