Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a spike-based neuromorphic model for sound source localization (SSL) that utilizes Resonate-and-Fire (RF) neurons and a phase-locking coding (RF-PLC) method. The model encodes interaural time differences (ITD) and incorporates a multi-auditory attention (MAA) module to enhance performance in noisy environments. The authors propose replacing energy-intensive Fourier Transform operations with RF neurons, aiming for efficiency in edge computing scenarios. The study claims state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness, supported by extensive experimental results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The integration of RF neurons and Jeffress models creates a robust auditory localization encoding method, effectively replacing high-energy Fourier Transform operations.
2. The paper provides a clear description of the biological plausibility of the encoding and backend SSL model, enhancing comprehension.
3. The experimental results validate the method's effectiveness and robustness, demonstrating promising performance metrics.

Weaknesses:
1. The claim regarding RF neurons replacing Fourier Transform operations lacks sufficient experimental validation; further evidence is needed.
2. The experiments primarily utilize the SLoClas dataset, limiting the generalizability of the findings; additional datasets should be tested.
3. The design of the loss function does not adequately address potential discrepancies in model outputs at similar angles, necessitating a more detailed discussion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental validation of RF neurons by providing reliable proof or references to existing research. Additionally, the authors should conduct tests on multiple datasets to enhance the generalizability of their findings. A detailed discussion of the loss function design is essential to address potential output discrepancies. Finally, including a step-by-step example of how audio inputs are encoded and utilized for determining sound source azimuth would enhance clarity for readers unfamiliar with SSL tasks.
