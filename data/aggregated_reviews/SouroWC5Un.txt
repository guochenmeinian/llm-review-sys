Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a decentralized learning protocol that is robust against malicious clients, addressing both model poisoning and reconstruction attacks. The authors propose a framework leveraging cryptographic tools such as secure multi-party computation (MPC), verifiable secret sharing (VSS), and distributed zero knowledge proofs (DZKPs) to ensure robustness and confidentiality. The claimed efficiency of these protocols is applicable to small-scale models with up to 10^6 parameters on simple datasets like MNIST.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles a significant issue in collaborative learning, focusing on collaboration among untrusted parties.
- It employs a comprehensive array of cryptographic techniques to achieve its objectives, enhancing the robustness of the learning process.

Weaknesses:
- The framing of "double robustness" is misleading, as the protocol does not involve servers; it should focus on robustness against poisoning and reconstruction attacks.
- There is a lack of clarity on how the various cryptographic components will integrate into a cohesive system, particularly regarding the formation of the aggregation committee and ensuring honest behavior among committee members.
- Some claims, such as the ability to form an honest majority committee with a high proportion of malicious clients, seem implausible.
- The paper does not address the impact of robustness modifications on final utility or accuracy compared to traditional methods like FedAvg.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the threat model and trust assumptions in the final version. Additionally, the authors should demonstrate how all cryptographic primitives can be integrated into a complete system and clarify the trust assumptions involved. It would be beneficial to discuss the potential for new poisoning attacks within the defined update space and how the proposed approach would perform in real-world non-iid scenarios. Furthermore, we suggest including a more detailed analysis of the accuracy loss compared to standard aggregation methods and addressing the scalability concerns raised regarding runtime in larger setups.
