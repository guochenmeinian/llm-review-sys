Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Implicit-Zoo, a large-scale dataset of neural implicit functions for both 2D and 3D tasks, including over 1.5 million implicit representations. The authors benchmark various tasks such as 2D image classification, semantic segmentation, and 3D pose regression using this dataset. They introduce a transformer-based approach for direct pose regression in 3D neural radiance fields and enhance benchmark methods through a learnable tokenizer. The dataset aims to facilitate research by connecting 2D and 3D supervision, improving performance across multiple tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Clear writing: The authors effectively describe the dataset creation process, enhancing reader comprehension.
2. Descriptive captions and figures: Well-structured visuals aid in understanding core concepts and methodologies.
3. Thorough documentation: The organization of details allows for easy navigation and comprehension.
4. Strong motivation: The paper presents a compelling rationale for the research and its potential impact.
5. Well-organized experiments: Although limited in number, the experiments are effectively structured to demonstrate the dataset's utility.

Weaknesses:
1. Limited evaluation: The model evaluation is restricted to ViT-based methods; a broader range of models should be included.
2. Comparison with benchmarks: Existing tools for pose evaluation are not utilized, which could clarify the proposed approach's effectiveness.
3. Limited tasks: The dataset could explore additional applications, such as generative models that utilize both 2D and 3D INRs.
4. Choice of INRs: The rationale for selecting INRs over GS-based approaches is not sufficiently explained.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including a variety of models beyond ViT-based methods to better showcase their dataset's advantages. Additionally, incorporating comparisons with existing benchmarks for pose evaluation would enhance understanding of the proposed approach's effectiveness. We suggest exploring more diverse applications of the dataset, such as generative models that utilize both 2D and 3D INRs, to broaden its appeal. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify their choice of INRs over GS-based methods, providing a more detailed justification for this decision.
