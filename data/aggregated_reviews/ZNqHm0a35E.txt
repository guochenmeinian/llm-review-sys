Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Incremental Vision-Language Object Detection (IVLOD), a novel learning task aimed at incrementally adapting pre-trained Vision-Language Object Detection Models (VLODMs) to specialized domains while preserving their zero-shot generalization capabilities. The authors propose Zero-interference Reparameterizable Adaptation (ZiRa) to address IVLOD without significant memory overhead. Experiments on COCO and ODinW-13 datasets demonstrate that ZiRa effectively maintains zero-shot generalization while adapting to new tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and logically structured, making it easy to follow.
2. The authors introduce RDB and ZiL to generalize VLODMs to specific domains without losing zero-shot capabilities.
3. The proposed incremental adaptation task is relevant for practical applications, particularly with VLMs trained on private datasets.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the paper is somewhat incremental, as RDB has been previously proposed. The authors should cite [1] and clarify the distinctions.
2. The evaluation focuses solely on general zero-shot performance after incremental learning, leaving questions about zero-shot specific-domain inference.
3. The paper lacks a comprehensive review of incremental object detection literature, including references [2-3].

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by clearly highlighting the need for this work and its distinctions from existing methods. Additionally, the authors should clarify the metrics used in their experiments, particularly regarding the zero-shot performance on COCO. It would be beneficial to include a broader range of incremental object detection literature and to address the questions raised about the pre-training data, learning rates, and the scaling factor in their model. Lastly, enhancing the writing quality and providing more descriptive captions in tables would improve comprehension.
