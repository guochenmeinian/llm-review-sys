Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DapperFL, a novel framework for domain adaptive federated learning tailored for heterogeneous edge devices. It integrates a Model Fusion Pruning (MFP) module and a Domain Adaptive Regularization (DAR) module to address system heterogeneity and domain shifts. The framework employs a unique aggregation approach to manage heterogeneous local models with diverse architectures and weights. The authors claim that DapperFL achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance through experimental evaluations on two domain generation datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The originality of the framework lies in its simultaneous focus on system heterogeneity and domain shifts, which have been addressed separately in prior works.
- The methodology is rigorously developed, with clear implementation details and well-organized explanations of the framework components (MFP, DAR, Aggregation).
- The paper is easy to follow, with clear figures and publicly available source code, enhancing reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- The introduction of system heterogeneity and domain shifts lacks clarity, particularly regarding the relevance of low-capability clients and the biased example of cameras in domain shifts.
- The MFP strategy is not particularly innovative and requires storing the entire global model, which contradicts the resource-constrained focus of the paper. The unstructured pruning strategy limits its contribution to system heterogeneity.
- There is insufficient discussion on the segmentation of the model in the DAR module, and the paper lacks references to existing works that address similar challenges.
- The proposed method is sensitive to hyperparameter selection, complicating its application.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction by providing a more coherent exposition of system heterogeneity and domain shifts, possibly supplemented with illustrations. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the innovation of the MFP strategy to better align with the resource-constrained context. It would be beneficial to include model symbols in the framework diagram for clearer explanations of model changes. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide a set of default hyperparameter values or an automatic selection mechanism to simplify application. Lastly, addressing the lack of references to related works and discussing the implications of using the L1 norm in the DAR module would strengthen the paper.
