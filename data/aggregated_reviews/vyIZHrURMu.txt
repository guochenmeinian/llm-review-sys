### Key Points
This paper presents CoDeSEG, a novel game-theoretic framework for community detection in large-scale networks, utilizing a structural entropy-based approach. The method defines a two-dimensional structural entropy, allowing nodes to iteratively adjust their community memberships to minimize this entropy. This heuristic strategy ensures efficient detection of both non-overlapping and overlapping communities, achieving nearly linear time complexity and state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The game-theoretic framework leverages structural entropy for nearly linear time complexity, ensuring scalability for large-scale networks.
2. The algorithm operates efficiently on both weighted and unweighted networks, outperforming existing methods in speed and accuracy.
3. The paper effectively addresses overlapping community detection and provides a comprehensive validation of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
1. Limited novelty in the proposed methodology; the rationale behind the structural entropy design and its physical interpretation is unclear.
2. The relationship between structural entropy and its effectiveness in large-scale or unweighted networks is not explicitly established.
3. The manuscript lacks a definition of Nash equilibrium, and comparisons with more recent algorithms are insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the rationale for the design of structural entropy, including its theoretical foundation and physical meaning. A clearer explanation of how high or low values correlate with community assignment quality is necessary. Additionally, we suggest including a direct comparison with recent algorithms to enhance the manuscript's credibility. The authors should also refine the writing, particularly in the algorithm section, and define all parameters as inputs. Finally, a calculation of space complexity and a more thorough analysis of experimental results would strengthen the paper.
