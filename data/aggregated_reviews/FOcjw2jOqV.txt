### Key Points
This paper presents a user-aware contrastive learning framework, UCLR, aimed at addressing the issue of inconsistent user behaviors in cross-domain recommendation (CDR). The authors propose a method that utilizes contrastive learning with individualized temperature coefficients to generate more equitable user embeddings, thereby mitigating the negative effects of data imbalance. The framework includes the creation of pretrained global embeddings and a dual-stream collaborative autoencoder, which collectively enhance recommendation accuracy, particularly for users with fewer interactions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The work is well-written and organized, with thorough clarifications of the framework components.
2. Individualized customization through separate temperature coefficients for each user is a notable feature.
3. Extensive experiments validate the results against baseline methods, demonstrating significant improvements.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation for incorporating the LoRA fine-tuning strategy needs clearer articulation.
2. Limitations exist in handling non-overlapping users, and effectiveness may be restricted to specific scenarios.
3. The use of BPRMF as a sole pretrained global embedding does not sufficiently verify model effectiveness and compatibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the motivation behind the LoRA method to enhance clarity. Additionally, conducting experiments with stronger baseline models, such as LightGCN or FinalMLP, could provide a more robust evaluation of UCLR's effectiveness. We also suggest comparing UCLR with more cross-domain recommendation baselines, such as RecSys-DAN, to contextualize its performance. Furthermore, addressing the computational costs associated with UCLR compared to baseline methods would be beneficial. Lastly, providing more analysis and experimental statistics on the impact of different user temperatures would strengthen the contribution of the paper.
