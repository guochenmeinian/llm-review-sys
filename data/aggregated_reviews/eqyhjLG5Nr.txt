Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical study on the equilibrium of supply-side competition in recommender systems, focusing on how these systems influence producers' content creation and the potential for specialization. The authors propose a game-theoretic model that examines the conditions under which specialization occurs among digital content producers, analyzing the impact of recommender systems on content diversity and market competitiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The exploration of supply-side competition under recommender systems is a significant and timely topic.
- The theoretical analysis provides insights into the equilibrium of supply-side competition and specialization.
- The proposed game-theoretic model effectively captures the multi-dimensional decisions of producers and user heterogeneity.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical analysis relies on a simplified recommendation model based on inner products of user and item vectors, which may not reflect the complexities of modern recommender systems driven by deep learning and large language models.
- The model's applicability to various types of recommender systems beyond digital goods is uncertain, and it lacks empirical validation or experimental analysis.
- The utility function is symmetric, which may not realistically represent the diverse preferences and costs of content creators in practice.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical model by incorporating heterogeneous preferences and costs among content creators to better reflect real-world scenarios. Additionally, we suggest conducting empirical validation or simulations to substantiate the theoretical claims and enhance the model's applicability across different recommender system contexts. Clarifying the practical implications of the theoretical findings for practitioners would also strengthen the paper's impact.
