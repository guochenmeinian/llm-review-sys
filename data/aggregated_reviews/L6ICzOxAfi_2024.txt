Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method to enhance multi-view consistency in vision foundation models through a memory-efficient loss function. The authors propose a strategy that reduces memory usage by three orders of magnitude by sampling positive pairs from a smaller subset and discarding pairs with negligible gradients. The model is trained on paired views from Matterport3D, and its performance is evaluated against competitors in tasks such as local feature matching and visual place recognition.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents a clear core idea, effectively motivating its contributions.
- The proposed loss function significantly reduces memory footprint, allowing for larger batch sizes and enhancing computational efficiency.
- The pruning scheme during backpropagation enables training with a smaller computational cost compared to existing methods.

Weaknesses:
- Limited experimental validation, as comparisons are primarily internal and favor the proposed model. The evaluation lacks diverse tasks, such as stereo depth estimation or optical flow.
- Generalization concerns arise from training on Matterport3D and evaluating on similar datasets, limiting insights into performance in varied scenarios.
- The comparison with competitors, particularly LoCUS, is potentially unfair due to differences in model architecture and training conditions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental validation by including a wider range of tasks, such as stereo depth estimation and optical flow, to better assess the model's capabilities. Additionally, we suggest evaluating the model on more diverse datasets beyond Matterport3D to provide insights into its generalization performance. It would also be beneficial to conduct a fair comparison with LoCUS under identical training conditions to clarify the advantages of the proposed loss function. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide a clearer rationale for the choice of the saturation threshold in the loss function, as its significance remains unclear.
