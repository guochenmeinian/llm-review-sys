Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical framework that connects deep ensemble methods and variational Bayesian methods through generalized variational inference and Wasserstein gradient flows (WGF). The authors demonstrate that these methods can be framed as infinite-dimensional variational inference problems, leading to the derivation of new algorithms for sampling from target distributions. The work emphasizes the significance of regularization in ensuring the uniqueness of minimizers in the optimization process.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized and articulates a compelling unifying theoretical framework.
- The clarity of presentation allows for a coherent understanding of complex concepts, despite the abstract nature of the subject.
- The rigorous mathematical formulation and extensive proofs support the theoretical claims effectively.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments section lacks clarity and context, making it difficult to follow without prior details on the experimental setup.
- The motivation for convexification and the preference for regularized optima over unregularized ones is not sufficiently articulated.
- The paper does not adequately explore the practical implications and limitations of the derived inference algorithms, particularly regarding their performance in high-dimensional spaces.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experiments section by incorporating high-level details about the experimental setup and the motivation for each experiment into the main text. Additionally, a clearer exposition on the necessity of regularized optima compared to unregularized ones should be provided. The authors should also elaborate on the practical challenges associated with the derived algorithms and consider discussing other relevant literature to strengthen the theoretical framework. Finally, enhancing the clarity of notation and definitions, particularly regarding integration domains and the 2-Wasserstein metric, would benefit the overall presentation.
