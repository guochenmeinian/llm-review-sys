Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on dynamic decision making with resource constraints, aiming to achieve O(1) regret under specific conditions. However, there is uncertainty regarding whether this regret is relative to the best policy in hindsight or to a value $V^{FL}$. The authors also explore contextual decision making with knapsack constraints, providing regret bounds in both full and partial information settings. The paper introduces a novel algorithm that can achieve $\tilde O(1)$ regret when certain worst-case conditions do not hold.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written, and the relationship between the worst-case condition and the degeneracy of linear constraints is novel and inspiring.  
- Under the unique non-degenerate LP assumption, the paper provides regret bounds that surpass worst-case scenarios in both information settings, enhancing understanding of the problem.  
- The results under the proposed model are relatively sharp and complete.

Weaknesses:  
- There is ambiguity in Theorem 3.1 regarding whether it should reference $V^{ON}$ instead of $V^{FL}$, which affects the strength of the results.  
- The assumption on randomness is stronger than typical in contextual decision-making literature, and the presentation could be improved, particularly regarding the intuition behind the unique non-degenerate solution.  
- Questions remain about the implications of resource constraints, the unbiasedness of estimators, and the relationship to existing problems like NRM.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify whether Theorem 3.1 should reference $V^{ON}$ instead of $V^{FL}$, as this significantly impacts the perceived strength of their results. Additionally, the authors should include any problem-dependent constants in their bounds and address the potential for these constants to vary based on the linear program's characteristics. Improving the presentation of the intuition behind the unique non-degenerate solution is crucial, as is providing a clearer discussion on the implications of the assumptions made regarding randomness. Furthermore, the authors should explicitly compare their results with existing literature on NRM problems to ensure a fair evaluation of their contributions.
