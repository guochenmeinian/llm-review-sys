### Key Points
This paper presents DS-prover, an iterative pipeline that utilizes LLMs to autoformalize natural language problems, filters high-quality autoformalizations, and fine-tunes LLMs for formal theorem proving in Lean. The authors demonstrate that large-scale formal data derived from natural problems can significantly enhance the theorem-proving capabilities of LLMs, as evidenced by experiments on miniF2F. While the iterative pipeline concept is not novel, the extensive experiments convincingly showcase the method's effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.  
- It achieves state-of-the-art results on miniF2F by a significant margin.  
- The ablation studies are comprehensive, demonstrating the effectiveness of each methodology component.  
- The approach addresses the critical issue of data scarcity in formal theorem proving by effectively utilizing synthetic data.  

Weaknesses:  
- The high-level idea of an iterative pipeline has been adopted in various existing works.  
- Some typos are present, such as "cycle" vs. "circle" and "model" vs. "mode."  
- The resources (compute/time) required to replicate the work are not detailed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the writing quality by addressing the identified typos. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide more information regarding the resources needed for replication to enhance the transparency and reproducibility of their work.
