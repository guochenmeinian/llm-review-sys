### Key Points
This paper presents a novel integration of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for uncertainty quantification, addressing a significant gap in the field. The authors provide a solid theoretical foundation for their Latent Graph Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (LGNSDEs) model, supported by theoretical guarantees (Lemmas 1 and 2). Empirical evaluations demonstrate that LGNSDEs outperform or match the performance of several baseline models (GCN, GNODE, BGCN, Ensemble) across multiple datasets, particularly in terms of AUROC, AURC, and accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Theoretical foundation is robust, with clear mathematical guarantees.
- Empirical results indicate superior or comparable performance of LGNSDEs.
- Innovative approach to uncertainty quantification in GNNs, capturing both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties.

Weaknesses:
- Some equations and notations lack clear explanations, hindering reader comprehension.
- The justification for the suitability of SDE formulations for GNNs is insufficiently detailed.
- Most equations are unnumbered, complicating reference.
- Drift and diffusion functions are initially presented as constants but later parametrized, leading to confusion.
- Certain mathematical symbols, such as in the ELBO equation, are not well-defined.
- Memory and time complexity calculations are not adequately explained.
- No discussion of computational efficiency is provided.
- Ablation studies with varying hyperparameters are lacking.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of mathematical equations and notations by providing detailed explanations and numbering all equations for easier reference. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the justification for the proposed SDE formulations' suitability for GNNs. The authors should clearly define all mathematical symbols, particularly in the ELBO equation, and provide a thorough explanation of memory and time complexity calculations in the appendix. Including a discussion on computational efficiency and conducting ablation studies with different hyperparameters would strengthen the paper. Lastly, we recommend increasing the font size in Figure 2 for better readability.
