### Key Points
This paper presents a poisoning attack framework for Federated Knowledge Graph Embedding, detailing both server-initiated and client-initiated attacks, along with corresponding defense mechanisms. The authors demonstrate how malicious participants or servers can introduce fake relations into victim models, thereby biasing downstream applications. The evaluation employs standard link prediction benchmarks, modified to assess the specific attack, and includes a comprehensive analysis of the attack's effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper introduces an interesting attack concept, particularly the use of auxiliary data.  
2. It provides a clear description of the problem setting and related work.  
3. The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attacks and defenses.  
4. The writing is clear, and the research questions are well-formulated.

Weaknesses:  
1. The significance of the attack's relevance in federated training is unclear, raising questions about its commonality.  
2. The relationship between the malicious client and server is not well-defined.  
3. The attack performance does not consistently improve with increased budget, indicating instability.  
4. The practicality of the attack settings may be questionable, as they require access to relation embeddings.  
5. Typos and clarity issues detract from the overall quality of the text.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the relationship dynamics between the malicious client and server. Additionally, we suggest providing a deeper justification for the attack's relevance and potential use cases. It would be beneficial to clarify the rationale behind the observed decrease in attack effectiveness with an increasing number of clients. We also encourage the authors to address the stability of the attack performance and discuss unnoticeability issues related to the injected poisoned triples. Lastly, fixing typos and enhancing overall readability will improve the paper's quality.
