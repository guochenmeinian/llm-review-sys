Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of the statistical and computational limits of latent Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), establishing three main theoretical results: an approximation error bound for the transformer-based score estimator, a sample complexity bound for score estimation, and provably efficient criteria for both forward inference and backward training. The authors demonstrate that Transformers serve as universal approximators for the score function in DiTs, with their capacity dependent on the latent dimension, and provide almost-linear time algorithms for efficient training and inference.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors derived an approximation error bound for transformer-based score estimators, offering practical guidance for structural configuration.
- The paper proves that learned score estimators can recover the initial data distribution, supporting the feasibility of using neural networks for score estimation.
- It establishes almost-linear time algorithms for training and inference, providing a theoretical foundation for efficiency.
- Most concepts and results are clearly presented, contributing to the understanding of DiTs.

Weaknesses:
- The assumption of a low-dimensional linear latent space is unclear and may limit generalization; further elucidation on its acceptance in the DiTs community is needed.
- The paper lacks practical insights into the provably efficient criteria, and the theoretical proofs' contributions to fast training and sampling algorithms are not well articulated.
- The presentation is overly technical, with long formal definitions that may hinder understanding for non-experts, and comparisons with prior works are imprecise.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the assumptions regarding the low-dimensional linear latent space and explore the potential for generalization beyond this framework. Additionally, we suggest including informal versions of the theorems to enhance accessibility for non-experts and providing clearer comparisons with prior works, such as specifying error bounds relative to existing models. Finally, incorporating simulation results or toy examples to illustrate the theoretical findings would strengthen the paper's practical relevance and credibility.
