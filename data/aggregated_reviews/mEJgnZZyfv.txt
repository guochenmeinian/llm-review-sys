Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents OpenMixup, the first comprehensive benchmark for mixup augmentation in visual representation learning, evaluating 18 mixup methods across 11 image datasets. The authors propose a modular, open-source codebase that standardizes data pre-processing, mixup design, training, and evaluation. Extensive experiments provide insights into performance-complexity trade-offs and recommend optimal mixup strategies. The paper also offers practical rankings of mixup methods based on performance and applicability, contributing significantly to the research community.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Comprehensive evaluation of 18 mixup methods across diverse datasets.
- Modular and open-source codebase that fosters reproducibility and future research.
- Detailed insights into performance and complexity trade-offs, highlighting the robustness of dynamic mixup methods.
- High-quality figures and tables that enhance clarity and understanding.
- Well-structured and clearly written, making complex ideas accessible.

Weaknesses:
- Lacks objective computational analysis on the significant overhead of dynamic mixup methods, which may limit their practicality.
- Insufficient exploration of hyperparameter sensitivity in dynamic mixup methods, which is crucial for effective method selection.
- Some claims, such as those regarding localizability and training stability, require stronger evidence and clearer explanations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the objective computational analysis of dynamic mixup methods to address their significant resource demands and provide clearer trade-offs between performance and resource usage. Additionally, an objective description of hyperparameter sensitivity should be included to aid in method selection. Clarifications on the assignment of models to datasets, the fairness of training settings across different methods, and the rationale behind performance rankings should also be addressed. Furthermore, we suggest simplifying verbose sentences and ensuring that all claims are well-supported by quantitative evidence.
