Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of interactive decision-making scenarios, including bandits, contextual bandits, and reinforcement learning, with a focus on regret minimization. The authors assert that the Graves-Lai constant's zero value is essential for achieving bounded regret, although this requirement may be too stringent for practical applications. The study introduces the concept of ϵ-robustness, which assesses algorithmic resilience to misspecified delay models, concluding that consistent algorithms cannot achieve ϵ-robustness unless the Graves-Lai constant is zero. The paper contrasts this negative finding with positive results for linear reward models, indicating that a zero Graves-Lai constant suffices for bounded regret without knowledge of delay models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper establishes a theoretical link between the Graves-Lai constant and delay robustness in interactive decision-making.
- It introduces ϵ-delay robustness, providing a quantitative measure of algorithm performance under misspecified delay models.
- The articulation of the delayed rewards problem is clear, enhancing understanding of the challenges faced by the proposed algorithms.

Weaknesses:
- The lack of empirical validation through simulations or real-world experiments may limit the practical relevance of the theoretical findings.
- The requirement for the Graves-Lai constant to be exactly zero is a strong condition that could diminish the paper's significance in practical applications.
- The related work on robustness is not comprehensive, and the paper lacks proper citations for definitions and assumptions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the practical relevance of their findings by including empirical validation through simulations or real-world experiments. Additionally, addressing the limitations of the Graves-Lai constant's requirement in practical scenarios would enhance the paper's significance. Explicitly discussing the limitations of the proposed approach and potential avenues for future research could provide a more balanced view. Furthermore, we suggest clarifying the definition of "the sub-optimality gap of decision" and ensuring proper citations for all definitions and assumptions used in the paper.
