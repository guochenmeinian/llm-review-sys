### Key Points
This paper presents TAPVid-3D, a benchmark for tracking any point in 3D space, addressing a significant gap in existing benchmarks for 3D tracking tasks. The authors compile over 4,000 real-world video clips from three datasets, covering various scenarios and object types. They introduce new Jaccard-based metrics tailored for complex 3D evaluations and provide a performance baseline by testing existing state-of-the-art models. The benchmark aims to enhance understanding of 3D motion and surface deformation, making it a valuable resource for future research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The benchmark is timely and necessary for evaluating 3D point tracking methods, with a well-motivated dataset design.  
- The dataset includes diverse scenarios and is well-documented, facilitating reproducibility.  
- The clarity of presentation and organization enhances understanding, making the paper accessible to a broad audience.  

Weaknesses:  
- There is insufficient analysis of the quality of the pseudo-ground truth (pseudo-GT) for 3D tracking, with a need for more statistics or human judgment on correctness.  
- The query point sampling is unbalanced, particularly in the DriveTrack data source.  
- The benchmark is dataset-dependent, limiting its applicability across different datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the pseudo-GT quality by providing more statistics or human judgment on correctness. Additionally, enhancing the query point sampling balance in the DriveTrack data source would be beneficial. We suggest including more recent baselines in Table 3, such as Geowizard and DepthAnything, to provide a richer comparison. Furthermore, repositioning Table 2 closer to its relevant section and making the captions for Tables 4 and 5 more self-descriptive would improve readability and comprehension.
