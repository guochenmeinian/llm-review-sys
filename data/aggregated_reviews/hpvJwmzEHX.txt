Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a model for synthesizable molecule design called Reaction-GFlowNet (RGFN), which modifies prior GFlowNet frameworks by incorporating reaction templates and reactant selection to enhance synthesizability. The authors evaluate RGFN against existing models, demonstrating competitive performance in generating synthesizable molecules while addressing the limitations of previous GFlowNet approaches. However, concerns are raised regarding the novelty and significance of the method due to the omission of related works, as it does not significantly differ from existing template-based retrosynthesis approaches. The evaluations of the method's performance are considered confusing and insufficient, particularly regarding its state-of-the-art claims in molecular generation, highlighting the need for empirical comparisons with molecular generation benchmarks to validate the method's contributions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method effectively integrates a reaction-based generation framework with GFlowNet, addressing synthesizability, a critical aspect often overlooked in molecular generation.
- The authors propose a curated set of high-yield reactions and low-cost fragments, which could enhance the development of other methods.
- The use of a chemical language for synthesizability offers potential cost advantages in practical applications, serving as a promising inductive bias for generating viable molecules.
- RGFN shows competitive performance in terms of synthesizability and average reward compared to FGFN and SyntheMol, despite fewer modes due to constraints in the generation space, and demonstrates comparable synthesizability scores to other synthesizability-focused methods while producing a more diverse set of candidate molecules.

Weaknesses:
- The preliminary explanation of the method is insufficient, particularly regarding the flow matching condition, which is not clearly articulated in the method section.
- The omission of related literature undermines the perceived novelty and significance of the research, and the technical contribution appears limited, with no substantial algorithmic differences from existing template-based methods.
- The evaluation lacks clarity and comprehensiveness, failing to convincingly demonstrate the proposed method's superiority, and the assessment is limited by a lack of comprehensive comparison with other synthesis-based generative models.
- The method is constrained by a limited chemical space, utilizing only 350 building blocks and 17 reactions, which may hinder its scalability and ability to explore complex synthetic pathways.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the preliminary section to better explain the flow matching condition and the relationship between forward and backward policies. Additionally, we suggest including a more comprehensive review of related works to clarify the novelty and significance of their contributions. Enhancing the clarity of evaluations and including typical empirical comparisons with molecular generation benchmarks would substantiate their claims of state-of-the-art performance. Incorporating synthesizability-related metrics in the rewards could enhance the model's performance, and a comparison with FGFN that incorporates the SA score in the reward would be beneficial. We also encourage the authors to provide specific details about their curated set of reactions and fragments to better assess their impact, as well as to compare the generation time costs between RGFN and FGFN. Finally, expanding the chemical space by increasing the number of building blocks and reactions used would improve the model's scalability.
