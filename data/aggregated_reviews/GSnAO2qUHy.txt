### Key Points
This paper presents a clickbait detection model called MCDM, which addresses the significant gap in clickbait detection by integrating subjective and objective features. MCDM includes a subjective feeling module that captures user-centric features, such as language patterns and emotional inclinations, and an objective content relevance module that examines news elements and models article content correlations. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that MCDM outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, confirming the effectiveness of this dual approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The modeling of subjective feelings for clickbait detection is novel and clever.  
2. The integration of both subjective and objective content relevance is solid and reasonable.  
3. The experiments are comprehensive and convincing, demonstrating improved performance over selected baselines.  
4. The paper is well written and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:  
1. The reliance on a manually defined list of features may limit generalizability across social media platforms.  
2. The description of the motivation and purpose in the introduction lacks comprehensiveness.  
3. The baseline methods compared are somewhat outdated, with only one method from the last 21 years.  
4. The model does not show significant improvement in overall accuracy, particularly on the Clickbait Challenge17 dataset.  
5. Many references cited are outdated, with only four from 2021 onwards.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comprehensiveness of the introduction by elaborating on the motivation and framework of the research. Additionally, we suggest including more recent baseline methods to strengthen the validity of the model. It would be beneficial to explore multimodal data sources, such as images, for clickbait detection. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the process of annotating clickbait tags in Section 5.1 and ensure that the results presented in Table 1 are statistically significant compared to the baselines. Lastly, addressing the font size in figures and adding punctuation at the end of equations will enhance the paper's readability.
