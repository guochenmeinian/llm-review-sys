### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of existing methods for biomedical entity linking (BioEL) across multiple datasets. The authors classify nine popular BioEL models into three categories and conduct an in-depth analysis of their performance. The paper introduces a "unified evaluation framework" intended to expedite future BioEL method development and baseline testing.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper offers a systematic framework for evaluating BioEL models, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses, and suggesting future directions for improvement.  
- The comprehensive evaluation is valuable for best practices in BioEL applications.  
- The evaluation framework could serve as a useful tool for benchmarking new models.

Weaknesses:  
- The framework is not adequately described, limiting its perceived value.  
- The paper does not report previously published state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for each dataset, making it difficult to contextualize claims about current methods' struggles.  
- The specific focus of the paper may limit its audience.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their claims regarding current methods' struggles by accurately reporting previously published SOTA results for each dataset. Additionally, it is essential to provide a detailed description of the evaluation framework, including whether high-level APIs and good practices from popular training/evaluation frameworks, such as Hugging Face and Pykg2vec, were followed. Furthermore, consider enhancing the presentation of Figure 3, possibly by using a radar chart.
