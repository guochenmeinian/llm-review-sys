Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Frequency Adaptive Normalization (FAN), a novel instance normalization technique aimed at improving time series forecasting by addressing non-stationary data with evolving trends and seasonal patterns. FAN utilizes the Fourier transform to identify and model predominant frequency components, demonstrating significant performance improvements across eight benchmark datasets when integrated with various predictive models. The authors claim average MSE enhancements ranging from 7.76% to 37.90%.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, structured, and presents a well-motivated idea with promising experimental results.
- It addresses the challenging problem of non-stationary time series forecasting and offers a new perspective on mitigating non-stationarity issues.
- The code is publicly available for reproducibility, and the experiments conducted are relatively comprehensive.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental descriptions lack clarity, particularly regarding the calculation methods for Trend Variation and Seasonality Variation, and the ADF test values are only provided post-normalization.
- There is a significant disparity between the results reported in Table 2 and those from SAN, which raises questions about the robustness of the methodology.
- The selection of the hyperparameter K is crucial but inadequately justified, and the ablation study does not sufficiently support the selection method.
- The paper lacks a discussion on limitations and social impacts, relegating this information to the appendix, which is not satisfactory.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental descriptions, particularly in explaining the calculation methods for Trend Variation and Seasonality Variation, and provide a direct comparison of ADF test values before and after normalization. Additionally, a more detailed comparison between FAN and previous relevant methods, such as SAN, should be included to address the performance gap. 

The authors should clarify the necessity of the large number of parameters (0.24 million) used in FAN and justify the choice of scaling method, considering dynamic alternatives that may be more suitable for non-stationary data. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors conduct a more thorough dataset-specific analysis regarding the selection of K and investigate the prediction length dependency more rigorously. Lastly, we recommend that the limitations section be included in the main paper to ensure that critical information is readily accessible to readers.
