### Key Points
This paper presents PARROT, a pre-training framework for zero-shot narrative comprehension that employs parallel narratives to enhance understanding. PARROT utilizes a "Selective Span Masking" technique to predict masked spans based on named entities, semantic roles, and verbs/adjective phrases. The empirical results indicate that PARROT's zero-shot performance is competitive with supervised models, achieving state-of-the-art results on narrative comprehension benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The parallel reading strategy effectively utilizes different narrative renderings to improve comprehension.
- Empirical validation supports the significance of "Selective Span Masking" in enhancing zero-shot narrative reading capabilities.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on parallel data may limit applicability across various datasets, as such data may not be readily available.
- The evaluation primarily focuses on ROUGE scores, which are known to have limitations and can be gamed, raising concerns about the robustness of the results.
- The paper lacks comprehensive comparisons with baseline models and alternative evaluation methods, such as human evaluation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the availability of parallel data and propose cost-effective methods for acquiring it. Additionally, we suggest including a comparative model that continues pre-training using T5's original tasks and conducting a thorough analysis of the performance differences. To enhance evaluation, we encourage the authors to incorporate more automatic metrics and human evaluations beyond ROUGE scores. Finally, we propose exploring the use of LLM prompting to simplify the automatic question generation process, potentially increasing robustness.
