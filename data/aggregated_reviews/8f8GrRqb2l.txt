### Key Points
This paper presents a novel protocol for evaluating link prediction in knowledge graphs (KGs) that utilizes posterior probabilities instead of traditional ranking systems. The authors propose a calibration function to assign probabilities to edges and evaluate this methodology across various knowledge graph embedding models and datasets. The results indicate significant improvements in evaluation time, reducing it by up to 98.9%. However, the paper lacks a clear connection to Web-related scientific research challenges, which raises concerns about its relevance to TheWebConf.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a timely and relevant problem in the field of knowledge graphs and link prediction.
- The proposed evaluation protocol is well-motivated, highlighting limitations of existing rank-based metrics.
- Comprehensive experimental evaluation across multiple KGE models demonstrates the protocol's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The paper does not sufficiently articulate its relevance to the Web, potentially violating submission guidelines.
- The presentation and structure of the paper hinder clarity, making it difficult to assess the overall contribution.
- The robustness of the evaluation protocol is sensitive to various factors, which could lead to misleading conclusions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and structure of the paper to facilitate better understanding of the contributions. Specifically, ensure that the discussion of model calibration and evaluation metrics is coherent and logically organized. Additionally, we suggest providing concrete examples of how triples are scored with the new protocol and comparing these scores to those obtained from rank-based metrics. To enhance reproducibility, consider sharing materials through an anonymous link during the review process. Finally, we urge the authors to explicitly address how their work relates to Web-related scientific research challenges to comply with the conference's relevance requirements.
