Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel video stylization method utilizing a 3D CNN framework that disentangles motion and appearance while employing multi-phase training. The authors propose to stylize the appearance component and subsequently integrate the motion back into the final output. Experimental results indicate that the method achieves high-quality stylization results compared to existing techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a 3D CNN framework and multi-phase training is innovative and effective, expanding the AdaIN technique into the temporal dimension with AdaIN3D.
- The results demonstrate significant improvements in stylization quality over baseline methods, supported by a large-scale dataset curated from Sports1M.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments lack thorough analysis; the ablation study does not provide insights into the results.
- The qualitative comparisons are limited to a few methods, neglecting relevant works that could enhance the discussion.
- The absence of a user study undermines the assessment of subjective quality, and the quantitative results do not show a clear advantage over previous methods.
- The rationale for using four appearance subnets and the necessity of the Entangle Subnet remain unclear, raising questions about the model's complexity and efficiency.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis in the ablation study to elucidate the reasons behind the results. Additionally, including a broader range of previous methods in the qualitative and quantitative comparisons would strengthen the paper. A user study should be incorporated to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the stylization quality. Furthermore, clarifying the motivations for using four appearance subnets and the Entangle Subnet would enhance the understanding of the model's design. Lastly, we suggest reorganizing Section 3 for clearer presentation of the methodology.
