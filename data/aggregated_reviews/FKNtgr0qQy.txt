### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into whether instruction-guided sequence modeling for reinforcement learning (RL) leads to grounded internal representations within agents. The authors propose a "blindfolded" navigation task in the BabyAI environment, where agents must infer intermediate states from limited initial information. They compare Transformer-based sequence learners that have seen intermediate states during training with those that have not, finding that language instructions enhance performance and that both model types can learn to represent the environment, albeit in different ways.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The novel "blindfolded" navigation task effectively tests agents' abilities to learn intermediate representations in the minigrid domain.
- The probing performance analysis across different Transformer layers is thorough and insightful.
- The impact of language instructions on probe performance is well-documented.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation is limited to a single environment, which weakens the generalizability of the findings.
- Results contradict the conclusion that models can infer intermediate states, as they appear sensitive to the state information provided.
- The paper lacks clarity regarding the specific measurements of internal representations and their grounding in relation to the given instructions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including multiple environments to strengthen the contributions of the work. Clarifying the underlying motivation and addressing the contradictions in the results would enhance the paper's coherence. Additionally, we suggest providing more precise definitions of key terms, such as "layout," and ensuring that the probing technique's dynamics are clearly articulated. Incorporating missing references and addressing the questions posed by reviewers regarding probe predictions and model dynamics would further solidify the paper's contributions.
