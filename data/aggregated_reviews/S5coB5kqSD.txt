Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents VeXKD, a versatile framework that integrates Cross-Modal Fusion with Knowledge Distillation (KD) for 3D detection tasks. The authors propose a modality-general fusion teacher that narrows the gap between teacher and single-modal student models, employing a data-driven mask generation network to create unique spatial masks that enhance feature distillation. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate significant improvements in 3D detection and BEV map segmentation tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The integration of cross-modal fusion and KD in 3D perception is a novel approach that enhances single-modal models.
2. The experimental results show substantial improvements in key metrics, supported by extensive ablation studies.
3. The framework is modality- and task-agnostic, applicable to various student modalities and downstream tasks.

Weaknesses:
1. The baseline is too low, lacking comparisons with state-of-the-art methods such as BEVDepth and VCD, which are not included in Table 1.
2. The related work section is incomplete, missing some significant prior works.
3. The novelty is limited, as the Masked Feature Distillation concept is previously proposed in FD3D.
4. The inference speed of the student model is not compared with existing state-of-the-art models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section by including a more comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art methods and ensure that comparisons with VCD are included in Table 1. Additionally, we suggest conducting more experiments with different baselines, such as BEVDepth and long-term temporal fusion settings, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Furthermore, clarifying the impact of temporal information on the results would enhance the paper's depth.
