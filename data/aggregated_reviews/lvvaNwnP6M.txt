Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework called H-InDex for dexterous manipulation tasks using a 30 DoF robotic hand in simulation. The method consists of three stages: the first stage employs a pre-trained network from a 3D human hand pose estimation dataset; the second stage adapts the representation with self-supervised keypoint detection, updating only 0.18% of the model's parameters; and the final stage learns a reinforcement learning (RL) policy while adapting the representation using exponential moving average for changing distributions. The authors demonstrate that their approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 16.8% absolute improvement and achieves superior sample efficiency in 10 out of 12 tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The idea of leveraging human hand pose estimation as a prior is innovative, and the experimental results support the method's soundness.
- Adapting a limited number of parameters through BatchNorm layer statistics is a practical approach that may benefit other domain transfer tasks.
- The paper is well-organized and clearly written, facilitating reader comprehension.

Weaknesses:
- Some tasks show that the proposed method performs comparably or worse than baselines, raising questions about its effectiveness.
- The necessity of stage 3 is questionable, as its performance appears similar to the pipeline without it in certain tasks.
- The paper lacks discussion on limitations or failure modes, and some conclusions drawn are not empirically supported, necessitating more rigorous justification and experimental validation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis regarding the impact of momentum values in BatchNorm, as empirical studies alone may not suffice. Further clarification on the significance of stage 3 is essential to understand its contribution to performance. Additionally, we suggest including scales for the X-axis and Y-axis in Fig. 8 for better interpretability. The authors should also consider providing more comprehensive ablation results across various environments to strengthen their claims and address the concerns regarding the generalizability of their findings.
