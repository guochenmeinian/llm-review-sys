Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel watermarking scheme for language models that ensures undetectability and robustness against adversarial edits, including insertions, deletions, and substitutions. The authors construct pseudorandom codes (PRCs) that are robust to a constant fraction of edits, achieved through an indexing approach and local weak pseudorandom functions (PRFs). The scheme is theoretically proven to satisfy three critical properties: undetectability, soundness, and edit robustness, with potential applications in preventing misuse of AI-generated content.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a new watermarking scheme capable of handling a broader range of adversarial edits.
2. It provides a thorough theoretical analysis and proof of robustness and undetectability grounded in cryptographic principles.
3. The construction of PRCs based on local weak PRFs and the indexing approach is novel and significant.

Weaknesses:
1. The presentation is insufficiently polished, particularly in Section 5, which lacks clarity and detail in connecting PRCs to watermarking.
2. There is a lack of empirical evaluation, making it difficult to assess the practical effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
3. The requirement for a constant entropy rate in generated text may limit the scheme's applicability across different language models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the exposition in Section 5 by clearly explaining the connection between PRCs and watermarking schemes, starting with a high-level overview. Additionally, consider revising the notation used in Algorithm 3 to avoid confusion, such as using $\mu_i$ instead of $p_i$. It would also be beneficial to clarify the perturbation channel's static nature and its implications for robustness. Furthermore, we suggest including empirical evaluations to demonstrate the scheme's effectiveness in real-world scenarios and addressing the scalability and efficiency of the proposed method. Lastly, a discussion on the trade-offs between undetectability and robustness should be included to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the scheme's limitations.
