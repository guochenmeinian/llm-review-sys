Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ProtoSeg, a prototype-based framework designed to unify semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation tasks on point clouds. The authors propose a method that utilizes prototype association for point distribution and dynamic prototype updates, introducing three optimization terms for distance regularization. The results indicate that ProtoSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The prototype-based method is reliable and convincing.
2. The unification of different segmentation tasks is an interesting and significant problem.
3. The proposed method demonstrates strong performance, achieving state-of-the-art results under most conditions.
4. The thorough ablation studies and discussions provide valuable insights into model design.
5. Clear illustrations enhance comprehension.

Weaknesses:
1. There is a lack of explicit discussion on limitations.
2. The choice of OAcc as a metric in ablation studies is questionable; mIoU is more relevant in segmentation tasks and should be considered.
3. The paper does not address the computational efficiency of the model, raising concerns about its speed compared to task-specific models and the impact of prototype numbers on efficiency.
4. The analysis of parameters, flops, and time consumption is missing, particularly regarding the effects of replacing the original prediction head with the prototypical classifier.
5. The paper lacks a detailed discussion on the challenges of unifying segmentation tasks and how the prototype classifier addresses these challenges.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on limitations by explicitly addressing potential drawbacks of the model. Additionally, we suggest switching the ablation study metric from OAcc to mIoU, as it is more relevant for segmentation tasks. The authors should also provide a comprehensive analysis of the model's computational efficiency, including comparisons with task-specific models and insights on the relationship between efficiency and the number of prototypes. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include a detailed analysis of parameters, flops, and time consumption, as well as a discussion on the challenges of unifying segmentation tasks and how their approach differs from existing methods in the image segmentation domain.
