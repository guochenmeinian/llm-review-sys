Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework called MixVal for validating domain-adapted models using mixed samples. While leveraging mixed samples is not new, its application to domain adaptation model validation is innovative. The framework is generalizable and can be integrated with various adaptation methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance across multiple domain adaptation methods and validation techniques, including SND and Corr-C. The authors effectively address the challenges of model validation in scenarios where target labels are unavailable.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The problem of model validation in domain adaptation is well-defined and practically motivated.
2. The framework's simplicity, generalizability, and superior performance are notable strengths.
3. Extensive experimental support, including various datasets and adaptation methods, reinforces the claims.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks theoretical analysis to substantiate the proposed framework.
2. Methodological novelty is questioned, as the approach appears to synthesize existing techniques like Entropy, SND, and Mixup without sufficient differentiation.
3. Presentation issues exist, particularly regarding the clarity of formulations and the empirical results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis to support the correlation between the ICE score and model performance. Additionally, providing a detailed comparison with existing methods utilizing Mixup, such as Manifold Mixup and CutMix, would enhance the novelty of the work. Clarifying the formulation discrepancies noted in the reviews and ensuring consistent presentation of empirical results will also strengthen the paper.
