Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for detecting hidden confounding using observational data from multiple environments, relying on the assumptions of Faithfulness & Causal Markov Property, Shared Causal Graph, Independent Causal Mechanism Principle, and Non-degenerate Probabilistic Independent Causal Mechanisms. The authors propose an independence test between treatment and outcome across environments, asserting that dependence indicates the presence of unobserved confounders. They support their claims with synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written, with clear motivation and a thorough discussion of assumptions, particularly in Section 4.1.  
- The presentation is excellent, with effective graphics that enhance understanding.  
- The approach addresses a significant issue in causal inference, and the experiments demonstrate implications in both synthetic and real-world datasets.  

Weaknesses:  
- The practical utility of the method is questionable, as practitioners may not have access to multiple observational datasets, and those datasets may be heterogeneous, complicating preprocessing.  
- The assumption that different observational datasets will share the same DAG is hard to believe, given varying mechanisms across environments.  
- The lack of motivation for the chosen setting and the limited discussion on the realism of the assumptions weaken the paper.  
- The experiments do not convincingly demonstrate improved performance over existing methods for detecting latent confounders.  
- The approach may not adequately address selection bias, a common challenge in practice.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the practical utility of their method, particularly addressing the challenges of accessing and preprocessing multiple heterogeneous datasets. Additionally, we suggest providing a clearer motivation for the chosen setting and discussing the realism of the assumptions in greater depth. It would be beneficial to include more attention to Section 4.2, potentially moving some content to the appendix to allow for a detailed presentation of the proposed algorithm. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore the implications of selection bias and include additional real-world datasets to strengthen their findings.
