### Key Points
This paper presents a joint entity and relation extraction model, HGERE, which incorporates a span pruning mechanism and higher-order interaction via hypergraph neural networks. The authors propose improvements over the state-of-the-art PL-marker by analyzing the effects of span pruning and GNN separately, achieving strong results across three datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and intuitive.
- The results demonstrate good performance and improvements over PL-marker.

Weaknesses:
- The model's innovation is limited, as similar work on GNNs for higher-order interactions has been previously explored.
- The span pruning method lacks complexity and there are related works that should be addressed.
- The hypergraphs appear fully connected without edge weights, suggesting a need for alternative graph construction methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their work by conducting a deeper analysis of various state-of-the-art higher-order models and graph neural networks. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include more higher-order baselines beyond GCN and MFVI, as MFVI is considered outdated. We also suggest reporting precision and recall for clearer comparisons, detailing computing costs, and providing experiments to demonstrate how span pruning reduces error propagation. Lastly, discussing related work on learning with hypergraphs would enhance the paper's context.
