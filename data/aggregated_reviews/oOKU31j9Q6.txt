### Key Points
This paper presents the Sense-based Semantic Change Score (SSCS), an unsupervised method for detecting semantic changes in words over time by utilizing pre-trained static sense embeddings. The authors propose annotating occurrences of target words with sense labels and computing their distributions across different corpora to quantify semantic change through divergence measures. The reported results indicate that SSCS outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for English, Latin, and German, marking a significant contribution to the diachronic study of language.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel application of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) tools in the diachronic domain, providing fresh insights into sense-aware semantic changes.
- Methodologically thorough, the study employs various sense embeddings and distance measures, demonstrating transparency in how sense distributions have changed.
- The paper is well-written and presents its findings clearly, making it accessible to readers.

Weaknesses:
- The justification for using different divergence measures, such as cosine distance and Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD), is insufficient, leading to perceptions of an arbitrary methodology.
- The novelty of the approach is limited, as existing unsupervised methods for semantic change detection are not adequately addressed or compared.
- The paper lacks essential references to state-of-the-art models and related works, which diminishes its comprehensiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the choice of divergence measures, clearly articulating the advantages of each to enhance methodological rigor. Additionally, the authors should include comparisons with state-of-the-art WSD models, such as ESC, and address the omission of datasets like RuShiftEval and Swedish from their experiments. A more comprehensive literature review is necessary to include relevant works and benchmarks, particularly for languages other than English. Furthermore, we suggest exploring a qualitative comparison between SSCS and existing unsupervised clustering methods to substantiate the claimed advantages of their approach. Lastly, the authors should clarify the computational efficiency of their method in the abstract and provide a thorough explanation of the rationale behind their experimental design.
