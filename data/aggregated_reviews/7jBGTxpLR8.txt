### Key Points
This paper presents a well-written study on the potential of polaritonic circuitry for quantum information processing, enhanced by machine learning techniques, specifically extreme learning techniques. The timing of this research is appropriate given recent advancements in dipolaritons in waveguides, which have shown enhanced nonlinearities. The authors propose a modeling approach using a local chi-3 nonlinear term and losses, adhering to a standard quantum optical Hamiltonian. However, the connection to polaritons is questioned, as the study primarily focuses on a lossy quantum optical system without sufficient detail on the materials or conditions necessary for strong light-matter coupling.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The study is well-written and presents a clear message regarding polaritonic circuitry.  
- The results demonstrate excellent performance, with a solid foundation in quantum-optical equations and machine learning methodology.  

Weaknesses:  
- The relevance of the term "polaritonic" is unclear, as the study lacks detailed explanations of the materials and conditions needed for strong light-matter coupling.  
- The training process for the structure described is not clearly articulated, leading to potential confusion.  
- There is a contradiction in the statements regarding the positivity of g_2, which could mislead readers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the connection between their work and polaritonic systems by providing more details on the materials and conditions required for strong light-matter coupling. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the training process of the structure, particularly regarding the roles of the nonlinear and linear layers, to enhance reader understanding. Finally, we advise correcting the contradictory statements about g_2 to state that it is strictly "non-negative."
