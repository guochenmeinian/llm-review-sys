### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach named Style-Linguistic Mismatch (SLIM) for generalizable audio deepfake detection. The authors assert that a dependency between linguistic and style information can enhance audio anti-spoofing tasks and provide interpretability for deep learning models. A proof-of-concept experiment demonstrates a higher correlation coefficient between linguistics and style in real audio. The proposed two-stage learning framework captures this dependency through compression modules and a projection head. The authors conducted extensive experiments across multiple datasets, showing improved performance over several state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, particularly on out-domain datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper explicitly explores the dependency between style and linguistics for audio deepfake detection.
2. It simultaneously addresses interpretability and generalizability, which is novel in the field.
3. The experiments demonstrate strong performance, especially on out-domain datasets, which is critical for anti-spoofing tasks.

Weaknesses:
1. The first training stage relies on an abnormal detection task using only real audio, which may not adequately represent the vast amount of normal data available.
2. The analysis section lacks depth, particularly in the "Interpretation of model decisions," with limited support for claims regarding artifacts in synthesized speech.
3. The title's claim of "generalized" detection is undermined by the limited diversity of the datasets used, particularly in terms of speaker variability and speech patterns.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis section by providing a more comprehensive interpretation of model decisions, including visual analysis of incorrectly classified speech samples. Additionally, incorporating more recent and diverse datasets, such as Mozilla Common Voice, would strengthen the claims of generalization. It would also be beneficial to address the correlation between the style-linguistic mismatch and deepfake samples more intuitively, possibly through clearer illustrations. Finally, exploring the method's performance under various audio degradations and testing against a broader range of TTS models would enhance the robustness of the findings.
