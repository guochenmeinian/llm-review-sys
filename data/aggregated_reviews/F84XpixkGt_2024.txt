### Key Points
This paper presents Instructional Segment Embeddings (ISE), a novel technique aimed at enhancing the safety of large language models (LLMs) by embedding different types of instructions—system, user, and data—into the model’s architecture. ISE allows the model to prioritize these instructions, leading to improvements in robustness against adversarial prompts and enhanced instruction-following capabilities, with reported gains of up to 18.68% in robustness and 4.1% in instruction-following on evaluated benchmarks. However, the paper acknowledges potential limitations against adaptive attacks, particularly jailbreak attacks, and the need for further exploration of these vulnerabilities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors address a critical area in LLM safety, demonstrating improved robustness to adversarial attacks across various models and datasets.
- The ISE method effectively prevents prompt injection and ensures adherence to system-level instructions, enhancing model robustness.

Weaknesses:
- The discussion on adversarial attacks lacks nuance, particularly regarding the potential for misuse of safety protocols.
- Implementation details are unclear, especially regarding how the model prioritizes hierarchical instructions and the lack of a clear metric for "robustness."
- The exploration of instruction complexity is limited, with no evaluation of larger models or scenarios involving multiple conflicting instructions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of adversarial attacks by addressing the potential for misuse of safety protocols and exploring strategies to counter adaptive attacks. Clarifying how the model prioritizes hierarchical instructions during training and inference is essential, as is providing a clear definition of the robustness metric used. Additionally, we suggest expanding the experiments to include larger models and more complex instruction scenarios to evaluate the scalability and effectiveness of ISE in real-world applications. A figure illustrating the training strategy would also enhance clarity.
