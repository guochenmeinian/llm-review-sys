### Key Points
This paper presents a technique called Adaptive-Consistency, which dynamically adjusts the number of samples generated from large language models (LLMs) based on the agreement level among the samples. Unlike traditional Self-Consistency methods that require a fixed number of samples, Adaptive-Consistency can significantly reduce the sample budget—up to 7.9 times—while maintaining comparable accuracy. The authors provide extensive experimental results across 17 datasets and three LLMs, demonstrating the method's effectiveness and efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is innovative, addressing significant limitations of existing Self-Consistency techniques.
- Comprehensive experiments across various datasets showcase the technique's broad applicability and efficiency.
- The paper is clearly written and well-justified, making it accessible for readers.

Weaknesses:
- Clarity regarding the experimental setup for dynamic budgets is lacking, particularly in section 5.2.
- The computational expense of the numerical integrations for the Dirichlet/Beta/CRP models is not adequately detailed, raising concerns about real-time efficiency.
- The performance analysis versus budget is somewhat lighter than desired, with a need for statistical tests or error bars for clearer interpretation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental setup in section 5.2, specifically detailing how the dynamic budget is enforced. Additionally, we suggest including information on the computational costs associated with the numerical integrations for the Dirichlet/Beta/CRP models to better assess real-time efficiency. Finally, we encourage the authors to enhance the performance analysis by incorporating statistical tests or error bars to facilitate interpretation of the results.
