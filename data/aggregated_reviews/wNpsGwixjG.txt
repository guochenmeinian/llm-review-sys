Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents robustness-aware quantization (RAQ), a method designed to enhance the efficiency of noise estimation networks by utilizing the robustness of early-stage diffusion models. The authors propose a strategy that employs low-bit activations during the early reverse diffusion process while maintaining high-bit activations for later stages. Experimental results indicate that this approach can improve performance while reducing activation bits below 8 bits.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The idea is straightforward and effectively promotes the application of Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) in diffusion models.
2. Extensive analyses demonstrate early-stage robustness through entropy transitions and noise injection.
3. The paper is well-organized, making it easy to follow, and includes code for result reproduction.
4. Empirical experiments validate the motivation for varying quantization rates at different diffusion stages.

Weaknesses:
1. The inconsistency in Tab. 1, where RAQ sets different bitwidths in five intervals, contradicts Algorithm 1, which suggests per-step adjustments.
2. The paper does not provide sufficient evidence of practical benefits from reduced activation bitwidths, especially given the advanced samplers that may limit the impact of early-stage quantization.
3. The lack of runtime, FLOPs, and model size metrics hinders the demonstration of the proposed method's effectiveness.
4. The choice of FID threshold in the RTQ algorithm is unclear, and the authors do not adequately discuss the limitations or potential societal impacts of their work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the bitwidth settings in Tab. 1 to align with Algorithm 1 and provide a more detailed analysis of the robustness of bitwidth selection. Additionally, including runtime comparisons and FLOPs would enhance the understanding of the proposed method's efficiency. We encourage the authors to discuss the limitations and potential societal impacts of their approach in a dedicated section. Finally, providing a clearer explanation of the choice of FID threshold for the RTQ algorithm would strengthen the paper.
