Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new benchmark for Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) called Continually Changing Corruptions (CCC), which introduces a stream of interpolated corrupted ImageNet images. The authors propose a simple baseline method, RDumb, which periodically resets the model to its pretrained state, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. The experiments reveal that many SOTA methods perform poorly on this benchmark, highlighting significant shortcomings in their evaluation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The overall message is clear, and the experiments effectively illustrate the evaluation shortcomings of TTA methods.
- The baseline RDumb is simple, meets all TTA assumptions, and should be considered a standard in future research.
- The experiments are extensive and thorough, demonstrating the proposed benchmark's robustness.

Weaknesses:
- Clarity issues exist in the mathematical notation and definitions, particularly regarding $cos(y_t, \bar{y}_t$) and the term "collapse."
- The paper lacks an analysis of the performance degradation reasons for SOTA TTA approaches, such as overfitting or catastrophic forgetting.
- Experimental results on CIFAR10-to-CIFAR10C and CIFAR100-to-CIFAR100C tasks are missing, which would strengthen the case for the proposed approach.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by defining "collapse" and clarifying the mathematical notation in Eq. 1, particularly the meaning of $cos(y_t, \bar{y}_t)$. Additionally, the authors should analyze the reasons behind the performance degradation of SOTA TTA methods and provide insights on mitigating these issues. Including experimental results on CIFAR10-to-CIFAR10C and CIFAR100-to-CIFAR100C tasks would further support their claims. Finally, we encourage the authors to add error bars to their tables to indicate statistical significance in their results.
