Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a benchmark dataset for the PINN family, defining over 20 PDE problems and testing more than 10 PINN variants. Extensive experiments evaluate baseline performance, addressing multiscale phenomena, irregular geometry, and nonlinear behavior. The dataset is original, but similar existing works like PDEBench and PDEArena exist. The authors provide a supplementary section to differentiate their work, although the significance of focusing solely on PINNs appears limited.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-documented and clearly written.
- It includes a diverse set of PDE problems and comprehensive testing of various PINN methods.
- The organization is commendable, with a user-friendly Python tool for reproducing results.

Weaknesses:
- The scope is narrowly focused on PINN methods, potentially limiting impact.
- Some discussions, such as the generation of ground truth and the representation of complex geometries, are inadequately addressed in the main text.
- The paper relies on the appendix for critical information, which detracts from the main narrative.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors broaden the scope beyond just PINN methods to include neural operator-type models, which could enhance the benchmark's applicability. Additionally, including datasets with varying PDE coefficients would provide a more comprehensive understanding of PINN performance. We suggest that the authors discuss how ground truth was produced and clarify the representation of complex geometries in the main text. Furthermore, we advise including traditional methods like finite difference schemes in the benchmarks to contextualize PINN performance. Lastly, we recommend that limitations and hardware details be integrated into the main paper rather than relegated to the appendix.
