### Key Points
This paper presents a framework termed Personal Popularity Aware Counterfactual (PPAC) to address global popularity bias in recommendation systems by introducing the concept of personal popularity (PP). The authors integrate both PP and global popularity (GP) to enhance recommendation accuracy and conduct comprehensive experiments demonstrating the framework's effectiveness. The paper is well-structured, easy to follow, and includes code and datasets for transparency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The concept of personal popularity is innovative and effectively integrated into the recommendation process.
- The paper is well-written, clearly structured, and provides extensive experiments, including an ablation study that highlights the impact of various components.
- The approach is supported by a solid theoretical foundation and comprehensive analysis.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation primarily compares the proposed framework to methods from 2021, lacking comparisons with more recent studies, which limits the demonstration of its superiority.
- The experiments are insufficiently diverse, relying on only three basic models and a limited set of metrics, which may weaken the conclusiveness of the results.
- The treatment of cold-start users and the specifics of user similarity calculations are not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including comparisons with more recent state-of-the-art methods to substantiate the framework's efficacy. Additionally, the authors should expand the experiments to include a wider variety of models and metrics, particularly focusing on popularity bias mitigation. Clarifying the differences between personal and global popularity, as well as providing more insights into the debiasing performance and cold-start user handling, would enhance the paper's contributions. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors provide detailed explanations for Equations 5-8 and consider releasing the code for reproducibility.
