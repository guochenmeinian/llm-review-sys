### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative approach to adjusting model size adaptively for Gaussian processes in continual learning settings, addressing the significant challenge posed by the dynamic nature of data availability in real-world applications. The authors propose an algorithm that automatically adjusts the number of inducing points while maintaining near-optimal performance, ensuring efficient computation and strong predictive accuracy with minimal hyperparameter tuning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The proposed algorithm is highly valuable for streaming data, requiring only one hyperparameter to tune, which significantly reduces the need for extensive fine-tuning.  
2. The empirical results convincingly demonstrate the algorithm's performance and efficacy across various datasets.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The paper could benefit from comparisons with other adaptive methods regarding prediction efficiency and additional metrics such as computational efficiency.  
2. There is a lack of explanation regarding the underlying motivation for the algorithm's effectiveness in continual learning and streaming data settings, which would enhance understanding of its strengths.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including comparisons of the proposed algorithm with other adaptive methods to assess prediction and computational efficiency. Additionally, providing a clearer explanation of the underlying motivation for the algorithm's effectiveness in continual learning and streaming data contexts would enhance the overall understanding of its strengths.
