Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for diffusion-model-based molecular inverse design, specifically focusing on Time-Aware Conditional Synthesis (TACS). The authors propose a novel approach that utilizes a time predictor to correct the data manifold during the guided generation of molecules, addressing the inconsistency between target distribution and generated samples. The method shows satisfactory results on the QM9 dataset and aims to improve the robustness of property-conditioned diffusion models for 3D molecule generation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for the study is clear, and the idea of using time correction to mitigate exposure bias is novel.
- The authors provide extensive related work and necessary ablation studies, enhancing the understanding of the literature.
- The paper demonstrates that TACS outperforms established baselines on the QM9 dataset, indicating improvements in generating molecules with desired properties.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments are insufficient; additional tests, such as designing molecules with specific substructures, are needed.
- The method is only validated on a single dataset (QM9), raising concerns about its generalizability.
- The presentation requires improvement due to typographical errors and incomplete references to the appendix.
- Some important experimental details and results appear to be missing or incorrect, including the evaluation of hyperparameters and comparisons with related works.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including more diverse datasets and conducting additional experiments to demonstrate the generalizability of TACS. Specifically, exploring the optimization of the number of atoms in generated molecules and extending the framework to discrete variables would enhance the study. Additionally, please ensure that all references to the appendix are accurate and that the impact of hyperparameters, such as the time window size, is thoroughly evaluated. Lastly, addressing the concerns regarding the accuracy of the time predictor and its reliance on the data would strengthen the paper's findings.
