Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents UrbanKGent, a unified framework for constructing urban knowledge graphs (UrbanKGs) using large language models (LLMs). The framework includes instruction generation for relational triplet extraction and knowledge graph completion, tailored to urban data's heterogeneity and spatial characteristics. An iterative refinement module enhances trajectories derived from the GPT-4 model, which are fine-tuned on Llama 2 and Llama 3 models, resulting in UrbanKGC agents. The evaluation demonstrates that UrbanKGent outperforms 31 baselines in urban knowledge graph construction tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses an important application domain of LLMs with a well-developed workflow.
2. Intensive efforts in data crawling, preprocessing, and empirical validation of the UrbanKGC agent's performance are commendable.
3. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, utilizing both human and GPT-4 self-assessment.

Weaknesses:
1. The methodology for generating the corpus, a key component of the framework, lacks systematic scientific rigor.
2. The transferability of the method to cities not included in the fine-tuning process is questionable.
3. The roles of GPT-4 and the smaller LLM in the framework are vaguely described.
4. The computational efficiency and scalability of the proposed algorithms are not thoroughly discussed.
5. The motivation for selecting geospatial relations for KGC tasks is not clearly explained.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the systematic methodology for corpus generation to enhance the framework's scientific rigor. Additionally, clarifying the roles of GPT-4 and the smaller LLM would strengthen the paper. We suggest providing a detailed discussion on the computational efficiency and scalability of UrbanKGent, especially concerning larger datasets. The authors should also elaborate on the motivation for focusing on geospatial relations and consider including a comparison with existing UrbanKG construction methods. Finally, a more detailed description of the iterative trajectory self-refinement module, including the criteria for refinement and the number of iterations, would enhance clarity.
