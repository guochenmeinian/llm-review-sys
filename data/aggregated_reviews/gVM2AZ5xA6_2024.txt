Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for animatable facial avatar reconstruction from a single RGB image using 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) for real-time rendering. The proposed method generates pixel-aligned Gaussian point clouds for identity reconstruction and employs 3DMM to create additional Gaussian points for facial expression control. Trained on a large corpus of human talking videos, the network can produce real-time reenactment results for unseen identities. Experimental results indicate that the method achieves plausible reenactment outcomes and outperforms existing approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces the first generalizable 3D Gaussian-based avatar modeling method, providing a comprehensive comparison with recent state-of-the-art baselines.
- Results demonstrate consistent superiority over existing methods across various metrics and settings.
- The dual-lifting method is novel, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction and effective expression control.

Weaknesses:
- The method's design is confusing; the static Gaussian points from the reconstruction branch appear to dominate expression modeling, raising questions about their role in dynamic expression control.
- The dual-lifting technique lacks novelty as similar concepts have been previously employed in 3D human reconstruction.
- Clarity is needed regarding whether baseline methods were trained on the same dataset as the proposed method, as this affects the validity of comparisons.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method design, particularly the roles of the reconstruction and expression Gaussian points, to resolve the apparent conflicts in expression modeling. Additionally, we suggest providing qualitative comparisons against state-of-the-art methods in the form of dynamic reenactment videos to highlight differences and advantages. The authors should also conduct a more thorough ablation study to validate the importance of the dual-plane lifting by potentially removing the reconstruction branch. Finally, a discussion on the impact of 3DMM estimation accuracy on performance and the limitations of the method should be included.
