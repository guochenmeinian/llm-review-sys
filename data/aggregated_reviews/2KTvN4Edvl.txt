### Key Points
This paper presents a Guideline Learning (GL) framework aimed at enhancing in-context learning (ICL) for information extraction (IE) tasks, specifically event and relation extraction. The authors identify a challenge in ICL related to "conceptual bias," where the understanding of concepts by large language models (LLMs) may not align with target concepts. To mitigate this, the GL framework generates guidelines from a limited number of annotations during training and retrieves these guidelines during inference. Experimental results indicate that the GL framework improves ICL performance, although it does not reach the level of state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised models. Notably, the authors' approach outperforms supervised models on a manually labeled test set (Equity Underweight).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The GL framework is an innovative approach that addresses a relevant challenge in the context of LLMs.
- Experimental results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness compared to vanilla ICL methods.
- The paper is well-written, with a clear presentation and a focused related work section.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation relies on a single dataset for two tasks, limiting generalizability.
- The term "conceptual bias" is vague and inadequately substantiated in relation to its impact on ICL.
- The paper lacks a mandatory "Limitations" section, which is a significant oversight.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the term "conceptual bias" and provide more substantial evidence for its relevance to ICL performance. Additionally, we suggest including a "Limitations" section to comply with EMNLP policy. To enhance reproducibility, the authors should report variance in results due to random sampling in their experimental settings. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore the application of their framework to datasets lacking readily available guidelines and to clarify the role of the generalizer in the methodology section. Lastly, we advise correcting grammatical discrepancies and including examples in Section 3 to illustrate the guidelines before and after updates.
