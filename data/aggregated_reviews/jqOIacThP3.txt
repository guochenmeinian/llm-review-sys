### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of "BERTology," investigating whether subject number is linearly encoded in BERT's hidden states. The authors demonstrate that the representation can be manipulated to encode opposite number information using linear transformations. They employ iterative nullspace projection to compute an orthonormal lower-dimensional basis for the subspace encoding grammatical number and analyze the effects of their interventions using a dataset on number agreement. The study shows robustness to hyperparameter choices but emphasizes the need for careful selection of target layers and tokens.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and clearly structured.  
- It proposes an interesting finding regarding the linear encoding of grammatical number in BERT, supported by robust analysis and experiments.  
- The methodology demonstrates a clear link between vector space manipulation and linguistic properties, with hyperparameter checking across different models.

Weaknesses:  
- The focus on a single model type and linguistic feature limits the generalizability of the findings.  
- The contributions may not be novel enough, as the idea that transformers represent some linguistic features linearly is not new.  
- The presentation of the methodology lacks clarity, particularly regarding the calculation of key parameters.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their contributions by expanding the experimental setup to include different BERT model sizes and other transformer models. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the methodology by explicitly discussing how to calculate the parameters involved in their approach. Finally, we encourage the authors to refine the title to better reflect the specific linguistic feature being studied, potentially incorporating terms related to grammatical number.
