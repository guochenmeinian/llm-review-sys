Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel 3D object detection framework named CluB, which integrates BEV-based and cluster-based representations. The authors propose the Cluster Feature Diffusion module and the imitation loss to enhance feature fusion, along with the Cluster Query Generation module to improve object query accuracy. CluB achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo and nuScenes datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining these two methodologies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with clear explanations and informative illustrations, such as Figure 2, which effectively conveys the overall concept.
- It is the first work to explicitly combine BEV and cluster-based methods, leveraging their respective strengths, which is well-motivated.
- Comprehensive experimental evaluations show good performance, particularly achieving state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes dataset.

Weaknesses:
- Some details are overlooked, such as the similarity of Figure 1 (a) to a figure in the FSD paper, which requires citation. There are also citation placement issues and errors in Table 1 regarding performance metrics.
- The ablation studies lack depth; additional performance analysis is needed to elucidate how different queries influence final outcomes. The authors should design experiments to demonstrate the unique properties of the two representations.
- There is insufficient analysis of the real-time performance and computational efficiency of CluB, particularly regarding the time cost associated with the cluster branch.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their figures and ensure proper citations are included, particularly for Figure 1 (a) and the citations in L108. Additionally, please correct the errors in Table 1 regarding performance metrics and ensure the table is properly formatted. 

We encourage the authors to conduct more detailed performance analyses to reveal the inner workings of CluB, particularly how the two types of queries affect performance. It would be beneficial to move Table 1 from the supplementary materials to the main paper to utilize space effectively.

We also suggest that the authors include runtime evaluations and report latency to provide a clearer understanding of CluB's efficiency compared to baseline methods. Lastly, a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity and real-time performance should be included to address concerns regarding the method's practicality.
