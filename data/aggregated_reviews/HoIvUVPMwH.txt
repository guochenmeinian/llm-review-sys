### Key Points
This paper presents DGAC, a Diffusion-based Graph-Agnostic Clustering method that effectively addresses the limitations of prior graph clustering approaches by capturing high-order node connectivity in both the input graph G and the affinity graph H. DGAC integrates graph neural networks and spectral clustering into a unified framework that minimizes the Dirichlet Energy of node embeddings and clustering results on both G and H. The method employs dual graph diffusion networks (DGDNs) to incorporate high-order connectivity from graph topology and node attributes. Additionally, DGAC includes three training loss functions to enhance feature extraction and clustering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DGAC significantly outperforms 12 baseline methods across both homophilic and heterophilic graph datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- DGAC effectively captures high-order connectivity in both the input graph G and the attribute graph H, overcoming limitations of previous methods.
- The integration of graph neural networks and spectral clustering through Dirichlet Energy minimization represents a novel contribution.
- The paper is well-structured, with comprehensive experimental setups that enhance reproducibility.
- Extensive experiments validate DGAC's superior performance on various datasets.

Weaknesses:
- A notation table is needed for improved readability.
- Some model details, such as the meaning of Lemma 2, are unclear and require further elaboration.
- The authors should provide a pseudo algorithm for the proposed method.
- The introduction could be clearer and more focused, with better motivation and interpretation of key insights from Table 1.
- The evaluation lacks comparisons with recent self-supervised learning approaches for homophilic datasets.
- The ablation study is limited to heterophilic datasets, leaving insights for homophilic datasets unexplored.
- The paper does not adequately address the computational and scalability challenges of the proposed method on large-scale graphs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction and provide a notation table to enhance readability. Additionally, the authors should clarify the meaning of Lemma 2 and include a pseudo algorithm for DGAC. To strengthen the evaluation, we suggest including comparisons with recent self-supervised learning approaches for homophilic datasets and expanding the ablation study to cover insights for homophilic datasets. Furthermore, the authors should address the computational efficiency and scalability of DGAC on large-scale graphs, as well as provide a detailed README file to facilitate understanding and execution of the code implementation.
