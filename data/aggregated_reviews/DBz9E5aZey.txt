Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents two variants of Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD), namely Virtual Particle SVGD (VP-SVGD) and Global Batch SVGD (GB-SVGD), which aim to improve convergence rates under weaker assumptions. The authors introduce the concept of "virtual particles" to facilitate a finite-particle stochastic approximation of population-limit SVGD dynamics. The proposed algorithms demonstrate significant improvements in convergence rates compared to existing methods, supported by numerical experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of virtual particles is a novel and interesting concept that enhances the analysis of SVGD.
- The convergence rates achieved by the proposed algorithms are significantly better than those of existing methods.
- The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it accessible to a broad audience.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical results and some arguments lack rigorous proof, relying heavily on intuition.
- Notation in Section 4 is confusing, particularly regarding the definitions and roles of variables.
- The empirical evaluations of the algorithms on real-world datasets are insufficiently detailed, limiting practical assessment.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 3 by defining the push-forward map $(\cdot)_{\sharp}$, as it is crucial for understanding the algorithm's design. Additionally, we suggest providing a more rigorous derivation of the updates in (2) to clarify why (3) is a stochastic approximation. The authors should also address the confusion surrounding the notation for filtration and clarify the role of countably infinite particles in the algorithm. Finally, a detailed discussion of the limitations and potential future research avenues would enhance the paper's impact.
