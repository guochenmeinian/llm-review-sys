Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel self-supervised learning (SSL) method called TopoSRL for simplicial complexes, aiming to address the limitations of existing graph-based SSL methods by capturing higher-order interactions and preserving topology in learned representations. The authors introduce a simplicial augmentation technique for enriched representations and a simplicial contrastive loss function to maintain local and global information. Experimental results suggest that TopoSRL outperforms state-of-the-art graph SSL techniques and supervised simplicial neural models across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method offers an intuitive approach to SSL for simplicial complexes.
- It effectively captures higher-order interactions and preserves topology in learned representations.
- The simplicial augmentation technique enriches representations.
- The simplicial contrastive loss function maintains local and global information in simplicial complexes.

Weaknesses:
- The paper's presentation and writing could be improved for better accessibility to general readers.
- The organization of the method section requires refinement for clearer explanations and to reduce mathematical overflow.
- Important definitions are relegated to footnotes, which is not ideal.
- The practical effectiveness of the proposed method is not sufficiently demonstrated.
- The choice of datasets may not fully reflect the performance potential of the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation and writing style to enhance accessibility for general readers. Specifically, organizing the method section more effectively, providing clearer explanations, and reducing the overflow of mathematical expressions would greatly improve understanding. Important definitions should be included in the main text rather than in footnotes.

To better demonstrate the method's effectiveness, we suggest exploring a wider range of datasets, particularly those with a higher number of 3-simplices and higher-dimensional simplices, to comprehensively evaluate the method. Additionally, investigating the proper downstream task that can best showcase the advantages of the proposed method would be valuable. Understanding how the method addresses the computational burden associated with higher-order simplices is also crucial for insights into its scalability.
