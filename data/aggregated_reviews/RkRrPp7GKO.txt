Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents H2O, a technique aimed at improving the efficiency of Transformer models by reducing the size of the key-value (KV) cache during inference. The authors propose a mechanism called the heavy hitter oracle, which identifies important tokens based on attention scores, allowing for significant memory reduction and improved throughput. The method is framed as a dynamic submodular optimization problem, with theoretical guarantees provided for its effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The algorithm is impactful, addressing a critical issue in the efficiency of large language models.
- The paper is well-analyzed through theoretical guarantees, experiments, and ablations, demonstrating strong performance in terms of decoding latency and memory reduction.
- The approach is intuitive and empirically validated, preserving performance across various model architectures and benchmarks.

Weaknesses:
- The submission lacks sufficient empirical evidence to substantiate claims of efficiency, particularly regarding the reduction of KV cache memory footprint by 5-10x while maintaining accuracy.
- There is a notable inconsistency between the evaluations in Sections 5.1 and 5.2, as the latter relies on synthetic data, raising doubts about real-world applicability.
- The baseline comparisons are overly simplistic, primarily contrasting with a naive Local baseline, and do not adequately address more robust alternatives.
- The claim regarding increased diversity in generated outputs is weakly supported and requires more substantial validation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical evidence supporting their efficiency claims, particularly by providing more detailed results from real-world datasets. It would be beneficial to clarify the throughput improvements in Section 5.1 and to report zero/one-shot performance to assess the method's applicability in various redundancy scenarios. Additionally, we suggest incorporating comparisons with more sophisticated baselines and addressing the discrepancies in evaluation methodologies between synthetic and real-world data. Finally, we encourage the authors to substantiate claims regarding diversity with larger human studies or appropriate diversity metrics.
