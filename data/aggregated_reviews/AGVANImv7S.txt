### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for evaluating factual knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs) by generating diverse questions from knowledge graphs (KGs). The authors create true-false, multiple-choice, and short-answer questions to assess LLMs' accuracy while considering robustness and consistency through the inclusion of relevant, irrelevant, and anti-factual knowledge. The evaluation covers various LLMs and highlights the performance differences, particularly noting that ChatGPT outperforms others.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a timely issue in LLM evaluation and provides a comprehensive analysis across different LLMs, question types, and knowledge domains.
- The method of generating questions from KGs offers a potentially efficient alternative to constructing domain-specific datasets and considers LLM abstentions in evaluations.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed evaluation framework appears similar to prior works, raising questions about its novelty and contribution.
- There is a lack of clarity regarding the motivation for assessing factual knowledge over other types and whether the benchmark genuinely evaluates factual knowledge or merely the models' ability to follow instructions.
- Concerns about the potential leakage problems in the datasets used and the reproducibility of results due to underspecified parameters and the availability of code.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation section to clarify the importance of assessing factual knowledge specifically. Additionally, the authors should address the lack of related work and incorporate discussions on the influence of context on model predictions. We suggest including recall scores alongside precision in the analysis and providing more details about the methodology for ensuring the accuracy of the wrong entities mentioned. Lastly, the authors should clarify the reproducibility aspects by specifying parameter settings and the availability of their code.
