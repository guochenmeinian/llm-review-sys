### Key Points
This paper presents GNAT (General Narrative Alignment Tool), a novel algorithmic sequence alignment proposal for narrative alignment, extending techniques from bioinformatics to general narrative texts. The authors empirically test their approach using five distance metrics across four application domains: summary-to-book alignment, translated book alignment, plagiarism detection, and short story alignment. They propose a unification function for comparing results from different scoring functions and introduce a sampling-based method for computing statistical significance using a Gumbel distribution. The results are promising, and the tool along with evaluation datasets will be publicly released.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured, easy to read, and provides a clear introduction to the task and its associated problems.
- The approach is novel in applying existing concepts to a different context, and the possibility of computing statistically significant scores for narrative alignment is particularly noteworthy.
- The extensive evaluation across multiple domains demonstrates the tool's versatility.

Weaknesses:
- GNAT requires significant computational power, which may limit accessibility for users without GPU resources.
- The introduction is lengthy and could benefit from restructuring for clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the structure of Section 1 "Introduction" by splitting it for better clarity. Additionally, ensure that all figures and tables are referenced in the text, specifically Figure 1 and Table 1. In Section 3.1, clarify the function H before its introduction and correct the missing punctuation in "gap penalty However." In Section 4.1, capitalize "gumbel" to "Gumbel" and consider providing a footnote with the URL and last access date for Project Gutenberg instead of a bibliographic reference. Lastly, address minor typographical errors in the "References" section, such as inconsistent capitalization and punctuation.
