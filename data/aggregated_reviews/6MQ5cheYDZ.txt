Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a decision-aware actor-critic algorithm aimed at addressing objective mismatch in reinforcement learning. The authors propose a joint objective for training the actor and critic, ensuring monotonic policy improvement regardless of the chosen parameterization. The algorithm's theoretical foundations are supported by numerical results, demonstrating its performance against traditional methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The algorithm guarantees monotonic policy improvement and is well-motivated, with solid theoretical underpinnings.
- The paper is well-written, with clear presentation of concepts and results.

Weaknesses:
- The analysis of convergence is flawed, lacking assumptions on Lipschitz continuity, step-sizes, and stability of the coupled recursions.
- The experimentation is limited to simple environments, raising concerns about the algorithm's applicability to more complex scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the critic's role in minimizing expected TD error, as current explanations are misleading. Additionally, we suggest addressing the notation issues, particularly regarding J_s(ρ) and the validity of d^π and μ^π as probability distributions. The authors should provide conditions for the step-sizes used in the algorithm to ensure stability and convergence, as well as clarify how Markov noise is treated. We also encourage the authors to conduct experiments in more challenging environments, such as MuJoCo, and report on the time overhead of their algorithm compared to others. Finally, including ablation studies to explore the impact of the critic loss under various conditions would strengthen the empirical validation of their approach.
