Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SCGaussian, a few-shot 3D Gaussian Splatting model designed to tackle novel view degeneration in sparse input scenarios. SCGaussian utilizes matching priors to enforce 3D consistency by optimizing the positions of Gaussian primitives along rays, effectively addressing challenges faced by monocular depth-based methods. The hybrid representation combines ray-based and non-structured Gaussian primitives, ensuring accurate scene structure. Extensive experiments validate SCGaussian's state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating significant improvements in rendering quality and efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is clearly written and easy to follow.
2. The experiments are comprehensive and support the claims made.
3. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot novel view synthesis without requiring sparse 3D points as input.
4. The novel optimization of Gaussian primitive positions (Section 3.3) in conjunction with rendering geometry optimization is well-explained, with ablation studies in Section 4.2 demonstrating its impact.

Weaknesses:
- The claim of not requiring SFM points for initialization is questionable, as it relies heavily on precomputed camera poses, which often generate SFM points as a byproduct. The authors should clarify why triangulation isn't utilized if camera poses and 2D correspondences are available.
- The advantages of the proposed optimization over triangulation need further exploration, particularly regarding NVS quality, generalization, optimization time, and computational resources.
- The novelty of the paper may not meet the high standards expected at NIPS.
- The generalizability of the method to larger scenes, such as driving environments, remains uncertain, particularly in texture-poor areas.
- More comprehensive details on the matching prior, including the average number of pairs extracted and the extraction time, are necessary.
- The evaluation would benefit from additional geometric metrics, such as Chamfer Distance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the reliance on precomputed camera poses and the implications for SFM points. Additionally, we suggest including experiments that compare the proposed optimization of Gaussian primitives with triangulation to substantiate its advantages. The authors should also address the potential generalization of the method to larger scenes and provide more detailed information about the matching prior. Finally, incorporating additional geometric metrics in the evaluation would enhance the robustness of the findings.
