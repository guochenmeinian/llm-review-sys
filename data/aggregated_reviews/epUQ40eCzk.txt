### Key Points
This paper presents the TWIGMA dataset, comprising 800,000 AI-generated images sourced from Twitter, aimed at analyzing the characteristics and thematic attributes of AI-generated versus non-AI-generated images. The authors find that AI-generated images exhibit distinct characteristics and lower variability compared to their non-AI counterparts. They observe a correlation between the similarity of AI-generated images to natural images and the number of likes, suggesting a trend in user engagement with artistically sophisticated content. The authors acknowledge the dataset's limitations, including potential biases from non-AI-generated images and the platform-specific nature of the dataset. They emphasize the importance of human involvement in analyzing the dataset, introducing a pilot human annotation study to evaluate themes derived from their clustering approach. The authors also discuss the broader implications of their work for understanding human interaction with generative models and propose future studies to explore the alignment between human comprehension and machine outputs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
- The paper is well-written and structured, making it easy to follow.
- The dataset is potentially the first of its kind, providing valuable insights into the impact of generative AI.
- It includes a large-scale dataset with metadata that respects Twitter's data use policies and allows for temporal analysis of AI-generated content.
- The authors have taken significant steps to address data quality concerns, including random quality checks and a pilot human annotation study.
- The revised manuscript clarifies the dataset's limitations and the importance of responsible usage, particularly regarding privacy.
- The introduction of a human-centric perspective in dataset analysis enriches the research's insights.

**Weaknesses:**
- The significance of the dataset and its analyses is questioned, as the practical applications are not thoroughly discussed.
- There is a lack of rigorous verification that the images are indeed AI-generated, raising concerns about dataset noise.
- The methodologies employed are seen as convoluted, and some claims made in the paper lack sufficient justification.
- The dataset's static nature may limit its long-term utility, as noted by reviewers.
- Some reviewers expressed concerns that the suggested future work directions may not significantly extend the dataset's applicability beyond the current study.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset by incorporating a more human-centric aspect, such as involving humans-in-the-loop to tag images and provide brief descriptions. Additionally, we suggest simplifying the methodologies to enhance clarity and trustworthiness in the results. The authors should also consider providing a structured comparison with existing datasets, such as DiffusionDB, to clarify the significance of TWIGMA. Addressing the ethical implications of including Twitter IDs and NSFW content more comprehensively would strengthen the paper. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors consider more dynamic updates to TWIGMA, which could facilitate longitudinal studies. Engaging a larger pool of human annotators for more comprehensive analyses could also provide deeper insights into the themes and variations present in the dataset. Lastly, exploring further avenues for future work that could enhance the dataset's utility and applicability in broader contexts would be beneficial.
