Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to semi-supervised few-shot object detection (FSOD), where both base and novel classes have limited labeled data but abundant unlabeled data. The authors identify that traditional supervised models exhibit low recall on novel classes and propose a new method, SoftER Teacher, to enhance proposal learning. The model is trained using a two-stage process: semi-supervised base training with partial data and fine-tuning on a balanced set of base and novel samples. Experimental results indicate that SoftER Teacher achieves promising performance in the generalized few-shot object detection (GFSOD) setting.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The concept of integrating unlabeled data into few-shot object detection is innovative and holds significant practical value.
- The method demonstrates strong performance with only 10% labeled data from base classes.
- The paper is well-structured, with extensive experiments and a clear presentation of results.

Weaknesses:
1. The distinction between semi-supervised few-shot object detection and semi-supervised object detection lacks practical significance, as both scenarios involve scarce classes.
2. The proposed task aligns more closely with semi-supervised learning rather than few-shot learning, as the model is trained with some knowledge of novel classes.
3. The SoftER Teacher method appears to be a minor enhancement over the existing Soft Teacher framework, primarily adding a new loss function without substantial innovation.
4. The title of Section 3.1 is misleading, as it suggests a focus on effective FSOD while discussing improvements in novel recall.
5. Claims regarding the novelty of incorporating external unlabeled data for few-shot fine-tuning are not convincingly substantiated.
6. The absence of ablation studies or component analyses limits the demonstration of the proposed method's effectiveness.
7. The performance gains in the FSOD setting are minimal, with poor novel class performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
8. The paper lacks details on training resource requirements, such as memory and time.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the practical significance of distinguishing between base and novel classes in the context of their proposed task. Additionally, we suggest that the authors improve the theoretical foundation of their approach by providing a more robust justification for the use of unlabeled data in few-shot settings. It would be beneficial to include ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed components, particularly the new loss function. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide a comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art methods and to include performance metrics related to training resource usage. Lastly, we advise revising the section titles for accuracy and clarity.
