Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Alberta Wells Dataset, which is a large dataset of labeled oil wells in Alberta, Canada, derived from high-resolution Planet satellite imagery. The dataset focuses on both active and abandoned oil and gas wells, providing benchmarks for binary segmentation and object detection tasks. The authors highlight the challenges of detecting wells at a 3m resolution and the dataset's significant size, covering over 217,000 wells. They conduct experiments using established models to evaluate performance across various metrics, acknowledging the limitations of existing datasets and the need for improved methodologies in the field.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is extensive and represents a significant advancement in the oil well detection domain, being the largest compared to related work.
- High-resolution imagery enhances data quality, and the authors employ a sensible approach for dataset splits, ensuring balance.
- A thorough literature review is provided, and the supplementary material is well-documented, including example notebooks for user accessibility.
- The authors acknowledge the challenges faced by machine learning models and propose relevant solutions.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset is limited to Alberta, which may restrict its applicability to other regions and its value in detecting abandoned wells, particularly in areas with existing AER data.
- Extremely poor mAP50 values raise concerns about the dataset's utility, and the automatic generation of bounding boxes may compromise data quality.
- There is a lack of discussion regarding the practical utility of the dataset, challenges associated with detecting wells at a 3m resolution, and the absence of human benchmark comparisons and out-of-domain testing.
- The presentation of certain data, such as IoU metrics and model performance, could be clearer, and the emphasis on dataset splitting may detract from reporting metrics in realistic scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation of the literature review by converting the numerical data into a table format for clarity. Additionally, the authors should clarify the methods previously used in the field, particularly what constitutes a “simple ML algorithm.” Addressing the low mAP50 values and considering the impact of image quality on detection capabilities is crucial. We suggest providing clearer definitions and references for IoU metrics in Table 4 and reducing emphasis on dataset splitting in favor of reporting metrics in a realistic setup. 

Incorporating time-series data could provide valuable insights into well status changes, and the authors should comment on well abandonment statistics. We suggest benchmarking larger variants of SegFormer and exploring alternatives to DETR, such as Conditional DETR or Mask2Former, to potentially enhance performance, particularly for small object detection. Including detection plots and raw confidence values for model predictions would provide visual context for the results, and reporting additional metrics like true positive/false positive rates and F1 scores would be beneficial. Lastly, we advise the authors to consider archiving the dataset on a platform like Zenodo for long-term accessibility and to discuss the implications of using proprietary Planet data, including licensing issues.
