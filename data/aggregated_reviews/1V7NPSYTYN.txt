### Key Points
This paper presents a sophisticated hierarchical model that synthesizes high-resolution 3D medical volumes from textual descriptions in radiology reports. The authors propose a segmented approach that integrates a pre-trained text-encoder (Medical BERT) for linguistic feature extraction, a text-guided low-resolution 3D diffusion model for initial volume synthesis, and a super-resolution 3D diffusion model for enhancing detail and anatomical accuracy. The methodology demonstrates the generation of anatomy-aware, high-fidelity 3D CT images, leveraging mask annotations to stabilize the generation process.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The hierarchical diffusion model efficiently synthesizes low-resolution images into detailed high-resolution outputs, ensuring computational efficiency and data integrity.  
2. Incorporating Medical BERT enhances the model's understanding of complex medical terminology, enriching the synthesis process.  
3. The use of segmentation masks for core anatomical structures significantly improves the anatomical plausibility and detail of the generated images.  
4. The paper is well-written and clearly explains the method, making it accessible to readers.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The model's performance is contingent on the quality and detail of input radiology reports; inaccuracies may compromise image generation.  
2. The advanced capabilities of the model demand considerable computational resources, potentially limiting accessibility for some research and clinical settings.  
3. The metric scores on the custom dataset appear low, and reference values for context would be beneficial.  
4. More motivation behind design decisions is needed, particularly regarding the necessity of latent diffusion and comparisons with existing methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Figure 1 by providing explanations for each component. Additionally, elaborating on the steps taken to simplify the implementation of the hierarchical model for users without deep technical backgrounds would enhance accessibility. Addressing how the model handles variations in the quality of textual descriptions in radiology reports is crucial, including mechanisms for ensuring reliable image synthesis with ambiguous data. We also suggest extending the results to include higher-quality volume generation to illustrate trade-offs more effectively. Finally, evaluating the model on more standard public datasets would facilitate systematic comparisons and strengthen the paper's contributions.
