### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach called Learning before Interaction (LBI) that integrates a language-guided simulator into the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) process to enhance decision-making solutions. The LBI framework utilizes a world model comprising a dynamics model and a reward model to simulate interactions and improve policy learning. The authors introduce the VisionSMAC dataset, which pairs states with images and task descriptions for the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC), and demonstrate LBI's effectiveness through superior performance on training and unseen tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The VisionSMAC dataset is a significant contribution, providing a large-scale, diverse, and realistic dataset for multi-agent decision-making in the SMAC environment.  
- LBI achieves impressive performance gains in SMAC, outperforming existing offline and imitation learning methods on unseen tasks, demonstrating good zero-shot generalization ability.  
- The approach produces explainable reward functions at critical states, aiding in understanding the decision-making process.  

Weaknesses:  
- The motivation for comparing the answer of GPT-4 appears misleading, as the proposed LBI method seems heavily reliant on the gaming environment, limiting its applicability beyond the SMAC benchmark.  
- The paper lacks evaluations in other multi-agent domains, making it difficult to assess the generalizability of the method.  
- The write-up is challenging to follow, with significant details relegated to the Appendix, and the main figure is not discussed in the text.  
- The framework appears to simplify multi-agent scenarios into single-agent problems, lacking thorough analysis and evidence to support this design choice.  
- The reliance on handcrafted processing for agent death masks narrows the applicability of the work to the SMAC domain, weakening its contribution.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the write-up by integrating important details from the Appendix into the main text and discussing the main figure explicitly. Additionally, we suggest conducting evaluations on one or two more multi-agent domains to strengthen the generality of the proposed method. The authors should also clarify the methods used for training data collection and provide explanations for the dynamics model's input notation. To enhance the model's applicability, consider replacing the handcrafted processing for agent death masks with a learned binary gate function. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide a more thorough analysis of the differences between their approach and existing literature on multi-agent world models.
