Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a PAC-Bayes approach for controlling multiple error types simultaneously within a framework that derives a high probability bound on the KL divergence between empirical and distribution risk vectors. The authors propose a differentiable training objective based on this bound, extending previous work in the binary case. The notion of user-defined "error types" allows for a generalization of traditional confusion matrices, facilitating the simultaneous control of error probabilities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The main result is a creative extension of the PAC-Bayesian framework, with practical implications for controlling multiple error types.
- The problem setting is well-motivated, and the paper is generally well-written, improving readability through contextual explanations.

Weaknesses:
- The framework would benefit from a specific example or experiment demonstrating its usefulness compared to existing methods.
- The proof of theorem 2 is lengthy; it should either be outlined or broken into lemmas for clarity.
- Limited empirical evaluation raises concerns about the practical applicability of the proposed bounds.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for their framework by including a concrete example or experiment that illustrates its advantages over existing approaches. Additionally, consider providing a clearer outline or breaking the proof of theorem 2 into more digestible parts. To enhance empirical support, we suggest conducting further experiments, particularly on the simultaneous minimization of Type I and Type II errors in more realistic scenarios. Finally, addressing the choice of $\ell$ in practice and discussing how it impacts performance would strengthen the paper.
