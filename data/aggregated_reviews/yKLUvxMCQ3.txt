### Key Points
This paper presents a position on the evaluation of large language models (LLMs), emphasizing the need to rethink tasks and model evaluation by placing trustworthiness at the center. The authors outline four desiderata for trustworthy models based on David Hays' definition: knowledge of inputs, behavior, evaluation protocols, and data origins. They discuss potential avenues for enhancing the trustworthiness of NLP systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a solid framework for understanding the implications of instruction-tuned NLP systems and the necessity for new evaluation paradigms.
- It synthesizes contemporary work across various NLP and ML subfields, offering valuable insights and a comprehensive survey of existing literature.
- The introduction effectively motivates the importance of trustworthy NLP in the context of LLMs.

Weaknesses:
- Recommendations for improving trustworthiness are not sufficiently concrete or detailed, lacking specific examples or frameworks for implementation.
- There is insufficient discussion regarding the incentive structures in the current NLP research landscape, particularly how industry profit motives may conflict with transparency.
- Some sections, such as the explanations of trust desiderata and the conclusions drawn from existing work, require clearer presentation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the specificity of their recommendations by providing concrete examples and frameworks for implementing their suggestions, such as how to craft diagnostic samples for LLMs. Additionally, we suggest that the authors acknowledge the incentive structures within the NLP research landscape and discuss potential ways to address these challenges. Clarifying the explanations accompanying each trust desideratum and enhancing the presentation of conclusions in Section 3 would also strengthen the paper.
