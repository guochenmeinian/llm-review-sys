### Key Points
This paper presents the "FindingEmo" dataset, which comprises 25,000 images annotated with Valence, Arousal, and Emotion labels, collected via the Prolific platform. Unlike existing datasets that focus on individual facial expressions, "FindingEmo" emphasizes the emotional content of entire scenes, enhancing understanding in Emotion Recognition and Social Cognition. The authors propose a novel benchmark for evaluating models' capabilities in analyzing emotional content in complex social scenes, employing rigorous annotation strategies and assessing various models to demonstrate the dataset's utility. The revised manuscript addresses ethical considerations regarding web-scraped images by including an opt-out option and enhances the introduction with details on the interdisciplinary nature of the dataset's development. Additional content includes scatterplots and barplots in the Appendix to illustrate associations between Arousal and Valence, as well as the distribution of annotations for Emo8 emotions. The authors clarify their methodology regarding neurotypicality screening and introduce a new section on cross-cultural analysis of annotation consistency across different backgrounds.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The dataset is large-scale and well-annotated, providing a comprehensive resource for emotion recognition in complex social contexts.
2. It advances the understanding of higher-order social cognition by focusing on whole scenes rather than individual expressions.
3. The paper is well-structured, clearly detailing the dataset creation and annotation processes.
4. The interdisciplinary approach integrates psychological concepts, enhancing the dataset's relevance to both AI and social science.
5. The manuscript includes a comprehensive impact statement addressing ethical concerns and an opt-out option for web-scraped images.
6. Visual aids such as scatterplots and barplots enhance data presentation.
7. The addition of cross-cultural analysis provides valuable insights into annotation consistency.

Weaknesses:
1. The reliance on web-scraped images may introduce biases inherent in online content.
2. The dataset's single annotation per image raises concerns about reliability and variability.
3. The absence of actual images due to copyright issues limits accessibility.
4. The paper lacks a cross-cultural perspective, which may affect the generalizability of the findings, although some analysis has been introduced.
5. Some annotations may be subjective, leading to potential inconsistencies in emotional labeling.
6. The authors did not create a single scatterplot for different emotions due to clarity issues, which may limit the visual representation of data.
7. The limited number of data points in the cross-cultural analysis may undermine the strength of the conclusions drawn.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset's robustness by addressing potential biases in web-scraped images and providing a more detailed discussion on demographic representation. To enhance annotation reliability, consider implementing multiple annotations per image and conducting a thorough analysis of inter-annotator agreement. We also suggest including a more comprehensive cross-cultural analysis of the annotations to assess generalizability. Additionally, we recommend attempting to create a clearer single scatterplot for different emotions to enhance visual representation. Finally, we suggest that the authors acknowledge the limitations of their data more explicitly in the conclusion to provide a balanced view of their findings. Exploring advanced models and techniques for emotion recognition, such as investigating loss functions that account for data imbalance and noise, could further enhance the dataset's utility.
