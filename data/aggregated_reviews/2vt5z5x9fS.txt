### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative UniMat representation for crystal structures, mapping atom locations to their positions in the periodic table and employing diffusion models with interleaved attention and convolution layers. The authors propose this approach as a promising alternative to traditional graph-based models, effectively addressing scalability issues in complex chemical systems. The rigorous evaluation methods, including proxy metrics and Density Function Theory (DFT) relaxations, assure the physical validity of the generated materials. The work learns to generate crystal materials through a diffusion process, with experiments conducted for both conditional and unconditional generation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The UniMat representation is intriguing and offers a novel approach to modeling crystal structures.  
- The use of diffusion models combined with rigorous evaluation methods enhances the credibility of the results.  
- The clarity of presentation and convincing experimental results contribute positively to the work.  

Weaknesses:  
- The chemical grounding of the UniMat representation lacks sufficient expert validation, raising concerns about its robustness.  
- There is ambiguity regarding the application of diffusion to unit cell parameters, which is not addressed in the manuscript.  
- The representation may be overly sparse, and the necessity of data augmentation through random shuffling and rotations is questionable.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the manuscript by addressing the application of diffusion to the unit cell parameters $[[a,b,c],[\alpha,\beta,\gamma]]$ and clarifying the corresponding prior distribution. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion on the motivations behind the UniMat representation to strengthen the chemical grounding of the work. Finally, obtaining approval from a referee with a materials science background would enhance the credibility of the chemical aspects of the study.
