### Key Points
This paper presents an algorithm for filtering, clustering, and labeling polynomial continued fractions (PCF) based on features related to the asymptotic behavior of their rational approximations. The authors apply this algorithm to a dataset of 1.7 million PCF, revealing intriguing structures and novel formulas linked to significant mathematical constants. The methodology introduces metrics derived from convergence dynamics, enabling automated clustering and the identification of both known and previously unknown formulas.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The work introduces a novel methodology for automated investigation of mathematical formulas, particularly PCF, using convergence dynamics as clustering metrics.  
- The rigorous testing on a large dataset leads to significant discoveries, demonstrating the robustness and potential impact on number theory.  
- The paper is well-written, clearly outlining the problem, methodology, and findings, supported by relevant figures.

Weaknesses:  
- The connection to AI or machine learning is not entirely clear; much of the analysis resembles descriptive statistical analysis rather than demonstrating a scalable machine learning approach.  
- The paper's writing could be improved for clarity and conciseness, particularly in the abstract and figure organization.  
- The dataset size and metrics used are limited, which may affect the robustness of the findings. Verification of newly identified formulas is also necessary.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and conciseness of the writing, particularly in the abstract and figure captions. Additionally, discussing how their approach can scale to larger datasets and more complex formulas would strengthen the paper. The authors should also consider expanding the dataset and incorporating a broader range of metrics to enhance the robustness of their findings. Finally, providing a detailed plan for verifying the correctness of newly discovered formulas for significant constants would enhance the credibility of their contributions.
