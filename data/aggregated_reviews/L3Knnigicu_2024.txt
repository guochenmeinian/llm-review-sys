Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Discrete-time Iterative Markovian Fitting (D-IMF) method, which introduces discretized reciprocal properties and Markovian processes, demonstrating that the optimal plan aligns with the static Schrödinger Bridge (SB) solution. The authors employ a time-dependent GAN, specifically Denoising Diffusion Generative Adversarial Models (DD-GAN), to enhance the generative model's performance. The proposed ASBM shows lower computational costs and favorable FID scores compared to DSBM.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with clear theoretical statements and significant contributions to probabilistic generative models.
- It broadens the understanding of IMF and Brownian bridges, and the theoretical convergence of D-IMF to the static SB solution is non-trivial and significant.
- The integration of these concepts into an adversarial framework is innovative, and the discrete-time construction is elegantly derived from DSBM.

Weaknesses:
- The performance gains appear primarily due to the GAN architecture, raising questions about the novelty of the work compared to diffusion models.
- The algorithm's effectiveness is questionable, requiring multiple discriminator and generator networks, leading to high computational costs and potential stability issues.
- The empirical studies are limited, primarily focusing on Male-Female data, and lack comprehensive ablation studies on critical hyperparameters and bidirectional learning metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical validation by conducting additional experiments beyond the Male-Female dataset and including ablation studies on hyperparameters such as the initial distribution setup and the number of function evaluations. It would be beneficial to compare the computational burden of their method with DSBM in terms of training time and resource usage. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the motivation for using a sampling-based approach over existing sampling-free methods like SF^2M and LightSB. Finally, we encourage the authors to address the diversity of generated samples and consider including a discussion on this aspect in the paper.
