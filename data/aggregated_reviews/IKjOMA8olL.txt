Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on Label Distance Bias in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), focusing on the performance disparity across various GNN models on three datasets. The authors investigate three metrics related to Label Distance Bias, revealing that Label Position Bias significantly affects GNN performance. They introduce the Label Proximity Score (LPS), which consistently correlates with performance disparity, and propose a framework for learning an unbiased graph structure to mitigate this bias. The findings emphasize the necessity of addressing Label Distance Bias to enhance GNN effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper identifies Label Position Bias as a prevalent issue across GNN models, underscoring its importance in GNN performance.  
- The Label Proximity Score is introduced as a reliable metric that outperforms Degree and Shortest Path Distance metrics in measuring Label Position Bias.  
- The study shows that Label Position Bias is more pronounced at lower labeling rates, providing insights into how labeling rates influence bias and suggesting potential mitigation strategies.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks empirical explanations for the underlying causes of Label Position Bias and does not conduct statistical significance tests to validate its findings.  
- There is insufficient evaluation of diverse GNN models to support the observed phenomena, and the limitations of selected baseline models are not addressed.  
- The proposed method's performance in larger, more complex datasets and its computational efficiency compared to existing methods remain unclear.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by providing a theoretical explanation for the emergence of Label Position Bias across GNN models. Additionally, conducting statistical significance tests to verify the observed bias would strengthen the findings. The authors should evaluate a broader range of GNN models to enhance the robustness of their conclusions. Furthermore, clarifying the method's performance in larger datasets and its computational efficiency compared to existing methods would be beneficial. Lastly, addressing the relationship between Label Position Bias and other forms of bias, such as those in heterophily graphs, would provide deeper insights into the problem.
