Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for domain-adaptive imitation learning using visual observations, proposing the D3IL architecture that incorporates dual feature extraction and dual cycle consistency. The authors aim to address the challenge of learning policies in a target domain based on demonstrations from a source domain, particularly in high-dimensional visual settings. The effectiveness of D3IL is demonstrated through various experiments, showing superior performance compared to baseline methods like TPIL and Disentan GAIL.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper tackles a significant and practical problem in imitation learning, where expert demonstrations are often unavailable in the target environment.  
- The problem statement, setup, and methodology are clearly articulated, with a thorough evaluation across multiple tasks.  
- The experiments are well-structured, covering various domain changes and including ablation studies that enhance understanding of the method's performance.  

Weaknesses:  
- The proposed framework is overly complex, particularly in Figure 3, and lacks clarity regarding its contributions compared to existing literature.  
- The experimental evaluation is limited to simple tasks, raising concerns about the method's scalability to more complex environments.  
- The paper does not adequately discuss its limitations or the assumptions regarding the relationship between source and target domains.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions and simplify the framework presented in Figure 3. Additionally, the authors should expand the experimental section to include more challenging tasks, such as humanoid running, to better demonstrate the method's capabilities. It would also be beneficial to discuss the assumptions regarding the source and target domains in more detail, particularly in relation to the performance gap observed with GWIL. Furthermore, we suggest defining what constitutes good or bad actions formally and addressing the limitations more explicitly within the main body of the paper rather than relegating them to the appendix.
