### Key Points
This paper studies the implications of private order flows in Ethereum's Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS) mechanism, revealing how these flows drive centralization in the block-building market. The authors propose that private order flows, which account for only 12% of transactions, contribute to 54.59% of block rewards, creating an "information difference" among builders. This difference leads to varying valuations of blocks, influencing the MEV-Boost auction dynamics. Builders with access to private transactions exhibit higher block valuations and bid more aggressively, resulting in a quasi-monopoly where dominant builders win most auctions. The study utilizes MEV-Boost data to demonstrate how this concentration reduces proposer revenue, delays low-fee transactions, and increases censorship risks, undermining Ethereum's decentralization. The paper also highlights the negative implications of reduced revenue for proposers and increased discrimination in block construction, particularly affecting transactions with lower priority fees.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- **Timely and Relevant Topic**: The analysis of private order flows in Ethereum's block-building market is pertinent to ongoing discussions in blockchain economics.
- **Robust Empirical Analysis**: The empirical section effectively validates the theoretical framework, demonstrating the behavior of builders and market dynamics under PBS.
- **Novel Contributions**: The introduction of information differences and auction strategy differences offers a fresh perspective on market centralization within the PBS framework.
- The paper addresses a relevant topic in the Ethereum ecosystem, providing insights into the block-building market dynamics and contributing to the understanding of market behavior.

Weaknesses:
- **Ambiguities and Inconsistencies**: Terms like "weak builder" and notations such as $a$ and $b$ lack clarity, complicating interpretation of results.
- **Structural Issues**: The paper's organization could be improved to better link theoretical assumptions with empirical observations, particularly in Section 3.2.
- **Unclear Figures**: Figures, especially Figures 2 and 3, are ambiguous, lacking clear axes and labels, which hinders data interpretation.
- The paper lacks novelty, as similar points have been made in prior works, particularly by Gupta, Pai, and Resnick, and Oz et al., which offer more recent and comprehensive data.
- The interpretation of Assumption 1 regarding private order flow arrangements is unclear.
- The robust fairness criterion is not well-defined, particularly concerning the block builder's "initial investment" and the profit-sharing mechanisms involved in order-flow arrangements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. **Empirical Validation**: We recommend that the authors include data comparing the profitability of blocks constructed from private versus public order flows to substantiate claims regarding builder revenue.
2. **Clarify Notation and Assumptions**: We suggest rethinking the notation for private order flows, specifically using time-varying variables like $a_t$ and $b_t$ to accurately reflect the model's dynamics. Additionally, clarifying Assumption 1 regarding the nature of private order flow arrangements would enhance understanding.
3. **Enhance Clarity and Readability**: We advise addressing inconsistencies in terminology and improving the paper's structure to ensure a logical flow, particularly in linking the rsync-builder discussion to earlier assumptions.
4. **Improve Figures**: We recommend enhancing Figures 2 and 3 with detailed captions and clearer labels to improve interpretability.
5. **Refine Background Section**: We suggest breaking down the lengthy background section into smaller parts to enhance reader comprehension, especially for complex concepts like PBS mechanisms.
6. **Number Formulas**: We recommend numbering all formulas in Section 5.1 to improve clarity and academic rigor.
7. **Address Theoretical Clarity**: We advise clarifying the definition of terms and ensuring that the theoretical framework accurately reflects the dynamics described in the empirical analysis. Furthermore, providing a clearer explanation of the robust fairness criterion, specifically detailing what constitutes the block builder's "initial investment" and how profit-sharing mechanisms operate in the context of order-flow arrangements, would be beneficial.
