Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents EGODE, a framework for simulating rigid-body dynamics that integrates neural ODEs with a hierarchical representation of mesh nodes and object representations. It introduces an event module to handle instantaneous changes during collisions, aiming for improved accuracy in dynamic modeling. The method is evaluated on the Rigid-Fall and Physion datasets, demonstrating superior performance over various state-of-the-art baselines. The authors acknowledge the need for more concrete evidence to support their claims regarding the applicability of their approach across various dynamic processes and recognize the importance of efficiency metrics in neural simulations, planning to enhance their experiments to better assess model performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The combination of Graph ODEs with event modules is novel and addresses current limitations in handling instantaneous changes during collisions.
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it accessible to a broad audience.
- Thorough ablation studies justify design decisions, and the method consistently outperforms baselines across multiple benchmarks.
- The authors demonstrate a commitment to improving their work based on reviewer feedback and express a willingness to share their complete code and training details, promoting transparency and collaboration.
- The scalability of the approach to higher resolution meshes has been validated through additional experiments.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks theoretical insights or proofs of concept for the coupled graph ODE framework.
- It does not include traditional physics engines as baselines, limiting the comparative analysis of EGODE's performance.
- Some statements in the introduction may mislead readers regarding the computational expense of simulating rigid-body collisions, which are generally efficient with modern algorithms.
- The generalization of the event function module lacks sufficient evidence and examples.
- The incorporation of physics priors into the loss function yields only marginal improvements, raising questions about their effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical grounding of the coupled graph ODE framework by providing proofs of concept. Additionally, including traditional physics engines like Mujoco 3 or Isaac Sim as baselines would enhance the comparative analysis. We suggest increasing the number of experiments focused on the complexity metrics of rigid-body simulations, including the number of objects, joint constraints, and collision events. If the authors choose to retain the physics priors in the revised paper, we encourage them to include a discussion on the reasons for the minimal improvements observed. Clarifying the computational efficiency of EGODE in relation to existing methods and rephrasing any biased claims in the introduction would also strengthen the paper. Finally, elaborating on how EGODE could be extended to handle scenarios involving rigid body hinges and deformable objects would provide valuable insights for future work.
