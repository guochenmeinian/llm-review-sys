Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel backdoor attack method, (soft)FLIP, which relies solely on modifying the labels of training samples while allowing for arbitrary trigger choices. The method employs a trajectory-matching algorithm to optimize poisoned labels by simulating the impact of normal backdoor poison samples on model parameters during training. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of (soft)FLIP on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 using two ResNet architectures and various trigger types.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The concept of backdoor poisoning through label modification is innovative and intriguing, with promising attack results.
2. The motivation for label-only poisoning is well-supported by real-world scenarios, such as crowdsourced image annotation and knowledge distillation, and the paper is well-structured.
3. The time required to execute FLIP is under 1 GPU hour, enhancing the practicality of the proposed attack.

Weaknesses:
1. The investigation is limited to ResNet architectures (r18 & r32), raising concerns about the generalizability of the attack to other contemporary models like VGG or Vision Transformers.
2. There is a lack of exploration from the defender's perspective, particularly regarding existing poison-cleanser defenses, which should be addressed in the main body of the paper.
3. Certain logical inconsistencies and unclear phrases in the text need refinement for clarity.
4. Some claims, such as the assertion that corrupted labels do not degrade clean accuracy, require moderation, as FLIP does lead to some clean test accuracy drops.
5. Specific details, such as identifiers in Table 4, need to be added for clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the diversity of model architectures investigated to include VGG and Vision Transformers, which would strengthen the generalizability of their findings. Additionally, we suggest including a brief study on the resistance of the poisoning attack to existing defenses and providing insights into potential countermeasures. The authors should refine the logic in paragraph 2 and clarify the claim regarding clean accuracy degradation. Furthermore, correcting the caption for Figure 5(a) and adding necessary identifiers in Table 4 would enhance the paper's clarity and presentation.
