Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method utilizing sequence-to-sequence transformers to identify Lyapunov functions for dynamical systems, particularly polynomial systems. The authors claim that their approach outperforms existing algorithmic solvers and human mathematicians in generating Lyapunov functions, achieving notable success rates for both polynomial and non-polynomial systems. However, the reviewers express skepticism regarding the necessity of large models like transformers for this task and question the fairness of the comparisons made.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper explores the capacity of transformers to solve mathematical problems, specifically in finding Lyapunov functions for nonlinear dynamical systems.
- The dataset generation process is thoroughly described, demonstrating careful consideration of design choices.
- The results indicate impressive performance, particularly in out-of-domain generalization tests.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the data generation methods is not clearly articulated, leading to confusion about their distinction from existing approaches.
- There is a lack of clarity regarding the stability concepts and the correctness of the learned Lyapunov functions, raising concerns about the academic rigor of the definitions used.
- The comparisons with existing tools, such as SOSTOOLS and FOSSIL, are perceived as unfair, with doubts about the claimed performance advantages.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definitions and concepts related to Lyapunov stability, ensuring precise terminology is used throughout the paper. Additionally, we suggest elaborating on the backward generation method to provide a clearer rationale and intuition for readers. It would be beneficial to address the limitations of the proposed method in verifying the correctness of the Lyapunov functions and to clarify the significance of finding global Lyapunov functions in practical applications. Lastly, we encourage the authors to ensure that comparisons with existing tools are fair and adequately represent their capabilities.
