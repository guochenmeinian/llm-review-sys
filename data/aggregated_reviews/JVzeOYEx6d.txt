Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a human preference model for text-to-image generation, introducing ImageReward, a dataset of human preferences rated across text alignment, image fidelity, and harmlessness. The authors develop a human preference annotation pipeline and propose Reward Feedback Learning (ReFL) to optimize diffusion models. Experimental results indicate that ImageReward outperforms existing metrics like CLIP scores, and the fine-tuned model is preferred by human annotators.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The human preference dataset is a significant contribution, featuring high-quality annotations from a professional data annotation company.
- The paper is well-presented, with clear writing and extensive analysis of the dataset and scoring model.
- The proposed methods show improved performance in both automatic and human evaluations, indicating the robustness of ImageReward.

Weaknesses:
- The paper exceeds the page limit and lacks detail in the description of ImageReward training, which may hinder reproducibility.
- The experimental design considers only six generative models, which may limit the robustness of the correlation results with human preferences.
- Certain aspects, such as the intention of Figure 7 and the agreement measure used in Table 2, remain unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the manuscript by adhering to the page limit and providing more detailed descriptions of the ImageReward training process. Additionally, including a comparative analysis with more recent models like MiniGPT-4 or LLaVa could strengthen the findings. We suggest expanding the evaluation setup and clarifying metrics, particularly regarding the "filter" evaluation metric in Table 3 and the reporting in Table 4. Finally, addressing the unclear points mentioned in the weaknesses section would enhance the paper's clarity and impact.
