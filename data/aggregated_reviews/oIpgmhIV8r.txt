### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to unify positional and structural embeddings in web mining tasks, particularly through the manipulation of a positional embedding based on the RWR proximity matrix. The authors propose three models tailored for non-attribute, homophilic, and heterophilic graphs, demonstrating competitive performance against selected baselines. The motivation and clarity of the problem are well-articulated, and the paper is generally accessible to a broad audience.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of positional and structural embeddings is a significant contribution to web mining.
- The technical solution is intuitively simple yet insightful, particularly the sorting of proximity distributions.
- Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PACER across various node learning tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The details regarding model optimization, particularly for PRCER-H, are unclear.
- Important baseline comparisons are missing, and consistency across tasks is lacking.
- The empirical evaluation is limited due to small dataset sizes and insufficient comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the differences between PACER and [41], particularly regarding 'multi-node set' versus single-node structural embeddings. Additionally, consider including an ensemble approach that combines structural and positional embeddings to evaluate its performance. Clarifying how PACER-A generates structural embeddings from node features and proximity distributions is essential, especially in homophilous graphs. We also suggest conducting additional ablation studies, particularly comparing $R^T$ and $D^{-1}A$, and analyzing the impact of restart probability on embedding locality. Finally, it would be beneficial to expand the empirical evaluation by including larger datasets and comparing against more state-of-the-art methods, as well as simple heuristics for link prediction.
