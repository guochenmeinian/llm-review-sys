Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for object detection in low-light conditions, leveraging illumination-invariant features through a novel Illumination-Invariant Module. The authors claim that their method enhances detection accuracy and can be integrated into existing object detection frameworks. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements in low-light object detection tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The writing is well-organized and includes helpful illustrations.
2. The proposed method shows better performance compared to existing techniques.
3. The Illumination-Invariant Module is designed to be a plug-and-play solution, enhancing its utility.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks comparisons with a broader range of related methods, particularly in Tables 1 and 2.
2. The assumption of uniform illumination between neighboring pixels is questionable, especially under uneven lighting conditions.
3. The paper does not address noise reduction in low-light images, which is a critical aspect.
4. There is insufficient discussion on the limitations of illumination-invariant features, particularly regarding color ambiguities.
5. The evaluation focuses solely on object detection without assessing low-light enhancement datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with additional related methods, particularly those addressing low-light conditions, to strengthen their claims. It is essential to discuss the implications of the uniform illumination assumption and consider noise reduction strategies in their approach. We also suggest providing visual examples to clarify the relationship between human visual perception and machine performance. Furthermore, the authors should evaluate their method on low-light enhancement benchmarks and demonstrate the generalization ability of their illumination-invariant features across various tasks beyond detection. Lastly, including runtime and memory usage metrics would enhance the understanding of the method's efficiency.
