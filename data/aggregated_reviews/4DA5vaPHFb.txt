Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Expectile-Regularized Neural Optimal Transport (ENOT), a novel method for training Neural Optimal Transport (NOT) models that incorporates expectile regularization on dual Kantorovich potentials. The authors demonstrate that ENOT achieves competitive results on the Wasserstein-2 benchmark and in Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation tasks, improving both accuracy and runtime.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is easy to implement, requiring only an additional regularizer.
- ENOT provides a new way to stabilize the learning of dual potentials and shows strong empirical performance compared to existing NOT formulations.
- The paper is well-organized, clearly written, and includes comprehensive experimental results.

Weaknesses:
- The derivation of the ENOT regularizer requires further clarification, particularly regarding its theoretical motivation and the conditions under which it operates.
- The technical novelty is limited, as ENOT merges established ideas (c-conjugate transform and quantile regression loss) rather than introducing entirely new concepts.
- The empirical evaluations lack quantitative comparisons with the Monge gap and do not sufficiently address the impact of hyperparameters such as $\tau$ and $\lambda$.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the derivation of the ENOT regularizer and provide additional quantitative comparisons between ENOT and the Monge gap. Furthermore, we suggest including MSE results in the main manuscript for the Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation task, as they are crucial for understanding the method's performance. Additionally, consider addressing the potential trade-offs associated with varying the threshold parameter $\tau$ and provide a more compact methodological section to enhance readability. Lastly, ensure that all figures and references are correctly cited and that notation is consistent throughout the paper.
