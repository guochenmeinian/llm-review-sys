### Key Points
This paper presents a systematic examination of asymmetric valleys in deep neural networks (DNNs) minima, building on prior work. The authors investigate the influence of various factors, including noise direction and sign consistency, on valley asymmetry. The findings indicate that sign consistency between perturbations and convergence points is crucial for valley symmetry. Theoretical insights are provided, particularly regarding ReLU activation and softmax functions, and practical applications for model fusion and federated learning are discussed.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The work contributes novel insights into the understanding of loss landscapes in DNNs, particularly regarding minima asymmetry, which has not been systematically explored since its initial observation.  
- The paper is well-structured, with a clear narrative and strong empirical validation across multiple datasets and architectures.  
- The theoretical insights related to ReLU and softmax functions are compelling, and the proposed direction-aligned noise method is simple yet effective.  

Weaknesses:  
- The theoretical support for the claims is somewhat weak, lacking rigorous proofs and detailed analysis of the degree of asymmetry.  
- Some experimental settings, particularly in federated learning, appear hastily conducted and lack sufficient detail.  
- The conclusions drawn from certain figures may conflict with established findings, raising concerns about their credibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis by providing a formal examination of the degree of asymmetry and its influencing factors. Additionally, a more detailed discussion on the implications of valley asymmetry for local search-based optimization methods, such as SGD and SAM, would enhance the paper's contribution. Clarifying the experimental settings in Section 6.2 and addressing the inconsistencies in the conclusions drawn from figures would also strengthen the overall presentation. Lastly, polishing the text to eliminate typos and inaccuracies would improve readability.
