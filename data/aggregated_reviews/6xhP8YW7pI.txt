### Key Points
This paper presents LP-DIXIT, an algorithmic method for evaluating explanations of link predictions in knowledge graphs by quantifying how explanations enhance users' predictability through Forward Simulatability Variation (FSV). The authors propose leveraging large language models (LLMs) to simulate user responses, allowing for scalable and reproducible evaluations. The results indicate that LP-DIXIT performs reasonably well compared to existing benchmarks. However, the methodology lacks novelty, as the integration of LLMs with post-hoc explanation techniques has been previously explored.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper formally describes the link prediction problem in knowledge graphs and emphasizes the importance of explainability.
- It facilitates reproducibility by providing open-source code and datasets.
- The approach innovatively uses LLMs to simulate human comprehension in evaluating explanations.

Weaknesses:
- The methodology lacks novelty, with previously explored combinations of LLM prompting and explanation techniques.
- The paper suffers from numerous typos and formatting issues, which detract from its professionalism.
- Limited experimental details prevent a comprehensive understanding of LP-DIXIT's performance across various graph structures and complex scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and depth of the experimental analysis, particularly in edge cases and complex scenarios. A more multifaceted approach to measuring explanation quality, beyond predictability, should be considered to enhance the evaluation. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a broader discussion on the adoption of the forward simulatability variation metric, including its comparison to existing evaluation metrics. Addressing the numerous typos and formatting issues will also enhance the paper's professionalism. Finally, clarifying the rationale behind the selection of high-scoring explanations and the instruction-tuning process for LLMs would strengthen the methodology.
