Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of random shuffled SGD through a primal-dual lens, aiming to enhance existing convergence bounds. The authors propose refined smoothness definitions that allow for larger step sizes in favorable scenarios, leading to faster convergence rates. The work includes results for generalized linear models and non-smooth extensions, utilizing a supremum over permutation-dependent partial averaging of smoothness constants. The convergence rate can be improved by a factor of \(O(\sqrt{n})\) in specific settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with clearly stated contributions.
- It effectively utilizes the finite-sum assumption and a primal-dual reformulation, improving upon existing bounds for shuffled SGD.

Weaknesses:
- The improvement in convergence primarily hinges on the constants \(\tilde{L}\) and \(\hat{L}\), which may not significantly alter results for small step sizes.
- The analysis lacks clarity regarding the conditions under which the \(\sqrt{n}\) improvement applies, particularly outside linear predictors.
- The definitions of \(\tilde{L}\) and \(\hat{L}\) appear inconsistent between the general convex case and linear predictors, raising questions about their implications for convergence rates.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the conditions under which the \(\sqrt{n}\) improvement is applicable, particularly in the context of linear predictors. Additionally, we suggest including a more detailed discussion of the primal-dual relationship's historical context and its relevance to the current work. The authors should also ensure that the definitions of \(\tilde{L}\) and \(\hat{L}\) are consistent and clearly articulated across different settings. Finally, addressing the minor typographical errors and ensuring the proofs are accessible to readers would enhance the overall presentation.
