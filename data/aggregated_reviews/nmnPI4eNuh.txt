### Key Points
This paper presents a thorough analysis of biases in the Social-IQ dataset and introduces a new dataset, DeSIQ, aimed at mitigating these biases. The authors demonstrate that biases in the Social-IQ dataset allow even moderately strong language models to achieve perfect performance without context. They employ various configurations in question-answer settings and test different model architectures, revealing significant accuracy degradations when hypotheses are replaced with other correct answers. The DeSIQ dataset is constructed with diverse contexts to create a more challenging benchmark for evaluating social intelligence in AI.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper provides a comprehensive methodology for identifying biases in multiple-choice question datasets.  
- It introduces the DeSIQ dataset, which offers a more challenging benchmark for social intelligence evaluation.  
- Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed debiasing approach and new model architecture.  
- The work is well-structured and clearly written, with sound experimental design.

Weaknesses:  
- DeSIQ's data relies entirely on the existing Social-IQ dataset, raising concerns about data quality.  
- All experiments were conducted only once, which diminishes the robustness of the results.  
- The perturbation method used for debiasing represents a limited application of existing techniques, and the generalizability of DeSIQ is questioned.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the diversity of the data construction method by exploring additional debiasing techniques beyond the current perturbation approach. Additionally, we suggest conducting multiple runs of experiments to enhance the reliability of the results. It would also be beneficial for the authors to clarify whether the questions in the DeSIQ benchmark are necessary for models to achieve high scores, considering the transformation into a matching problem. Lastly, we encourage the authors to include experiments with the input of “a+t/v” to further validate their findings.
