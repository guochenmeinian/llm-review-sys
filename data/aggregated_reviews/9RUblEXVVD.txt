Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents OTOv3, an automated system designed for Neural Architecture Search (NAS) that trains general super-networks and constructs high-performing subnetworks without pretraining or fine-tuning. The authors claim that OTOv3 can automatically generate search spaces and utilize a Hierarchical Half-Space Projected Gradient (H2SPG) to ensure network validity during optimization. Experimental evaluations indicate that OTOv3 achieves competitive or superior performance across various benchmark datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- OTOv3 is backed by substantial theoretical considerations and empirical validation, demonstrating its potential impact in NAS.
- The method is well-structured and clearly articulated, making its benefits understandable.
- The approach avoids the need for manual intervention in building the search space and can automatically identify optimal subnetworks.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of OTOv3 compared to OTOv2 is questionable, as many components appear to be incremental improvements rather than groundbreaking innovations.
- Some experimental comparisons are unfair, particularly regarding search costs and outdated baselines.
- The methods section is poorly organized, leading to confusion about the operational mechanics of the proposed method.
- The writing quality requires improvement, with instances of unclear phrasing and incomplete sentences.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methods section by providing more coherent explanations and ensuring that all concepts are adequately defined upon their first mention. Additionally, we suggest that the authors address the perceived lack of novelty by clearly delineating the differences between OTOv3 and OTOv2, particularly in terms of their respective contributions to NAS. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include a more comprehensive comparison of inference times and to ensure that all experimental results are presented fairly, using up-to-date baselines and consistent hardware conditions. Lastly, we advise enhancing the overall writing quality to eliminate ambiguities and improve readability.
