### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to addressing structural ambiguity in Indonesian transcribed speech by leveraging prosodic information and creating a dataset of 4,800 utterances. The authors propose three methods: a baseline ASR with a trained text disambiguation model, a modified ASR that tags interpretations, and an end-to-end model. The findings indicate significant improvements over the baseline, with prosodic features being crucial for disambiguation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a thorough exploration of a new area in Indonesian NLP, including corpus creation, human assessment, and experimental comparisons.
- It introduces a novel approach and task in an under-served language, preserving speech intent in written form.
- The inclusion of a human assessment study offers valuable context for understanding disambiguation.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset is relatively small and consists of read speech, which may not reflect natural prosody.
- The simplification of the disambiguation task, with only a few tags, raises concerns about the complexity of the problem addressed.
- The lack of an ethics section and insufficient details regarding participant consent and compensation are notable ethical concerns.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the naturalness of the dataset by considering spontaneous speech data. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed discussion of the hyperparameters used in their models, including whether default settings were employed. It would be beneficial to release the corpus created for this task to enhance reproducibility. Furthermore, we suggest addressing the ethical concerns by including a dedicated ethics section that clarifies participant consent and compensation. Lastly, consider standardizing the reporting of metrics in tables and providing additional training details in the appendix to aid reproducibility.
