### Key Points
This paper presents SmoothGNN, a novel method for unsupervised node anomaly detection in graphs utilizing smoothing patterns and spectral graph theory. The authors propose Individual Smoothing Patterns (ISP) and Neighborhood Smoothing Patterns (NSP) to identify anomalies, supported by theoretical insights and experimental validation across multiple datasets. SmoothGNN demonstrates superior accuracy and computational efficiency, achieving up to 75x faster speeds than existing methods, particularly on large-scale datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of ISP and NSP provides a fresh perspective on node anomaly detection, addressing the smoothing issue in graph learning.
- Extensive experiments across nine real-world datasets showcase consistent performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Weaknesses:
- The justification for NSP as a layer-wise coefficient in SmoothGNN is insufficiently explained, and its application only at the final layer representation remains unclear.
- The utility of Theorem 4 in selecting the number of layers lacks clarity, and a detailed analysis of time and space complexity is missing.
- Some experimental results in Tables 2 and 3 are incomplete, raising concerns about the comprehensiveness of the evaluation.
- The paper does not adequately address potential real-world challenges, such as memory limitations and overfitting risks, particularly in the context of GNNs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the mathematical concepts, particularly the formulations of ISP and NSP, to enhance accessibility for non-experts. Additionally, addressing the potential real-world challenges, including memory limitations and overfitting strategies, would strengthen the paper. A broader comparison with non-GNN-based anomaly detection techniques is also suggested for a more balanced evaluation. Finally, providing a detailed analysis of the computational complexity and the conditions under which the experimental results were generated would enhance the paper's rigor.
