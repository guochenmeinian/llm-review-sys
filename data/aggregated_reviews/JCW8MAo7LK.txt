### Key Points
This paper investigates the effects of employee departures on socialization patterns within organizations, utilizing communication data from a large holding company. The authors analyze changes in network metrics for coworkers connected to departing employees and explore the impact of organizational stress on these dynamics. The study reveals that employee exits lead to communication breakdowns, with remaining employees becoming more disconnected. The authors pose several research questions regarding the effects of departures on immediate coworkers, group dynamics, and the influence of individual characteristics and stress levels.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study is likely the first of its kind, providing valuable insights into organizational behavior through a comprehensive analysis of communication data.
- The large-scale dataset, covering 120,000 employees and 5 million weekly interactions, enhances the generalizability of the findings.
- The comparison of employee exit effects across different stress periods offers a nuanced understanding of internal communication dynamics.

Weaknesses:
- The focus on a single company limits the generalizability of the findings to other organizations with different cultures or structures.
- The study lacks a qualitative or mixed-methods approach, which could capture the nuanced human elements of socialization not fully represented in quantitative data.
- There is insufficient discussion regarding ethics approval and consent from employees, raising concerns about the study's reproducibility and ethical considerations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their analysis by examining additional datasets to see if similar patterns exist elsewhere. Providing a more comprehensive definition of "high-stress" and including more examples would enhance understanding. Additionally, clarifying how the implemented changes did not impact the control group's metrics is crucial. We encourage the authors to release the dataset (anonymized appropriately) to facilitate further research. Translating findings into actionable strategies for organizations, particularly regarding maintaining effective communication during high turnover, could be a valuable next step. Lastly, delving deeper into individual-level impacts of employee departures would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the effects on employees.
