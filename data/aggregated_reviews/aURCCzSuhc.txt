### Key Points
This paper presents a study on taxonomy expansion for Named Entity Recognition (NER), addressing the challenge of training models with two disjoint, partially labeled datasets. The authors propose a Partial Label Model (PLM) that utilizes soft labels and a latent variable formulation of the loss, allowing for semantic overlap between entity sets. Experiments conducted on six datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach matches or outperforms standard cross-annotation methods, particularly in low-resource scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles a relevant and real-world problem of combining disjoint datasets.
- It is well-written, clear, and easy to follow.
- The proposed PLM method shows strong performance in low-resource settings and when dealing with overlapping categories.
- Extensive experiments provide convincing results.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental setup is basic and does not align with ideal conditions, particularly regarding the treatment of subtype/supertype and overlapping relations.
- The limited selection of baseline methods may undermine the robustness of the findings.
- The assumption that relationships between new and old categories are known may not reflect practical scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental design by addressing the treatment of subtype/supertype and overlapping relations among entity types. Additionally, consider expanding the set of baseline methods to enhance the robustness of the comparisons. It would also be beneficial to explore scenarios where the underlying distribution of entity labels differs between datasets, as this is a common real-world challenge. Finally, clarify how the PLM method's advantages manifest in complex scenarios compared to simpler approaches like cross-annotation.
