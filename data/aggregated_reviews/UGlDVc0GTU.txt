Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework called LLM-based Skill Diffusion (LDuS), which enables zero-shot skill-based policy adaptation to various contexts specified in natural language. The authors propose a hierarchical skill learning structure that combines a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a diffusion model, utilizing loss-guided diffusion for generating adaptable skill trajectories. The effectiveness of LDuS is demonstrated through experiments on robotic manipulation tasks, achieving improved performance compared to several baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach is innovative and addresses an important problem, demonstrating novelty in integrating LLMs with skill diffusion.
- Extensive evaluation across various challenging tasks shows superior performance, reinforcing the framework's effectiveness.
- The paper is well-structured, with clear presentation and high-quality illustrations.

Weaknesses:
- The justification for combining the diffusion model with the VAE is insufficient, particularly regarding Equation (5), which lacks mathematical clarity and citation.
- The seeding procedure is unclear, suggesting a need for training and evaluating on multiple seeds to ensure robustness.
- The contribution of the paper appears limited, primarily combining existing components without substantial justification for their integration.
- The scope of context adaptation is narrow, focusing mainly on speed variations, which may not fully explore the framework's potential.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the combination of the diffusion model and VAE, particularly regarding Equation (5), and ensure proper citation of relevant works. Clarifying the seeding procedure and using more seeds in experiments would enhance the robustness of the findings. Additionally, expanding the scope of context adaptation beyond speed variations to include other types of context would provide deeper insights into the framework's scalability and applicability. Finally, including a comparison of inference times with other approaches would address current limitations and enhance the paper's contribution.
