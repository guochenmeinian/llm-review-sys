Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a self-evolving spiking neural network (SESNN) model to explore the origins and functional advantages of pinwheel structures in the primary visual cortex (V1) compared to salt-and-pepper configurations. The authors demonstrate that pinwheel centers exhibit increased sensitivity and faster responses to complex spatial textures, serving as primary processors for intricate contours, while adjacent iso-orientation domains enhance edge representations. The model's ability to reproduce orientation maps aligns with empirical data from various mammalian species. Additionally, the paper analyzes the response times of neurons to the complexity of visual scenes, integrating various data types to enhance biological fidelity. The study includes quantitative assessments of local pixel entropy and global geometrical entropy to identify noise from different shapes, as well as latency comparisons between neurons on boundaries and those in other areas.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The investigation of pinwheel structures is highly relevant, addressing a significant question in sensory processing differences between primates and rodents.
- The model employs bioplausible mechanisms, utilizing spiking neurons and Hebbian-like learning rules.
- The paper is well-written, and the analysis of spatial-temporal response patterns is both novel and engaging.
- The authors provide a detailed analysis of local pixel entropy and global geometrical entropy, effectively identifying noise from various shapes.
- The SESNN model offers a novel approach to simulating pinwheel structures, enhancing understanding of their functional roles in visual processing.
- Statistical significance is quantified for the differences in response times between pinwheel and salt-and-pepper structures, providing robust evidence for their findings.

Weaknesses:
- The analysis lacks sufficient support for the main claims, particularly regarding the functional implications of pinwheel structures.
- The justification for using different learning rules for excitatory-excitatory (E>E) versus excitatory-inhibitory (E>I) connections is computationally sound but lacks biological plausibility discussion.
- The experiments primarily utilize binary edge maps, which may not accurately reflect real-world visual processing.
- The visual representation of the downward trend in response times is not immediately clear, which may hinder comprehension of the results.
- The statistical significance of the downward trends is only partially addressed, particularly at certain time points.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis by incorporating additional metrics and comparisons with experimental data to substantiate their claims. Specifically, addressing the functional roles attributed to pinwheel centers in previous literature would strengthen the discussion. The authors should also clarify the omission of pinwheel density as a metric and provide a brief description of the baseline model in the main text. Furthermore, including real image experiments instead of binary edge maps would enhance the relevance of their findings. Additionally, we recommend improving the clarity of the downward trend in response times between pinwheel and salt-and-pepper structures by quantifying these trends in Figure 3c and demonstrating their statistical significance at all time points. Consider providing clearer visual representations of the data to enhance understanding. Lastly, conducting an ablation study to explore the mechanisms leading to the observed results would provide deeper insights into the model's predictions.
