Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a post-processing technique aimed at enhancing the utility of synthetic data generated under differential privacy (DP). The authors propose a method that involves reweighting synthetic data samples to align them with user-selected utility measures derived from real datasets. The technique employs a stochastic first-order algorithm to optimize resampling weights and is demonstrated through numerical experiments on various datasets. The results indicate improvements in utility metrics, such as correlation alignment and F1 scores.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed post-processing technique is novel and model-agnostic, making it versatile across different synthetic data generation methods.
- The methodology is well-structured, and the numerical experiments validate the approach effectively across multiple benchmark datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation relies on benchmark datasets that may be considered "easy," and additional testing on more challenging datasets is warranted.
- Important experimental details are missing, including comparisons of privacy budgets and the handling of categorical data.
- The paper does not sufficiently discuss the trade-offs involved in the proposed method, particularly regarding computational complexity and potential impacts on other data properties.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the computational complexity of the proposed post-processing technique and how it compares to existing synthetic data generation algorithms. Additionally, the authors should provide more examples or case studies to illustrate the practical applications of their technique beyond the correlation matrix. It would also be beneficial to clarify the distinctions between their method and similar approaches, such as the Private Entropy Projection mechanism, and address the potential limitations of their experimental setup regarding privacy budget comparisons. Finally, including raw utility and F1 scores in the results would enhance transparency and understanding of the improvements achieved.
