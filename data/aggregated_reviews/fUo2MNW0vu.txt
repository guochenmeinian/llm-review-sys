### Key Points
This paper presents MoRec, a tri-level framework for multi-objective recommendations, focusing on accuracy, revenue, fairness, and alignment. The authors propose a reweighting strategy for training samples and loss functions to achieve controllable multi-objective learning, employing a PID controller to enhance key objective performance. The method is validated on three public datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Multi-Objective Recommendation is a valuable research area.
- The proposed method is technically sound and applicable in industrial settings.
- The framework is data-centric and model-agnostic, facilitating commercial testing.

Weaknesses:
- The baselines and related works are inadequate, with outdated comparisons that undermine the framework's relevance.
- The originality of the objectives is questionable, as many seem directly derived from existing literature.
- There is insufficient analysis of the alignment objective and its effectiveness in addressing skew distribution.
- The paper lacks a comprehensive review of other methodologies and does not compare MoRec with significant works like FairBatch.
- Revenue estimation is overly simplistic, relying solely on item price, which limits the framework's applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by including more recent references and significant works in multi-objective optimization. Additionally, the authors should provide a detailed comparison between MoRec and FairBatch to clarify its advancements. To enhance flexibility, we suggest that the authors explore alternative representations for "revenue" that can be applied in various contexts, such as academic datasets. Furthermore, the authors should address the complexity of setting objective weights as hyper-parameters by proposing methods to assist users in efficiently finding optimal solutions from the Pareto front. Finally, we encourage the authors to expand the framework's objectives beyond the four fixed ones presented, considering additional criteria that may be relevant in commercial applications.
