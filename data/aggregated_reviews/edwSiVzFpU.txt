### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive survey of end-to-end task-oriented dialogue (EToD) systems, marking it as the first of its kind in the field. The authors propose a new taxonomy distinguishing between modular and fully end-to-end systems and provide a public website with resources, including leaderboards, to support the EToD community. The paper aims to enhance visibility and traction in EToD research by summarizing existing efforts and discussing emerging trends and challenges.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper offers a thorough overview of progress in task-oriented dialogue, with clear writing and accessible formatting that enhances readability. It includes a detailed literature review, a lucid taxonomy, and valuable resources for researchers.

Weaknesses:  
The paper lacks discussion on the integration of task-oriented dialogue with large pre-trained models, which is crucial in the current research landscape. Additionally, it omits recent developments such as QToD and Multi-Grained Knowledge Retrieval for End-to-End Task-Oriented Dialog. Furthermore, the evaluation protocols for EToD systems, including automatic metrics and recent LLM-based metrics like BERTScore, are not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the integration of task-oriented dialogue with large pre-trained models to reflect current trends. Additionally, the authors should include recent advancements in EToD, specifically QToD and Multi-Grained Knowledge Retrieval. We also suggest enhancing the section on evaluation protocols by incorporating a detailed analysis of automatic metrics, human evaluation, and LLM-based metrics.
