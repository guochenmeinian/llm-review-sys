Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates neuron interpretation methods in NLP, focusing on identifying which neurons relate to specific concepts. The authors propose a comparative framework based on the consistency of neuron rankings across various methods, concluding that Probeless (Antverg and Belinkov, 2021) demonstrates the highest consistency. The work addresses challenges such as the lack of standard metrics and benchmarks, introducing two voting-based metrics to evaluate compatibility among six interpretation methods. The findings suggest that neurons identified by multiple methods may be more informative.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant and emerging area of interpretability in NLP, potentially fostering further research.
- It presents a novel approach by employing voting theory to create a ranking metric for neuron interpretation methods.
- The paper is well-written, organized, and provides a thorough experimental analysis.

Weaknesses:
- The assumption that consensus among interpretability methods is desirable is questionable, as it may depend on the selection of methods.
- The chosen six methods lack novelty, and more recent advancements in neuron interpretation could have been considered.
- The validation of Probeless's superiority is not comprehensive, and the proposed metrics do not effectively address reproducibility challenges.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of the selected interpretation methods by incorporating more recent advancements in the field. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more comprehensive validation of Probeless's performance, including additional experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness. It would be beneficial to discuss the limitations of the assumption regarding consensus among methods in the limitations section. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the complexities of neuron behaviors, such as superposition, and clarify the distinction between mechanistic interpretability and neuron analysis in the context of their work.
