Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Chameleon, a framework that enhances large language models (LLMs) with a library of plug-and-play modules for compositional reasoning. The authors propose a method where an LLM, prompted with module descriptions and constraints, generates a sequence of modules to process a question. Chameleon, utilizing GPT-4, achieves performance improvements on benchmarks such as ScienceQA and TabMWP without fine-tuning, outperforming previous approaches. The authors have conducted multiple new experiments, demonstrating that Chameleon maintains performance gains over state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines across various datasets and base LLMs, including GPT-4 and Claude. They acknowledge the need for clearer terminology, such as replacing "NL-like programs" with "module sequence plans," and plan to provide detailed steps for the "plug-and-play" feature to enhance user understanding. The authors also recognize the importance of including MM-COT Large in their visual comparisons and will address the environmental implications of using LLM components.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-organized and easy to follow, supported by abundant figures and visualizations.
2. Chameleon introduces a novel approach to tool use entirely within a sequence of modules, enhancing LLM capabilities.
3. The modular design of Chameleon allows for flexibility and extensibility, enabling individual updates to components without affecting the overall system.
4. The system demonstrates notable performance improvements on multiple QA datasets, showcasing the effectiveness of the framework.
5. The authors have demonstrated a commitment to addressing reviewer feedback, enhancing clarity and transparency in their presentation.
6. New experimental results on additional datasets, such as NER and FinQA, indicate the framework's general applicability.
7. The error analysis provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of the tool planning and execution within Chameleon, highlighting its advantages over ChatGPT.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the method appears limited, with unclear distinctions between Chameleon and similar systems like HuggingGPT.
2. The performance improvements reported may not solely result from Chameleon, as they could stem from the inherent capabilities of GPT-4.
3. The main takeaway messages from the paper remain unclear and inadequately supported by experimental evidence, necessitating further analysis and validation.
4. The current code organization may not facilitate easy adaptation for broader tasks, limiting usability for domain experts.
5. The writing sometimes oversells the approach, particularly in the abstract and terminology used, such as "NL-like programs" and "plug-and-play."
6. The authors are currently unable to update the paper immediately, which may delay the dissemination of their findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the novelty of Chameleon by explicitly differentiating it from similar systems like HuggingGPT. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more accurate representation of performance improvements, avoiding misleading comparisons to prior work. To enhance the plug-and-play claim, the authors should detail the steps required to add new modules and clarify the selection criteria for the module inventory. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore more advanced planning algorithms to improve the system's performance and conduct a thorough error analysis to identify specific areas where Chameleon reduces errors compared to base models. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their main takeaways by conducting additional experiments, particularly focusing on demonstrating at least one message with robust experimental support. Specifically, an analysis of different factors influencing the performance of tool use within the sequence of modules is essential. Additionally, we suggest that the authors enhance the code base to provide APIs that allow users to define their tools and tasks easily, as well as develop comprehensive design guidelines for new tasks. This documentation should include step-by-step instructions and examples to assist users in adapting Chameleon for various applications. Lastly, we advise revising the writing to avoid overselling the approach and to ensure that terminology accurately reflects the system's capabilities, while also incorporating the new findings and refining the writing based on reviewer suggestions.
