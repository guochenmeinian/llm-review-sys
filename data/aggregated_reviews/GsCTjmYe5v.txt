Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a deep learning framework for medication recommendation that leverages patients' electronic health records and drug information to suggest safe and effective medication combinations based on symptoms and examination results. The authors propose a model that incorporates severity levels of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and evaluates its performance on two real-world datasets, MIMIC-IV and PRIVATE, demonstrating superior results compared to existing baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The topic is pioneering and addresses a significant need in intelligent healthcare by recommending safe drug combinations.
- The use of the DDInter database enhances the model's ability to consider varying severities of drug interactions, potentially improving prescription accuracy.
- The paper is well-structured, and the experiments are comprehensive, with informative figures.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation is poor, with equations that may confuse readers and low-quality figures that are not vector graphics.
- The paper lacks sufficient evaluation metrics, such as "Jaccard," and does not adequately compare with state-of-the-art baselines like MoleRec and 4SDrug, undermining the validity of the claims.
- The authors do not provide code for reproducibility, and there are significant gaps in the explanation of the methodology and dataset representation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by enhancing the quality of figures and ensuring that equations are clearly explained. Additionally, the authors should include necessary evaluation metrics, particularly "Jaccard," and provide comparisons with more advanced baselines to strengthen their claims. To address reproducibility concerns, we suggest that the authors share their code and provide detailed explanations of their methodology, including the initialization of embeddings and the representation of lab test responses. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the implications of their findings, particularly regarding the clinical impact of the small improvements in AUC and the implications of the wDDI metric.
