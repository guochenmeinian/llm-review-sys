Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) in non-stationary low-rank Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), proposing algorithms PORTAL and Ada-PORTAL. The authors aim to achieve low average dynamic suboptimality gaps by leveraging off-policy exploration, data transfer from previous transition kernels, and periodic policy updates. The theoretical analysis supports the effectiveness of these methods under certain assumptions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work is original, contributing significantly to the understanding of non-stationarity in low-rank MDPs.
- The analysis is thoughtful, and the exposition is generally clear, with a satisfactory quality of work.
- The proposed methods are sound and show promise in improving suboptimality gaps compared to previous approaches.

Weaknesses:
- The clarity of the algorithm exposition could be improved; specifically, equations should be reported rather than cited, and outputs of subroutines should be included.
- There are concerns regarding the soundness of the proofs, particularly the need for clearer justifications of certain inequalities and assumptions.
- The paper lacks an experimental section and does not adequately address the limitations of the proposed methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the exposition of the algorithms by reporting equations directly and including outputs of subroutines. Additionally, we suggest providing a clearer overview of the proof strategy and justifying the assumptions made, particularly regarding reachability. It would also be beneficial to include an experimental section to validate the proposed methods. Lastly, we encourage the authors to incorporate clarifications from the rebuttal into the main body of the paper for enhanced clarity and presentation.
