Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of discretisations of mean-field type stochastic differential equations (SDEs) relevant to machine learning. The authors propose a convergence result (Theorem 1) indicating that, under suitable conditions on drift and diffusion coefficients, the discretised dynamics converge in 2-Wasserstein distance to the continuous-time system of interacting particles. The paper applies this result to various contexts, including Two-Layer Neural Networks (NNs), Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD), Two-Player Zero-sum Continuous Games, and Kinetic Equations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well-written, clear, and structured effectively. It addresses a significant gap in the literature regarding the convergence of discrete-time to continuous-time systems, which is crucial in modern machine learning. The applications of Theorem 1 to diverse areas demonstrate its relevance and utility.

Weaknesses:  
The authors neglect a substantial body of literature on SDE discretisation schemes for McKean-Vlasov SDEs and interacting particle systems. The analysis lacks a rigorous comparison with existing results, particularly regarding convergence criteria. Additionally, the notation and terminology can be confusing, and the paper would benefit from more applied results to demonstrate practical relevance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the existing literature regarding SDE discretisation schemes, particularly focusing on the convergence of Euler-Maruyama and Milstein-type numerical schemes. A thorough comparison of convergence notions, specifically the Wasserstein asymptotic pseudotrajectory (WAPT) versus classical discretisation step convergence, should be included. 

Furthermore, we suggest clarifying the notation in the algorithmic template and providing a formal definition of the *limit set* in the main body. An *idea-of-proof* paragraph following Theorem 1 would enhance understanding, and the authors should address the practical implications of their theoretical results, such as their application in training GANs. Lastly, a brief mention of the relationship to multi-agent systems could broaden the paper's appeal.
