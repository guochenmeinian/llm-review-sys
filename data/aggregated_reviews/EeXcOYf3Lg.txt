Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a diffusion-based makeup transfer method called Self-supervised Hierarchical Makeup Transfer (SHMT). The method extracts makeup features from distorted images and aligns them with facial features, utilizing both noisy generated features and source face shapes. The incorporation of pyramid Laplacian features allows for fine-grained control over makeup transfer strength, balancing detail preservation of makeup and facial features. The experimental section is comprehensive, showcasing the model's ability to generalize across various makeup styles.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The experiments are thorough, with qualitative comparisons validating the model's capability to handle diverse makeup styles.
- The model demonstrates impressive generalization across different makeup types.
- The proposed method allows flexible control over hierarchical texture details, yielding superior quantitative and qualitative results compared to existing methods.

Weaknesses:
- The criteria for judging makeup complexity are unclear; it is uncertain whether this is assessed automatically or through human evaluation, and how the Laplace feature parameter $h_i$ is selected during training.
- The comparison methods appear outdated and could be replaced with more recent diffusion-based approaches.
- Ethical concerns regarding potential misuse of makeup transfer technology and data privacy have not been adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity on how makeup complexity is evaluated, including the selection process for the Laplace feature parameter $h_i$. Additionally, we suggest updating the comparison methods to include recent diffusion models to enhance the relevance of the evaluation. It is crucial to address ethical concerns more thoroughly, particularly regarding the potential for misuse and the specifics of data usage and consent. Providing detailed protocols for data security and ethical considerations in the main paper would strengthen the overall contribution.
