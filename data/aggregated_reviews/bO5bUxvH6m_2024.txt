Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical framework for learning discrete concepts from high-dimensional data using latent hierarchical causal models. The authors propose formalizing concept learning as identifying discrete latent variables and their hierarchical causal structure from continuous observed data. They provide identifiability conditions and proofs for recovering these discrete latent variables and their relationships, while also interpreting latent diffusion models through this framework, supported by empirical evidence.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a novel formalization of concept learning as a causal discovery problem, providing theoretical grounding for an important area of machine learning.
2. It includes rigorous proofs for the identifiability of discrete latent variables and hierarchical structures under relatively mild conditions.
3. The flexible graphical conditions allow for more complex hierarchical structures than previous work.
4. The connection drawn between the theoretical framework and latent diffusion models is interesting and supported by empirical evidence.
5. The authors are transparent about the limitations of their work.

Weaknesses:
1. The identification conditions (Condition 3.3 and 3.7) may be too restrictive for real-world scenarios, particularly the invertibility requirement on the generating function g (Condition 3.3-ii).
2. The method relies heavily on rank tests of probability tables (Theorem 3.5), which can be computationally expensive and numerically unstable for large state spaces.
3. The approach assumes a clear hierarchical structure among concepts, which may not reflect the complex, overlapping relationships found in real-world data.
4. The theory does not address how to handle noise or uncertainty in the observed data, which could significantly impact the identification of discrete states.
5. The sections on latent diffusion models feel disconnected from the main contributions and lack a concrete mechanism for leveraging theoretical insights to improve diffusion model architectures.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and accessibility of the theoretical explanations, particularly in Sections 3.2 and 3.3, by providing additional clarifications and examples. We suggest restructuring the paper to present all definitions and key contributions in the main text rather than relegating significant content to the appendix, which currently makes it difficult to follow. Additionally, we encourage the authors to provide concrete empirical results demonstrating the practicality of recovering hierarchical graphs, particularly in real-world scenarios. Addressing the realism of Condition 3.3 and discussing potential relaxations could enhance the applicability of the framework. Finally, we recommend considering the removal of the section on latent diffusion models if it does not contribute meaningfully to the overall narrative.
