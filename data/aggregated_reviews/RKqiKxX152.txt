### Key Points
This paper presents a unified framework, UnifiedSSR, for joint learning of user behaviors in search and recommendation scenarios. The authors propose a dual-branch architecture that encodes product interactions and user queries in parallel, facilitating cross-scenario modeling. Additionally, an intent-oriented session module is introduced to enhance user behavior modeling by capturing dynamic user intent. The framework demonstrates promising results across multiple datasets, indicating its potential to improve search and recommendation outcomes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The three-way parameter sharing is an interesting approach.
- The paper is well-written and clearly presents its concepts.
- The evaluation across various datasets shows consistent performance improvements.

Weaknesses:
- The joint learning of search and recommendation behaviors is not fully explored.
- Session-intent modeling does not adequately support UnifiedSSR.
- Several details regarding the methodology and figures are unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of dataset processing by explicitly describing how the datasets are divided for both search and recommendation scenarios in Section 4. Additionally, we suggest conducting multiple evaluations on the datasets and including statistical analysis to assess the significance of improvements over baseline methods. Furthermore, addressing the coherence between the two parts of the framework and exploring the joint learning aspect more deeply would enhance the paper's depth. Lastly, we encourage the authors to analyze and compare their work with Yuqi Gong et al.'s unified framework for a comprehensive understanding of the research landscape.
