### Key Points
This paper presents a study on parallel submodular function minimization, focusing on integer-valued functions bounded between $-M$ and $M$. The authors propose two algorithms: one with a running time of $\tilde{O}(n^{1/3} M^{2/3})$ and query complexity $\tilde{O}(n^2 M^2)$, and another that operates in 2 rounds with query complexity $n^{O(M)}$. These algorithms improve upon existing methods that require $\Omega(n)$ rounds. The work also extends the optimization of the Lovasz extension to the $\ell_\infty$ case, yielding significant theoretical contributions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The problem of efficiently minimizing submodular functions in parallel is well-motivated and relevant, addressing a gap in existing literature.  
- The algorithms provide the first upper bounds that improve upon previous results, with clear and correct presentation of the findings.  
- The writing is clear, and the technical background is well-explained, making the contributions accessible.

Weaknesses:  
- The results largely rely on existing work and simple observations, lacking substantial novel methodology.  
- The practical efficiency of the first algorithm is questionable due to unclear constants, and the second algorithm resembles exhaustive search, limiting its applicability for larger $M$.  
- There is no experimental evaluation, which may limit the practical understanding of the algorithms' performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the distinction between the parallel and sequential settings of submodular function minimization, potentially by introducing the concept of adaptivity. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion on the wider implications of the results for machine learning. To enhance the algorithms, consider exploring strategies similar to those in [ALS20] to reduce the query complexity of the first algorithm. Lastly, we advise addressing minor editorial issues and ensuring consistency in notation throughout the paper.
