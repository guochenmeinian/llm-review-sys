### Key Points
This paper presents FADID-TT, a fully anonymous decentralized identity (DID) system that achieves both full anonymity and accountability through threshold tracing. The authors propose a system that employs (n,t)-threshold secret sharing, anonymous signatures, and decentralized anonymous credentials (DACs) to ensure privacy while resisting identity forgery. The implementation on blockchain platforms like Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum demonstrates practical feasibility. However, the evaluation section lacks comprehensive experimental validation, particularly in performance metrics and comparisons with existing works.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of full anonymity with threshold traceability is a significant contribution to decentralized identity systems.
- The paper is well-structured, with clear expression and rigorous analysis.
- It effectively discusses limitations of existing DID solutions and provides detailed explanations of the system's workflow.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation section is underdeveloped, lacking comparative experiments and sufficient demonstration of performance metrics.
- The novelty of the system is not well-articulated, raising questions about its distinct contributions compared to existing technologies.
- There is limited discussion of practical deployment challenges, particularly regarding integration with existing DID systems and potential vulnerabilities to collusion among committee members.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation section by including comparative performance metrics, such as storage and computational overheads, against existing related works. Additionally, the authors should clarify the novelty of their work by explicitly detailing how their system outperforms existing solutions. It would be beneficial to address practical deployment challenges, including integration with existing DID standards, and to provide concrete examples of the roles within the ADID committee to enhance clarity. Finally, we suggest revising the figures for better readability and ensuring consistent legends between figures.
