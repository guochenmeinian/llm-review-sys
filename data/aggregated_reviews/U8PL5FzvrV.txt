### Key Points
This paper presents a multitasking framework that integrates dialogue discourse parsing with addressee recognition to enhance the performance of dialogue discourse parsing. The authors propose a reinforcement learning agent to select the most beneficial training examples from addressee recognition and a task-aware structure transformer to optimize both tasks. The method demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines on the Molweni and STAC datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The multitasking framework alleviates data sparsity in dialogue discourse parsing without requiring additional annotated labels.
- The proposed reinforcement learning agent and task-aware structure transformer effectively improve dialogue discourse parsing performance.
- The paper is well-written, organized, and presents comprehensive evaluations.

Weaknesses:
- The significance of the improvements for downstream tasks, particularly those not affected by data sparsity, is inadequately demonstrated.
- The contribution is perceived as incremental, with unclear implications for downstream tasks like reading comprehension and sentiment analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the demonstration of how dialogue discourse parsing performance impacts downstream tasks. Additionally, providing more details on the multi-task training for Equation 11, considering the differing dataset scales, would enhance clarity. Addressing the questions regarding the choice of gradient as a metric for task-private and shared neurons and the potential benefits of joint training for addressee recognition would also strengthen the paper.
