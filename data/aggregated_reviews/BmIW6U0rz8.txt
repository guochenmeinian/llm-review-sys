Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Koopman eigenfunction kernel that induces a Koopman-invariant RKHS, along with an analytical solution for the corresponding regression problem. The authors provide theoretical guarantees and numerical experiments to validate the efficacy of their method, which links Koopman operator theory with kernel methods for learning dynamical systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The design of the kernel that induces a Koopman-invariant RKHS addresses a challenging problem.
2. The theoretical results in Section 4 guarantee the performance of the proposed method.
3. The paper is well-written, clearly presenting the problem of Koopman linearization and introducing novel techniques for function approximation.

Weaknesses:
1. The presentation lacks clarity, particularly in the mathematical description of the Koopman approximation theory and the claimed challenges in the Koopman operator community.
2. The authors only test their method on low-dimensional toy models, which limits the applicability of their findings.
3. There is a general lack of mathematical rigor, with some statements being unjustified or misleading, such as the claim regarding the RKHS's universal features.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the mathematical rigor throughout the paper, ensuring all claims are justified and clearly articulated. Specifically, clarify the definition of the feature map and provide more details on the choice of kernel \( k \). Additionally, we suggest extending the experimental section to include more complex dynamical systems and real-world datasets, such as PIV data or molecular dynamics, to demonstrate the method's applicability. Finally, a more detailed discussion on the sampling strategy's importance and how it affects performance would enhance the manuscript.
