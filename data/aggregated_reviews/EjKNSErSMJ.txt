Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a regularized version of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm for monotone variational inequalities, demonstrating an $\tilde{O}(T^{-1/2})$ convergence rate for the deterministic case and an $\tilde{O}(T^{-1/6})$ rate for the stochastic setting using variance reduction techniques. The authors claim their approach is novel, particularly in achieving last-iterate convergence without imposing strong curvature requirements.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The presentation and analysis are mostly straightforward and easy to follow.
- The combination of regularization and variance reduction is a simple yet effective idea.
- The paper establishes the first last-iterate convergence result for constrained stochastic MVI problems.
- Strong theoretical guarantees are provided, including the first finite-time analysis of smoothed fictitious play.

Weaknesses:
- There are significant issues with the proofs, particularly regarding the omission of $w_t$ in Line 808 and the strong assumptions made in Lemma 4.1.
- The assumption of the existence of $\bar{F} = \max ||F(x)||_2$ is seen as unusual and overly strong.
- Empirical results show a gap between the proposed algorithm and the extragradient method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and rigor of the proofs, particularly addressing the omission of $w_t$ in Line 808. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed justification for the assumptions made in Lemma 4.1 and the necessity of $\bar{F}$. It would also be beneficial to elaborate on the advantages of the proposed regularized Frank-Wolfe method compared to projection-based algorithms, both theoretically and empirically. Finally, enhancing the numerical experiments to demonstrate significant advantages over existing methods would strengthen the contribution of the paper.
