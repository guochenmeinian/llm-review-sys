Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Autoregressive Neural TensorNet (ANTN), a novel architecture that integrates features from both autoregressive neural networks (ARNN) and tensor networks (TN) for simulating quantum many-body systems. The authors aim to leverage the advantages of both methods, achieving enhanced expressivity and adherence to physics inductive bias. Theoretical contributions include proofs of exact sampling and expressivity, while empirical results demonstrate ANTN's superior performance in quantum state learning and approximating the ground state of the 2D \(J_1-J_2\) Heisenberg model. The authors clarify that the ANTN approach combines the strengths of ARNN and matrix product states (MPS) to achieve performance levels comparable to density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) while reducing computational costs. They discuss the impact of DMRG results on training and the advantages of ANTN in inheriting symmetries and flexible sign structures from MPS, which are not present in ARNN. The findings indicate that while increasing parameters in ARNN can improve energy, it leads to diminishing returns due to optimization challenges.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed architecture effectively combines the strengths of tensor networks and autoregressive neural networks, presenting a novel and intuitive approach.
- The paper is well-structured and provides a comprehensive literature review, enhancing readability and accessibility.
- The experimental results show that ANTN consistently outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its potential for larger systems and superior expressivity.
- The authors provide detailed responses to reviewer comments, enhancing the clarity and depth of the manuscript.

Weaknesses:
- The empirical study lacks clarity regarding the specific ANTN architecture used, as it does not specify which ARNN variant was employed in the experiments.
- The manuscript frequently mentions "expressivity" and "sign structure" without clear definitions, which may hinder reader understanding.
- The theoretical treatment of the expressivity advantage of ANTN over ARNN lacks thoroughness and may be misleading in its current form.
- There is insufficient discussion on the training process for ANTN, and the paper lacks benchmarks for runtime and memory complexity.
- The focus on the differences between ARNN and ANTN could be more pronounced, as the current emphasis includes many aspects that dilute this comparison.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental section by specifying which ARNN variant was used in the experiments and providing external performance references for comparison. Additionally, we suggest including definitions and explanations for key concepts such as "expressivity" and "sign structure" to enhance reader comprehension. A detailed discussion on the training process for ANTN should be included in the main text, along with benchmarks for runtime and memory complexity to provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the theoretical treatment of the expressivity claims to clearly establish the differences between ANTN and ARNN, particularly addressing the exponential versus polynomial expressivity. It would be beneficial to conduct a systematic empirical exploration comparing the performance of ANTN with varying layers of ARNN to illustrate the trade-offs more clearly. Finally, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the expressivity advantages of ANTN in relation to existing architectures to strengthen their theoretical contributions and improve the runtime efficiency of the DMRG configurations to enhance practical usability.
