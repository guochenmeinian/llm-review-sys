Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of the Combinatorial Group Testing (CGT) problem within a game-theoretic framework, focusing on a set of $n$ agents where $k$ are active. The authors aim to identify the active agents through queries while minimizing the time taken. They introduce the concept of adversarial equilibrium (AE) and analyze two scenarios: one where the number of active agents is known, achieving near-optimal revealing times of $O(k \log(\frac{n}{k}))$, and another where it is unknown, resulting in revealing times of $n^{k-1}$ with a lower bound of $\Omega(n)$.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem is clearly introduced, and the paper is well-written, particularly in its technical discussions.
- The algorithm for the known $k$ case (BS_Jumps) is a sound contribution, demonstrating performance close to optimal.
- The application of game-theoretic ideas to CGT is interesting and relevant, with several applications identified.

Weaknesses:
- The paper builds on ideas from Chionas et al. [2023], limiting its contributions, with the main algorithm being BS_Jumps while other algorithms are either from literature or straightforward.
- The feedback function lacks clear motivation, and its implications should be discussed.
- There is no section for numerical evaluation or experiments, which is a significant weakness.
- The discussion of the unknown $k$ case is not as thorough as that for the known $k$ case.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation and implications of the feedback function discussed in lines 117-119. Additionally, a section dedicated to empirical testing or validation of the proposed algorithms would enrich the paper significantly. We also suggest providing a more thorough discussion of the unknown $k$ case to match the depth of the known $k$ case analysis. Lastly, please clarify the concept of "selfishness" of agents and its implications, as well as the connection between CGT and the applications mentioned in the introduction.
