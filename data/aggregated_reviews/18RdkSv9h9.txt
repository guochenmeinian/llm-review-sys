Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents FINALLY, a speech enhancement algorithm utilizing GANs and the Wav LM encoder, evaluated through various feature extractors. The authors provide both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrating the algorithm's effectiveness across different noise levels, types, and accents. The theoretical justification for using adversarial learning and the mode-covering property of LSGAN for speech enhancement is discussed, alongside the integration of a perceptual loss based on WavLM features.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The fidelity of the generated outputs is impressive, showcasing significant restoration capabilities from low-quality signals.
- The rigorous comparison leading to the selection of WavLM as the feature extractor is commendable.
- The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of the loss functions and training stages.

Weaknesses:
- The approach closely resembles HiFi with minimal modifications, and the claimed contributions may not be as substantial as presented.
- The experimental section lacks standard datasets and metrics for comparison, such as PSNR, PESQ, and STOI, which limits the evaluation's robustness.
- The complexity of the three-stage training process may not justify the performance gains over HiFi-GAN2, and the reduction of model size for ablation studies raises concerns about result validity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental evaluations by including standard datasets and metrics like VCTK, WHAM, and Librispeech to facilitate comparisons with recent methods. Additionally, we suggest providing qualitative comparisons against baselines such as HiFi++ in the main tables to highlight improvements more effectively. Clarifying the necessity of the WavLM-enc in the ablation study and addressing the order of metrics in the results tables would enhance the paper's clarity. Lastly, we advise a more thorough discussion of the limitations, particularly regarding the non-streaming nature of the approach.
