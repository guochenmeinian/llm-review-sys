Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the phenomenon of *attack amplification* in federated learning (FL) when using Knowledge Distillation (KD) and proposes a framework named HYDRA-FL to mitigate the impact of poisoning client attacks. The authors introduce an auxiliary classifier to apply KD loss at a shallower layer, thereby reducing the adverse effects on the final model layers. Experimental results indicate that HYDRA-FL improves performance under both clean and poisoned conditions compared to existing FL methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper clearly articulates the threat posed by KD in FL and provides a unified solution that is agnostic to most FL frameworks.
- It includes a well-structured ablation study validating the effects of various components of the proposed algorithm.
- The writing is clear and accessible, making the content understandable to a broad audience.

Weaknesses:
- The practicality of the algorithm is questionable, as it relies heavily on specific hyper-parameter choices, with insufficient sensitivity analysis provided.
- Only two FL+KD methods are analyzed, limiting the scope of the experimental validation.
- The related work section lacks comprehensiveness, failing to adequately discuss existing research on KD in FL with poisoned teacher models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental analysis by including additional KD methods to better demonstrate the efficiency of HYDRA-FL. A more in-depth analysis of the experimental observations is needed to provide insights into the variability of performance, particularly when alpha=5 in Table 2. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify how their findings on attack amplification apply to both standard KD and KD-based FL, emphasizing the differences and similarities. Finally, referencing the appendix more frequently in the main text would enhance the paper's clarity regarding limitations and the threat model.
