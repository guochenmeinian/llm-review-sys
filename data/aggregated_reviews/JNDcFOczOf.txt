Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the applicability of iterated and accumulated quantile risk objectives within Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL). The authors propose an algorithm named Risk-Aware-PbRL (RA-PbRL) that optimizes these objectives and provide a theoretical analysis of regret bounds, demonstrating that the regret is sublinear concerning the number of episodes. Empirical results are also included to support the theoretical findings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The problem addressed—applying risk-aware objectives to PbRL—is relevant for applications like healthcare and AI systems, with a reward model that generalizes beyond prior works.  
2. The consideration of both iterated and accumulated objectives, including the popular CVaR, is commendable, and the algorithm design along with the theoretical analysis is well executed.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The algorithm appears straightforward, combining confidence set construction with risk-aware objectives, leading to computational inefficiency and practical implementation challenges. More implementation details are needed.  
2. The intuition behind the factor $\min_{\pi,d} \omega_{\pi}(d)$ in Theorem 4.1 requires clarification, particularly regarding its influence on regret. Additional discussions on regret due to reward estimation are necessary.  
3. There are inconsistencies in the appearance of $L_G$ in the upper and lower bounds (Theorems 4.2 and 4.4) that need explanation. Similarly, the role of $dim_{T}$ should be clarified.  
4. The paper requires careful proofreading due to numerous typographical errors.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the implementation details of the RA-PbRL algorithm to address its computational inefficiency. Additionally, we suggest providing a clearer explanation of the intuition behind the factor $\min_{\pi,d} \omega_{\pi}(d)$ and its impact on regret, as well as discussing the implications of reward estimation on regret. Clarifying the discrepancies in the bounds related to $L_G$ and $dim_{T}$ is also essential. Finally, we urge the authors to conduct a thorough proofreading to correct the identified typographical errors.
