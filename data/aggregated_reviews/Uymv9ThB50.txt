Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Safety Concept Activation Vector (SCAV) framework, which aims to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in large language models (LLMs) by interpreting their safety mechanisms. The authors propose an SCAV-guided attack method that enhances the success rate of generating harmful prompts and embedding-level attacks while requiring less training data. They claim that SCAV demonstrates superiority over existing methods like PCA and RepE, particularly in terms of accuracy and performance with fewer training samples. The results indicate that the method can transfer attack prompts across different models, including black-box models like GPT-4, suggesting persistent safety issues in LLMs. The authors assert that SCAV effectively identifies optimal layers for perturbation and showcases the linear separability of malicious and safe embeddings across various models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a clean presentation.
2. The evaluation is comprehensive, showing promising results and improved transferability to GPT-4.
3. The originality of applying the SCAV framework to guide attacks on LLMs provides a unique perspective on understanding safety mechanisms.
4. The authors provide multiple analyses demonstrating SCAV's performance improvements over existing methods, including significant gains in attack success rate (ASR) and accuracy with fewer training samples.
5. The paper offers insights into the linear separability of malicious and safe embeddings, which could inform future research and defense mechanisms.

Weaknesses:  
1. The concept of inspecting hidden representations for safety is not novel, as it has been previously proposed in RePE, and the authors' approach using SCAV lacks sufficient novelty.
2. The reliance on linear separability in high-dimensional spaces may not consistently hold, raising questions about the robustness of the SCAV framework.
3. The choice of layers for optimization lacks justification, and the authors do not provide sufficient empirical evidence to validate the linear separability assumption across diverse models and layers.
4. The lack of statistical analysis supporting SCAV's claimed superiority raises concerns about its distinct advantages over existing methods.
5. The explanation of transferability to black-box models is deemed insufficient, with a need for deeper comparisons and justifications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the novelty of their approach compared to existing methods like RePE. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed exploration of the linear separability assumption and its implications for the SCAV framework's applicability across different models. We suggest including an ablation study on the choice of layers optimized in the SCAV objective and clarifying the selection criteria for hyperparameters. Furthermore, we recommend enhancing the statistical analysis to convincingly demonstrate SCAV's superiority over PCA and other clustering methods, including clear comparisons and evidence of performance metrics. To enhance the discussion on transferability, we suggest providing a more thorough comparison of SCAV with established black-box methods and offering a detailed explanation of the mechanisms that enable effective transferability to models like GPT-4. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the term "misleading heuristics" for better audience understanding.
