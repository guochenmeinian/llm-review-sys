### Key Points
This paper presents AMOR, a modular framework for answering questions by reasoning over external knowledge bases. AMOR is structured as a Finite State Machine (FSM) that decomposes tasks into smaller modules, which can include LLM calls or tool calls. Each module is fine-tuned separately using relevant data, facilitating easier data collection and evaluation. The development process consists of a warm-up phase for generalization and an adaptation phase for domain-specific fine-tuning. Empirical evaluations demonstrate AMOR's effectiveness, outperforming relevant baselines across various QA datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The authors propose an innovative FSM-based framework that integrates classical techniques with state-of-the-art LLMs and tool calling, effectively incorporating human feedback.  
- The paper is well-written, with clear explanations and helpful figures that enhance understanding.  
- Extensive empirical studies and ablation analyses validate the method's effectiveness across popular datasets like HotPotQA and PubMedQA.  

Weaknesses:  
- The framework's complexity, including the need for separate fine-tuning of various LLMs and a two-stage fine-tuning approach, makes it resource-intensive.  
- The absence of uncertainty measures in experiments limits the ability to assess the statistical significance of the results.  
- The paper lacks a formal task description and clear definitions of notations, which hinders readability and understanding of the proposed method.  
- Key implementation details, such as architecture and hyperparameters, are missing, complicating reproducibility.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing a formal task description and clearly defining all notations used. Additionally, including measures of uncertainty in the experimental results would strengthen the validity of the findings. To enhance reproducibility, we suggest adding a table detailing the architecture, hyperparameters, and techniques used for each module. Finally, we encourage the authors to simplify the presentation of ideas to improve overall readability and comprehension.
