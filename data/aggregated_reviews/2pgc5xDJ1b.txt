Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for inferring policy decisions based on randomized controlled trial data applied to a target population with new covariate data. The authors propose a nonparametric approach that certifies valid finite-sample inferences of out-of-sample loss, addressing the challenge of generalizing RCT results to a target population while ensuring robustness against model miscalibrations. The method is validated using both simulated and real data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The problem of policy evaluation with covariate shifts is significant and well-articulated.
2. The paper is well-written and presents contributions clearly, making it accessible even to those less familiar with the methodology.
3. The incorporation of informal methods for benchmarking plausible values of the $\Gamma$ parameter enhances practical applicability.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation for focusing on inferring L_{n+1} for a single additional data point rather than considering multiple new observations is unclear.
2. The discussion of theoretical guarantees is insufficient, particularly regarding the reliance on heuristics and assumptions about the distributional forms.
3. The experimental setup appears overly simplistic, utilizing a basic two-dimensional covariate space and a simple quadratic model for loss.
4. The claimed contribution that Gamma can incorporate finite sample and model misspecification error lacks clarity, particularly in how these considerations influence Gamma selection.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind inferring L_{n+1} for a single data point and consider discussing the implications of evaluating multiple new observations. Additionally, we suggest a more thorough exploration of the theoretical guarantees and the assumptions made regarding the distributional forms. The authors should also consider enhancing the complexity of the experimental setup to better reflect real-world scenarios. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify how model misspecification and estimation error are incorporated into the choice of Gamma and to highlight the novel technical contributions in comparison to related works.
