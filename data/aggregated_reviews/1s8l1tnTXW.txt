Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Muharaf dataset, a collection of 1,644 historic handwritten Arabic manuscript images, annotated and transcribed by experts. The dataset aims to advance handwritten text recognition (HTR) for Arabic and cursive scripts, encompassing various handwriting styles and document types, including personal letters, diaries, and legal correspondences. Key features include spatial polygonal coordinates of text lines and basic page elements, making it suitable for tasks beyond HTR, such as text-line segmentation and layout analysis. The authors describe the data acquisition pipeline and provide baseline results from training convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The Muharaf dataset is one of the largest publicly available Arabic datasets for historical manuscripts, providing a rich collection of diverse handwriting styles and document types.
- The dataset's comprehensive annotations enhance its utility for various research tasks, including layout detection and writer identification.
- The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear description of the data collection and annotation process.

Weaknesses:
- The significance of the Muharaf dataset in relation to existing Arabic datasets is not sufficiently emphasized.
- Baseline experiments focus on a single method, limiting exploration of newer approaches and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.
- The paper lacks detailed discussions on historical variations of Arabic scripts and does not adequately explain terms like "harakat," which may confuse non-Arabic speakers.
- The labeling process description is vague, and the qualifications of annotators are not clearly presented, potentially impacting perceived quality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the Muharaf dataset's significance compared to existing Arabic datasets. Evaluating the dataset with multiple SOTA OCR models, rather than focusing on a single method, would enhance its applicability and relevance. Including a comparison of transcription text before and after expert review in terms of CER/WER would provide insight into the QA process's effectiveness. Additionally, providing illustrative examples of annotations and a clearer breakdown of the annotators' qualifications would enhance clarity. Lastly, a more robust benchmarking with comprehensive evaluations and comparisons to existing datasets would strengthen the paper's impact.
