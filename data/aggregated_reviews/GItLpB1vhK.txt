Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents new sketching algorithms for approximating kernel-based estimators of Koopman operators from large-scale temporal data, achieving significant computational efficiency improvements. The authors derive non-asymptotic error bounds and demonstrate the effectiveness of their methods through empirical studies, particularly emphasizing the importance of long-time trajectory data for accurate Koopman mode decomposition.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper develops efficient algorithms for computing Koopman spectra, validated on large datasets, including traditional benchmarks and molecular data.
- Optimal learning rates for the new algorithms are provided, enhancing their theoretical foundation.
- The authors effectively contextualize their contributions within existing literature, and the paper is well-written and organized.
- The empirical analysis is robust, showcasing the tradeoff between time and accuracy and emphasizing the necessity of long trajectories for scientific discovery.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for the need for long-time trajectory data is insufficiently addressed in the Introduction, requiring further elaboration.
- The discussion on learning rate differences among methods (Nystrom PCR, RRR, and KRR) could be expanded, potentially in tabular form, and should include clarifications on the choice of methods in figures.
- Some equations are confusing, particularly the transitions between Eq. 8 and Eq. 9, and Eq. 10 and Eq. 11, which need clearer explanations.
- The generation process of random $\tilde{\Phi}$ should be explicitly detailed in the text.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the Introduction by providing a clearer motivation for the necessity of long-time trajectory data in Koopman mode decomposition. Additionally, we suggest expanding the discussion on the differences in learning rates among KRR, PCR, and RRR, possibly through a comparative table, and clarifying the rationale for method selection in figures. The authors should also clarify the transitions between equations to enhance understanding and provide a detailed explanation of how random $\tilde{\Phi}$ are generated. Lastly, addressing minor comments regarding citations, abbreviations, and figures will further enhance the paper's clarity and impact.
