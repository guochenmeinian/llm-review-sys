### Key Points
This paper presents a study on Visual Relation Extraction (VRE), introducing the GlObal Structure knowledge-guided relation Extraction (GOSE) framework. The authors tackle the challenges of incorporating global structure knowledge and capturing dependencies between entity pairs, demonstrating the advantages of GOSE through experimental results that indicate good performance, particularly in cross-lingual and few-shot learning contexts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation and organization of the paper are clear and well-articulated.
- The proposed local- and global-learning procedures appear novel and are supported by extensive experiments showing promising results.
- The paper is well-written, making it easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- There is insufficient discussion on the performance of LLMs with multi-modal inputs, which raises questions about the paper's contribution to the VRE task.
- The iterative learning component's significant impact on performance raises concerns about overfitting, especially given the small datasets used.
- The paper lacks detailed explanations on how local and global structure information is learned, and there are numerous typos that require careful proofreading.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the performance of LLMs capable of processing multi-modal information to clarify the contribution of GOSE to the VRE task. Additionally, we suggest conducting further experiments to provide evidence on how dependencies between entity pairs enhance performance, potentially including visualizations of attention weights over spatial information. To address concerns about overfitting, we recommend extracting a validation dataset from the training data for hyperparameter tuning. Furthermore, please clarify the number of iterations used in experiments and how global tokens T are initialized. Lastly, we urge the authors to proofread the manuscript to correct the identified typos and enhance clarity.
