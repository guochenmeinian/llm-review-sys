Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into ridge regression, establishing equivalences between ridge regularization and ensembles of weak learners trained on subsamples of the original dataset. The authors prove two types of equivalences: one at the level of a generic class of risks and another at the level of the ridge estimator itself. These results hold under mild assumptions without requiring specific data models. The authors provide both theoretical and data-driven characterizations of the equivalences and discuss potential extensions to real-data scenarios and random features regression. The paper also addresses an important open question regarding the behavior of optimally tuned ridge regularization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work is sound, relevant, and well-motivated, addressing open questions in the literature.
- The theoretical contributions are significant, extending previous results under relaxed conditions.
- The paper is well-written, with code available for reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical results may have limited practical implications, as they are primarily established in the asymptotic regime.
- Some minor issues in presentation and clarity remain, including the need for additional exposition in certain areas.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve Figure 3 by enhancing the caption to describe the difference in the x-axis between the left and right panels. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a sketch of the proof to highlight the core ideas behind their main result. Clarifying the novelty of their proof techniques and discussing whether the equivalences are expected to break in specific settings would also strengthen the paper. Finally, addressing minor typos and ensuring consistent terminology throughout the manuscript would enhance clarity.
