Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical foundation for understanding mode connectivity in auction mechanisms, specifically focusing on RochetNet and Affine Maximizer Auctions (AMA). The authors establish that locally optimal solutions are connected by paths in parameter space, demonstrating that $\epsilon$-mode connectivity holds under certain conditions, such as when valuations are normalized and menus are $\epsilon$-reducible. The work aims to explain the empirical success of differentiable economics in auction design.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant problem in auction mechanism design through machine learning.
- It provides a novel theoretical explanation for empirical phenomena observed in auction optimization.
- The presentation is clear, and the proof appears correct and well-structured.

Weaknesses:
- The significance and novelty of the results are not fully articulated, particularly regarding the relationship between mode connectivity in auction mechanisms and that in neural networks.
- The presentation requires major revisions, especially in the contributions section, where definitions and results should be more clearly stated.
- There is a lack of discussion on practical implications of mode connectivity for practitioners, such as initialization strategies for networks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the contributions section by moving key definitions to the introduction for better readability. Additionally, please provide a more explicit discussion on how mode connectivity can justify empirical performance and what insights practitioners can derive from this property. It would also be beneficial to clarify the differences in network architecture between existing work and the neural networks studied in this paper. Finally, addressing the perplexing regularity of the "five pieces" in the RochetNet and AMA results would enhance the paper's depth.
