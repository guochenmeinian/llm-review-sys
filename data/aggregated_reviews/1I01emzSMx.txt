### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative extension of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) designed for modeling turbulent flows, specifically addressing the challenges of non-Gaussianity and rare events. The authors propose a domain-specific non-Gaussian extension of VAEs, replacing Gaussianity in latent space with a more complex distribution to effectively capture tail behavior. The proposed XVAE method shows promise, particularly in its superior performance compared to the traditional Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) technique, especially in capturing extreme events.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The writing is clear and well-structured.
2. The proposed XVAE method is innovative and shows promise.
3. The visualizations are effective and intuitive.
4. XVAE exhibits superior performance in capturing extreme events compared to the POD technique.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a comprehensive comparative analysis with recent state-of-the-art models, relying on the outdated POD technique from 1993.
2. Important details such as the number of knots used in the best-performing model and the shape parameters for optimal training results are absent, hindering reproducibility and clarity.
3. There is insufficient detail regarding the dataset used in the study, including a lack of access to the dataset or a link for retrieval.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including a more comprehensive comparative analysis with contemporary state-of-the-art models to enhance its relevance. Additionally, the authors should provide the number of knots used in the best-performing model and the shape parameters for optimal training results to improve reproducibility and clarity. Finally, a detailed description of the dataset used in the study should be included, along with access to the dataset or a link for retrieval.
