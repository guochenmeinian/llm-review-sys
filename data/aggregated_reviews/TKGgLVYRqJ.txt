### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the conditions under which stable polysemy emerges in semantic space, focusing on frequency, discriminability, and non-conformist usage of lexical items. The authors utilize population dynamics models to analyze these factors theoretically and empirically, demonstrating that low frequency, non-conformist usage, and high discriminability increase the likelihood of words acquiring new stable senses. The analysis is based on a curated dataset of several thousand words with extensive sense annotations and various secondary data sources. The main contribution lies in applying population dynamics models from biology and economics to semantic change, showcasing mathematical rigor alongside empirical analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is methodologically sound and thorough, clearly outlining assumptions and their implications.
- The mathematical specifications are dense yet accessible to non-specialists, and the results contribute valuable insights into diachronic phenomena in language.
- The limitations section is comprehensive and enhances the understanding of the results.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation of the methodology is overly dense, and the discussion lacks depth, particularly in addressing the correlation between frequency and polysemy.
- The theoretical status of polysemy is questioned, with concerns about distinguishing between polysemy and homophony, as well as the multitude of potential causes for polysemy.
- The model's ability to combine various factors into a causal framework is unclear, resembling correlational analysis rather than a distinct theoretical contribution.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology presentation, providing additional details to enhance interpretability. It would be beneficial to address the tension between frequency and polysemy more thoroughly in the discussion section, ensuring a robust interpretation of results. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the theoretical underpinnings of polysemy and its distinction from homophony, as well as the implications of their findings for understanding language change. Finally, we encourage the authors to consider whether a formal approach is the most suitable for the NLP community, potentially exploring more simulative methodologies.
