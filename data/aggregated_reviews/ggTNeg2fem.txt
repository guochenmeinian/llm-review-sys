Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extensive review of multimodal automated fact-checking tasks, conceptualizing a framework that includes four modalities: text, image, audio, and video. The authors provide a comprehensive analysis of existing benchmarks and models, aiming to fill a critical gap in the research landscape. However, the paper lacks a clear structure, making it complicated to read, and does not include a quantitative comparison of the surveyed works, despite claiming to validate the importance of multimodal fact-checking through manual annotation of claims.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper conducts a thorough review of multimodal automated fact-checking, showcasing a vast amount of revised papers in terms of variety and quality.
- It presents a well-organized motivation for multimodal fact-checking research and includes informative citations and references.

Weaknesses:
- The manuscript lacks a clear structure, complicating the reading experience, and does not provide a comparative analysis of the models or their performance on benchmark datasets.
- The conceptualization of the three-stage framework for fact-checking is not novel, and the necessity of the initial claim detection stage is questioned.
- There is insufficient discussion on the challenges of deploying multimodal fact-checking in real-world settings and the characteristics of the datasets used.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper's structure to enhance clarity and readability. Including a quantitative analysis comparing the performance of different models on benchmark datasets would significantly strengthen the manuscript. Additionally, we suggest that the authors justify the necessity of the claim detection stage in their framework and provide a more in-depth discussion on the challenges of multimodal fact-checking. Finally, incorporating LLM-based detection models in the model section would reflect current trends in the field.
