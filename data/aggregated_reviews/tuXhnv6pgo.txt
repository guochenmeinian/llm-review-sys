### Key Points
This paper presents a method to create a surrogate model for transient thermal simulations of 3D printing processes using a transformer-based machine learning architecture. The objective is to condense lengthy computer-intensive calculations into minutes. The authors demonstrate that transformers outperform other models, although this conclusion may be influenced by the number of parameters in the transformer model compared to others. The manuscript includes a dataset of 640,000 data points for training but lacks details on the geometries of these points and generalization across different geometries.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed method significantly reduces computation time for thermal simulations.  
- The use of a transformer-based architecture is innovative for this application.  

Weaknesses:  
- The manuscript lacks details on the geometries of the data points and their generalization.  
- There is ambiguity regarding the context of RMSE values, making it difficult to assess their significance.  
- The conclusion about transformers outperforming other models may not be valid without considering neural scaling laws.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the manuscript by providing detailed information on the geometries of the data points and addressing generalization across different geometries. Additionally, including context for the RMSE values would enhance the clarity of the results. We also suggest that the authors review neural scaling laws to support their conclusions regarding the performance of transformers compared to other architectures.
