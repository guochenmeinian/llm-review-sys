Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive summary of skeleton-based action recognition, emphasizing graph neural networks and skeleton sequences. The authors propose a comparison of various methods, including skeletal graphs, ST-GCN, and hyperformer, to illustrate the evolution of graph neural networks in this field. The study includes extensive experiments to validate these approaches and highlights the importance of dynamic features through comparisons with Taylor-transformed skeletons.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper features a well-structured abstract and an in-depth literature review with a detailed experimental setup.
- It provides unique insights into the development of skeletal graphs and conducts extensive experimental validations.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation behind the study is weak and lacks sufficient evidence, making it resemble a case study rather than a technological innovation.
- The scope of comparisons between skeleton graphs and other methods is limited, offering only superficial summaries.
- The writing and logical structure, particularly in the Introduction, lack clarity, and the layout has formatting issues, such as excessive whitespace and poor figure placement.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation section by providing stronger evidence to support their claims. Additionally, we suggest expanding the scope of comparisons to include a more in-depth analysis of existing work in skeleton-based action recognition. Enhancing the clarity of the writing and logical structure, especially in the Introduction, is crucial. Finally, addressing the layout and formatting issues, such as excessive whitespace and figure placement, will improve the overall presentation of the paper.
