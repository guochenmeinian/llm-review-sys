### Key Points
This paper presents the Re3Dial framework, which addresses the limitations of pre-trained dialogue models in utilizing long-range context by automatically constructing billion-scale long-turn dialogues from existing short-turn dialogue sessions. The framework employs a four-step process involving initialization, retrieval using the Unsupervised Dense Session Retriever, diversity sampling, and session updating. Experimental results indicate that the framework significantly enhances the model's ability to generate coherent and informative responses in multi-turn dialogues. The authors also release a dataset of 1 billion dialogues in Chinese.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed Re3Dial framework effectively augments dialogue data, improving the performance of dialogue systems on both automatic and human metrics.
- The authors contribute a large-scale dialogue dataset for public use, which can benefit future research.
- The methodology is well-structured and demonstrates efficacy through experiments.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks comparisons with additional baseline methods, such as alternative retrieval enhancements or different long-term modeling approaches.
- The experimental results show only marginal improvements, raising concerns about the overall innovation and effectiveness of the proposed methods.
- The evaluation is limited to Chinese datasets, which may not guarantee the framework's effectiveness across different languages.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison of their framework by including additional baseline methods to strengthen their claims. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments on English dialogue datasets to validate the generalizability of the approach. Furthermore, the authors should provide results in terms of Distinct-1, PPL, and ROUGE-L to enhance the clarity and comprehensiveness of their findings. Lastly, addressing the marginal performance improvements with more substantial evidence of the retriever's effectiveness would strengthen the paper's contributions.
