### Key Points
This paper presents a new model for cross-document event coreference resolution that integrates discourse information into the pairwise scorer. The model utilizes local information (event trigger embeddings and EDU embeddings) and global discourse information (lowest parent node of the EDUs and the shortest path between them). The authors employ a T5 model to compress documents, focusing on event mentions, and subsequently run a discourse parser. The model achieves state-of-the-art results on the ECB+ dataset and includes a thorough ablation study demonstrating the contributions of various components.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of discourse signals into the model is innovative and yields a substantial improvement over the baseline (+4.6 F1).
- The ablation studies effectively illustrate the impact of each component, enhancing the understanding of the model's performance.
- The paper is well-written and presents a clear methodology.

Weaknesses:
- The model does not compare against significant state-of-the-art models, such as CDLM and Held et al., which outperform it by approximately 1 F1 point.
- Evaluation is limited to the corpus level with singletons; a topic-level evaluation without singletons is recommended.
- The model is tested on a single dataset, limiting its generalizability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison of their model against stronger baselines, specifically citing relevant works like Caciularu et al. (2021) and Held et al. (2021). Additionally, the authors should evaluate the model at the topic level without singletons, as suggested in Cattan et al. (2021). It would also be beneficial to analyze the impact of the discourse parser's accuracy on overall performance. Clarification is needed regarding the concatenation of the EDU sequence and the constraints in equation 1. Lastly, we suggest addressing the clarity of the qualitative analysis in section 5.3 and providing further insights into the effectiveness of the T5-based compression method.
