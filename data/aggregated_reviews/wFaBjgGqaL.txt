### Key Points
This paper presents an assessment of the robustness of conceptual representations in humans and large language models (LLMs) through three tasks: feature listing, triplet similarity, and explicit similarity ratings. The authors propose that while human conceptual spaces exhibit strong coherence across different cultures and languages, LLMs demonstrate significant variability in performance, particularly in explicit similarity ratings. The work also includes an analysis of embedding spaces from models like word2vec and CLIP, providing insights into how visual information influences representations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Methodologically solid with a well-rounded evaluation of conceptual spaces across tasks and populations.
- Engaging results that highlight differences between human and model conceptual structures, which could inspire further research.
- Clear presentation and accessibility of the paper, making it enjoyable to read.

Weaknesses:
- Limited sample size in terms of concepts and raters, raising concerns about potential biases.
- Some claims regarding model capabilities lack textual support, which could lead to misinterpretations.
- The dimensionality reduction to three dimensions may obscure important signals in the data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for mapping feature spaces to three dimensions, as evaluations could work in higher dimensions. Additionally, we suggest addressing the potential impact of polysemy in translations and how it may affect results. Clarifying the sampling method for training and testing responses would enhance transparency, and providing a baseline for out-of-sample prediction accuracy would aid in interpretation. Lastly, we encourage the authors to investigate possible order effects in human data for pairwise similarity ratings and include this analysis in an appendix.
