Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to out-of-distribution (OOD) detection by addressing the discrepancy between auxiliary and real OOD data. The authors propose a learning framework called DAL, which utilizes a Wasserstein ball to augment the auxiliary OOD dataset, thereby improving model performance in open-world OOD detection. The theoretical foundation of the method is supported by rigorous proofs, and experiments validate its effectiveness across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-motivated, clearly formalizing challenges in existing outlier exposure methods and providing a solution.
- The proposed DAL framework is theoretically grounded with a convergence guarantee.
- The structure of the paper is clear, guiding readers through the problem, theory, and algorithm.
- Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Weaknesses:
- Experiments are conducted on relatively simple datasets; further validation on more complex samples is needed.
- There are gaps between the algorithm and theory, particularly regarding assumptions in Theorem 2 that require clarification.
- More justifications are needed for certain design choices, and some experimental results could be moved to the appendix for clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the assumptions in Theorem 2 to clarify their applicability to the algorithm. Additionally, the authors should provide more detailed explanations for the need to perturb data in the embedding space and justify specific design choices with supporting literature or experiments. It would also be beneficial to explore the application of the model to regression tasks and clarify how the model can be adapted for transformers that are difficult to fine-tune. Finally, addressing the limitations of the method and discussing relevant open challenges would enhance the paper's contribution.
