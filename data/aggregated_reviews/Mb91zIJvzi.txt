### Key Points
This paper presents a methodology for efficiently discovering failures in a true system using Bayesian inference with Normalizing Flows (Flow-GMM) to sample $z$ values that enhance coverage while avoiding known risk regions ($\mathcal{Z}_{\text{risk}}$). The problem formulation is clearly defined, and the proposed three-step pipeline is intuitive, as illustrated in Figure 1. However, the effectiveness of the coverage function $C(z)$ is contingent on its definition, which may impact sampling quality. The paper lacks a conclusion in the last section and requires additional background information for clarity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- Clear motivation for estimating failures with minimal demonstrations.  
- Intuitive methodology that is easy to follow.  
- Interesting application of Bayesian inference that may engage the audience at the BDU workshop.  

Weaknesses:  
- Scalability concerns due to the computational complexity of Gaussian Processes.  
- Lack of clarity in the abstract and incomplete final section.  
- Insufficient background information for readers unfamiliar with the problem setup.  
- Potential issues with the definition of the coverage function and the modeling of disturbances.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the abstract and include a conclusion or discussion in the final section. Additionally, providing more background information and references would help readers understand the problem setup. It would be beneficial to clarify how the coverage function $C(z)$ is computed from a trajectory $X_z$ and how the risk function $R(z)$ is calculated, possibly including this in the appendix. We suggest adding uncertainty intervals or detailed error analysis in Table 1 to explain the increase in Max Error. Furthermore, elaborating on the sampling and projection processes in the latent space, including the transformation to latent space $W$ using $g_{\theta}^{-1}$, would enhance understanding. Finally, we encourage the authors to include additional examples and results to demonstrate the robustness of the method across tasks and to address its limitations, particularly regarding the sim-to-real gap and the number of demonstrations.
