Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a rejection scheme for unsupervised anomaly detection, focusing on determining a constant rejection threshold based on a confidence score from the EXCEED model. The authors provide theoretical analyses and empirical experiments demonstrating the feasibility of setting a rejection threshold with strong guarantees. The method aims to improve trust in anomaly detectors by rejecting samples with unstable predictions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and presents a clear theoretical analysis of the EXCEED metric, deriving upper bounds for the rejection rate and expected prediction cost.
- Comprehensive experiments validate the proposed method's effectiveness across various unsupervised detectors and datasets.
- The clarity of presentation enhances understanding, making complex theoretical contributions more accessible.

Weaknesses:
- The introduction of numerous variables without timely definitions complicates comprehension; for instance, variables like \(t_1(n, \gamma, T)\) and \(\gamma = \mathds{P}(Y = 1)\) are defined later in the text.
- Background information on the EXCEED metric is insufficient, and recent neural network anomaly detectors are not evaluated.
- The experimental description lacks detail, particularly regarding hyperparameters and the evaluation protocol, which could benefit from expansion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by defining key variables earlier to aid reader comprehension. Additionally, providing more background on the EXCEED metric and including recent neural network methods in the evaluation would strengthen the paper. Expanding the experimental section to include detailed descriptions of the implementation, hyperparameter tuning, and the influence of \(\lambda\) on costs would enhance the reader's understanding. Furthermore, addressing the assumptions regarding the contamination ratio and exploring methods for estimating detector stability beyond EXCEED would be beneficial.
