Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents BeNeDiff, which integrates behavior-informed latent variable models with generative diffusion models to analyze neural dynamics during behavioral tasks. The methodology focuses on identifying fine-grained neural subspaces and synthesizing behavior videos for quantifying neural activity linked to specific behaviors. The authors validate their approach using multi-session widefield calcium imaging datasets, achieving notable neural disentanglement and reconstruction quality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The use of wide-field calcium imaging for neural-behavior analysis is innovative and engaging.
2. Employing a behavior LVM for latent factor disentanglement, followed by a video diffusion model for behavior encoding, is both clear and impressive.
3. Utilizing $Z$ produced by the LVM as a learning target for the classifier in the video diffusion model is crucial, as it avoids potential "label leakage" issues.
4. The paper is well-organized, with meaningful and useful results in disentanglement and behavior encoding.

Weaknesses:
1. The reliance on a behavior LVM for neural activity disentanglement may be affected by the newly introduced total correlation (TC) penalty term with $\beta$ weighting; the impact of this penalty should be evaluated through ablation studies.
2. It is unclear whether the behavior video generation is trained concurrently with the disentangled subspace learning, and this should be clarified.
3. Visualization of the learned latent space would enhance understanding of the disentangled neural space.
4. Additional ablation studies on the contributions of the loss function are warranted.
5. The primary contributions are not sufficiently benchmarked against competing approaches, particularly regarding total correlation and diffusion modeling.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity on whether the behavior video generation is trained alongside the disentangled subspace learning. Additionally, incorporating visualizations of the learned latent space would be beneficial. We suggest conducting further ablation studies to analyze the contributions of the loss function and the TC penalty term. To strengthen the paper, we encourage the authors to benchmark their model against existing methods, such as pi-VAE, and emphasize how the diffusion methodology addresses challenges that previous methods may not resolve. Finally, we advise the authors to focus on the model advancements and their general applicability across datasets rather than emphasizing the dataset itself as a major contribution.
