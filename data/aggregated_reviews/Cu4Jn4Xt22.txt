### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to cross-domain code vulnerability detection, addressing the challenges of negative transfer and excessive alignment through the proposed MNCRI framework. The authors introduce a mutual nearest neighbor contrastive learning paradigm and an instance re-weighting scheme to enhance domain alignment. Experimental results on three open-source software project datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements over baseline methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized and clearly written, tackling a relevant problem in code vulnerability detection.
- The identification of negative transfer and excessive alignment provides an intriguing perspective.
- Extensive experimental evaluations show that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the proposed method is limited, as it combines existing techniques like contrastive learning and MMD, with the instance re-weighting scheme being a minor modification.
- There is a lack of detailed descriptions regarding the implementation of nearest neighbor instance selection and the memory bank.
- The comparison of results with baseline methods raises concerns about fairness, as they were not evaluated under the same experimental conditions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the novelty of the proposed method, particularly regarding the contrastive learning and instance re-weighting modules. Additionally, please provide detailed descriptions of the implementation of nearest neighbor instance selection and the memory bank. We also suggest addressing the sensitivity of the hyperparameters \(\lambda\) and \(\mu\) and conducting an ablation experiment to assess the impact of excluding the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss on statistical domain alignment. Finally, consider incorporating PLM-based techniques alongside traditional domain adaptation methods to strengthen the validation of the proposed methodology.
