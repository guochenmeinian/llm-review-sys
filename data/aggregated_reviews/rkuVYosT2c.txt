### Key Points
This paper presents new techniques for distributed least squares regression using matrix sketching. The authors propose a sparse sketching method that produces a nearly-unbiased least squares estimator in two passes over the data, achieving optimal space and current matrix multiplication time. Additionally, they improve communication-efficient distributed averaging algorithms for least squares and related tasks, and provide a novel bias analysis for sketched least squares, characterizing its dependence on sketch sparsity. The theoretical results are supported by experiments on real datasets demonstrating practical benefits.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper provides a sparse sketching method that achieves near-unbiased least squares estimation in optimal space and current matrix multiplication time.  
- It achieves O(d^2 log(nd)) bits of space, which is optimal, and matches current matrix multiplication time O(d^Ï‰), improving over previous approaches.  
- The introduction of a new bias analysis for sketched least squares sharply characterizes dependence on sketch sparsity, with techniques that may be applicable to other sketching and randomized linear algebra problems.  

Weaknesses:  
- Experiments are conducted on only a few datasets and do not explore a wide range of problem sizes or distributed computing scenarios.  
- The focus is primarily on least squares regression, with limited discussion of extensions to other problems.  
- Some theoretical results rely on assumptions (e.g., about leverage score approximation) that may not always hold in practice.  
- The result and techniques appear niche and incremental, with a nonstandard computational model that may restrict applicability.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related work, particularly regarding distributed least squares and debiasing approaches. Including references that prove results in the current computational model would enhance the paper's context. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments with other sketching methods to empirically justify statements on bias, variance, and computational time. Clarifying the definitions of bias and variance earlier in the paper would also aid reader comprehension. Finally, addressing minor typos and ensuring consistency in notation for concentration inequalities would improve the overall presentation.
