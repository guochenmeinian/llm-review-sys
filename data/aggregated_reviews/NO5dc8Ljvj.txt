### Key Points
This paper presents the Chinese Cognitive Distortion Dataset (C2D2), comprising 7,500 examples with paired scenes, thoughts, and cognitive distortion labels. The authors explore the association between cognitive distortions and mental disorders on social media, aiming to enhance mental disorder detection models by incorporating cognitive distortions. The dataset is publicly accessible and verified by experts, providing a valuable resource for mental health research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The C2D2 dataset is a significant contribution to the mental health field, addressing the scarcity of publicly available datasets in Chinese.
- The dataset construction process is rigorous, involving volunteer recruitment and expert verification, which enhances its quality.
- The experiments demonstrate the potential for future research in NLP applications for mental health.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for not annotating the dataset in English is flawed; English annotations could broaden applicability.
- There is no evaluation of human expert performance on the dataset, raising concerns about its generalizability.
- The dataset may reflect researcher biases due to the method of collecting distorted thoughts from volunteers rather than actual patients.
- The paper lacks clarity on certain details, such as the meaning of "ppopularity" and the rationale behind the method of extracting posts with cognitive distortions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset by considering English annotations to enhance its applicability. Additionally, the authors should evaluate human expert performance on the dataset to address concerns about its generalizability. Clarifying the meaning of "ppopularity" and discussing the potential biases in volunteer-generated data would strengthen the paper. We also suggest that the authors explore the possibility of treating the problem as a multi-label task when multiple cognitive distortions occur simultaneously. Finally, including a reiteration of the cognitive distortion detection experiment on the English version of the data could provide valuable insights.
