Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the statistical limits of adaptive linear models, specifically focusing on the concept of $(k,d)$-adaptivity. The authors prove that for a $(k,d)$-adaptive model with failure probability $\delta$, the estimation error of adaptive components is bounded by $k\log(n/\delta)$ when the non-adaptive component has zero mean (Theorem 3.1), and similar results hold when the mean is not zero (Theorem 3.2). Additionally, they introduce the Two-stage Adaptive Linear Estimating Equation (TALE) estimator, which exhibits asymptotic normality (Theorem 3.4). The experiments reveal that the TALE estimator aligns well with the normal distribution.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is clearly structured and well-written, making it relatively easy to follow.
- The proposed TALE estimator has desirable theoretical properties and shows promising numerical results.
- The work addresses an important problem in adaptive data collection, providing a novel scheme with reasonable guarantees.

Weaknesses:
- There are concerns regarding the technical soundness of the paper, particularly the justification of proof techniques for Theorems 3.1 and 3.2, which may be basic extensions of prior works.
- The assumption that the non-adaptive component is independent of the adaptive component may be overly strong.
- The definition of $(k,d)$-adaptivity may be limited, as it assumes a fixed number of adaptively collected entries, ignoring scenarios where this may vary.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definition of $(k,d)$-adaptivity, potentially using "dependency" instead of "adaptivity" to enhance understanding. Additionally, the authors should justify how the proof techniques for Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 differ from prior works and elaborate on the challenges of extending results for general $(k,d)$-adaptivity. It would also be beneficial to include numerical verifications for Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 and to compare the TALE estimator against state-of-the-art statistical tools in the numerical section. Finally, addressing the independence assumption between adaptive and non-adaptive components in the discussion would strengthen the paper.
