Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an ante-hoc "reflective perspective" on ethical considerations for the curation of human-centric computer vision (HCCV) datasets. The authors argue that their approach differs from existing frameworks, which are often post hoc and lack persuasive justification. They conduct a thorough examination of ethical considerations in HCCV dataset curation, identifying deficiencies in current practices and suggesting actionable recommendations for ethical data collection. The authors review a substantial body of literature, synthesizing 331 sources across three themes: Purpose, Consent and Privacy, and Diversity, while providing ameliorative recommendations for each. They include an Appendix detailing their literature review process and a checklist to facilitate ethical discussions among data collection teams. The authors also acknowledge limitations in their approach, particularly regarding the challenges of obtaining consent and the economic implications of scaling their recommendations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is commendably thorough and well-presented, enhancing its credibility through a comprehensive literature review. The inclusion of a checklist for ethical considerations in Appendix A is a strong and useful enhancement. The authors effectively highlight the importance of ethical considerations, such as privacy and bias, and provide recommendations guided by legal frameworks like GDPR. Their diverse backgrounds further contribute to the paper's relevance.

Weaknesses:  
The engagement with the Beauchamp & Childress principles is superficial, lacking detailed justification and contextualization. The authors' initial assumption that bypassing Institutional Review Board (IRB) supervision is the norm may misrepresent the landscape of data governance. Additionally, some recommendations may not be practical or feasible, and the claim of being "principlism-guided" was not sufficiently engaged with, raising concerns about its relevance and application. The paper also lacks case studies to evaluate the applicability of the proposed suggestions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the depth of their engagement with the Beauchamp & Childress principles, providing detailed justification for their relevance to each ethical issue discussed. It would be beneficial to clarify the complexities of IRB processes and the human rights failures associated with HCCV, emphasizing the necessity of human subjects review. Including case studies or evaluations of the proposed recommendations would demonstrate their practical feasibility. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors acknowledge the potential costs and challenges of implementing their recommendations, helping researchers transition from current practices to more ethical methods. Lastly, we encourage the authors to ensure that their use of the term "principlism-guided" is adequately contextualized within their literature review and to emphasize the proactive nature of their recommendations, clarifying that while some can be applied retroactively, they are most effective when integrated into the data collection process from the outset.
