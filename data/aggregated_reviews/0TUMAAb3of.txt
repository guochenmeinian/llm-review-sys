Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an algorithm for optimal allocation in a multi-arm bandit problem involving queues, ensuring system stability while achieving sub-linear regret. The authors propose a framework for multi-class multi-server asymmetric queueing systems, utilizing feature-based Multinomial Logit functions to model service rates. The proposed UCB and Thompson Sampling algorithms stabilize queues and learn service rates, demonstrating performance through experimental results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The algorithm effectively combines max-weight and UCB (or TS) to ensure stability and no-regret in a multi-arm bandit context involving queues.
- The introduction of feature-based multinomial logit functions for service rates and preference feedback is novel and practical.
- The proposed algorithms achieve stability with average queue length bounds and sublinear regret, outperforming previous methods.

Weaknesses:
- Notation confusions arise from the use of terms like $\mu_{n,k} (S| \theta)$, making technical parts difficult to understand.
- The empirical evaluation is limited to synthetic data and specific settings (N=KL), lacking broader experimental contexts.
- The algorithms require solving NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, which may be impractical for large-scale applications.
- The stability assumption relies on a predefined allocation $\mu$, which should not depend on scheduler decisions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of notation and definitions, particularly regarding $\mu_{n,k} (S| \theta)$ and the norm $|| . ||_{V_{k,y}^{-1}}$. Additionally, we suggest expanding the empirical evaluation to include scenarios where N<KL and providing comparisons with a wider range of relevant algorithms. Clarifying the relationship between $Q_{max}$ and system parameters N, K, and $\epsilon$ would enhance the understanding of regret performance. Finally, deriving problem-specific lower bounds on regret would provide insights into the optimality of the proposed algorithms.
