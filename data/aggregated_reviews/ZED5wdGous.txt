Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for enhancing patient perceptions using visual prostheses through a combination of a deep learning encoding model and patient-specific parameter tuning via preferential Bayesian optimization (PBO). The authors demonstrate the method's efficacy using simulated data and patient choices, addressing personalized stimulus optimization in visual neuroprostheses. The proposed approach consists of a two-stage process: first, learning a Deep Stimulus Encoder (DSE) to optimize stimuli, followed by embedding the DSE in a sample-efficient PBO strategy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Originality: The work innovatively combines deep learning with Bayesian optimization, modifying existing models to improve performance.
- Quality: The research is well-sourced, with thorough benchmarking and well-documented code.
- Clarity: The writing is structured and generally easy to follow, effectively demonstrating the significance of patient-specific tuning.

Weaknesses:
- Reliance on simulated data raises concerns about the generalizability of findings, as the parameters used may not reflect real-world variability.
- The feasibility of the proposed method for actual patients is questionable, particularly regarding the practicality of the human-in-the-loop process.
- Limited novelty, as the approach primarily applies existing techniques rather than introducing new methodologies.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the grounding of their simulated data by incorporating experimentally collected datasets to enhance realism. Clarifying the update mechanism for the encoder parameters and providing ablation studies would strengthen the contribution. Additionally, addressing the feasibility of the human-in-the-loop process in real-world settings and exploring the application of their method to natural images, including color, would enhance the paper's impact. Finally, we suggest including comparisons with relevant literature and addressing minor typographical errors to improve overall clarity and presentation.
