Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an inductive knowledge graph completion (KGC) method that integrates both textual and structural information through a two-stage framework called Learning from Structural and Textual Knowledge (LSTK). The first stage extracts soft triples with confidence scores from a text corpus, while the second stage utilizes these soft triples alongside existing hard triples to learn a rule-based model for KGC. The authors introduce text-enhanced rules (TE-rules) to filter low-confidence rules, and experimental results indicate that LSTK significantly outperforms baseline methods across three constructed datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of textual and structural knowledge in KGC is innovative and addresses limitations of existing methods.
- The introduction of TE-rules effectively mitigates noise from soft triples, enhancing rule learning.
- The creation of three new datasets contributes valuable resources for empirical evaluation.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion of related works that also utilize structural and textual knowledge, such as KEPLER and BERTRL.
- The reliance on a single method for estimating confidence scores may limit generalizability.
- The two-stage pipeline could introduce unnecessary cascaded errors, and the relationship between the two stages is not clearly articulated.
- Notations, particularly the use of "t" for both tail entities and rule lengths, may cause confusion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related works in the field of inductive link prediction, specifically addressing models like KEPLER and BERTRL. Additionally, clarifying the motivations behind the two-stage framework and its potential limitations would strengthen the paper. We suggest providing statistics on unseen entities in both original and soft triples to enhance understanding of the method's applicability. Furthermore, addressing the scalability of the proposed framework and its performance on established benchmarks would be beneficial. Lastly, we advise revising the notation for clarity to avoid confusion regarding the symbol "t."
