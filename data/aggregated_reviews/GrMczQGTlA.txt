Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to humanoid locomotion by utilizing next-token prediction as a learning objective and formulating it as a joint distribution learning problem. The authors train a causal transformer on diverse data sources, including motion capture data, videos, RL controllers, and MPC controllers, allowing for effective training even with noisy or missing data. They demonstrate that their model achieves lower tracking errors with unlabeled data and successfully deploys on a Digit humanoid robot, showcasing robust locomotion in various real-world environments. The authors also acknowledge the potential for incorporating a more detailed autoregressive model for robotics in future revisions and discuss the challenges of balancing model size and inference speed, particularly in real-time applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of the next-token-prediction framework for humanoid robots is both simple and intriguing.
2. The integration of multiple data sources, such as RL controllers and Internet videos, is innovative.
3. The real-world experiments are compelling, highlighting the framework's potential in practical robot learning.
4. The paper effectively addresses humanoid locomotion using AI methods, demonstrating real-world applicability.
5. The authors' commitment to open-sourcing their work is commendable and could significantly advance the field.

Weaknesses:
1. The correlation between prediction error and tracking error raises questions about the data requirements for establishing this relationship, given the complexities of real-world scenarios.
2. The lack of open-sourcing the code limits the broader community's ability to benefit from the engineering insights behind the framework.
3. Some experiments lack detail, such as the number of trials for Figure 5 and the absence of comparisons with existing MPC methods.
4. The paper does not adequately address the control frequency or deployment specifics for the robot, nor does it provide sufficient ablation studies on the data sources used.
5. The scenarios considered are relatively simple, limiting the complexity of the challenges addressed.
6. The paper introduces few new techniques, primarily relying on established methods in the Next Token Prediction paradigm.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comprehensiveness of their experiments by providing more details on trial counts and comparisons with MPC methods. Additionally, conducting further ablation studies on the impact of different data sources would strengthen the findings. Clarifying the control frequency and deployment logistics in the paper is essential. We also suggest that the authors consider open-sourcing their code and datasets to enhance reproducibility and community engagement. Furthermore, we recommend improving the discussion on the minimum required frequency for functioning and its relation to model size. Expanding the “Transformers for Robotics” section to include a more detailed autoregressive model would better reflect the contributions of this paper. Lastly, addressing the limitations regarding the simplicity of the scenarios and the potential complexities involved in robotic manipulation tasks would provide a clearer understanding of the model's practical applications.
