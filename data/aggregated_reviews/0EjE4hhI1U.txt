### Key Points
This paper presents an active learning framework aimed at reducing uncertainty in key outcome statistics within experimental settings characterized by noisy data. The authors propose a novel approach that targets outcome uncertainty rather than overall measurement uncertainty, challenging conventional assumptions in active learning. The framework is illustrated through its application in rotational spectroscopy, highlighting its potential to enhance chemical characterization tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents ideas clearly, with no typographical errors noted.
- It offers a novel perspective by focusing on minimizing outcome uncertainty, which is more relevant in many experimental contexts.
- The practical application demonstrated in rotational spectroscopy adds significant value to the research.

Weaknesses:
- The computational complexity of the method is not adequately discussed, raising concerns about its feasibility for real-time or large-scale applications.
- The practical value of the approach is unclear, particularly regarding whether the bottleneck lies in data collection or model training, necessitating further discussion and clarification.
- The approach appears to require tailored workflows for different tasks and data types, limiting its broader applicability.
- The paper lacks theoretical bounds or guarantees on the method's performance, particularly in simpler settings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the computational requirements and scalability of their method to address potential concerns for real-time applications. Additionally, clarifying the practical value of the approach by discussing the benefits compared to traditional model training methods would enhance the paper. Including loss function curves from the pre-trained model alongside those from the active learning process would provide valuable insights. To increase applicability, we suggest developing a more generic workflow that is agnostic to specific tasks and data types. Finally, we encourage the authors to consider incorporating theoretical bounds or guarantees on their method's performance in simpler models, such as linear regression.
