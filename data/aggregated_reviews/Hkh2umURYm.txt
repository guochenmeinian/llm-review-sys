### Key Points
This paper presents an interactive personalized visualization recommendation system (PVisRec) utilizing the Hier-SUCB algorithm, which addresses the limitations of non-interactive systems by incorporating real-time user feedback. The authors justify the problem's relevance and provide a theoretical framework, including regret bounds for the contextual combinatorial semi-bandit approach. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of Hier-SUCB, showing superior performance in cumulative reward, regret minimization, and hit rate across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The hierarchical structure and learnable bias term effectively model the interaction between data attributes and visualization configurations.
- Improved regret bounds and robust theoretical analysis enhance confidence in the algorithm's applicability.
- The paper rigorously benchmarks Hier-SUCB against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The computational efficiency of Hier-SUCB in larger datasets or complex visualization scenarios is not fully explored.
- The findings from the Plot.ly dataset may not generalize to other datasets with different visualization needs.
- The rationale behind the algorithm's decision-making is not extensively discussed, potentially hindering broader adoption.
- Grammar issues and typos are present, though they do not significantly impact comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the gap between the empirical study and real-world applications, particularly regarding time complexity and factors affecting time cost/delay. Additionally, providing more evidence or use cases to showcase Hier-SUCB's generalizability across different domains would strengthen the paper. The authors should also explore the algorithm's performance with varying numbers of configurations and larger action spaces. Lastly, including error bars in figures to illustrate variability in results would enhance the clarity of the findings.
