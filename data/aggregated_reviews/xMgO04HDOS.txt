Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a two-level hierarchical algorithm for discovering both team and individual skills in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), termed Hierarchical Multi-Agent Skill Discovery (HMASD). The authors formulate multi-agent skill discovery as an inference problem within a probabilistic graphical model, utilizing variational inference for skill discovery over joint and individual policies. The empirical results indicate that HMASD outperforms established baselines on sparse reward benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized and articulates the formalism clearly, enhancing understanding of the methods.
- The empirical evaluation is robust, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in discovering useful skills.
- The extension of unsupervised skill discovery from single-agent to multi-agent settings is a significant contribution.

Weaknesses:
- The algorithm's complexity may hinder practical applications due to the requirement for global state inputs and the rigidity of multi-agent options.
- The framework introduces many hyperparameters, necessitating extensive tuning, which could lead to instability during training.
- Important baselines are missing from the experiments, and the paper lacks a discussion on limitations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding the complexity of high-level policies and how they address this issue compared to existing works. Additionally, a comprehensive review of related multi-agent option discovery literature should be included to highlight novel contributions. The authors should explicitly discuss the limitations of their method, particularly regarding hyperparameter sensitivity and the potential instability during training. Furthermore, we suggest including exploration bonus baselines to substantiate the improvements observed, and providing visualizations of learned skills to enhance the empirical analysis. Lastly, the notation should be simplified to avoid confusion, and the number of team and individual skills should be clearly stated in the main text.
