### Key Points
This paper presents an approach to data-driven algorithm design by utilizing neural networks to select the most suitable algorithm for specific computational problems. The authors propose extending the paradigm from selecting a single best algorithm to a context-specific selection, introducing neural networks as a novel parameterized family of mappings. The study focuses on the sample complexity of learning neural network weights for branch-and-cut trees in mixed-integer programming, aiming to optimize expected performance scores based on i.i.d. samples.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The methodology of mapping problem instances to suitable algorithms using neural networks is well-articulated, with rigorous sample complexity bounds providing a strong theoretical foundation.  
- The paper is well-written, effectively motivating the research context and presenting technical aspects clearly.  
- The theoretical improvements are experimentally verified on a synthetic dataset, demonstrating the practical applicability of the proposed approach.  

Weaknesses:  
- Training neural networks can be computationally intensive, which may limit scalability.  
- The inference time for selecting optimal parameters could exceed that of traditional methods.  
- The application to branch-and-cut trees is somewhat limiting, and the theoretical bounds are asymptotic, likely lacking effective constants.  
- The practical interpretation of sample complexity bounds for large-scale problems remains unclear, and the empirical contributions are minimal, primarily relegated to the appendix.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the practical interpretation of the established bounds, particularly in relation to the state of practice for branch-and-cut methods. Additionally, the authors should explore generalization to other algorithmic problems beyond mixed-integer optimization. Clarifying the implications of theoretical guarantees on practical performance and addressing the computational overhead of training and inference times would enhance the paper's impact. Finally, ensuring consistent terminology regarding branch-and-cut versus branch-and-bound trees would improve clarity.
