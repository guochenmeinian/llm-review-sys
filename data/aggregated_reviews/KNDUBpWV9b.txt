Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents KOALA, a pair of efficient text-to-image synthesis models that reduce computational and memory requirements compared to the base model. The authors propose three key innovations: knowledge distillation into a compact U-Net, the strategic use of high-resolution images and detailed captions in training data, and the employment of step-distilled teachers. The resulting models, KOALA-Turbo and KOALA-Lightning, demonstrate faster inference times and the ability to generate high-quality images on consumer-grade GPUs. Additionally, the paper provides empirical guidelines for distilling Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) when resources are limited, focusing on transformer block selection, feature distillation, and optimal datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper offers a practical solution for generating high-quality images with reduced computational requirements.
2. It presents empirical findings to justify design considerations and conducts extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments, providing good insights into distillation aspects.

Weaknesses:
1. The presentation is verbose and repetitive, lacking precision and important details, making it less approachable.
2. The extent of degradation in text rendering is unclear, as KOALA has not been compared with a baseline for text rendering capabilities.
3. The proposed method is specific to the SDXL U-Net and lacks generalizability, resembling a technical report rather than an academic paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization and conciseness of the paper, potentially reducing its length by eliminating redundancy. Specifically, we suggest that the authors provide a short, precise explanation of how the proposed distillation loss works and clarify the terminology around "block removal" and "layer-wise removal" to avoid confusion. Additionally, we encourage the authors to compare KOALA with training-free methods and baseline models regarding text rendering capabilities. Lastly, including a clear definition of the KOALA acronym in the introduction would enhance clarity.
