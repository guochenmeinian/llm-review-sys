### Key Points
This paper presents an autoregressive retrieval method aimed at diversifying the reply set for smart reply systems. The authors propose a text-to-text retrieval model that learns from a dataset of (message, reply set) pairs generated through bootstrapping. Experimental results indicate improvements in both relevance and diversity across three datasets, with the method outperforming baselines. The main contributions include the autoregressive retrieval approach and the bootstrapping framework for data generation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method distinguishes itself from previous models by utilizing an autoregressive approach that operates end-to-end, demonstrating competitive run-time efficiency.
- The bootstrapping data construction method yields high-quality pairs, enhancing the performance of the smart reply task.
- Extensive experiments provide insights into the performance comparison with state-of-the-art methods and the impact of various components.

Weaknesses:
- Conditioning replies on previous replies may increase inference latency.
- The lack of subjective evaluation limits the accuracy of model comparisons, as the absolute ROUGE values are small.
- The re-implementation of baselines by the authors may introduce unfairness in comparisons.
- Some symbols in Algorithm 1 are confusing, and the calculation of ROUGE for multiple replies lacks clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of symbols in Algorithm 1 and provide a detailed explanation of how Y_N and Y_M are utilized to select the final K replies. Additionally, we suggest including a subjective human judgment evaluation of relevance and diversity to complement the objective metrics. Clarifying the discrepancies in SimSR results and the methodology for calculating ROUGE for multiple replies would also enhance the paper's rigor.
