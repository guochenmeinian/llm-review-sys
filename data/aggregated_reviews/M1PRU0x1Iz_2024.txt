Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents FedAvP, a novel algorithm for data augmentation in federated learning (FL) that shares augmentation policies among clients without revealing client data. The authors propose a meta-learning method and a Federated Meta-Policy Loss (FMPL) to optimize these policies while minimizing privacy leakage and communication costs. Extensive experiments validate the method's effectiveness across various data heterogeneity scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The algorithm is innovative, applying automatic data augmentation using policy loss to address data heterogeneity in FL.  
2. Theoretical proof and comprehensive experiments demonstrate the method's effectiveness and privacy protection.  
3. The paper is logically coherent and well-organized, providing clear problem descriptions and solutions.  
4. Empirical evidence supports the method's efficacy in enhancing model performance while avoiding privacy leakage.

Weaknesses:  
1. The augmentation policy search is limited to image data and only two types of augmentation methods, raising concerns about scalability.  
2. The paper lacks comparisons with the latest federated data augmentation methods and includes few non-IID scenarios in performance experiments.  
3. The writing needs improvement for clarity, and deeper analysis is required to explain why different $\alpha$ values yield varying augmentation methods.  
4. The choice of baselines for comparison is inadequate, as classic methods for addressing non-IID, such as FedNova and Scaffold, are not included.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors conduct more comprehensive experiments on non-IID settings, particularly those involving quantity-based label skew, to further support the algorithm's effectiveness. Additionally, we suggest improving the clarity of the writing and providing a deeper analysis of the impact of different augmentation strategies on performance. The authors should also include comparisons with state-of-the-art federated data augmentation methods and provide more intuitive explanations regarding the shared policy's role in alleviating non-IID issues. Finally, an analysis of the scalability of FedAvP as the number of augmentation methods increases would be beneficial.
