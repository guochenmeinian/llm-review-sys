Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a fast estimation algorithm for the Chamfer distance between two point sets, achieving a near-linear time complexity of \(O(nd \log(n)/\epsilon^2)\) with a \((1 + \epsilon)\)-approximation. The authors utilize random sampling and importance sampling to enhance approximation performance, proposing a distribution \(D_a\) that bounds the distance to the closest point in the second set. The algorithm is validated through experiments, demonstrating improved efficiency over traditional methods, including KD-tree implementations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The stochastic approximation of Chamfer distance is novel.
- The design of the importance sampling proposal is compelling.
- The algorithm achieves faster approximation than conventional methods.
- The paper is well-written and coherent, with solid experimental validation.

Weaknesses:
- The algorithm is limited to specific ground metrics that satisfy certain conditions.
- There is a lack of comparison with real applications, such as point-cloud reconstruction tasks.
- The gradient of Chamfer distance concerning input sets is not addressed, which is crucial for deep learning applications.
- Some notations and concepts, like Locality Sensitive Hashing, require clearer definitions in the main text.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including a comparison of the proposed approximation with conventional Chamfer distance in practical applications, such as point-cloud reconstruction. Additionally, the authors should investigate the approximation error of the gradient of Chamfer distance, as this is essential for its use in deep learning. Clarifying the definition of Locality Sensitive Hashing and providing examples of distance metrics beyond \(\ell_1\) and \(\ell_2\) would enhance readability. Lastly, addressing the relationship between Chamfer distance and Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) in the context of existing literature would strengthen the paper's relevance.
