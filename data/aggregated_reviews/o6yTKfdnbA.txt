Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Recursion in Recursion (RIR) framework and the RIR-EBT-GRC method for long-range sequence modeling, which combines the efficiency of Binary Balanced Tree Recursive Neural Networks (BB-Tree RvNNs) with the computational power of more complex tree RNNs. The authors aim to achieve O(k*log_k(N)) time complexity, demonstrating competitive performance on tasks like ListOps and Long Range Arena (LRA). They argue that RIR-EBT-GRC significantly reduces training time and memory usage compared to existing methods, achieving a 35x speed-up and a 25x memory reduction in specific settings, along with substantial accuracy improvements over MEGA in various tasks. However, concerns remain regarding the method's complexity and its significance relative to existing approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and provides a thorough explanation of the method and related work.
- The authors effectively address reviewer concerns, demonstrating the method's soundness and improvements over prior works.
- The experiments are comprehensive, comparing the proposed method against a large suite of baselines.
- RIR demonstrates significant efficiency in handling long sequences, maintaining competitive performance on symbolic processing tasks.
- RIR-EBT-GRC shows impressive performance metrics, including substantial speed and memory efficiency gains.
- The method's ability to generalize from shorter training data is a notable advantage.

Weaknesses:
- The method's complexity, involving two levels of recursion and necessary modifiers, may hinder general applicability.
- The complexity of RIR-EBT-GRC is perceived as high for relatively modest gains, raising questions about its practicality.
- The presentation of results, particularly in tables, is difficult to interpret; scatter plots illustrating performance trade-offs would enhance clarity.
- The method is slower than some existing models, which may limit its appeal in certain applications.
- The paper lacks sufficient discussion on the significance of its contributions to broader tasks and real-world data distributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their results by including scatter plots that illustrate the trade-offs between efficiency and performance. Additionally, we suggest providing a more in-depth discussion on the implications of their contributions for larger tasks and realistic data distributions. The authors should also consider simplifying the method or providing clearer explanations and figures to aid understanding, particularly regarding the beam alignment section and the choice of the hyperparameter k. Furthermore, we recommend improving the clarity around the complexity of RIR-EBT-GRC by providing objective measures such as Lines of Code or Time/Space complexity comparisons with other methods. Finally, integrating discussions from the supplementary material into the main text could enhance the paper's comprehensiveness and addressing the limitations of the model's generalization capabilities and its performance on a wider range of tasks would strengthen the paper.
