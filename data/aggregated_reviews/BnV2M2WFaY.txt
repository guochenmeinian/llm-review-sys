Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on linear bandit problems with adaptive noise sequences, proposing two algorithms: LinVDTS and LinNATS. LinVDTS utilizes a weighted RLS estimator to achieve a noise-dependent regret bound of $O(d^{\frac{3}{2}} \sqrt{T})$, while LinNATS addresses unknown heteroscedastic noise with a multi-layer uncertainty structure, achieving similar regret bounds. The authors claim these contributions improve upon existing regret bounds in the literature, particularly in terms of noise adaptivity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well-organized and clearly presented, with technically sound proofs. It provides comprehensive theoretical guarantees for noise-adaptive linear bandit problems, and the clarity of the exposition aids in understanding the algorithmic design.

Weaknesses:  
The significance of the contributions is questionable, as the RLS estimator and proof techniques are standard in Linear Thompson Sampling (LinTS) literature. The only novel aspect of LinVDTS is the weighted RLS estimator, which is also common in existing works. The claim that the authors improve upon the existing $\mathcal{O}(d^{\frac{3}{2}}\sqrt{T})$ regret bound is disputed, as the bound remains the same when variances are fixed. Additionally, the Bayesian regret presented is $\mathcal{O}(d^{\frac{3}{2}}\sqrt{T}+\delta T)$, which is inferior to the known best $\mathcal{O}(d\sqrt{T})$.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the significance and contributions of their work, particularly clarifying how their results advance the field. Additionally, the authors should address why they fail to achieve the optimal Bayesian bound. Incorporating numerical simulations would also enhance the empirical validation of the proposed algorithms, demonstrating their adaptability to varying noise levels. Lastly, we suggest providing clearer explanations of the stratification process and the rationale behind the choice of estimators to improve readability.
