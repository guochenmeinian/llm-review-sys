Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for reward-directed conditional generation using diffusion models in a semi-supervised learning framework. The authors propose learning a reward function from a small labeled dataset, which is then used to label the larger unlabeled dataset with pseudo labels. The paper aims to address how to balance the reward signal and distribution shift to achieve high-quality samples. The authors provide theoretical insights into the behavior of reward-conditioned diffusion models and support their claims with experimental results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-organized and clearly written, facilitating reader comprehension.
2. The theoretical exploration of reward-conditioned distributions and the trade-off between reward maximization and sample quality is valuable.
3. The analysis is thorough, and the experimental results align with the theoretical findings.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks comparisons with similar models, such as classifier-guided diffusion models.
2. The assumptions made in the theoretical analysis are overly simplified and may not hold in general.
3. The experimental setup is limited, and the metrics do not adequately cover the theoretical claims.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including a comparison with classifier-guided diffusion models to contextualize their contributions. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the assumptions made in the theoretical analysis, particularly regarding the linear transformations and reward models, as these may be too strong. It would also be beneficial to enhance the experimental section to better support the theoretical claims, possibly by including a summary of related work and addressing the generalizability of results. Furthermore, adding legends to figures, particularly Figure 2, and ensuring consistent notation in Figure 1 would enhance clarity.
