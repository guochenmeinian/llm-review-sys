### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative framework for analyzing personalization in social media feeds, specifically focusing on TikTok. The authors propose metrics to measure the degree of personalization by comparing user engagement with recommended items over time. The framework aims to serve as an auditing tool, especially relevant in light of the European Digital Services Act. The study demonstrates significant findings regarding the balance of exploitation versus exploration in TikTok's recommendations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The topic of algorithm auditing is highly relevant, particularly following new regulations.
- The framework is applied to a real dataset of TikTok users who consented to data donation.
- The methodology is clear, and the findings contribute meaningfully to the field.
- The paper addresses ethical considerations and acknowledges its limitations.

Weaknesses:
- The focus is limited to TikTok, using a small dataset, which may weaken the findings' generalizability.
- The framework does not account for critical aspects such as gender or race biases in algorithmic auditing.
- The definitions of exploration and exploitation lack theoretical backing and clarity.
- There is no code provided, hindering reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the study by extending the analysis to include other platforms like Instagram and YouTube Shorts for a broader comparison. Additionally, incorporating related work on algorithm auditing frameworks would strengthen the paper. The authors should also submit the code for their framework to enhance reproducibility. Furthermore, we suggest integrating qualitative research methods, such as user interviews, to better understand user perceptions of personalization. Clarifying the labeling process for exploration and exploitation, as well as providing justifications for design choices and parameter settings, would also enhance the paper's rigor. Finally, a deeper discussion on the ethical implications of the findings, particularly regarding the impact of non-personalized recommendations, would be valuable.
