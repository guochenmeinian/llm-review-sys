Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for reconstructing 3D clothed human models from single images by utilizing attention mechanisms to create tri-plane features, addressing the limitations of existing methods that primarily rely on 2D image features. The authors propose a new feature query strategy that integrates spatial and manifold queries. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method surpasses existing baselines, demonstrating robustness in challenging poses and loose clothing.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method explicitly considers the yz-plane and xz-plane in addition to the xy-plane, providing valuable insights for future research.
- The experiments are well-structured, showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods and effectively validating the proposed components.

Weaknesses:
- There are inconsistent reconstruction results, with some figures showing coarse details and discrepancies in performance compared to existing methods.
- The complexity of the proposed architecture, which includes multiple networks, raises concerns about potential overfitting and the lack of discussion regarding method complexity.
- The learnable embeddings appear to be fixed across different inputs, which may not be suitable for varying side views.
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion on the limitations of the SMPL prior and its impact on reconstruction accuracy, especially for challenging poses.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the consistency of the reconstruction results by providing more comprehensive qualitative ablation studies, particularly for complex poses. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion on the complexity of the proposed method and its implications for overfitting. The authors should clarify the role of learnable embeddings and consider visualizing them to enhance understanding. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to address the limitations of the SMPL prior in the context of inaccurate estimations and its effects on reconstruction quality. Lastly, providing inference time statistics would offer a more comprehensive comparison with existing methods.
