### Key Points
This paper presents BioT5, a T5-based model that integrates knowledge from chemical and protein textual representations, scientific literature, and domain databases. The authors claim that BioT5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various tasks and datasets through a multi-task pre-training framework and a prompt-based fine-tuning strategy. The model utilizes SELFIES for molecules, FASTA for proteins, and text tokens for unstructured literature, demonstrating competitive performance compared to existing baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- BioT5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on most tasks and datasets.
- The methodology is well-documented, with clear descriptions of the model rationale and pre-training settings.
- The use of separate tokenization and embedding methods is effective.
- The introduction and related works sections are well-written, providing a solid foundation for the study.

Weaknesses:
- The lack of an ablation study limits understanding of the performance gains.
- The justification for prompt-based fine-tuning is insufficiently addressed.
- Clarity is needed regarding the source of result improvements from SELFIES, FASTA, or general text representations.
- The novelty of the components used in the workflow is questioned.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by conducting an ablation study to clarify which aspects contribute to performance gains. Additionally, providing a more robust justification for the choice of prompt-based fine-tuning over other methods would strengthen the argument. The authors should also include error analysis to better understand the model's limitations and provide more details on how baseline results are computed. Finally, addressing the novelty of the components used in the workflow would enhance the paper's contribution to the field.
