Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a recurrent neural network (RNN) that learns to mimic a Bayesian non-parametric (BNP) approach to classification with potentially heavy-tailed data and an unknown number of classes. The authors propose an amortized inference method for Bayesian nonparametric models, specifically through a Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM), and evaluate their approach on synthetic and image classification tasks. The method aims to combine the strengths of BNP models and deep learning, demonstrating comparable or superior performance to particle filter methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and motivated, providing a clever integration of BNP with RNNs.  
- The empirical analysis is thorough, with experiments on both synthetic and challenging image-based datasets, showcasing the method's robustness and efficiency.  
- The use of amortized inference in this context is novel, linking it to recent trends in Likelihood Free Inference (LFI) methods.  
- The authors provide code to support reproducibility.

Weaknesses:  
- The experimental evaluation is limited, primarily relying on a single random seed for each method, which undermines the robustness of the results.  
- The choice of baselines is inadequate, with comparisons primarily to outdated methods and lacking consideration of other standard baselines for open-set classification.  
- The experiments utilize a small RNN architecture without exploring the impact of different architectures or hyperparameters.  
- The paper does not fully address the inference capabilities of Bayesian nonparametric methods, focusing mainly on classification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental evaluation by using multiple random seeds to provide a clearer indication of uncertainty and robustness in results. Additionally, we suggest including a broader range of baseline comparisons, particularly with finite parametric mixture models and other contemporary methods in open-set classification. The authors should also explore the effects of different RNN architectures and hyperparameters on performance. Finally, we encourage a more thorough discussion of the inference aspects of their method to better align with the principles of Bayesian nonparametric approaches.
