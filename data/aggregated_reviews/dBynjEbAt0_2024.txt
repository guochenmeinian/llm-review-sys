Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Bayesian approach to estimating functional data, specifically focusing on time-series represented as functions. The authors aim to disentangle fixed effects and noise variations while incorporating a norm-preserving warping function. The methodology is evaluated through simulations and real data examples, demonstrating its potential in functional data analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively introduces various temporal warping models, providing insightful mathematical and visual explanations.
- Historical context is well-established through examples from 2D shape analysis, enhancing the motivation for the proposed models.
- The implementation strategies for infinite-dimensional computations using basis functions like B-splines are commendable.

Weaknesses:
- Comparisons are limited to the warpMiX implementation, using default parameters without addressing the disparity in noise variance assumptions between models.
- The paper lacks a thorough comparison with existing literature on similar models, particularly those by Kurtek and Srivastava.
- Evaluation relies heavily on visual assessments, lacking quantifiable metrics from downstream tasks, raising questions about the practical utility of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with warpMiX by addressing the noise variance discrepancies and exploring more datasets for evaluation. Additionally, a more detailed comparison with existing literature on similar models should be included to strengthen the contribution. To enhance the evaluation, we suggest incorporating real downstream tasks to provide quantifiable assessments of the model's effectiveness. Furthermore, clarifying the implications of using specific basis functions, such as B-splines, versus alternative methods would be beneficial.
