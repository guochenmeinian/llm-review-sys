Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for similarity-based cooperative equilibrium, extending program equilibrium to a context of partial transparency. The authors propose a simple deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to identify this equilibrium, tested in a newly defined high-dimensional variant of the prisoner's dilemma (HDPD). The paper also introduces "difference meta games," which incorporate similarity information between players, demonstrating that these games can yield Pareto optimal cooperative equilibria. The CCDR algorithm is proposed for self-play in HDPD, facilitating cooperation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper logically extends existing concepts like program equilibrium, making them more applicable to real-world AI scenarios.
- It presents robust theoretical foundations supported by limited yet representative experiments.
- The writing is clear and well-structured, with effective examples and explanations.
- The introduction of HDPD is a notable independent contribution.
- Experiments include relevant baselines, such as LOLA.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical analysis is limited to a specific class of diff-based policies, which may restrict applicability.
- The CCDR algorithm's reliance on "cooperate" and "defect" actions raises concerns about its clarity and applicability in various games.
- The results primarily apply to a narrow class of games, and the proposed approach may not generalize well.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the limitations of the CCDR algorithm, particularly regarding its reliance on high-level actions that may not exist in many games. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explore the implications of their findings for AI alignment more thoroughly, addressing the potential for agents to manipulate similarity measures. Finally, we encourage the authors to evaluate their approach on non-additively-decomposable games to assess its broader applicability.
