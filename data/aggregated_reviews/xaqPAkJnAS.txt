Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents InfoMGF (Information-aware Unsupervised Multiplex Graph Fusion), a framework aimed at enhancing graph structure reliability in Multiplex Graphs by refining structures to eliminate noise and maximize task-relevant information. The authors propose a learnable graph augmentation strategy and validate the effectiveness of their approach through extensive experimental results, demonstrating superior performance over various baselines and even advanced supervised methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a critical gap in Unsupervised Multiplex Graph Learning (UMGL) by focusing on graph structure reliability, which is often overlooked.
- The proposed framework effectively refines graph structures, maximizing both view-shared and view-unique task-relevant information, supported by theoretical analyses and extensive experiments.
- The paper is well-motivated, clearly written, and organized, with comprehensive experimental validation and illustrative visualizations.

Weaknesses:
- The difference between the existing non-redundancy principle and multiplex graph non-redundancy is unclear and needs clarification.
- The proposed InfoMGF-LA runs out-of-memory on MAG data; the authors should provide a reason for this.
- Scalability remains a concern, as the overall complexity of the framework is not clearly defined despite individual analyses.
- The authors should address the potential limitations of the method in handling real-world large-scale graphs in the conclusion.
- There are minor grammatical and spelling errors present in the text, and the writing could be improved in tone and clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the differences between the existing non-redundancy principle and multiplex graph non-redundancy. Additionally, please provide an explanation for the out-of-memory issue with InfoMGF-LA on MAG data. It would be beneficial to clarify the overall complexity of the framework and discuss its scalability in real-world applications. Furthermore, we suggest addressing the minor grammatical errors and refining the writing style for better clarity. Lastly, please ensure that the notation used throughout the paper is consistent and not confusing for readers.
