Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for incorporating human expert knowledge into algorithmic predictions, addressing how human input can enhance predictive accuracy beyond what is captured in training data. The authors propose a meta-algorithm that combines human predictions with a multi-calibrated partition of the dataset, aiming to leverage human expertise for improved outcomes. The experimental results, particularly in the context of X-ray classification, support the effectiveness of this approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is clearly written and offers a novel method for integrating human input into algorithmic predictions. It provides significant contributions, particularly in medical applications, and includes a thorough discussion of related work and comprehensive experimental evaluations. The framework is well-structured and effectively demonstrates the potential for human-AI collaboration.

Weaknesses:  
The method would benefit from being presented as a broader framework rather than a specific instantiation. Additionally, the theoretical results could be better integrated into the paper's structure, and the definitions of critical concepts like indistinguishability and multicalibration require more detailed interpretation for clarity. The framework's reliance on minimizing mean squared error is also a limitation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation of their method by framing it as a comprehensive framework rather than a specific instantiation. Additionally, we encourage the authors to discuss potential enhancements to their approach and its implications for future work in incorporating human feedback into algorithmic predictions. Clarifying the definitions of key concepts and restructuring the theoretical results for better flow would also enhance accessibility.
