### Key Points
This paper investigates the language preference in code-switching behavior among bilingual Nepalese speakers, particularly in expressing sentiment within YouTube comments. The authors present experiments and analyses that are relevant to their research questions and provide baseline results on a Nepali-English code-switched sentiment dataset using traditional SVM, MLP, and transformer-based models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The Nepali-English code-switched sentiment dataset will be publicly available.
- The study demonstrates that bilingual individuals in Nepal primarily use the Nepali language to express negative sentiments, consistent with prior research.
- Baseline results on sentiment classification for the code-switched dataset are provided.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset's representativeness is questionable; details on the number of distinct users and the influence of the YouTube channels' topical focus on findings are needed.
- The token-level tagging was performed using an off-the-shelf model, and an analysis of its performance on YouTube comments would be beneficial.
- Additional data analysis, such as identifying frequently used Nepali words/slangs in a code-switched context, is recommended.
- The paper should include model interpretation to explain why TF-IDF, a simpler method, outperformed more resource-intensive transformer models.
- A detailed analysis of the impact of tokenization on sentiment classification is necessary, as the paper mentions it as a potential source of error.
- Incorporating LLM-based experiments for sentiment classification would enhance the study.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the representativeness of the dataset by providing more information on user diversity and the influence of YouTube channel topics. Additionally, conducting performance analysis on the token-level tagging model specific to YouTube comments would strengthen the findings. We suggest including a data analysis section to highlight frequently used Nepali words/slangs in the code-switched context. The authors should also provide a model interpretation to clarify the superior performance of TF-IDF over transformer models and include a detailed analysis of tokenization's impact on sentiment classification. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore LLM-based experiments for sentiment classification.
