Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DenoiseReID, a novel denoising model aimed at enhancing representation learning in person re-identification (ReID) tasks. The authors propose the Feature Extraction and Feature Denoising Fusion Algorithm (FEFDFA), which integrates feature extraction and denoising processes without incurring additional computational costs. Experimental results demonstrate that DenoiseReID achieves stable performance improvements across various ReID datasets and can be extended to large-scale image classification tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The integration of feature extraction and denoising in a single backbone is innovative and computation-efficient.
2. The theoretical analysis appears precise, and the experimental results are extensive, covering multiple tasks and datasets.

Weaknesses:
1. The proposed FEFDFA bears similarities to reparameterization; clarification on their differences is needed.
2. Performance comparisons are limited to TransReID, missing opportunities to benchmark against the latest advancements like CLIP-ReID.
3. The paper lacks hyper-parameter analysis and does not adequately address the need for additional training steps.
4. Some statements regarding the training process are inconsistent, particularly concerning the treatment of parameters.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the differences between FEFDFA and reparameterization. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include performance comparisons with state-of-the-art methods such as CLIP-ReID. We suggest conducting a hyper-parameter analysis to strengthen the findings and addressing the inconsistencies in the training process statements. Lastly, exploring the application of the method to CNN architectures could provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
