Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained to path-integrate the positions of two agents simultaneously, motivated by neuroscience findings on place cells responding to nearby animals. The authors augment existing single-agent RNN models, demonstrating that grid cell responses are weaker in the dual-agent scenario, while border and band cell responses are stronger. They also show that networks capable of dual-agent path integration can generalize to single-agent tasks, but not vice versa. The authors outline testable predictions based on their findings, aiming to contribute to the understanding of spatial navigation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and presents a novel approach to modeling neural activity related to path integration for two agents.  
- The authors conducted several ablation studies and provided clear testable predictions to validate their results.  
- The experimental analysis is solid, with important control experiments performed.

Weaknesses:  
- There is a lack of analytical derivation or explanation for the obtained results, leaving the influence of hyperparameters unclear.  
- The multi-agent experiments are limited to dual-agent integration, and exploring more agents could strengthen the findings.  
- The RNNs used are simple vanilla discrete-time models, and the interplay between recurrent noise and grid/border scores warrants further investigation.  
- Certain architectural assumptions, such as the mixed-cell output and the implications for distinguishing between agents, require better justification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analytical framework by deriving or explaining the results to clarify the influence of hyperparameters. Additionally, exploring the strengths of grid and border cell responses in scenarios with three or more agents would enhance the paper's impact. Investigating the effects of recurrent noise and considering continuous-time RNNs could provide valuable insights. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors justify their architectural choices more thoroughly, particularly regarding the mixed-cell output and its implications for distinguishing between agents.
