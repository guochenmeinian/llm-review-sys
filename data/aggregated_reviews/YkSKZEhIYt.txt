Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the DISCO (Discrete-State Continuous-Time Diffusion) model, an innovative framework for graph generation that integrates continuous-time Markov Chains while maintaining the discrete nature of graph data. The authors demonstrate the model's flexibility in sampling, allowing for trade-offs between quality and efficiency. Additionally, the paper categorizes existing graph diffusion models and proposes a concise message-passing neural network as an alternative to complex graph transformers.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for the research is clear, addressing the efficiency limitations of current discrete graph generation models.
- The writing quality is good, with most sections being easy to follow.
- The proposed method is technically sound and supported by comprehensive mathematical proofs.

Weaknesses:
- The selected baselines for comparison are insufficient, with only DiGress being evaluated against DISCO, while other relevant methods are overlooked.
- The innovation appears limited, as the approach seems to derive straightforwardly from existing tools, primarily integrating continuous-time Markov Chains with discrete graph data.
- Some symbols in the formulas lack clarity, reducing overall readability.
- There is a disconnect between the motivation for improved sampling efficiency and the theoretical discussion of the method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the baseline comparisons by including additional relevant methods to enrich the experimental evaluation. It would be beneficial to clarify the symbols used in the formulas to enhance readability. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors provide more evidence and evaluation to substantiate the claims regarding sampling efficiency improvements. Additionally, addressing the disconnection between the motivation and theoretical discussions would strengthen the paper's coherence.
