Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an end-to-end framework for speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) that preserves speaker and voice characteristics while utilizing unsupervised training. The authors propose enhancements to the speech tokenizer by distilling semantic information and improving the sampling mechanism to support textless non-autoregressive (NAR) acoustic modeling. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach is competitive with or outperforms strong baselines, particularly in isochrony preservation and translation quality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Significant improvements throughout the S2ST pipeline, leading to a solid contribution.
- The proposed method outperforms a previous state-of-the-art model on English-French translation tasks.
- The modular architecture and innovations, such as isochrony embedding and layer beam search, are noteworthy.

Weaknesses:
- The paper's writing quality needs improvement, with typos and clarity issues present.
- The experimental evaluation is limited to English-French translation, raising questions about performance on other language pairs.
- A lack of ablation studies to assess the impact of individual design choices on model performance.
- The inference speed of the proposed framework is a concern, particularly due to the use of an autoregressive decoder for predicting Codec tokens.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the structure of the introduction and method sections to enhance clarity, possibly by separating the modeling designs for S2ST and Codec-related contributions. Additionally, consider adding visualizations for the distillation strategy to illustrate the proposed methods more effectively. It would also be beneficial to include an analysis of the inference speed and comparisons with systems like UnitY. Furthermore, we suggest conducting ablation studies to investigate the effects of individual design choices and expanding the evaluation to include more language pairs. Lastly, we advise proofreading the paper to correct typos and improve overall writing clarity.
