### Key Points
This paper presents an empirical study on the effects of non-uniform bid-scaling across various auction formats, including first-price, Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG), and generalized second-price (GSP) auctions. The authors investigate how non-uniform bid-scaling influences auction efficiency and outcomes, addressing limitations in current autobidding systems. Through a simulation framework that generates synthetic auction data, the study evaluates the performance of these auction formats under different bid-scaling conditions. The findings indicate that non-uniform bid-scaling can significantly impact auction outcomes, challenging traditional auction equilibrium theories and suggesting new avenues for designing efficient online auction systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study provides a comprehensive empirical analysis of various auction formats under different bid-scaling scenarios, offering valuable real-world insights.
- The paper includes an analysis of the convergence properties of auto-bidding algorithms, enhancing the robustness of the empirical results.
- A detailed comparison of auction formats with and without reserves under varying bid-scaling conditions is presented, aiding in understanding their efficiencies.

Weaknesses:
- The robustness of the empirical results and their ability to capture real-world complexities is unclear.
- The paper may be dense and complex, lacking intuitive diagrams or visual aids to enhance understanding.
- Some experimental conclusions lack theoretical backing, and the introduction may be overly detailed while neglecting the significance of the research theme.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the empirical results section by addressing the robustness of their extensions to different auction formats and non-uniform bid-scaling. Additionally, the authors should consider incorporating more intuitive diagrams to illustrate the dataset generation and simulation processes. We suggest trimming the background introduction to auto-bidding to maintain focus on the main theme and enriching the conclusions with theoretical explanations for experimental findings. Lastly, we advise re-evaluating the necessity of Algorithms 1 and 2, as they may present redundant content.
