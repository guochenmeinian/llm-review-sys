### Key Points
This paper presents a narrative order aware framework, BPOT, for story generation, utilizing a bidirectional pretrained model to encode event correlations and pairwise event order. The authors propose a reinforcement learning algorithm with a novel optimal transport reward to enhance event quality during the fine-tuning stage. Evaluation results indicate BPOT's superiority in generating logically coherent stories with flashbacks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The reward design is novel.
- The overall work is solid, and the experiments are sufficient.
- The motivation and experimental setting are reasonable.

Weaknesses:
- The method section is difficult to follow due to unclear wording, structure, and graphs.
- The overall experimental setup is relatively weak, with few baseline models.
- The claims regarding the model's ability to handle narrative order and flashbacks are not convincingly supported by experiments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method section, including the wording, structure, and graphs. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the experimental setup by incorporating more comparative experiments, such as those referenced in [1]. It would also be beneficial for the authors to clarify the intuition and motivation behind the optimal transport reward and provide details on how to compute PPL for planning-based models. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to focus the paper's claims on 'event aware story generation' rather than over-claiming the concept of 'narrative.' Lastly, we suggest editing the title for clarity.
