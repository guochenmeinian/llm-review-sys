### Key Points
This paper presents AdaptKry, a novel approach for optimizing polynomial graph filters by unifying various filters into a Krylov subspace. It enhances adaptability to diverse graph structures and efficiently manages complex graphs. The authors demonstrate AdaptKry's superior filtering capabilities through extensive experiments, particularly in node classification tasks on academic benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The unification of polynomial filters into the Krylov subspace is an innovative concept.
2. AdaptKry exhibits strong performance across multiple datasets.
3. The paper is well-organized and clearly written.

Weaknesses:
1. Proposition 2 regarding optimal polynomial filters appears not to be satisfied by AdaptKry, necessitating clarification on the differences.
2. The main distinctions between AdaptKry and other polynomial filter methods stem from the propagation matrix with tau and the concatenation operation, which increases parameters; thus, ablation experiments are needed to validate the benefits of AdaptKry beyond concatenation.
3. The improvement of AdaptKry on heterophilic graphs is marginal, and there is a lack of sufficient datasets for this category, suggesting the need for experiments on larger heterophilic graph datasets.
4. Theorem 1 lacks novelty and should be cited from the Markov chain mixing time literature.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Proposition 2 to elucidate how AdaptKry differs from optimal polynomial filters. Additionally, conducting ablation studies to demonstrate the specific contributions of the concatenation operation is essential. To enhance the evaluation of AdaptKry on heterophilic graphs, we suggest utilizing more extensive datasets, referencing the latest benchmarks available. Furthermore, please ensure that Theorem 1 is properly cited and consider making Section 3.3 more rigorous by quantifying potential information loss with small K values. Lastly, addressing the computational cost and numerical stability associated with the matrix inverse operation in Algorithm 1 would strengthen the paper.
