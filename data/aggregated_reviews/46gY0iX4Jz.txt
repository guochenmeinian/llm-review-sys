### Key Points
This paper presents a novel algorithm for collaborative anti-money laundering (AML) efforts among financial institutions, addressing the challenge of detecting money laundering activities that span multiple institutions while preserving the privacy of individual transaction graphs. The authors propose the **Collaborative Scatter-Gather Mining (CSGM)** algorithm, which utilizes Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and Bloom filters to enhance efficiency and reduce communication costs. The paper includes a large-scale real-world transaction dataset and demonstrates promising results, although the performance improvements are limited, particularly regarding recall scores.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper provides a clear and structured approach to decentralized AML detection, contributing significantly to the field with its innovative use of collaborative techniques.
2. It effectively compares the proposed method with various existing AML methods, enhancing its credibility and relevance.
3. The inclusion of well-organized tables and figures presents experimental results clearly, offering valuable insights into the algorithm's performance.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the approach is somewhat limited, as it combines existing techniques without significant innovation beyond enabling collaboration while protecting data privacy.
2. The implementation details lack clarity, particularly regarding complex aspects like LSH and Bloom filters, which may challenge readers unfamiliar with advanced graph-based methods.
3. The paper does not sufficiently test the proposed method across diverse real-world scenarios, and the Alipay-ECB dataset is not publicly available, limiting reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the implementation details, especially in sections discussing LSH and Bloom filters, to make the content more accessible. Additionally, we suggest that the authors conduct further testing of the algorithm on a broader range of real-world datasets to validate its robustness and generalizability. Open-sourcing the Alipay-ECB dataset and the code would significantly enhance the paper's impact and facilitate reproducibility. Furthermore, we advise the authors to ensure that the best experimental results are bolded and the second-best results are underlined in Table 1, and to correct any spelling errors throughout the document.
