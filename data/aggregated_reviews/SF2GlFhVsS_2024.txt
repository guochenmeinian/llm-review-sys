Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to mitigating object hallucination in large visual language models (LVLMs) through contrastive decoding. The authors propose training an "evil" LVLM using direct preference optimization to generate logits that are then contrasted with outputs from the original LVLM. The theoretical foundations and experimental results demonstrate that this method effectively reduces hallucinations across multiple benchmarks, including POPE and CHAIR.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is straightforward and easy to follow.
- The perspective of training an amateur model first using direct preference optimization is intriguing.
- The writing and presentation are generally clear, with significant performance improvements noted against previous methods.

Weaknesses:
- There is a **generalization issue**; the proposed method may only apply to specific objects seen during training, limiting its applicability to a broader vocabulary.
- The experimental details are insufficiently described, particularly for Figures 1, 2, and Tables 2 and 5, which lack clarity despite significant result variations.
- Missing results for the three models studied and inadequate training details for the "Evil Model" raise concerns about the completeness of the manuscript.
- The writing contains several errors, including typos, inconsistent terminology, and a lack of a Conclusion section, indicating a rushed preparation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of experimental setups and provide comprehensive results for all models studied. Including comparisons with RLHF methods could enhance the discussion on the utility of the amateur model. Additionally, addressing the generalization issue by exploring the model's performance on unseen objects would strengthen the paper. We also suggest revising the writing for clarity, correcting typos, and ensuring consistent terminology throughout the manuscript. Finally, the authors should include a Conclusion section to summarize their findings effectively.
