Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for partially identifiable robustness to evaluate robustness in scenarios with insufficiently heterogeneous training distributions. The authors define 'identifiable robust risk' and its corresponding minimax quantity, demonstrating that previous methods yield suboptimal robustness. They propose an empirical minimizer of the identifiable robust risk, which outperforms existing methods in finite-sample experiments. The study also investigates the optimal minimax risk of a robust predictor under a structural causal model with hidden confounders, revealing that the robust predictor is identifiable only if test shifts align with training shifts. The authors analyze the implications of bounded shifts on robust predictors and provide empirical validation of their approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is clearly written and presents an interesting approach to bridging structured and unstructured distributional robustness.
- It contributes original insights into the impossibility of infinite robustness under the proposed framework and provides a theoretical explanation for the failure of existing methods in challenging environments.

Weaknesses:
- The structural causal model shows bias even without distribution shifts, raising concerns about its applicability.
- The paper lacks motivation from real-world applications, leaving unclear when the proposed framework is useful in practice.
- Some sections could benefit from reorganization into formal assumptions, and there are missing details that require further clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for their framework by providing real-world examples where the predictor is partially identifiable. Additionally, we suggest elaborating on how the empirical estimations for the training shift direction are computed, as this is crucial for understanding the subsequent estimation process. Clarifying the connections between their active intervention selection and existing literature on distribution shifts would also enhance the paper's relevance. Finally, addressing the bias in the structural causal model and considering upper bounds on robust loss could strengthen the analysis.
