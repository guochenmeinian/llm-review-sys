Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a spectral clustering oracle that achieves sublinear pre-processing and query time complexity. The authors propose a new algorithm that enhances running time while slightly compromising on approximation guarantees. The work builds on existing research, particularly improving preprocessing time to \(O(n^{1/2 + O(\epsilon / \phi^2)})\) at the cost of increased misclassification error and conductance gap requirements. The algorithm's practicality is supported by experimental results on synthetic data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a new sublinear-time clustering oracle with improved running time guarantees.
- The theoretical contributions are presented clearly, with natural proof techniques.
- The proposed algorithm is practical and implementable, confirmed by experiments.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical improvements over previous algorithms are minimal, which may limit perceived novelty.
- The statement of Theorem 1 is difficult to follow, particularly regarding the parameter \(\xi\).
- Experimental evaluation lacks comparisons with other methods and does not report running times, limiting its usefulness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Theorem 1 by providing an intuitive explanation of the parameter \(\xi\). Additionally, consider including comparisons with algorithms [30] and [14] in the experimental section, and clarify the evaluation metrics used. It would also be beneficial to enhance the experimental section by adding robustness experiments and ensuring that the setup is clearly explained.
