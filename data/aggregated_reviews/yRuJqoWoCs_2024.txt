Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an SE(3)-equivariant multi-view depth estimation model based on the Perceiver IO framework. The authors propose treating each feature ray as a token, concatenated with an equivariant positional embedding using spherical harmonics to encode ray poses. The model processes these equivariant ray encodings through self-attention layers, aggregating them into global features for pixel color prediction. The effectiveness of the approach is validated on the ScanNet and DeMoN datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. This is the first paper addressing SE(3)-equivariant positional embedding for the transformer/Perceiver IO framework in multiview applications, offering a simpler and more efficient alternative to existing methods.
2. The proposed method achieves competitive benchmark results across multiple datasets, with a convincing ablation study highlighting the significance of the equivariant embedding.
3. The appendix provides accessible explanations and visualizations, making complex concepts easier for beginners.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation and benefits of the new equivariant nonlinearity introduced by the authors are not clearly demonstrated, raising questions about its advantages over existing SE(3)-equivariant nonlinearities.
2. The ablation experiments did not control the number of parameters concerning the maximum spherical harmonics degrees, which could affect performance comparisons.
3. The paper's presentation is hindered by the organization of important details in the appendix, making it difficult to follow the overall process.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation and benefits of the new equivariant nonlinearity, providing a distinct comparison to existing nonlinearities. Additionally, it is essential to control the number of parameters in the ablation studies to ensure fair comparisons. We also suggest reorganizing the paper to include critical details currently in the appendix within the main text, enhancing the overall readability and coherence of the presentation.
