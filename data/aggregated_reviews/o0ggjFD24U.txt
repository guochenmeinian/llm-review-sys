Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for continuous-time control with costly observations, addressing the optimal timing for observations in such environments. The authors propose a method called Active Observing Control (AOC), which allows for irregular observation intervals and continuous-time control. The effectiveness of AOC is validated through experiments in diverse real-world scenarios, including a glucose environment for diabetic insulin regulation, an HIV environment for chemotherapy dosing, and a quadrotor environment for unmanned aerial vehicle control. The authors demonstrate that AOC outperforms traditional discrete-time models and competing methods in these settings, reinforcing the generalizability and practical applicability of their theoretical claims. The paper also discusses the theoretical implications of observing at irregular intervals and provides comprehensive implementation details, ablation studies, and an appendix detailing empirical validations across multiple environments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed approach is novel and addresses an important problem relevant to real-world applications.
- The paper provides both theoretical insights and empirical validation of the method across multiple environments.
- AOC consistently achieves high average utility, outperforming other methods.
- It includes detailed implementation information and ablation results, enhancing the paper's robustness.

Weaknesses:
1. The method's reliance on the accuracy of the learned model may limit its generalizability and robustness, particularly when the true reward function is unknown.
2. Key related works are not cited, including those that explore similar objectives in different contexts.
3. The claim of novelty in the formulation is questionable, as similar objectives have been proposed in existing literature.
4. The optimal method remains unspecified, and the initial method may not be optimal in all scenarios.
5. The method may not be genuinely continuous-time due to the lower bound on time resolution.
6. Practical guidance for selecting the cost parameter 'c' in real-world applications is lacking.
7. The uncertainty threshold \(\tau\) is fixed after a single episode, and further adjustments could enhance performance.
8. The reliance on an accurately learned dynamics model from offline datasets raises concerns about feasibility and accuracy in practice.
9. The submission of code via an external link is not ideal, especially given its recent update after the supplementary materials deadline.
10. There are several typographical errors and inconsistencies in the manuscript.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of the method by addressing the limitations associated with the learned model's accuracy. It would be beneficial to include discussions on the omitted related works to better position the paper within the existing literature. We suggest clarifying the differences between their formulation and similar objectives found in prior research. Additionally, the authors should consider providing practical guidance for selecting the cost parameter 'c' and explore the potential for adjusting the uncertainty threshold \(\tau\) dynamically. Clarifying the optimal method and its applicability across various scenarios would strengthen the paper further. Addressing the typographical errors and inconsistencies will also enhance the manuscript's clarity and professionalism.
