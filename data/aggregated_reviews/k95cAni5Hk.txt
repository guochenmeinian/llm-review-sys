### Key Points
This paper presents a stance detection task utilizing toxic, moral, and speech act traits in tweets through a multitasking model named TWISTED. The authors demonstrate that multi-tasking enhances stance detection performance compared to single-task and baseline methods across four benchmark datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The approach is sound and well-explained, with reasonable evaluation methods and comprehensive data comparisons.  
- The results indicate considerable improvements over baseline models, supported by extensive experiments and qualitative examples in the appendix.  

Weaknesses:  
- The contribution feels incremental and lacks groundbreaking novelty, as the use of neural and lexical features alongside multi-task learning is common in NLP.  
- There is a lack of qualitative analysis and exploration of related work, particularly concerning stance detection in climate change, politics, and COVID-19 contexts.  
- The experimental scale is small, and some claims are insufficiently supported.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their work by providing additional motivation for the model's architecture and exploring more related literature, specifically including the stance detection tasks on climate change by Islam et al. 2023, political campaigns by Islam et al. 2023, and COVID-19 by Pacheco et al. 2022, as well as the work by Islam and Goldwasser 2022 on moral foundations. Additionally, addressing the lack of qualitative analysis and expanding the experimental scope would strengthen the paper.
