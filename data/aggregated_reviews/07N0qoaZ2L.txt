Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of two-sided matching bandit problems, aiming to minimize regret against a player's optimal stable matching. The authors propose an adaptive online Gale-Shapley algorithm that achieves a regret bound of $N^2\log T/\Delta^2$ when $N<K$, and under the $\alpha$-condition, they provide a new analysis that improves the bound to $N\log T/\Delta^2$. The paper also explores the bandit learning problem in two-sided matching markets, providing improved regret analysis that nearly matches the lower bound.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors suggest an adaptive online Gale-Shapley algorithm that outperforms previous algorithms when $N$ is much smaller than $K$.
2. The paper is well-written, with clear flow and strong technical novelty, offering insights into balancing exploration and exploitation in matching markets.
3. Numerical experiments demonstrate significant improvements under specific conditions.

Weaknesses:
1. The upper bound without the $\alpha$-condition is $N^2$, which may not be tight concerning $N$.
2. The novelty of the theory is unclear, and the combination of bandits with matching markets appears unconventional, raising questions about practical applicability.
3. A comprehensive comparison with existing results is lacking, and the new gap definition's advantages over prior notions are insufficiently discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by explicitly outlining the contributions in the introduction, particularly emphasizing the main algorithmic design insights. Additionally, we suggest providing a lower bound result for the new gap and discussing how it captures practical difficulties better than existing definitions. It would also be beneficial to clarify the empirical relevance of using bandits in matching markets and explore how the results would change if the assumption of known utility preferences $\pi_{i,j}$ is relaxed.
