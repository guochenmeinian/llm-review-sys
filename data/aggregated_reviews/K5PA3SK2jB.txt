Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for co-training an inference network that models the provenance of points in a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), enhancing the quantification of uncertainty in reconstructed geometry through triangulation and depth error. The authors extend implicit maximum likelihood estimation (IMLE) to functional domains over infinite sets, introducing a loss term that improves novel view synthesis and reduces triangulation uncertainty on standard datasets. The method allows for better utilization of triangulation information from training images and introduces a secondary neural network for modeling provenance. Additionally, the authors propose a post-hoc uncertainty estimation method that integrates with any NeRF backbone to assess triangulation uncertainty, clarifying that their approach retains the original depth maps from the backbone and effectively removes artificial floaters, revealing the underlying geometry without relying on generative priors.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for modeling visibility and triangulation quality is compelling and relevant to the NeurIPS community.
- The results demonstrate improvements in novel view synthesis and uncertainty modeling, supported by thorough evaluations and ablation studies.
- The theoretical framework is mathematically rigorous, and the appendix provides extensive supplementary information.
- The solution addresses a significant problem in uncertainty estimation and is deemed sound and inspiring, effectively removing artifacts and improving the visibility of correct geometry in reconstructed scenes.

Weaknesses:
- The introduction lacks clarity on the significance of the problem being addressed, leaving questions about its importance.
- The presentation is overly technical and complex, particularly in sections 4.1-4.3, which may confuse readers.
- The method primarily addresses triangulation uncertainty, neglecting other forms of uncertainty, which may limit its applicability.
- The evaluation metrics and visualizations do not convincingly demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods.
- The correlation between uncertainty and depth error may seem unconventional, and pose inaccuracies in the dataset can lead to geometry inconsistencies, affecting the overall results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction by explicitly stating the importance of the problem being addressed. Simplifying the presentation, particularly in sections 4.1-4.3, would enhance reader comprehension; consider moving technical details to the appendix. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more comprehensive discussion of the method's limitations in the main text rather than relegating it to the supplemental material. Clarifying the relationship between depth error and uncertainty in the evaluation would also strengthen the paper's contributions. Lastly, addressing the dataset's pose accuracy and including a clearer distinction between the stochastic processes discussed, along with providing visual aids, could enhance understanding.
