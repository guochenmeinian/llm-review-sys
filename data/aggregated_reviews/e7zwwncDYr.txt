### Key Points
This paper presents an approach to enhance fairness in image generation by intervening in the latent distributions of pre-trained models using probabilistic circuits, without the need for retraining. The authors propose a method that leverages a small fair reference dataset, demonstrating its potential to save training resources while achieving fair generation. The experiments indicate that the method can effectively utilize the distribution of the reference dataset, although several results in Table 1 lack thorough analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The use of probabilistic circuits for fair image generation is innovative and efficient, as it avoids retraining the entire model.
2. The methodology is well-structured, with a clear theoretical foundation and a comprehensive evaluation using multiple metrics.
3. The approach allows for control over the trade-off between fairness and fidelity, which is significant for practical applications.

Weaknesses:
1. The experiments are limited to the CelebA dataset and focus solely on gender as the sensitive attribute, which restricts the generalizability of the findings.
2. There is a lack of theoretical guarantees regarding the fairness of the generated images, which weakens the claims made.
3. The method's performance is contingent on the quality of the pre-trained model and the availability of sensitive attribute labels, potentially limiting its applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of results in Table 1, particularly regarding the impact of reference dataset size and the relationship between fairness and skewed pre-trained data. Additionally, the authors should consider expanding the scope of their experiments to include diverse datasets and multiple sensitive attributes, such as race and age. A more rigorous statistical analysis, including confidence intervals or significance tests, would strengthen the validity of the results. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors provide a formal discussion on fairness guarantees and explore the implications of conditional sampling more thoroughly in future work.
