Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Collaborative Neural Framework (CNF) aimed at enhancing the robustness of neural methods for vehicle routing problems (VRPs) against adversarial attacks. The authors propose a novel ensemble approach that includes a global attack strategy to generate diverse adversarial instances and an attention-based neural router for effective load balancing among models. Extensive experiments benchmark the proposed method against various baselines for TSP and CVRP, demonstrating impressive empirical performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach of ensembling multiple models is novel and has potential applicability to broader combinatorial optimization problems.
- The empirical performance is strong, with the method consistently outperforming baselines on TSP and CVRP, and the experiments are well-documented.
- The paper is well-structured, with clear problem formulation and comprehensive evaluations.

Weaknesses:
- The absence of an ablation study for independent adversarial training limits the analysis of the proposed method's robustness.
- The threat model is not clearly defined, raising concerns about the types of perturbations the method can withstand.
- The inference procedure is inadequately described, necessitating further elaboration.
- The organization and clarity of the presentation could be improved, as some figures and terms lack sufficient explanation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the threat model by explicitly stating the types of perturbations the proposed method is robust against. Additionally, we suggest including an ablation study for independent adversarial training to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the method's performance. The authors should also elaborate on the inference procedure to enhance understanding. Furthermore, addressing the organization and clarity of the presentation, particularly regarding figures and terminology, would strengthen the paper. Lastly, considering comparisons with test-time adaptation methods such as meta-learning and neural-guided local search could provide valuable insights into the robustness of the proposed framework.
