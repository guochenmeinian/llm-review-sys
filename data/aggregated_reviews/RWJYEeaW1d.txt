### Key Points
This paper presents EasyQuant, a data-free weight-only quantization method for large language models (LLMs), which identifies outliers in weights using their mean and variance, isolating them from the quantization process. The quantization range is optimized based on the gradient of the reconstruction error, allowing for efficient quantization of models like OPT-176B and BLOOM-176B within minutes. The authors demonstrate that outliers significantly impact quantization efficiency and model generalization, achieving comparable accuracy to data-dependent methods while running over 10x faster.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- EasyQuant is the first method to quantize LLMs without accessing input data, revealing the importance of outliers and quantization range optimization.  
- The method shows high quantization efficiency and is implemented for rapid processing of large models.  
- Experimental results indicate some performance gains over baseline methods, particularly in sensitive language model tasks.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks a thorough investigation into the distribution and existence of outliers across different layers.  
- EasyQuant's approach of retaining outliers in full precision resembles mixed-precision quantization, raising questions about the source of performance benefits.  
- The focus is primarily on 4-bit quantization, leaving uncertainty about the behavior of outliers at lower bit widths.  
- The experimental section is criticized for weak baselines and insufficient validation of the outlier threshold's impact on performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their writing, particularly in the introduction, by including technical details earlier and discussing core contributions more explicitly. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments to analyze the distribution of weight outliers and their impact on performance across various tasks. It would be beneficial to compare EasyQuant against state-of-the-art methods like LLM.int8() and SmoothQuant to strengthen the novelty and robustness of the findings. Finally, we advise revising the experimental section to include stronger baselines and to clarify how the quantization scale changes during optimization for different layers.
