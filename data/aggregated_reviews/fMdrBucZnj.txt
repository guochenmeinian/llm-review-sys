Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new method for hierarchical clustering called Expected Probabilistic Hierarchies (EPH), which extends the Flexible Probabilistic Hierarchy (FPH) approach. EPH optimizes expected clustering scores (Exp-Das and Exp-TSD) over the distribution of hierarchies, addressing the alignment issue between continuous and discrete targets. The authors provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that EPH's optimization objective is consistent with its discrete counterparts, and experimental results indicate that EPH outperforms existing methods on various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized, clearly presenting its contributions supported by theoretical analysis and extensive empirical results.
- It includes a comprehensive evaluation demonstrating EPH's effectiveness over baseline methods on synthetic and real datasets.
- The writing is clear, making the complex concepts accessible.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of EPH is limited, as the framework and techniques largely derive from prior work, particularly ZÃ¼gner et al. (2021).
- The improvements in performance over FPH are marginal, raising questions about the significance of the contribution.
- The computational overhead of EPH compared to FPH is notable, and the method may not guarantee convergence to a global optimum.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the articulation of the motivation behind selecting the Dasgupta and TSD scores, clarifying their relevance and differences. Additionally, the authors should address the potential limitations of EPH in finding intrinsic hierarchical structures and discuss the implications of binary versus non-binary hierarchies. It would also be beneficial to provide more insights into the variance of performance due to random initialization and to visualize the hierarchy of clusters for qualitative evaluation. Lastly, we suggest that the authors explore ways to enhance the computational efficiency of EPH to make it more competitive with existing methods.
