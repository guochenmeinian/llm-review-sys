Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new metric for comparing heterogeneous joint distributions, termed Hierarchical Hybrid Sliced Wasserstein (H2SW), which is based on a novel slicing operator called Hierarchical Hybrid Radon Transform (HHRT). The authors derive theoretical properties of H2SW and validate its effectiveness through applications in 3D mesh deformation, training shape autoencoders, and dataset comparisons. The work addresses limitations of existing metrics like Sliced Wasserstein (SW) and Generalized Sliced Wasserstein (GSW) that are not suitable for heterogeneous domains.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of H2SW provides a pioneering metric specifically designed for heterogeneous joint distributions.
- The novel slicing operator HHRT enhances the ability to compare heterogeneous data effectively.
- The paper is well-structured and presents theoretical properties and empirical validations clearly.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity in explaining the main challenges of designing a sliced Wasserstein variant for heterogeneous joint distributions and how H2SW addresses these challenges.
- The relationships between various transforms (PRT, GRT, PGRT) are not sufficiently detailed, leading to confusion.
- Some figures and definitions are presented with insufficient clarity, affecting readability and understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by elaborating on the challenges of designing a sliced Wasserstein variant for heterogeneous joint distributions and clarifying how H2SW addresses these challenges. Additionally, provide a detailed explanation of the relationships between PRT, GRT, and PGRT to enhance understanding. We suggest refining the writing for conciseness and precision, particularly in definitions and descriptions, and ensuring that figures are larger and clearer for better readability.
