### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to peer-review rebuttal generation through attitude roots and themes, inspired by Jiu-Jitsu argumentation. The authors propose a new task for generating rebuttals that align with an opponent's beliefs, contributing to the field by introducing attitude roots and themes, enriching a peer review dataset, and exploring the potential of these concepts in rebuttal generation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The work is pioneering in applying Jiu-Jitsu argumentation to peer review, introducing a novel task of attitude and theme-guided rebuttal generation.  
- The authors provide a new dataset and benchmarks for this task, facilitating further research.  
- The paper is well-structured and presents a compelling argument supported by thorough evaluation.

Weaknesses:  
- The small number of annotators (one or two) raises concerns about the reliability of human annotations.  
- The dataset construction relies on intermediate classification model performance, which may introduce biases.  
- Missing details regarding the human annotation process and the criteria for annotator selection could undermine the study's credibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the transparency of the annotation process by providing more details about the annotators, including their recruitment criteria and interaction with the authors. Additionally, we suggest discussing the intended users of the proposed system and the expected benefits, clarifying that the system aims to suggest relevant rebuttal patterns rather than exact rebuttals. This could enhance the paper's clarity and applicability.
