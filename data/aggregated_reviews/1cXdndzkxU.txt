Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of the multi-armed bandit problem to infinitely many arms with generalized rotting constraints. The authors derive explicit regret lower bounds and propose an algorithm that achieves regret upper bounds matching the lower bounds when $\beta \geq 1$. However, they acknowledge that closing the gap for $\beta \in (0,1)$ remains an open problem. The study also introduces a sliding-window-UCB-based approach adaptable to both slow and abrupt rotting cases, providing tight regret guarantees and improved empirical performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The extension to infinitely many arms with rotting mean rewards is relevant for real-world applications, supported by solid theoretical analyses and empirical results.
- The paper is well-written, presenting the problem and results clearly, with a novel treatment of unknown parameters.

Weaknesses:
- The paper may be perceived as an extension of prior work, potentially limiting its impact. The inability to prove near-optimality for $\beta \in (0,1)$ diminishes the theoretical significance.
- The definition of $V_T$ and $S_T$ lacks clarity and may not be fully rigorous, as they are treated as deterministic constants despite being influenced by random variables.
- The experimental study is limited, primarily focusing on $\beta=1$, and could benefit from comparisons across different rotting processes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definitions of $V_T$ and $S_T$, ensuring that they are rigorously justified within the context of the paper. Additionally, addressing the unknown parameters to minimize additional regret would enhance the robustness of the proposed algorithms. We suggest conducting a more extensive experimental study that includes varying $\beta$ and different rotting processes to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the algorithm's performance. Finally, we encourage the authors to strengthen the motivation for the problem by discussing its applicability in real-world scenarios more convincingly.
