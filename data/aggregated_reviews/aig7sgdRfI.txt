Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for learning Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) using the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) objective. The authors demonstrate that gradient descent on the DDPM objective can effectively recover the ground truth parameters for mixtures of two spherical Gaussians and mixtures of \( K \) spherical Gaussians under specific assumptions. Additionally, the paper provides a proof that the approximation error in the power iteration matrix remains significantly smaller than the eigengap when \( t = O(\log d) \), as detailed in Lemma B.5. The authors argue that the inequality \( 1 + \tau + \epsilon > 1 \) does not sufficiently establish the preservation of the eigengap, emphasizing that the conditions for maintaining the eigengap are specified in section 2.2.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides several interesting insights, particularly regarding the relationship between gradient descent and established algorithms like EM.
- It contributes to the understanding of diffusion models, focusing on a fundamental class of distributions, GMMs, which is of high interest to the NeurIPS community.
- The connection between DDPM and classic algorithms could be significant for future research.
- The authors provide a clear argument that the approximation error is controlled under specific conditions and adhere to standard practices in theoretical computer science regarding the use of asymptotic notation.

Weaknesses:
- The novelties of the proposed method compared to existing works are not clearly articulated, particularly regarding the advantages of using the DDPM objective.
- The practicality of the method for general GMMs with \( K \geq 3 \) components is questionable, as achieving a global optimum for maximizing log-likelihood is generally infeasible.
- The paper lacks empirical experiments to validate the theoretical claims.
- The presentation is poor, with structural issues, missing sections like "Conclusion" and "Discussion," and unclear terminology.
- The justification for the preservation of the eigengap could be more explicitly stated, and the specific conditions for the inequality's validity are not detailed enough for some readers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by restructuring it to include essential sections such as "Background," "Problem Statement," "Conclusion," and "Discussion." This would enhance the reader's understanding of the contributions and the context of the work. 

We suggest that the authors explicitly define acronyms like GD (gradient descent) in the abstract and clarify terms such as "natural" data distribution. Additionally, we encourage the authors to conduct empirical experiments to validate their theoretical results and compare their method with existing approaches.

To address the concerns regarding the convergence of power iteration, we recommend that the authors provide a more rigorous justification for their claims, particularly regarding the conditions necessary for convergence and the implications of the inequality \( 1 + \tau + \epsilon > 1 \). Lastly, we advise correcting minor typographical errors and ensuring consistent terminology throughout the paper.
