Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents BitsFusion, a weight quantization method for the UNet architecture in Stable Diffusion v1.5, achieving a quantization to 1.99 bits and a model size reduction of 7.9 times while maintaining or enhancing image generation quality. The authors propose a mixed-precision quantization approach, novel initialization techniques, and a two-stage training pipeline. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of BitsFusion across various benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance compared to the full-precision model.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-organized and accessible, with clear explanations of methodology and experimental procedures.
2. The BitsFusion framework innovatively addresses the challenges of low-bit quantization, contributing significantly to the field.
3. Comprehensive analysis of quantization errors and effective validation across multiple datasets enhances the credibility of the results.
4. The generated results are impressive, showcasing the practical potential for deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation appears heuristic, lacking necessary theoretical analysis, which could limit the understanding of the method's implications.
2. The two-stage training pipeline may introduce additional computational complexity and training time, which is not adequately discussed.
3. The claim that the 1.99-bit model outperforms the full-precision model in all metrics is an overgeneralization, as it relies on specific datasets and does not account for diverse real-world conditions.
4. The analysis of layer sensitivity to quantization lacks depth, and the paper does not explore the intrinsic mechanisms behind layer sensitivity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis of their method to strengthen the motivation behind their approach. Additionally, a discussion on the computational complexity and training time introduced by the two-stage training pipeline should be included for a more comprehensive evaluation. To substantiate claims of superior performance, we suggest conducting evaluations on a wider variety of datasets and prompts, including real-world conditions. Lastly, exploring the intrinsic mechanisms of layer sensitivity to quantization would enhance the understanding of the quantization process, and including comparisons with established weight initialization techniques could provide further insights.
