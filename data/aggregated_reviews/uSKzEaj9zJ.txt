Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Nonlocal Attention Operator (NAO), a novel neural operator architecture designed to address both forward and inverse problems in partial differential equations (PDEs) across various physical systems. The authors propose an attention-based kernel map that learns resolution-invariant kernels from data, facilitating physics modeling and mechanism discovery. The theoretical foundation elucidates how the attention mechanism aids in resolving ill-posed inverse problems, while empirical evaluations demonstrate NAO's effectiveness in tasks such as radial kernel learning and heterogeneous material modeling.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach uniquely integrates forward and inverse PDE solving within a unified framework.
- The theoretical analysis provides a rigorous justification for the attention mechanism's role in kernel identifiability.
- The empirical results show NAO's advantages in generalization and data-efficient learning, particularly for ill-posed inverse problems.
- The interpretability of learned kernels enhances understanding of discovered physical mechanisms.

Weaknesses:
- Experimental evaluations are limited to simpler PDE systems, raising concerns about scalability to complex, high-dimensional problems.
- The interpretability claims require further substantiation, as the discussion on how learned kernels provide physical insights is insufficient.
- The computational efficiency and scalability of the method for large-scale problems need to be addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental evaluation by including a broader range of tasks and more complex PDE systems to assess scalability. Additionally, we suggest incorporating more out-of-distribution (OOD) testing to enhance generalization insights. A detailed analysis of the computational complexity of NAO, particularly regarding data requirements and integration with existing physics-informed machine learning approaches, would be beneficial. Finally, providing open-source code on platforms like GitHub or GitLab could facilitate replication and practical application of the framework.
