Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into AI-generated image detection, focusing on the impact of semantic artifacts on detector performance. The authors propose a patch-based training approach to enhance generalization across different image scenes and generators. Experiments reveal that various generators produce distinct artifacts, leading to performance drops in cross-scene and cross-generator settings. The proposed method outperforms baselines in some metrics but shows performance gaps in others, particularly between accuracy (ACC) and average precision (AP).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The problem of current detectors overfitting to dataset semantics is significant.  
- The preliminary experimental analysis of artifacts is enlightening.  
- The results support the effectiveness of the proposed method.  
- The experimental analysis, including comparisons and ablations, is sufficient for understanding model performance.  

Weaknesses:  
- The performance drop in cross-scene settings has been previously discussed in Dogoulis et al. (2023).  
- The method lacks methodological novelty, relying on a simple CNN model that processes image patches, with performance close to or worse than the state-of-the-art NPR model.  
- Significant performance gaps between ACC and AP persist, contrary to the method's claims.  
- Resizing images to 256 pixels reduces synthetic artifacts, which should be omitted for clarity on results.  
- Missing comparisons with existing approaches, particularly regarding patch-based learning and frequency visualizations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the performance of the model if resizing is completely omitted. Additionally, a comparison with the existing approach by Dogoulis et al. should be included to clarify differences. We suggest conducting experiments using images collected from fake news to enhance the relevance of the findings. Furthermore, including an ablation study on patch size and visualizations of real images would strengthen the paper. Finally, addressing the missing citations related to patch usage and discussing the potential of paired data to mitigate semantic artifacts would enhance the robustness of the proposed method.
