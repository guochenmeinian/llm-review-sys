Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel analysis of performance discrepancies in image classification models across different income levels and geographic regions, utilizing the annotated Dollar Street dataset. The authors provide insights into how factors such as texture, occlusion, lighting, colors, shapes, poses, and backgrounds contribute to these disparities. They demonstrate that texture debiasing can enhance model performance, particularly for low-income groups. The study includes a comprehensive set of annotations and experiments with models like CLIP and ViT, contributing valuable data to the research community. The authors also acknowledge the need for further work in mitigating other biases beyond texture and contextualize their conclusions with related works, including a discussion on limitations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
1. The paper addresses an important yet understudied issue in computer vision.
2. The thoroughness of the study and the clarity of the authors' responses to reviewer comments enhance its quality.
3. The annotations offer valuable insights into model failure modes and can guide the development of more robust methods.
4. The analysis of texture bias and its mitigation presents clear ethical and social implications for fairness in foundational models.
5. The addition of a new section discussing limitations strengthens the paper's contribution to the field.

**Weaknesses:**
1. The rationale for focusing on specific annotation factors such as colors, shapes, and poses is not adequately justified.
2. The claims regarding factor labels explaining performance disparities may overstate the correlation-causation relationship.
3. Some figures lack clarity, such as missing axis labels and the need for error bars to indicate meaningful differences.
4. The initial lack of clarity regarding the selection of image factors may confuse readers.
5. The placement of related works near the conclusions may obscure their relevance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the selected annotation factors to clarify their relevance. Additionally, consider relocating related works to an earlier section for better integration. It would be beneficial to add error bars in Figures 2, 4, and 6 to provide context for the observed differences. Furthermore, we suggest expanding the analysis to include other image quality factors such as blur and out-of-focus conditions, as well as exploring potential mitigations for other biases to enhance the robustness of their findings. Lastly, ensure that ethical considerations regarding the annotators' participation are clearly articulated to maintain transparency and explicitly acknowledge the limitations regarding the correlation versus causation claims in the analysis to align with the findings presented.
