### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to label distribution inference by predicting label distributions from ternary labels (0, 1, -1). The authors elucidate the theoretical advantages of ternary labels over binary labels through error analysis and propose a categorical distribution with dimensional monotonicity and orderliness (CateMO) to maintain the monotonicity and ordinality of probabilities associated with ternary labels. The work is validated through theoretical analysis and experimental results, demonstrating its significance in the label distribution learning (LDL) domain.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Originality: The paper introduces a unique learning paradigm by integrating three-way decision philosophies, effectively addressing the trade-off between accuracy and cost in label distribution quantification.
2. Quality: The proposed paradigm and CateMO distribution are rigorously established through theoretical foundations and experimental validation, with in-depth analyses of results.
3. Clarity: The paper is well-structured and articulated, with effective visual aids enhancing comprehension.
4. Significance: The work reduces barriers to implementing LDL algorithms, broadening their applicability.

Weaknesses:
1. Lack of introduction to three-way philosophies, which may hinder reader understanding.
2. Figures 2 and 3 are presented in the wrong order, and Figure 3 contains inaccuracies regarding the triangle area.
3. Insufficient experimental comparisons with existing label enhancement algorithms, limiting the demonstration of the proposed method's novelty and effectiveness.
4. Absence of parameter sensitivity analysis for the CateMO distribution, which is crucial for understanding its performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by providing a comprehensive overview of the three-way philosophies to aid reader comprehension. Additionally, the authors should correct the order of Figures 2 and 3 and ensure that Figure 3 accurately represents the triangle area. To strengthen the manuscript, we suggest including comparisons with existing label enhancement algorithms and expanding the experimental evaluation beyond three datasets. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to conduct a parameter sensitivity analysis of the CateMO distribution to clarify its robustness. Lastly, discussing the relationship between the proposed method and existing weakly supervised learning frameworks would enhance the manuscript's depth.
