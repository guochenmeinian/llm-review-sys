Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for estimating causal effects in bi-directional Mendelian randomization (MR) studies, addressing the challenges posed by invalid instruments and unmeasured confounding. The authors propose sufficient and necessary conditions for identifying valid instrumental variable (IV) sets and introduce a cluster fusion-like algorithm for accurate causal effect estimation. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through theoretical proofs and experimental results using synthetic data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper provides a comprehensive exploration of a significant problem in causal inference, establishing necessary and sufficient conditions for bi-directional MR models.  
- The proposed cluster fusion-like algorithm is well-founded and validated through extensive experiments, demonstrating its efficacy in estimating causal effects.  
- The writing is clear and accessible, making complex concepts understandable.

Weaknesses:  
- The reliance on linear causal relationships limits the practical applicability of the proposed approach.  
- The experimental validation is primarily based on synthetic datasets, which may not fully capture real-world complexities.  
- A deeper exploration of the assumptions made, particularly regarding the independence of genetic variants and the existence of valid IVs, is lacking.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the assumptions, particularly the necessity of the assumption in line 106 regarding $\beta_{X ->Y} \beta_{X->X} \neq 1$, and its implications if violated. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify why Assumption 3 is crucial for the identifiability of IVs. It would also be beneficial to address how the proposed method performs under confounding conditions among genetic variants. Exploring the potential for applying the method to non-linear causal relationships through linearization techniques could enhance its applicability. Finally, we encourage the authors to validate their findings with real-world datasets to strengthen the practical utility of their method.
