### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for Open Information Extraction (OIE) using Sentence as Chunk sequence (SaC) and an end-to-end BERT-based model called Chunk-OIE for sentence chunking and tuple extraction. The authors argue that SaC has superior properties compared to traditional token sequences, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple OIE datasets. The paper includes a statistical study on chunk alignment with OIE gold tuple spans and provides publicly available software and pre-trained models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on OIE datasets.  
- The presentation of the overall method is clear, supported by experiments and ablations.  
- The introduction of chunks as an intermediate representation is a novel approach.  

Weaknesses:  
- The theoretical justification for chunking over token-level extraction is not adequately supported, raising doubts about its performance advantages.  
- The chunk boundary and type identification process is vague, lacking clarity on how chunks can be defined and annotated across different datasets and languages.  
- Limited experimentation with non-English datasets and traditional NER and RE tasks, as well as insufficient discussion of related work, particularly the differences between UIE and OIE.  
- The model architecture is similar to prior works, limiting its perceived contribution.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the chunk boundary and type identification process, providing a more robust theoretical framework for chunk definition and annotation. Additionally, we suggest expanding the evaluation to include non-English datasets and traditional NER and RE tasks to demonstrate the model's versatility. A more thorough discussion of related work, particularly the distinctions between UIE and OIE, would enhance the paper's context. Finally, justifying the choice of span-finding methods with relevant references or ablations would strengthen the argument for the proposed approach.
