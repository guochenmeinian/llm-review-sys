Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework called the contrastive split-latent permutation autoencoder (CSLP-AE) for EEG signal conversion, aiming to disentangle task-related content and subject-specific style. The authors hypothesize that effective conversion requires learning latent representations that separate content and style, employing contrastive learning to achieve this. The CSLP-AE framework was tested on the ERP Core dataset, demonstrating a significant performance improvement of 51.7% in unseen-to-unseen subject conversions and achieving high accuracy in single-trial classifications. Additionally, the paper introduces DREAM, a contrastive autoencoder (C-AE) approach utilizing a variational autoencoder, which enhances latent representations for subject and task differentiation. The framework also facilitates EEG signal conversion for counterfactual scenarios. The authors acknowledge that while the split-latent permutation reconstruction cost shows promise, its benefits may vary depending on the application, particularly in sleep staging.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of CSLP-AE is an innovative contribution, leveraging disentangled representation learning from other domains to advance EEG analysis.
2. The split-latent permutation framework effectively promotes the extraction of generalizable patterns in EEG data.
3. The figures illustrating the framework and training tasks are clear, enhancing understanding of the proposed method.
4. The methods section provides detailed explanations, facilitating comprehension of the model's intricacies.
5. A comprehensive comparative analysis verifies the contribution of each proposed task, reinforcing the empirical robustness of the work.
6. The paper provides a comprehensive comparison of CSLP-AE with conventional C-AE, demonstrating similar performance metrics.
7. The authors have conducted ablation tests on the Sleep-EDF Expanded dataset, adding rigor to their findings.

Weaknesses:
1. Notations in the methods section could be improved; a clear key for symbols and abbreviations would enhance comprehension.
2. The manuscript lacks elaboration on how the model accommodates noise in EEG data, necessitating further analysis and discussion.
3. The difference between subject-specific and task-related latent features is not significantly distinct, warranting a discussion on this observation.
4. The potential benefits of the split-latent permutation reconstruction cost in sleep staging remain unclear, as it may not enhance performance in non-time-locked scenarios.
5. The absence of ablation tests for sleep data in the initial submission raised concerns about the robustness of the findings.
6. Text in Figure 3 is difficult to read; presenting t-SNE for S and T spaces separately may not intuitively display feature disentanglement.
7. The evaluation of reconstructed signal quality is limited; additional metrics like the Inception Score and Frechet Inception Distance would provide a more comprehensive assessment.
8. More extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods in EEG decoding and reconstruction tasks would strengthen the paper's validation.
9. A detailed outline of the model architecture and hyperparameters is necessary for improved reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of notations in the methods section by providing a comprehensive key for symbols and abbreviations. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on how the model accommodates noise in EEG data and discuss the implications of the observed similarity between subject-specific and task-related latent features. We suggest improving the discussion regarding the limitations of the split-latent permutation framework in non-time-locked domains, particularly in sleep staging. Including the results of the ablation tests for C-AE and SLP-AE on sleep data in the revised manuscript would provide a clearer understanding of the method's applicability. Enhancing the readability of Figure 3 and considering a combined t-SNE representation could improve visual clarity. We also suggest including additional evaluation metrics for reconstructed signal quality and conducting more extensive comparisons with current state-of-the-art methods in EEG decoding and reconstruction. Finally, providing a detailed outline of the model architecture and hyperparameters would greatly enhance reproducibility.
