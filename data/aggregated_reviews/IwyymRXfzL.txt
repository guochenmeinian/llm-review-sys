Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Perceptual Adjustment Query (PAQ), a novel mechanism for collecting human feedback that integrates cardinal reporting and ordinal reasoning. By identifying a transition point along a continuum, PAQ allows for a more expressive evaluation of similarity compared to traditional methods. The authors frame the problem within Mahalanobis distance learning, leading to a low-rank matrix estimation challenge. They propose techniques such as sample averaging and truncation to address specific challenges, supported by theoretical and simulation analyses.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The PAQ method effectively reduces cognitive burden while enhancing the expressiveness of human responses.
- The integration of PAQ with Mahalanobis metric learning introduces a new approach to understanding perceptual data.
- The paper is well-structured and presents coherent theoretical guarantees and numerical experiments.

Weaknesses:
- There is a lack of empirical validation in real-world applications, with no implementation guidance or synthetic tests provided.
- The method's reliance on a pre-trained generative model with a linear latent space limits its applicability.
- Proposed solutions to challenges, such as averaging and truncation, are somewhat expected and lack novelty.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical validation of the PAQ by conducting real-world experiments and providing implementation guidance. Clarifying whether the continuum should be continuous or discretized is essential. Additionally, the authors should explore the applicability of PAQ beyond Mahalanobis metric learning and include comparative experiments with existing metric learning algorithms to illustrate the proposed method's value. Addressing formatting and expression inconsistencies, as well as providing clearer definitions and descriptions of the proposed techniques, would enhance the paper's clarity and rigor.
