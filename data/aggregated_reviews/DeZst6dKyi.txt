Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for efficient optimization using Frequent Directions (FD) to implement a low-rank preconditioner for gradient-based optimizers, specifically targeting both full-matrix AdaGrad and Shampoo. The authors propose a sketching scheme that leverages the low-rank nature of the Kronecker-factored gradient covariance matrix, aiming to reduce memory usage while maintaining performance. The theoretical analysis combines the regret bounds of FD with those of AdaGrad, resulting in a trade-off between regret and memory efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The observation regarding the low-rankedness of the Kronecker-factored covariance matrix is intriguing.
- The theoretical analysis is rigorous and well-motivated, providing a sound regret analysis for the proposed methods.
- Experimental results demonstrate improvements over existing baseline methods like Shampoo.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the approach is questionable, as the use of FD for optimization problems is not particularly innovative, and the paper does not convincingly demonstrate that FD is a superior method.
- The experiments do not show significant improvements in time or memory compared to existing implementations.
- Theorems, particularly Theorem 3, appear weak, with concerns about the error bounds and their implications for performance.
- The relationship between the proposed Sketchy AdaGrad and existing methods like Robust Frequent Directions (RFD) and Spectral Compensation Frequent Directions (SCFD) is unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by explicitly discussing the differences between their proposed algorithms and existing methods such as RFD and SCFD. A detailed comparison would help clarify the contributions of the work. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the experimental section to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed methods against existing implementations, including wall-time comparisons. Finally, we encourage the authors to refine the theoretical analysis, particularly regarding the bounds presented in Theorem 3, to address concerns about their robustness and relevance.
