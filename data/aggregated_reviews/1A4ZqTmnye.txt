Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a task-aware distributed source coding framework called NDPCA (Neural Distributed Principal Component Analysis) aimed at efficiently compressing correlated data in multi-sensor networks. The authors formulate the problem and solve it in a linear setting using their method DPCA, while also addressing bandwidth allocation and analyzing DPCA reconstruction loss bounds. NDPCA extends DPCA to nonlinear tasks by integrating a neural autoencoder, and the experiments demonstrate that NDPCA performs comparably or better than three baseline methods across three tasks, achieving a balance between performance and bandwidth.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The novel idea of compressing data from distributed sources based on their importance is effective, providing valuable insights for nonlinear problem scenarios.
2. The training and inference methods of NDPCA do not require retraining for different bandwidths, which conserves computational and storage resources.
3. The experiments comprehensively compare the proposed framework against three baseline methods across various tasks, highlighting the advantages of task-aware NDPCA.

Weaknesses:
1. The theoretical analysis in sections 2 and 3 is limited to linear scenarios, which does not robustly support the application of NDPCA in nonlinear contexts.
2. The experiments are constrained to only two data sources, limiting the analysis of NDPCA's performance with larger datasets.
3. The autoencoders struggle with generalizing out-of-distribution data, a significant limitation that could hinder NDPCA's practical applicability in real-time data transmission scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis to encompass nonlinear scenarios, thereby strengthening the justification for NDPCA's applicability. Additionally, we suggest expanding the experimental framework to include more than two data sources to better assess NDPCA's scalability and performance. It would also be beneficial for the authors to address the generalization issue of autoencoders with out-of-distribution data, potentially enhancing the framework's utility in dynamic environments. Lastly, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the reasons behind NDPCA's performance compared to other methods, particularly in the context of the "Locate and Lift" task.
