Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Fourier-based Kernel Entropy Approximation (FKEA) metric, which efficiently evaluates the diversity of generated samples. The authors propose two key contributions: (1) FKEA-based metrics (FKEA-VENDI and FKEA-RKE) are more computationally efficient than existing metrics like VENDI and RKE, reducing complexity to \(O(n)\) for a sample size \(n\); (2) The metric is reference-free, applicable to large-scale image, text, and video datasets for generative models. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed metric.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured, and the theoretical results are technically sound.
- The proposed metric demonstrates improved computational efficiency and can be calculated without sophisticated hardware setups.
- The method is broadly applicable for assessing various generative models.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation method relies on parameters like \(\sigma\) and \(r\), whose influence on results is unexplored. The authors use different values for different datasets without justification.
- A toy example illustrating the difference between reference-dependent and reference-free metrics is lacking, making discussions in Sections 1 and 2 less concrete.
- An evaluation time comparison between FKEA-based metrics and their original counterparts is missing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of parameter selection by providing guidelines for choosing \(\sigma\) and \(r\) and discussing their impact on evaluation results. Additionally, incorporating a toy example would enhance understanding of the metrics. We also suggest including experimental results that demonstrate the limitations of reference-dependent metrics compared to reference-free metrics. Finally, an evaluation time comparison between FKEA-VENDI and VENDI would provide valuable insights into the efficiency of the proposed metrics.
