Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Cluster-Learngene, an innovative method for initializing Vision Transformer models by adaptively clustering attention heads and feed-forward networks (FFNs) from a large pre-trained ancestry model. Key features include adaptive clustering based on density characteristics, efficient initialization through priority weight-sharing and learnable parameter transformations, and resource customization tailored to downstream tasks. Empirical validation shows that Cluster-Learngene outperforms traditional initialization strategies and is competitive with resource-intensive fine-tuning methods, achieving faster convergence and higher data efficiency across various model scales and tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Originality: The method introduces a novel approach to model initialization by clustering attention heads and FFNs, creating "learngenes."
- Quality: The research is thorough, with robust empirical validation across multiple datasets.
- Clarity: The paper is well-structured and articulates complex methodologies effectively.
- Significance: It addresses critical issues in efficient model scaling for resource-constrained environments.
- Creative Combination: The approach effectively merges existing concepts to enhance model initialization.

Weaknesses:
- Lack of comparison to other clustering methods, such as k-means.
- Limited experimental evaluation focused primarily on image classification, lacking broader task assessments like object detection or segmentation.
- Formatting issues in the paper, including unclear sections and insufficient experimental comparisons with existing methods like Learngene.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison of Cluster-Learngene with other clustering methods to highlight its advantages. Additionally, expanding the experimental evaluation to include a wider range of vision tasks and architectures would better demonstrate the generalizability of the approach. We suggest providing a complexity analysis or time cost assessments for Cluster-Learngene to clarify its computational efficiency. An ablation study on hyperparameters, particularly Îµ, would enhance understanding of their impact on performance. Lastly, addressing the clarity and coherence of the abstract would significantly improve the paper's overall impact.
