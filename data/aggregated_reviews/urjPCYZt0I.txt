Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents JailbreakBench, an open-source benchmark for evaluating jailbreak attacks on large language models (LLMs). The benchmark includes a repository of jailbreak artifacts, a dataset of jailbreak behaviors, a standardized evaluation framework, and a leaderboard for tracking performance. The authors aim to standardize the evaluation process for jailbreaks, addressing the lack of reproducibility and comparability in existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The benchmark includes nearly 100 jailbreaking behaviors for evaluation, enhancing its utility.
- The open-sourced code is well-structured, facilitating reproducibility and community contributions.
- The evaluation framework and leaderboard provide a unified metric for assessing various models and algorithms.
- The repository supports good reproducibility, extensibility, and accessibility based on community feedback.

Weaknesses:
- The number of evaluated attacks and defenses is limited, with only 4 attacks and 5 defenses compared to other benchmarks like HarmBench, which includes 18 attacks.
- The benchmark does not account for fine-grain factors such as attack budgets, potentially leading to unfair comparisons.
- There is insufficient detail on the unique features of the adversarial prompts and the JBB-Behaviors dataset.
- The current support for LLMs is limited, which undermines claims of extensibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the benchmark by adding a section that compares JailbreakBench's performance and methodology with other benchmarks to highlight its advantages. Additionally, consider expanding the number of evaluated attacks and defenses, particularly incorporating in-context-learning-based methods like ICA and MSJ. It would also be beneficial to include more settings such as universal and transfer attack settings. Furthermore, providing more details on the unique advantages of the JBB-Behaviors dataset and the adversarial prompts would enhance clarity. Lastly, we suggest adding a local install option for easier debugging and ensuring that metadata, such as model-specific data, is readily available in the repository.
