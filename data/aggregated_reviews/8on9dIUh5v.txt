Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the effectiveness of two data augmentation techniques, Cutout and CutMix, in enhancing feature learning within convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The authors demonstrate that while standard empirical risk minimization (ERM) fails to learn rare and extremely rare features, Cutout and CutMix improve performance by focusing on these features and mitigating noise. The findings are supported by numerical experiments and real-world data, particularly on CIFAR-10.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides the first theoretical insights into the performance of Cutout and CutMix, addressing a significant gap in the literature.
- It effectively compares ERM with Cutout and CutMix, highlighting the latter's ability to learn rare features while ignoring noise.
- The theoretical results align well with numerical experiments, reinforcing the validity of the claims.

Weaknesses:
- The definitions of common, rare, and extremely rare features are not clearly articulated, which complicates the manuscript's readability.
- The analysis is limited to Cutout and CutMix, neglecting other relevant data augmentation methods.
- The theoretical framework lacks detailed discussions on practical implications and computational costs associated with implementing these methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of definitions for common, rare, and extremely rare features in Section 2.1 to enhance readability. Additionally, we suggest expanding the analysis to include other data augmentation techniques to provide a more comprehensive understanding. The authors should also include a discussion on the computational costs of Cutout and CutMix compared to ERM, as well as provide more practical guidance on hyperparameter selection in Section 2.4. Finally, we encourage the authors to conduct further real-world evaluations, particularly on CIFAR-10, to substantiate their theoretical claims.
