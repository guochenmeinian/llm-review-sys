Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents OBELISC, a large-scale dataset of interleaved image-text documents aimed at supporting open-source multimodal models. The dataset includes a vast collection of filtered web documents and demonstrates the potential of models trained on multimodal data, showing that they can serve as compelling alternatives to closed datasets. The authors provide a detailed description of the dataset construction process and compare the performance of models trained on OBELISC with those trained on other datasets, particularly highlighting its scale, quality, and diversity. The authors also propose comparisons with mmc4, noting the challenges of concurrent work, and acknowledge that while Flamingo evaluates on 16 tasks, their model has been tested on 6 datasets, with updates indicating improved performance on various benchmarks. Additionally, they address issues related to dataset licensing, challenges in downloading images, and the presence of noisy data in the dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed large-scale image-text dataset is beneficial for the community and represents a significant contribution to the field of multimodal machine learning.
- The paper offers a comprehensive analysis of the dataset and its construction process, including improvements in model evaluation and performance reporting, such as the introduction of a new interactive visualization tool.
- It is well-written and easy to understand, with strong documentation and a clear description of the filtering methods used.
- The dataset has potential applications in various domains, such as information retrieval and multimodal chatbots.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset lacks clear licensing information, which is essential for potential users.
- Limited performance comparisons with mmc4 and other similar datasets may hinder the assessment of OBELISC's effectiveness.
- There is insufficient comparison with similar image-text datasets regarding performance metrics, particularly in relation to the challenges posed by noisy data and difficulties in downloading a complete dataset.
- The paper does not provide enough downstream application examples or detailed explanations of the filtering and ingestion processes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the dataset's licensing information to facilitate its use. Additionally, the authors should conduct a more thorough comparison with similar datasets, such as mmc4, by training baseline models and presenting performance metrics across various applications. Improving performance comparisons by including additional datasets beyond mmc4 would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of OBELISC. Addressing the presence of noisy data and the challenges in downloading images would enhance dataset quality. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors elaborate on the unique filtering and ingestion processes used to create the dataset, as this would better establish its significance in the field. Finally, providing several downstream application examples would enhance the paper's impact and illustrate the practical utility of the dataset.
