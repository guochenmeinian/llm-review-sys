### Key Points
This paper presents the first results for non-credible auctions, where the auction format is a convex combination of first and second price, parameterized by $\alpha_0$. The authors provide a range of regret bounds based on the knowledge of $\alpha_0$ and the distribution of highest competing bids. Specifically, they achieve $0$, $\tilde O(\sqrt T)$, and $\tilde O(T^{2/3})$ regret for second-price, first-price, and a strict combination of the two when $\alpha_0$ is known. When $\alpha_0$ is unknown but the distribution is known, they achieve $O(\log^2 T)$ regret. If both are known, they offer $\tilde O(T^{2/3})$ regret in the bandit feedback model and $\tilde O(\sqrt T)$ in the full information model. All regret bounds are tight up to $\log T$ factors.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a novel and relevant problem in auction theory, providing comprehensive theoretical results.
- The regret bounds presented are tight and demonstrate significant technical depth.
- The writing is generally clear, making the algorithms and technical challenges understandable.

Weaknesses:
- The credibility model oversimplifies real-world scenarios, as it assumes a static cheating strategy, which may not reflect actual seller behavior.
- The independence assumption of the highest competing bid distribution from the bidders' valuations is questionable and may not hold in practice.
- The practical relevance of the problem is not sufficiently argued, and the novelty is somewhat limited due to reliance on existing learning algorithms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation of the regret lower bound in Corollary 5.1 by rephrasing it to clarify that "in the worst case for any $\alpha_0$ we get $\Omega(T^{2/3})$ regret." Additionally, we suggest providing toy examples or numerical studies to enhance the understanding of the theoretical results. It would also be beneficial to discuss the challenges of moving beyond the current credibility model and to justify the assumptions regarding the independence of distributions. Lastly, the authors should strengthen the argument for the practical relevance of their findings by identifying specific markets where these issues may arise.
