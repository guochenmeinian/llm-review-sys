### Key Points
This paper presents GeCo, a unified architecture for low-shot counting that integrates object detection and segmentation. GeCo addresses limitations of current methods by generalizing object prototypes across diverse appearances and introducing a new counting loss that optimizes detection tasks. The architecture achieves significant improvements in detection accuracy and count estimation, setting a new benchmark in low-shot counting. The authors propose a framework that utilizes the SAM backbone for feature extraction, implementing Dense Query Encoder (DQE) and Dense Query Decoder (DQD) for detecting prototypes in few-shot and zero-shot setups.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. GeCo combines object detection and segmentation in a single framework, enhancing efficiency and performance.
2. The novel dense object query formulation improves generalization of object prototypes, reducing false positives.
3. The proposed counting loss directly optimizes detection tasks, leading to more accurate object counts and better handling of annotation noise.
4. GeCo surpasses existing few-shot detection-based counters by approximately 25% in total count MAE and demonstrates robustness in one-shot and zero-shot scenarios.

Weaknesses:
1. The complexity and computational requirements of the GeCo architecture may limit its scalability and real-time applicability, particularly in resource-constrained environments.
2. The paper lacks explicit architectural components or techniques specifically designed for low-shot scenarios.
3. Performance on heterogeneous datasets with significant intra-class variability is not adequately demonstrated.
4. The effectiveness of GeCo in scenarios involving small objects or high-density areas has not been thoroughly explored.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the choice of the SAM framework over other backbone networks, specifically addressing its generalization and performance compared to models like ResNet or EfficientNet. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explicitly outline design elements that make GeCo suitable for low-shot learning, including any modifications that address low-shot challenges. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to evaluate GeCo's performance on datasets with significant intra-class variability and to explore its effectiveness in scenarios involving small objects or high-density regions.
