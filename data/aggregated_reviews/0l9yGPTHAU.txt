Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of distributionally robust Markov decision processes (RMDPs) in the discounted infinite-horizon setting, focusing on the transition kernel's uncertainty modeled using L_p norms. The authors propose a model-based approach that constructs an empirical approximation of the reference transition kernel and applies distributional robust value iteration. They demonstrate that their method converges to the optimal robust policy under conditions of sa-rectangularity and s-rectangularity, establishing upper bounds and sample complexity results. The authors improve upon previous work by showing near minimax optimality for any choice of L_p norm and that solving s-rectangular RMDPs is not more complex than sa-rectangular RMDPs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper improves existing upper and lower bounds, demonstrating near minimax optimality for any L_p norm.
- It provides a comprehensive literature review and articulates the contributions clearly.
- The analysis employs a novel dual formulation for RMDPs optimization, which may be of independent interest.

Weaknesses:
- Minor typos, formatting inconsistencies, and punctuation errors are present.
- The paper closely aligns with Clavier et al. [2023], necessitating clearer differentiation of unique contributions.
- The focus on the tabular setting limits the applicability of insights to function approximation contexts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions by providing a more in-depth discussion comparing their work to Clavier et al. [2023]. Additionally, establishing lower bounds in the s-rectangularity setting for any L_p norm would strengthen the paper. We suggest addressing minor typos and formatting issues to enhance readability. Finally, incorporating empirical evaluations to support the theoretical bounds would significantly improve the manuscript's overall impact.
