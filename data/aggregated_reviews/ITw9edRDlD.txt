Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the phenomenon of emergent abilities in language models, arguing that these abilities are largely artifacts of the evaluation metrics used. The authors propose that when linear or continuous scoring metrics are applied, the emergent behaviors, which are typically sharp and unpredictable, become smooth and predictable. They provide empirical evidence through a toy model, analyses of GPT-3/InstructGPT, and experiments with image reconstruction tasks to support their claims. Additionally, the authors focus on various metrics, particularly BLEU and ROUGE-L-Sum, and express discomfort with disregarding previous claims of emergence, clarifying that their findings indicate that 34 out of 39 BIG-Bench metrics show no signs of emergent abilities. They also propose a new Limitations section in the main text and a longer commentary in the Discussion section regarding alternative hypotheses, along with a new Appendix section discussing the relationship between emergent abilities and grokking, as well as a subsection on BLEU as a metric.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and timely, addressing a significant topic in the field.
- It presents a reasonable and intuitive claim regarding the influence of discrete metrics on perceived emergence.
- The empirical evaluations are thorough, including analyses of various models and tasks.
- The authors are open to revising their work based on feedback, indicating a collaborative approach to research.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the paper is somewhat limited, as the idea that metrics influence emergence has been previously proposed.
- There is insufficient discussion of related work on emergence and progress measures, particularly in the context of grokking.
- The relationship between the authors' hypothesis and alternative theories of emergence is not adequately explored.
- The paper lacks a discussion on the BLEU score metric, despite its relevance to many tasks, which may leave readers with unanswered questions.
- Some figures are small and difficult to read, and the authors' hesitance to comment on BLEU could undermine the comprehensiveness of their analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related work, particularly addressing the contributions of grokking and how it relates to their findings. Additionally, the authors should clarify the relationship between their hypothesis and alternative theories of emergence. A discussion of the BLEU score metric should be included to address its apparent high emergence scores in various tasks, specifically considering reproducing an analysis similar to Figure 9 for the BLEU metric to further investigate its sharpness. Furthermore, we suggest enhancing the readability of figures and considering the use of clearer terminology regarding "sudden emergence" versus "gradual emergence." Lastly, we advise the authors to revise claims that may overstate their conclusions, ensuring that limitations of the evidence are acknowledged throughout the paper.
