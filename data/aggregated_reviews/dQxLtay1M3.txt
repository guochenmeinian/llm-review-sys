### Key Points
This paper presents a hypernetwork-based decoupling approach for few-shot relation extraction (FSRE), specifically addressing the FewRel and FewRel 2.0 datasets. The authors propose a model comprising three components: an encoder for relation representation, a network generator for initializing relation classifiers, and the classifiers for predicting relations of query instances. The method employs a two-step training strategy and a class-agnostic aligner to mitigate overfitting and enhance generalization. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the method's effectiveness compared to various baselines, including RE pre-trained models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is based on solid preliminary observations and is well-motivated.
- The experiments are comprehensive, yielding strong results, particularly in improving upon RE pre-trained models.
- The ablation study effectively demonstrates the necessity of each component in the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of applying existing components in FSRE is limited, and the experimental improvements are marginal, especially against GM_GEN.
- The contributions of the work are not explicitly highlighted in the introduction, requiring readers to dig for them.
- The paper lacks citations for relevant works, such as MoCo and deepstruct, which diminishes its scholarly rigor.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by explicitly highlighting the contributions of their work. Additionally, the authors should discuss the differences between their approach and existing works, such as "Sylph: A hypernetwork framework for incremental few-shot object detection" and deepstruct. To strengthen the experimental results, we suggest conducting statistical significance tests with multiple experiment runs and clarifying the details regarding the fine-tuning of the classifier embedding. Finally, we encourage the authors to include missing references to enhance the paper's credibility.
