Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for estimating parameters of exponential-family distributions from truncated samples, extending previous work primarily focused on Gaussian distributions. The authors propose a polynomial-time algorithm that utilizes maximum likelihood estimation followed by projected stochastic gradient descent (SGD), leveraging an oracle to determine whether points lie within the truncation set. The theoretical foundation is robust, demonstrating convergence under specific assumptions related to bounded variance and log-concavity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
* The proofs are thorough and correct, providing a solid theoretical basis for the proposed methods.
* The authors effectively introduce their assumptions and results at a non-technical level before delving into more complex formal results.
* The algorithm is simple and elegant, making the approach appealing.

Weaknesses:
* The technical presentation lacks clarity, with insufficient big-picture overviews and a disconnect between informal results and technical details.
* The paper lacks motivation and concrete examples illustrating real-world scenarios where the oracle property applies, which could enhance its relevance to a broader audience.
* There is an absence of numerical examples to validate the theoretical results, which would provide an independent check on the algorithm's performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the flow of the technical sections by providing a clearer synthesis of the contributions and possibly moving some proofs to the appendix for better readability. Additionally, including specific real-world examples to motivate the study would be beneficial. We also suggest that the authors incorporate numerical demonstrations of the algorithm's performance, even if in a supplementary format, to substantiate the theoretical claims made in the paper.
