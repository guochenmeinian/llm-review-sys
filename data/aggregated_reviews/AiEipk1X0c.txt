### Key Points
This paper presents G2MILP, a deep generative framework designed to generate mixed-integer linear program (MILP) instances, addressing the challenge of limited real-world data for combinatorial optimization problems. The authors propose a novel approach that utilizes masked variational autoencoders (VAE) and masked autoencoders (MAE) to represent MILP instances as bipartite graphs. The framework iteratively corrupts and replaces parts of these graphs, generating new instances that maintain the structures and computational complexity of real-world datasets. The experimental results indicate that the generated instances closely resemble real-world datasets, aiding in the enhancement of MILP solvers when data availability is constrained. The authors clarify that while the concepts of MAE and VAE are well-explored, their specific application to MILP generation introduces valuable innovations and differentiates their work from existing literature.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a novel approach to generating MILP instances, leveraging a masked VAE and MAE.
2. The methodology is well-motivated and clearly presented, making it accessible to readers.
3. The experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, with thorough evaluations across various datasets.
4. The framework effectively addresses the issue of limited training data for MILP solvers.
5. The incorporation of additional statistics for structural similarity calculations enhances the robustness of their results.

Weaknesses:
1. The lack of robust baseline comparisons makes it difficult to assess the true effectiveness of the proposed method.
2. The novelty of the approach may be perceived as limited due to the established nature of generative frameworks in the literature.
3. The presentation of certain figures and tables, particularly Table 8 and Figure 2, lacks clarity and requires standard deviation reporting for better understanding.
4. Some explanations regarding the neural network's implementation and notation may lack clarity, leading to confusion about the relationship between predicted probabilities and model inputs.
5. The methodology, particularly the masking process, is not sufficiently detailed, leading to confusion regarding its implementation and effectiveness.
6. The significance of the proposed method is questioned, as it primarily modifies existing instances rather than generating fundamentally new ones.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their methodology, particularly regarding the masking process and its implications for instance generation. Additionally, providing "fair" comparisons on downstream proxy tasks with other popular methods would strengthen the paper's contributions. We also suggest enhancing the presentation of Table 8 and Figure 2 by including standard deviations and clarifying their differences. Furthermore, we recommend improving the clarity of explanations regarding the neural network's implementation, particularly how the predicted probabilities are utilized in relation to the model inputs. Finally, refining the notation for consistency throughout the paper and releasing the code as promised would facilitate further validation and application of the proposed framework.
