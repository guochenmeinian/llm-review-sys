Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a neural compression paradigm, NeCGS, aimed at effectively compressing diverse sets of 3D geometry models. The authors propose a two-stage framework that first converts irregular mesh models into a regular 4D TSDF-Def volume representation, followed by a quantization-aware auto-decoder network to achieve redundancy elimination and compact representation. The method claims to outperform state-of-the-art techniques in both accuracy and preservation of geometric details across various datasets. Additionally, the authors demonstrate that their method achieves reasonable accuracy with resolutions of 128 or 256, requiring approximately 16 to 24 hours for optimization on a dataset of 600 geometries. They also propose a three-stage optimization strategy to reduce time when handling larger datasets, which involves optimizing embedded features while keeping decoder weights fixed.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a unique method leveraging neural networks for 3D geometry compression, achieving impressive compression ratios.
- High accuracy and preservation of geometric structures are maintained even at high compression ratios, supported by comprehensive experiments and ablation studies.
- The method shows significant improvements in reconstruction accuracy for unseen meshes compared to existing techniques like GPCC and VPCC.
- The proposed three-stage optimization strategy effectively reduces compression time for larger datasets.
- The inclusion of source code enhances reproducibility and transparency.
- The organization and clarity of the methodology and results are commendable.

Weaknesses:
- The optimization process for TSDF-Def volumes is excessively time-consuming (over 15 hours), which limits practical applications.
- Generalization to more complex or varied 3D geometry sets remains unclear, particularly for geometries with thin structures or open boundaries.
- The rationale for selecting the auto-decoder network over other architectures is insufficiently explained.
- A more thorough comparison of computational resource trade-offs with existing techniques is lacking.
- The comparison with existing methods lacks rigor, particularly regarding the complexity of geometries used in visual results.
- The authors need to benchmark the generalization versus compression time trade-off on a larger and more complex pool of shapes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the long optimization time required for TSDF-Def volumes, potentially focusing on methods to accelerate this process. Additionally, the authors should provide a clearer explanation of the choice of the auto-decoder network and include a comparative analysis of computational costs with baseline methods. It would be beneficial to include scalability tests to evaluate performance with larger and more complex datasets. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors benchmark the models' generalization versus compression time trade-off on a larger and more complex pool of shapes to enhance the robustness of their findings. Finally, addressing the generalization capabilities of the method and providing more insights into how it handles new geometries would strengthen the paper.
