Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Prompt Bias Calibration (PBC) method to address prompt-template bias in reward modeling for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). The authors propose combining PBC with existing length bias correction methods to mitigate biases in response generation. Experimental results indicate that their method outperforms baselines on academic benchmarks and demonstrates hyperparameter stability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The problem of bias in RLHF is significant and potentially impactful if addressed effectively.
2. The PBC method is innovative and easy to implement, showing strong empirical validation.
3. Illustrative figures enhance understanding of the concepts.

Weaknesses:
1. Academic metrics like MMLU are not suitable for RLHF; MT-bench is preferred.
2. The presentation lacks clarity, particularly regarding the problem being addressed and the meaning of notations in equations.
3. There are no error bars in the results, making it difficult to assess the strength of the findings.
4. The novelty of the proposed method is questioned, and some aspects of the theoretical analysis are unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the problem statement and the notations used in the equations, particularly in Equation (5) and Equation (6). Additionally, please include error bars in Table 2 and Figure 4 to provide a clearer understanding of the results' reliability. It would also be beneficial to report the accuracy of different reward models in the experiments and consider including real-world case studies to illustrate the contributions of the paper. Finally, we suggest providing a more robust theoretical analysis to clarify the assumptions made in the methodology.
