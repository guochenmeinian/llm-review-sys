### Key Points
This paper presents the Granual AMR Parsing Evaluation Suite (GrAPES), an evaluation suite for AMR parsing that includes a corpus of AMR graphs from AMRBank 3.0 and newly annotated sentences. It features 36 categories grouped into 9 sets, focusing on various phenomena such as pragmatic coreference and structural generation. The authors apply this suite to evaluate three AMR parsers, providing detailed statistical analysis of the results. The study emphasizes the need for a more nuanced evaluation beyond traditional metrics like Smatch.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The evaluation suite is comprehensive, covering a wide range of phenomena and informed by practical applications.
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with thorough experiments and detailed analyses.
- It introduces both a dataset and standard tools for comparing AMR parsers, enhancing reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity regarding the availability of the evaluation suite and tools for other researchers.
- There is significant overlap with previously proposed metrics, and the uniqueness of the contributions is not sufficiently demonstrated.
- Some comparisons with prior work are unclear, which may hinder understanding of the contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity on the availability of GrAPES and the analysis software for other researchers, including details on licensing and publication timelines. Additionally, we suggest that the authors compare and contrast their proposed metrics with existing ones to highlight the uniqueness of their contributions. Addressing how this work can be adapted for other grammatical formalisms like CFGs and CCGs would also enhance its applicability. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the relationship between structural generalization and long input texts in their analysis.
