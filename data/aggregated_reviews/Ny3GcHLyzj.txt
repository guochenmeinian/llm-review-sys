Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework called CONPE (contrastive prompt ensemble) aimed at efficient adaptation of vision-based robot learning tasks. The authors propose an ensemble of visual prompts learned through contrastive learning, which are domain orthogonal and applied in downstream tasks using a guided-attention-based prompt ensemble module. The framework aims to achieve task-specific and domain-invariant visual features, demonstrating effectiveness through various experimental results across multiple environments, including AI2THOR, Metaworld, and CARLA.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant issue of environment generalization in robotics learning with an intuitive and efficient method.
- The combination of contrastive learning and visual prompts leads to improved performance over existing baselines.
- Extensive experiments and ablation studies provide a comprehensive understanding of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a discussion on the impact of changes in the appearance of the robot arm/hand, which could disrupt manipulation tasks.
- The visual representations in virtual environments are simpler than in real-world scenarios, necessitating supportive real-world experimental results.
- Terminology used in the paper, such as "prompt" and "zero-shot performance," is confusing and not well-defined, leading to potential misunderstandings.
- The evaluated tasks are relatively simplistic, lacking more challenging scenarios that would enhance the paper's credibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their terminology, particularly around "prompt" and "zero-shot performance," to avoid confusion. Additionally, we encourage the authors to include a limitation section that discusses the potential struggles of CONPE, especially regarding domain factors that vary beyond the training data. It would also be beneficial to incorporate more complex and realistic tasks in the evaluation to strengthen the paper's contributions. Lastly, we suggest providing supportive real-world experimental results to validate the framework's applicability outside of simulated environments.
