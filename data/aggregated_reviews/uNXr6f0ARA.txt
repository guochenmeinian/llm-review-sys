### Key Points
This paper presents the BSG framework, which aims to balance the smoothness of graph embeddings in self-supervised learning (SSL) through a mutual information-based decomposition of the SSL objective into neighbor loss, minimal loss, and divergence loss. The authors validate their method with extensive experiments on real-world datasets, demonstrating improved performance on benchmark tasks such as node classification and link prediction.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method is interesting, straightforward, and easy to understand.
2. The paper is well-organized, clearly written, and supported by rigorous theoretical analysis.
3. Comprehensive experiments cover multiple tasks, providing strong evidence for the method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the method is limited, as the neighbor-based similarity constraint is common in recent literature; the authors need to clarify their contributions.
2. The method relies on the homophily assumption, limiting its applicability to heterophilic graphs; a discussion on extending the approach to these graphs is necessary.
3. The paper lacks a comprehensive experimental comparison with existing methods that address over-smoothing, and the distinctions between these methods and the proposed approach should be clarified.
4. Some experimental results are not statistically significant, and the improvements observed are marginal; additional evaluations on graph classification or node clustering tasks are recommended.
5. The derivation process of the formulas in Section 4.1 should be included in the appendix for clarity, and the transition from Equation (5) to Equation (6) requires further explanation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the discussion regarding the trade-off terms in Equation (6) and provide specific embedding smoothness values for both their proposed method and baseline methods to strengthen their argument. Additionally, the authors should categorize the baselines in Section 5.1 to indicate which exhibit over-smoothing and which exhibit under-smoothing. A more detailed README for the code repository would facilitate understanding and execution. Lastly, addressing the statistical significance of results and clarifying the differences in objective functions for node classification and edge prediction would enhance the paper's rigor.
