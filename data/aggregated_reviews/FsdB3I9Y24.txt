Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Projected Diffusion Models (PDM) for constrained generative modeling, reformulating the denoising process of diffusion models as a constrained optimization problem. The authors propose iteratively projecting generated samples onto a constraint set at each denoising step, demonstrating the method's effectiveness across various applications involving both convex and non-convex constraints. The approach is theoretically justified, providing guarantees for feasibility and optimality under certain conditions. The authors emphasize the necessity of satisfying constraints for feasibility, particularly in contexts like material science where data collection is costly and constraints are imposed by domain experts. They argue that while high-quality samples are desirable, feasible samples are essential, and they provide detailed responses to reviewer questions, clarifying the computational metrics used, the significance of Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) scores, and the implications of their findings for real-world applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and clearly articulates the method and its motivations.
- The method demonstrates effectiveness under various constraints, ensuring high-quality sample generation.
- The authors provide thorough clarifications regarding the theoretical underpinnings and implementation details of their model.
- The approach is straightforward to implement and compatible with existing diffusion models, requiring only a projection operator at inference.
- The use of FID scores alongside constraint satisfaction metrics is a robust approach for evaluating model performance.
- The paper demonstrates strong empirical results, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various sections.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on FID scores for empirical comparisons raises concerns about their relevance in specialized domains explored in the work, particularly regarding their applicability to out-of-distribution datasets.
- The novelty of PDM as an optimization technique is questioned, as it appears to apply existing post-processing projections to the Langevin MCMC sampling scheme without sufficient clarification on its unique contributions.
- Increased computational cost is acknowledged as a limitation, particularly in relation to constraint adherence.
- Concerns are raised regarding the potential impact of projections on sample quality, with some reviewers questioning the trade-off between constraint satisfaction and sample fidelity.
- The mathematical description of the projection operator and constraints in experiments could be more concrete to enhance understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the mathematical descriptions of the projection operator and constraints used in experiments to better convey the degree of non-convexity and difficulty. Additionally, it is important to address the computational overhead associated with applying the projection operator at each SGLD iteration more prominently in the main text, rather than relegating this information to the appendix. We also suggest providing a clearer distinction between PDM and existing methods like Cond and Cond+ using mathematical expressions to elucidate their differences. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the theoretical justification for the projection mechanism, particularly addressing concerns about its impact on sample quality. We encourage the authors to consider revising their approach to ensure that the balance between constraint satisfaction and sample fidelity is adequately addressed, particularly in non-convex settings. Finally, including pseudocode for the projection algorithm would enhance the comprehensibility of the methodology and exploring alternative metrics for evaluating sample quality beyond FID scores would be beneficial.
