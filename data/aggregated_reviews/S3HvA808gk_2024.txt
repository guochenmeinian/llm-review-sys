Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a critical examination of the claim that AUPRC is a superior metric to AUROC for class imbalance tasks. The authors theoretically characterize the behavior of AUROC and AUPRC, demonstrating that optimizing for AUROC minimizes the model’s FPR uniformly, while optimizing for AUPRC does so in a weighted manner favoring higher scores. Empirical experiments on both synthetic and real-world fairness datasets support their theoretical findings, revealing that AUPRC can introduce biases against low-scoring subpopulations. The authors provide guidance on metric selection based on specific scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces novel theoretical insights into the relationship between AUROC and AUPRC, highlighting their distinct optimization behaviors.
- Empirical validation through extensive synthetic and real-world experiments reinforces the theoretical claims.
- Clear guidance is provided on when to use AUROC versus AUPRC, enhancing practical applicability.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation is lacking clarity, particularly with unexplained terms like “high prevalence subgroup” and insufficient detail in Theorem 3.
- Figure 2 is corrupted, hindering assessment of results, and the caption of Figure 1 is excessively lengthy.
- There is repetition in Section 4 regarding Figure 1, and minor stylistic issues detract from the overall presentation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their presentation by providing detailed explanations for terms such as “high prevalence subgroup” and enhancing the clarity of Theorem 3. Additionally, please address the corruption of Figure 2 and consider revising the caption of Figure 1 for conciseness. We suggest compressing the repetitive content in Section 4 and ensuring that the theoretical results are presented without strong assumptions, such as perfect calibration. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore the implications of their findings across multiple subgroups rather than limiting the analysis to two.
