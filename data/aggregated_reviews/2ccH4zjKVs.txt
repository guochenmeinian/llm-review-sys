Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an algorithm for finding approximate second-order stationary points (SOSP) in the context of strong contamination models, specifically addressing robust matrix sensing problems. The authors demonstrate that their algorithm achieves dimension-independent accuracy guarantees and can robustly solve low-rank matrix sensing issues. The theoretical framework includes assumptions that allow the algorithm to yield approximate SOSPs with high probability, even under significant data corruption.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and clear, with a strong theoretical foundation supporting the proposed approach.  
- The application to robust low-rank matrix sensing is compelling and demonstrates the algorithm's efficacy.  
- The work provides the strongest guarantees for finding SOSPs in adversarial settings and introduces a novel combination of robust mean and Hessian approximation techniques.

Weaknesses:  
- The lack of simulations or real data applications raises questions about the computational efficiency of the proposed method.  
- The assumptions regarding the bounded region of iterates are difficult to verify, and the novelty of the theoretical techniques employed is unclear, as the work appears to build on previous studies.  
- The results suggest that increasing sample size does not improve performance, which is counterintuitive and requires further clarification.  
- The absence of practical implementation and experiments limits the understanding of the algorithm's applicability in real-world scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including simulations or real data applications to demonstrate the computational efficiency of the algorithm. Additionally, clarifying the assumptions related to the bounded region of iterates and discussing the potential applicability of the results to other nonconvex optimization problems would enhance the manuscript. It would also be beneficial to elaborate on the limitations of the algorithm explicitly and provide a more detailed explanation of why second-order stationarity is significant in the context of low-rank matrix sensing. Finally, addressing the counterintuitive findings regarding sample size and performance would strengthen the overall argument.
