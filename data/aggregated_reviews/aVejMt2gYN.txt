Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Inference-time Policy Adapters (IPA), a novel method for efficiently customizing large language models like GPT-3 without the need for extensive fine-tuning. IPA utilizes a lightweight policy adapter to optimize user objectives through reinforcement learning, enhancing control during decoding. The authors demonstrate IPA's effectiveness across various text generation tasks, including toxicity reduction and lexically constrained generation, showing superior performance compared to baseline methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant challenge in generative large language models by minimizing the computational resources required for fine-tuning.
- The design of the adapter and reinforcement learning algorithm is straightforward, making the method both simple and effective.
- Comprehensive testing on multiple text generation tasks consistently shows performance improvements over existing baselines.
- The paper is well-written, clearly structured, and presents its novelties concisely.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation benchmarks and metrics appear subjective and potentially arbitrary, raising concerns about the efficacy of the proposed method.
- Manual configuration of the reward function for each task seems arbitrary, lacking a principled methodology.
- The potential for overfitting to the evaluation metrics is concerning, particularly if the same dataset split is used for both reinforcement learning and evaluation.
- The human evaluation results for certain tasks seem unexpectedly weak compared to automatic metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the reward function selection process for reinforcement learning. Additionally, it would be beneficial to clarify whether the same dataset split was used for both reinforcement learning and evaluation to address overfitting concerns. We suggest conducting a new experiment to optimize for one metric and assess its impact on performance with another metric within the same task. This would help evaluate whether the reward-oriented RL approach adversely affects generation quality not captured by existing metrics. Lastly, consider refining the human evaluation methodology to ensure it aligns better with the improvements observed in automatic metrics.
