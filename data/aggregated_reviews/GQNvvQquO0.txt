Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on private representations of sets, focusing on answering set membership queries with a nontrivial probability of correctness while ensuring differential privacy. The authors propose algorithms for $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP set representation, achieving an error probability of $\frac{1}{e^\varepsilon + 1}$, with space complexity of $O(k\varepsilon)$ and encoding/decoding time of $O(k\log(1/\delta))$. The work generalizes randomized response to a sparse setting and provides lower bounds that nearly match the upper bounds. Experimental results indicate a favorable privacy-utility trade-off compared to existing techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study addresses an interesting special case of private histograms, providing improved guarantees.
- The approach generalizes randomized response effectively.
- The literature review is comprehensive and well-articulated.
- The techniques employed are novel and contribute to the field.

Weaknesses:
- The clarity of the writing could be improved, as understanding the results took considerable effort.
- The lower bound in Theorem 1.4 appears to be incorrectly stated.
- The proof of error probability requires clarification, particularly regarding the probability expressions.
- The algorithm's reliance on knowledge of the set size $k$ may limit its applicability.
- There are concerns about the privacy analysis related to the dimension of the published solution.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the privacy proof, particularly discussing the probability of returning $(⊥,⊥,⊥,S)$ when the linear system lacks full rank. Additionally, please clarify the potential missing lower order terms in the space usage stated in Theorems 1.1 and 1.2. It would be beneficial to confirm whether randomized response can be applied to the vector $b$ before solving the linear system when $p=1$. We also suggest addressing the limitations regarding the randomness of hash functions and the implications for computational differential privacy. Finally, enhancing the motivation for the use cases of DP set representations and providing more context on related works would strengthen the paper's impact.
