Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new benchmark aimed at evaluating multimodal video understanding, focusing on specific areas of visual perception: memory, abstraction, physics, and semantics. The benchmark includes approximately 11,600 real-world videos, curated through a rigorous data collection process involving diverse participants. It assesses four types of reasoning capabilities—descriptive, explanatory, predictive, and counterfactual—across various tasks. The authors propose a dataset with various annotations, including temporal and sound actions, textual questions and answers, and object bounding boxes. The benchmark introduces adversarial elements, such as distractor actions, to challenge existing video understanding models, which often rely on superficial visual cues. Baseline evaluations, particularly of the Flamingo model, indicate significant room for improvement in achieving human-level performance, especially in counterfactual tasks where it struggles, while excelling in semantics. However, Flamingo often underperforms against a frequency-based baseline, raising questions about the implications for future research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset's motivation and collection process are clear, with attention to ethnic diversity to mitigate biases.
- The benchmark sets an ambitious goal for video understanding, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks like Kinetics and SSv2.
- The inclusion of human results as a baseline enhances the benchmark's utility for future work.
- The dataset includes natural videos that evaluate basic physics principles and memory tasks, moving beyond synthetic datasets.
- The benchmark provides a comprehensive evaluation tool, including multiple annotations and baselines for comparison.
- Baseline evaluations reveal the current state of model performance, highlighting the need for further advancements in video understanding.

Weaknesses:
- The limited number of models evaluated per task restricts the benchmark's insights and generalizability.
- The environments in the dataset lack variety, primarily featuring controlled settings that may not represent real-world scenarios.
- The average video length of 23 seconds may not adequately assess long-term reasoning capabilities.
- There is a lack of substantial insights regarding model performance, which diminishes the dataset's potential impact.
- The benchmark does not currently evaluate the ability of models to plan and interact with their environments.
- The current structure makes it challenging to locate interesting insights in the supplementary material.
- The benchmark does not account for the computational cost of the evaluated models, which is crucial for real-world applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the benchmark by incorporating more than one model per task to facilitate comparisons and derive broader insights into the challenges faced in visual perception tasks. Additionally, we suggest improving the diversity of environments in the dataset to better reflect real-world scenarios by incorporating videos filmed in varied settings. Exploring longer video lengths would also be beneficial to assess long-term reasoning capabilities, potentially allowing models to predict outcomes based on extended temporal contexts. We encourage the authors to develop methods for evaluating interaction with the environment, which could enrich the benchmark's scope. Furthermore, providing a more detailed analysis of the performance of existing state-of-the-art models, including fine-tuned results, would enhance the understanding of the dataset's difficulty and potential biases. We also suggest restructuring the supplementary material to make key insights more accessible and including guidelines on the computational efficiency of the models to provide a more comprehensive evaluation framework.
