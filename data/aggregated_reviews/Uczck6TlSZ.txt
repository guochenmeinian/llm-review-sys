Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method called GILL that integrates frozen LLMs with pre-trained image encoders and decoders to generate coherent image and text outputs. The authors demonstrate GILL's superior performance over baseline models in handling longer and more complex text, as well as its capabilities for image retrieval and generation. The framework extends pre-trained LLMs to multimodal applications by mapping their embedding spaces to visual models. The approach is innovative and has the potential for significant impact in unified multimodal pre-training.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed approach is innovative, efficiently combining frozen LLMs with visual models to generate coherent outputs without requiring extensive retraining.
- The paper is well-written and logically structured, making it accessible.
- Experimental results indicate that GILL effectively processes long-form text and generates images closely aligned with the text, outperforming previous models.
- The alignment of visual tokens with LLMs is promising, and the proposed solutions are insightful.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clear implementation details, particularly regarding which parameters are updated during training, leaving uncertainty about model components that require training.
- While GILL is novel, the GILLMapper concept has been previously explored, and related literature is not adequately discussed.
- There is no comparison with state-of-the-art multimodal methods like BLIP, nor is there discussion of other relevant works that unify text-to-image and image-to-text tasks.
- The paper does not address inference speed, a critical factor for diffusion-based image generation.
- Potential misalignment between the OPT model and CLIPText is not discussed, raising concerns about performance gaps.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of implementation details, specifically by clearly stating which parameters are updated in the equations. Additionally, the authors should discuss the related literature on GILLMapper and provide comparisons with state-of-the-art multimodal methods such as BLIP. It is essential to include evaluations of the model's performance on text generation tasks and address the implications of inference speed. Furthermore, the authors should clarify how they plan to tackle potential alignment issues between the OPT model and CLIPText.
