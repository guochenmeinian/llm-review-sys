**Key Points**  
The paper discusses a driver activity classification system aimed at enhancing road safety and autonomous vehicle development. It introduces a Semantic Representation Late Fusion Neural Network (SRLFNet) that utilizes generalizable representations from vision-language models. The method involves processing synchronized video frames from various perspectives, encoding them with a pretrained vision-language encoder, and fusing the embeddings to predict class probabilities.

**Strengths and Weaknesses**  
We recognize the innovative application of vision-language models in the proposed method. However, we note that the novelty of the model architecture is limited, which may hinder its impact in the field.

**Suggestions for Improvement**  
We suggest further exploration of the model architecture to enhance its novelty and effectiveness in driver activity classification.
