Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical investigation into the learnability of linear threshold functions (LTFs) within the learning from label proportions (LLP) framework. The authors propose that when feature vectors are distributed according to a Gaussian distribution, LTFs can be efficiently learned. They develop a principal component algorithm to estimate means and covariance matrices using subgaussian concentration bounds, providing generalization bounds that clarify the relationship between bag classification error and instance classification error. The experimental results support the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses the PAC-learnability of LTFs in the LLP setting, presenting well-defined theoretical results, particularly in Definitions 1.2 and Theorems 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5.
2. The proof of Theorem 1.4 is robust, accompanied by an algorithm and detailed lemmas.
3. The inclusion of experimental results, despite the simplicity of the datasets, adds value to the theoretical work.

Weaknesses:
1. Theorems 1.3 and 1.5 would benefit from brief proof summaries rather than relegating all details to the appendix.
2. The readability of the paper is hindered by some unclear sentences and typographical errors, which detract from the overall presentation.
3. The sample complexity discussions in Theorems 1.3 to 1.5 lack numerical results and analysis, which are necessary for intuitive understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Theorems 1.3 and 1.5 by providing concise proof summaries. Additionally, enhancing the readability of the manuscript by rephrasing unclear sentences and correcting typographical errors is essential. We suggest including numerical results and discussions on sample complexities to elucidate the theoretical findings. Furthermore, clarifying the role of \(\lambda\) in Theorem 1.5 and explicitly stating that the lambdas are eigenvalues of the covariance matrices would strengthen the paper. Lastly, consider adding an overview of the paper after Section 1.1 to guide readers through the structure and main results.
