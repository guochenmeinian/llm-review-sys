Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of the sampling ratio selection problem in Multilingual Neural Machine Translation (MNMT) as an optimization challenge, introducing a Double Power Law (DPL) to manage sampling ratios for various languages. The authors argue that traditional methods assume unlimited training data, which is unrealistic for low-resource languages, necessitating consideration of model capacity and overfitting risks during data sampling. Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy (+0.3 BLEU) with reduced training costs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper enhances the work of Fernandes et al. (2023) by transitioning from a single to a double power law, addressing both model capacity and overfitting risks.
- It tackles an important issue in MNMT, particularly the often-overlooked risk of overfitting in low-resource languages.
- The organization effectively leads from empirical observations to problem identification and solution formulation.

Weaknesses:
- The DPL may not sufficiently resolve the sampling problem, particularly regarding data quality in low-resource settings, which should be analyzed further.
- Confusing claims exist regarding performance metrics; discrepancies between reported accuracy and training costs raise questions about key comparisons.
- The improvement over traditional methods appears marginal, particularly when compared to temperature-based methods, which show limited enhancement in BLEU scores and training time.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of data quality issues in low-resource settings, as this is critical for realistic MNMT scenarios. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the claims made in the introduction and abstract to ensure consistency with experimental results. It would also be beneficial to provide a more robust comparison of the proposed method against temperature-based methods, including a detailed discussion on the marginal improvements observed.
