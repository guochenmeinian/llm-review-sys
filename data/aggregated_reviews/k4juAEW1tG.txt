Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper introduces a benchmark, BenchCLAMP, for evaluating syntactic and semantic parsing capabilities of language models (LMs) using nine existing datasets. The authors assess various LMs, including encoder-decoder models and prompt-based models, and explore the impact of model size, training data quantity, CFG-based decoding constraints, and prompt design. The findings indicate that while language models are competitive in parsing tasks, these tasks remain challenging.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
- The benchmark provides a comprehensive evaluation of LMs for constrained generation, offering valuable insights for the NLP community.
- The methodology for dataset construction and evaluation is well-motivated and clearly documented.
- The paper demonstrates that fine-tuned encoder-decoder models outperform pretrained models like GPT-3, suggesting a promising direction for future improvements.

**Weaknesses:**
- The evaluation is limited to older models, excluding recent advancements like GPT-4 and ChatGPT.
- The necessity of evaluating syntactic and semantic parsing capabilities is not well articulated, given that mainstream LMs do not require these features as inputs.
- The linearization of dependency parses is criticized for being lossy, and there are inconsistencies in the dataset descriptions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- We recommend that the authors evaluate more recent pre-trained models, such as GPT-4 and ChatGPT, to better understand the benchmark's relevance.
- The authors should clarify the necessity of syntactic and semantic parsing in the context of current LMs, potentially motivating the need for such benchmarks more effectively.
- We suggest releasing both lossy and lossless versions of the dependency parses to address concerns regarding the linearization process.
- The authors should enhance clarity in the grammar section by providing examples and ensuring consistency in dataset descriptions to avoid confusion.
