Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents TIGER, a generative retrieval approach for sequential recommendation that utilizes Semantic IDs derived from item text features through RQ-VAE quantization. The authors claim that TIGER outperforms state-of-the-art models and enhances cold-start recommendations and item diversity. The empirical analysis across Amazon datasets demonstrates promising results compared to traditional item-ID-based recommenders.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel concept of using quantized embeddings (Semantic IDs) within a generative retrieval framework, which is logically compelling.
- The extensive evaluation shows that TIGER outperforms existing methods, indicating its effectiveness in sequential recommendation tasks.
- The clarity of the presentation allows for reproducibility of the results.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution of the paper is limited, as it does not significantly advance the field beyond existing methods like RQ-VAE, and lacks efficiency studies.
- The experimental results raise concerns regarding consistency with published benchmarks, particularly for the P5 model, and the absence of significance tests in ranking results.
- The scalability of the Semantic ID approach is questionable, especially when constrained to a small number of codewords, which may not generalize well to larger datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the scalability of the Semantic ID representation by exploring larger code sets for items, which would enhance the system's applicability to billions of items. Additionally, conducting comparative experiments with the P5 model, focusing on achieving the best performance regardless of parameter comparability, would strengthen the findings. The authors should also clarify the preprocessing steps for datasets, particularly addressing missing information, and include significance tests for ranking results to validate their claims. Finally, a more detailed discussion on the implications of using Semantic IDs in relation to existing methods would provide a clearer context for their contributions.
