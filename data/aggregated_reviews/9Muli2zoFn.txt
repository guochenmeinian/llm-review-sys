Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for training conditional score-based models using an optimal transport (OT) guided diffusion model. The authors propose integrating the OT framework into the score-based modeling paradigm, allowing for effective training in scenarios with unpaired or semi-paired data. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that the method minimizes the 2-Wasserstein distance between true and modeled distributions. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in applications such as super-resolution and image-to-image translation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with precise definitions and formulations.
- A thorough discussion of design choices is provided, including the introduction of the resampling-by-compatibility technique to address potential drawbacks.
- The experimental results and ablation analyses confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method across various applications.

Weaknesses:
- Clarification on the calculation of $H$ and its computational cost is necessary.
- The introduction of several hyper-parameters requires a specified approach for determining their values.
- The training pipeline is not end-to-end, which may lead to sub-optimal results.
- The limitations of the proposed method, particularly regarding scenarios where OT may fail, are not adequately discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity on how to calculate $H(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})$ and provide detailed information regarding the computational cost associated with their training method. Additionally, the authors should specify how to determine the hyper-parameters introduced in the proposed method. To enhance the paper, we suggest discussing the limitations of the OT-guided model, particularly in scenarios where the transport cost may not accurately reflect semantic distances. Lastly, including the 2-stage training procedure and sampling process in Figure 1 would improve clarity and understanding of the proposed approach.
