Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of the Best Arm Identification (BAI) problem under differential privacy (DP) constraints, aiming to identify the arm with the highest expected reward with a probability of at least \(1 - \delta\). The authors propose AdaP-TT, a DP variant of the Top Two algorithm, which achieves near-optimal performance in the high privacy regime. They derive a lower bound on sample complexity for the DP-FC-BAI problem, characterizing it in both low and high privacy regimes. The paper includes experiments demonstrating the algorithm's efficiency compared to other DP approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed upper and lower bounds match in the high-privacy regime, providing an up-to-constant characterization of the asymptotic sample complexity for DP-BAI.
- The algorithm AdaP-TT empirically outperforms a natural DP variant of the successive elimination algorithm.
- The problem is well-motivated, particularly in contexts like clinical trials, and the writing is generally clear.

Weaknesses:
- The techniques employed are primarily adaptations of previous work, limiting the paper's technical novelty.
- The presentation is dense and difficult to follow, with some terms introduced without sufficient context.
- The authors do not provide non-asymptotic sample complexity for AdaP-TT, which would enhance the analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation to make it more accessible to non-experts, possibly by providing proof sketches that emphasize the novelty of the proof techniques. Additionally, we suggest that the authors discuss the non-asymptotic optimality of the proposed algorithm and clarify the relationship between \(T^*_{TV}(\nu)\) and \(T^*_{KL}(\nu)\). A comparison with recent work on multi-agent DP-BAI, particularly the paper by Rio et al. (2023), should also be included to contextualize their contributions within the broader literature.
