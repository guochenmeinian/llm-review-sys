Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to variational inference that utilizes tree-structured correlations to capture instance-level relationships among latent variables. The authors propose Tree-structured Variational Inference (TreeVI) and its extension, Multiple Tree-structured Variational Inference (MTreeVI), which allows for the automatic learning of tree structures from data. Additionally, the authors explore the joint posterior distribution of latent embeddings given observed data, introducing a formulation that includes both a greedy-search method and an optimization method for tree learning. Experimental results indicate that the proposed methods outperform existing techniques in various applications, including constrained clustering and link prediction, and that the initialization of the tree does not significantly impact performance. The authors also clarify specific equations and their dependencies, enhancing the understanding of their model.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
* The approach effectively incorporates inter-instance correlations while maintaining efficient training through a tree structure.
* The methods are methodologically interesting and well-described, demonstrating improved performance across diverse tasks.
* The authors provide a clear understanding of the joint posterior distribution and its formulation.
* The combination of greedy-search and optimization methods for tree learning demonstrates a thoughtful approach to model performance.
* The authors are responsive to reviewer feedback, indicating a willingness to improve the manuscript.

Weaknesses:
* The paper's setting and notation are confusing, particularly regarding the representation of tree structures and their relation to existing methods like TreeVAE.
* There is insufficient analysis of computational complexity, and the experiments are limited to simple datasets without reporting standard deviations.
* The construction of trees lacks proper validation, and the writing contains clarity issues and several typos.
* The manuscript lacks sufficient explanation, particularly regarding the formulation for capturing inter-dimensional correlations.
* The alignment of the experiments in Section 4.1 with the main theme of the paper is insufficient, potentially leading to confusion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the notation and provide a more thorough explanation of the tree structures, particularly in relation to existing methods like TreeVAE. Additionally, a detailed analysis of the computational complexity should be included, alongside a broader range of experimental datasets with standard deviations reported. The authors should also validate the tree construction more convincingly, ensuring that learned trees reflect instance-level constraints. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors provide a more detailed explanation of the formulation for capturing inter-dimensional correlations and ensure that the experiments in Section 4.1 are more closely aligned with the main theme of the paper to avoid misleading interpretations. Lastly, we recommend a thorough revision of the writing to address clarity issues and correct typographical errors.
