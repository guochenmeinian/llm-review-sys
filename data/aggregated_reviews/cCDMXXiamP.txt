Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for auditing DP-SGD in a black-box setting, focusing on the selection of worst-case initial model parameters to enhance auditing effectiveness. The authors demonstrate that pre-training on in-distribution data leads to smaller average gradient norms, thereby improving the distinguishability of the target point for auditing/membership attacks. The study includes extensive experiments on MNIST and CIFAR10, reporting tighter privacy lower bounds compared to previous methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem addressed is well-motivated, as tight black-box auditing remains an open challenge.
- The paper includes extensive experimental analysis of hyperparameter effects on auditing.
- Confidence intervals for the empirical privacy budget $\epsilon$ are provided, enhancing the robustness of the results.

Weaknesses:
- The main contribution is incremental, with prior literature already noting the impact of $\theta_0$ initialization on auditing/membership inference.
- The justification for pre-training lacks rigor and is somewhat vague.
- Reproducibility is hindered by the absence of code and incomplete reporting of experimental factors.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the rigor of their justification for using pre-training, ensuring that it is clearly articulated. Additionally, providing code for reproducibility is essential. The authors should clarify the algorithm used for pre-training $\theta_0$ and the random distribution for average-case initialization. Addressing the discrepancies in Figure 5 regarding average-case versus worst-case initialization would strengthen the argument. Furthermore, the authors should elaborate on the canary strategy used for black-box audits and detail the loss thresholds for the membership attack to enhance clarity. Lastly, a more comprehensive comparison with previous auditing methods under identical conditions would provide valuable context for their contributions.
