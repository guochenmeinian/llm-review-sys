Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Meta Parallel Graph Neural Network (MPGNN) as a scalable solution for network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) in large-scale IoT environments. MPGNN employs a graph-embedded adversarially trained actor-critic (G-ATAC) algorithm to optimize coalition formation for network partitioning, followed by coalition-wise E-GraphSAGE for intrusion detection, framed as an edge classification task. The authors report that MPGNN outperforms competitive baselines and achieves performance comparable to centralized NIDS.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses the significant efficiency issues in NIDS, presenting a well-motivated approach.
- MPGNN is clearly written and organized, with thorough experimental validation demonstrating its effectiveness.
- The use of a meta-learning framework and coalition formation policy is innovative, enhancing scalability and efficiency.

Weaknesses:
- Important related research works are missing, impacting the perceived novelty of the paper.
- The G-ATAC method lacks efficiency analysis, and its complexity may hinder practical application.
- The evaluation relies on only two datasets, which may not adequately represent the diverse nature of IoT networks.
- The methodology for coalition head selection is inadequately explained, and the paper lacks a coherent structure.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by including relevant federated network intrusion detection methods to contextualize MPGNN within existing research. Additionally, we suggest providing a complexity analysis for the G-ATAC method to address potential efficiency issues in large IoT networks. The authors should also consider employing stronger baselines in their evaluations to better demonstrate MPGNN's contributions. Furthermore, a more detailed explanation of the coalition head selection criteria and the reinforcement learning algorithm's operation would enhance clarity. Finally, expanding the dataset analysis to include larger and more diverse datasets would strengthen the evaluation of MPGNN's scalability and adaptability.
