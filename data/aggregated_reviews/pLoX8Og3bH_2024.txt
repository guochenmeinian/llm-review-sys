Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents advancements in multispectral video semantic segmentation (MVSS) through two key contributions: the establishment of a new benchmark dataset, MVUAV, captured via UAVs, and the development of SemiMV, a semi-supervised learning baseline designed to optimize sparse annotations using Cross-collaborative Consistency Learning (C3L). The MVUAV dataset comprises 413 video sequences and 53K frames with sparsely annotated pixel-level segmentation labels, while the SemiMV framework employs a denoised temporal aggregation strategy to enhance performance on MVSS tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The MVUAV dataset introduces an oblique birdâ€™s-eye view for multispectral video semantic segmentation, providing rich and diverse data across various lighting conditions and over 30 semantic categories.
2. The SemiMV framework effectively utilizes semi-supervised learning, demonstrating improved performance over existing baselines on two benchmark datasets.
3. The dataset's annotations and advantages in resolution, modality, and size contribute significantly to the field.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a detailed comparison with existing aerial-view datasets, which is essential to establish the MVUAV dataset's relevance and uniqueness.
2. There is insufficient articulation of the motivation behind the UAV-View dataset, leaving its necessity and contributions unclear.
3. The analysis of limitations and broader impacts is inadequate, which may not meet submission requirements for understanding the research's implications.
4. Privacy concerns regarding the UAV-view multimodal dataset are not adequately addressed, particularly regarding the potential capture of private information and the absence of clarity on privacy measures.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation of the paper, particularly in Section 4.2, by providing clearer descriptions of terminology and addressing specific queries regarding the memory feature and matrix dimensions. Additionally, we suggest including a thorough comparison of the MVUAV dataset with existing aerial-view datasets to highlight its unique contributions. The authors should also clarify the relationship between MVUAV and MVSeg, and ensure that the dataset's alignment of RGB and thermal images is explicitly stated. Furthermore, we advise conducting ablation studies on crucial parameters and addressing the limitations and potential societal impacts more comprehensively within the main manuscript. Lastly, it is essential to outline the privacy measures taken to mitigate risks associated with the dataset.
