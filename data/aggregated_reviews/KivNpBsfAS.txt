### Key Points
This paper presents a position on data contamination in NLP evaluations, particularly concerning large language models (LLMs) trained on benchmark test data. The authors propose a "contamination report registry" to crowdsource contamination identification and encourage authors to verify the integrity of evaluation sets. The paper emphasizes the need for revisiting traditional evaluation methods in light of LLM capabilities and advocates for transparent evaluation protocols.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a critical issue of data contamination in NLP evaluations, highlighting its implications for model performance and scientific conclusions.  
- It proposes practical solutions, including the development of measures for detecting contamination and a community registry, which could enhance evaluation practices and awareness in the NLP community.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks empirical evaluations or case studies to substantiate claims about data contamination.  
- It primarily focuses on contamination from training LLMs on benchmark test data, potentially overlooking other biases.  
- The proposed methodology for measuring contamination is ambiguous and may not be robust enough for large-scale evaluations.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including empirical results, figures, and examples to illustrate the significance of data contamination in NLP models. Additionally, we suggest providing a clear, standardized methodology for measuring contamination that goes beyond simple string-matching operations. Addressing the broader effectiveness of current test sets in evaluating powerful models like GPT-3-175B would also strengthen the paper's impact. Finally, clarifying the design and practical constraints of the proposed contamination registry would enhance its feasibility and relevance.
