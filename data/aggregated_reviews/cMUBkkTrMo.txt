Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a variational regression model aimed at addressing the label imbalance problem and enhancing uncertainty qualification in regression. The authors propose a method that combines a reweighting technique from Yang et al. (2021) with the output distribution and loss function from Amini et al. (2020) to improve performance on imbalanced datasets. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and uncertainty estimation across multiple real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors tackle the novel problem of simultaneously addressing label imbalance and uncertainty estimation in regression.
- The integration of techniques from Yang et al. (2021) and Amini et al. (2020) is effective and demonstrates superior performance in experiments.
- The clarity of presentation aids in understanding the proposed methods and results.

Weaknesses:
- While the combination of state-of-the-art techniques is commendable, it may limit the originality of the approach.
- The absence of code for reproduction is a notable drawback.
- Some parts of the paper lack clarity, particularly in defining neighboring labels and the formulation of importance weights.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definitions and formulations, particularly regarding how neighboring labels are defined and the detailed formulation of the importance weights. Additionally, we suggest including the code for reproduction to enhance the paper's accessibility. An ablation study should be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of each component of the proposed method. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide more rigorous justification for their claims, particularly regarding the effectiveness of the N.I.D. assumption and the choice of the evidential regression model over other Bayesian neural networks.
