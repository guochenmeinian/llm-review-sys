Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the problem of Universal Unsupervised Cross-Domain Retrieval (U2CDR) and proposes a two-stage semantic feature learning framework to address it. The framework consists of a cross-domain unified prototypical structure established through an instance-prototype-mixed contrastive loss and a semantic-enhanced loss in the first stage, followed by a modified adversarial training mechanism in the second stage. The authors claim to be the first to explore the "universal" version of this problem, allowing disjoint label spaces between query and retrieval domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a novel problem, Universal Unsupervised Cross-Domain Retrieval, and proposes an initial solution.
2. The hierarchical formulation of the problem and the proposed method is clear and well-structured.
3. The method is theoretically motivated, and experiments appear to be comprehensive.

Weaknesses:
1. The optimization methods employed seem largely existing, and the authors should enhance the description of their novelty.
2. The necessity of using six different contrastive losses across two stages is unclear, and the theoretical justification appears limited.
3. The analysis related to the Ablation Study is insufficient, particularly regarding the experimental results in Table 4.
4. The paper lacks clarity in explaining the handling of instances that are not common categories and the differences between universal and unsupervised domain adaptation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology section by explicitly stating the novelty of their approach and the rationale behind the use of multiple contrastive losses. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the analysis of the Ablation Study to better explain the experimental results. It would be beneficial to address how the method handles uncommon categories and to clarify the distinctions between universal domain adaptation and unsupervised domain adaptation. Lastly, we encourage the authors to refine the presentation of the cross-domain prototype conversion and close neighbor matching processes for better comprehension.
