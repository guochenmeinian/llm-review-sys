### Key Points
This paper presents a method called TEXT-TRANSPORT to estimate causal effects of linguistic attributes across different text distributions, utilizing a density ratio approach. The authors propose two methods for this estimation: a classification-based method and a language model (LLM)-based method. Empirical validation is conducted on three datasets, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness, particularly in hate speech detection.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed framework is novel and potentially beneficial for causal NLP and computational social science.
- Empirical results across three datasets support the effectiveness of the method.
- The paper is well-organized, clearly written, and effectively motivates the problem.

Weaknesses:
- There is a lack of comparison with naive estimator baselines, which could further validate the proposed framework.
- Evaluation metrics could be more comprehensive; specifically, instance-level estimation (ITE) error could enhance the assessment of the transport estimator.
- Concerns exist regarding the LLM-based method's calibration and its implications for validity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with naive estimator baselines to validate the effectiveness of their framework more robustly. Additionally, incorporating more comprehensive evaluation metrics, such as instance-level estimation (ITE) error, would strengthen the analysis. For the LLM-based method, we suggest assessing whether the prompted output is qualitatively or quantitatively more similar to texts from the target versus source corpora. Finally, clarifying the rationale behind the chosen density ratio transformation and exploring alternative transformations could enhance the paper's depth.
