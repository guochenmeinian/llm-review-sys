Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Deep Kernel Mixture Point Processes (DKMPP), which integrates Deep Kernel Learning (DKL) into Deep Mixture Point Processes (DMPP) to manage complex relationships between events and covariates more flexibly. The authors employ a denoising score matching technique to develop a training procedure that avoids the need for integration and second-order derivative calculations. The proposed method is evaluated across various datasets, demonstrating its advantages over baseline point process models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors extend score matching to point processes, enhancing scalability through the denoising technique, which is a valuable contribution to point process learning applicable in diverse scenarios.
- A comprehensive range of experiments with both synthetic and real-world datasets showcases the proposed method's efficiency and effectiveness, with appropriate hyperparameter studies.
- The organization and clarity of the presentation of the proposed method are commendable.

Weaknesses:
- The assertion that Euclidean distance may not be suitable for high-dimensional inputs requires further clarification, particularly regarding the dimensionality induced by the design choice of the mapping function $g_{w_2}$.
- The motivation for using a score-based approach lacks clarity, especially when other generative models like GANs or VAEs could potentially address parameter estimation.
- The related works section is not comprehensive enough, missing significant contributions in the field that could enhance the paper's context.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their statement regarding the suitability of Euclidean distance for high-dimensional inputs, particularly in relation to the mapping function $g_{w_2}$. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the rationale for choosing a score-based approach over other generative models. Expanding the related works section to include relevant literature on point processes with deep kernels would strengthen the paper. Furthermore, including additional experiments, such as modeling self-exciting point process data, would enhance the robustness of the numerical results.
