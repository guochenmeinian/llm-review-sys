Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel score matching variant called Local Curvature Smoothing with Stein’s Identity (LCSS), which addresses computational challenges related to the Jacobian trace in score matching, particularly for high-dimensional data. By leveraging Stein’s identity, LCSS circumvents the direct computation of the Jacobian trace, providing both regularization benefits and computational efficiency. The authors validate their method through experiments on synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating its efficiency compared to existing methods like denoising score matching (DSM).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The idea of LCSS is novel and offers a computationally efficient alternative to existing score matching methods.
2. The Jacobian is not computed directly, but implicitly respected.
3. The paper is well-written, with clear presentation and appropriate references to related works.
4. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on both small and large datasets.

Weaknesses:
1. The assumption of interchangeability in lines 161-162 lacks justification, as it requires specific properties of the function in question.
2. The paper does not discuss the empirical and theoretical differences between LCSS and methods that use the Jacobian, particularly regarding estimated error bounds.
3. The advantages of LCSS over DSM remain unclear, especially concerning the Gaussian constraints criticized in DSM.
4. The experimental results show only marginal improvements over DSM, raising questions about the significance of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their assumptions, particularly regarding interchangeability, and provide a more thorough discussion on the differences between LCSS and Jacobian-based methods, including error bounds. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify how LCSS differs from DSM concerning Gaussian constraints and elaborate on the benefits of using a non-affine SDE. Finally, including a comparative table of results could enhance the presentation of their contributions and findings.
