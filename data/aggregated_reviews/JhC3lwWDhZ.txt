### Key Points
This paper presents a novel tree tokenization technique called "TreePiece" aimed at improving the inference speed of autoregressive (AR) semantic parsing models. The authors propose tokenizing parse trees into larger units, enabling simultaneous predictions of multiple sub-trees, which reduces the number of prediction steps and accelerates the parsing process. Empirical results demonstrate that TreePiece achieves over 6x faster decoding time compared to baseline AR decoders while maintaining similar accuracy levels.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The TreePiece method addresses a significant issue of slow inference in AR models by reducing prediction steps.
- Empirical evidence supports the claim of faster inference times comparable to non-autoregressive (NAR) methods.
- The approach is intuitive and may attract interest from researchers in semantic parsing.

Weaknesses:
- The performance improvement over NAR methods is not substantial, with similar performance but slower operation.
- The method is only tested on the TOPv2 benchmark, raising questions about its applicability to other semantic parsing tasks.
- Key technical details are relegated to the appendix, making the main paper less self-contained.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the self-containment of the paper by integrating essential technical details from the appendix into the main text. Additionally, providing empirical evidence regarding the applicability of the TreePiece method beyond the TOPv2 benchmark would strengthen the work. Clarifying the differences between AR and TreePiece-0 in Table 1, as well as offering recommendations on the optimal expansion size, would enhance the paper's clarity and utility. Lastly, addressing the formatting issue in Figure 3 to ensure all text is legible is necessary.
