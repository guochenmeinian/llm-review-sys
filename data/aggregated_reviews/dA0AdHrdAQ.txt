Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Emergent Language Corpus Collection (ELCC), a standardized dataset comprising 73 corpora from eight open-source emergent communication systems (ECSs). Each corpus is annotated with metadata detailing the source system's characteristics, including environment, agent architectures, and corpus attributes. The authors aim to facilitate ECS research by providing a comprehensive resource that allows researchers to bypass the lengthy setup of individual systems and directly analyze emergent languages.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The ELCC serves as the first consolidated resource for emergent communication, potentially accelerating research and enabling reproducible studies.
- The dataset is well-structured and includes extensive metadata covering various attributes of the ECSs.
- The paper presents a strong discussion of practical applications and the dataset's relevance to existing studies.

Weaknesses:
- Limited novelty, as the paper organizes existing systems without proposing new methods or systems.
- The writing is colloquial and contains lengthy, complex sentences, which hinder clarity.
- The paper lacks qualitative examples and experimental results to validate the dataset's utility and robustness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing by reducing colloquial language and simplifying complex sentences. Additionally, the authors should consider including qualitative examples and experimental results to demonstrate the practical utility of the ELCC dataset. A simple experiment could involve showing performance improvements in a specific task when pretraining on the ELCC dataset. Furthermore, we suggest expanding the related work section to provide broader context within the ECS field and enhancing the analysis of the corpora to include more detailed insights. Lastly, the authors should address the potential risks of overreliance on the dataset and discuss strategies for mitigating these risks.
