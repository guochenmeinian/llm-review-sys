### Key Points
This paper presents a dataset of 12,000 claim-response pairs aimed at countering misinformation through emotional and social media-style discourse. The authors propose that this dataset, generated via an LLM with human post-editing, is crucial for developing automated methods for social correction. They demonstrate improvements over baseline models through both automatic summarization and human evaluations, emphasizing the importance of emotional content in effective misinformation debunking.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is well-motivated and could significantly aid future research in misinformation debunking.
- The human evaluations indicate that the dataset enhances the quality of generated responses.
- The paper provides a clear explanation of the dataset generation process and includes both quantitative and qualitative analyses.

Weaknesses:
- There is insufficient detail regarding the recruitment and background of annotators, which raises concerns about potential biases.
- The issue of LLM hallucinations in claim generation is not adequately addressed, particularly regarding the accuracy of verdicts.
- Some technical details and metrics are confusing or inadequately explained, leading to potential misunderstandings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and detail regarding the recruitment and background of annotators to address potential biases. Additionally, please provide more information on the prevalence of hallucinated claims and the measures taken to ensure the accuracy of verdicts in the dataset. Clarifying the organization of the experiments and ensuring that all relevant details are included in the main body rather than the appendix would enhance the paper's readability. Finally, consider addressing the applicability of the proposed style transfer technique to various social media platforms beyond Twitter.
