Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an algorithm named BLOCC for solving bilevel optimization problems characterized by coupled constraints. The authors propose a penalty approach and Lagrangian duality theory to transform the original bilevel problem into a single-level minimization problem, decoupling the variables. A first-order algorithm is developed, relying on two min-max subproblems, with rigorous convergence theory established. The effectiveness of BLOCC is validated through applications in infrastructure planning and support vector machine (SVM) model training.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work addresses a challenging bilevel problem with coupled constraints, showcasing the algorithm's capability to handle complex scenarios.
- The first-order nature of the proposed algorithm is notable, as it avoids the need for second-order information typically required in similar problems.
- The evaluation of BLOCC on both toy examples and real-world applications demonstrates its practical utility.

Weaknesses:
- Key properties derived in Lemmas 2 and 3 assume bounded Lagrangian multipliers, which is not a common assumption in the literature. The authors should clarify this point and possibly include a tailored version of Theorem 1.6 in the Appendix.
- The algorithm's requirement for solving two min-max subproblems results in a triple-loop structure, which may be computationally intensive compared to other hypergradient methods.
- The convergence results depend on additional assumptions that are not clearly articulated, particularly regarding their restrictiveness.
- The paper lacks a detailed discussion on the computational complexity and scalability of the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity around the assumptions, particularly regarding the boundedness of Lagrangian multipliers and the implications of Assumption 5. Additionally, contextualizing BLOCC within the broader bilevel optimization literature would enhance understanding of its necessity. A more thorough analysis of the comparison methods, particularly LV-HBA and GAM, is needed, including a discussion on the scalability of these methods. Finally, providing more details on hyperparameter tuning and the computational complexity of the algorithm would strengthen the paper.
