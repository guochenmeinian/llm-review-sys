Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for conformal prediction that utilizes "privileged information" to construct prediction intervals in the presence of missing or noisy data. The authors propose a quantile-of-quantile approach that addresses the challenge of unavailable privileged information during testing, achieving finite-sample coverage. The method is supported by theoretical guarantees and empirical results demonstrating its effectiveness compared to existing techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and organized, providing solid theoretical guarantees and comprehensive simulation studies.  
- The originality of the approach in addressing issues related to corrupted training data is commendable, and the clarity of the presentation enhances understanding.  
- The proposed method potentially opens new avenues for applying conformal prediction in high-stakes scenarios.

Weaknesses:  
- The intuition behind "privileged information" is not adequately explained, and examples of its application in real-world contexts are lacking.  
- There is insufficient discussion regarding the choice of hyperparameters, particularly \(\beta\), and the absence of ablation studies limits understanding of its impact.  
- The empirical evaluation could benefit from a broader range of real-world datasets and a discussion on the characteristics of privileged information.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the intuition behind "privileged information" and include relevant examples in the introduction to clarify its significance. Additionally, conducting ablation studies on the choice of the hyperparameter \(\beta\) would enhance understanding of its role and impact on accuracy. We also suggest expanding the empirical evaluation to include a wider variety of real-world datasets and discussing what constitutes ideal privileged information for the method. Lastly, addressing how to compute the weights \(w_i\) and their implications for coverage validity should be made clearer in the manuscript.
