### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical investigation into the advantages of reward lookahead in reinforcement learning (RL) agents. The authors analyze the competitive ratio between standard agents without lookahead and those with access to future reward information, deriving tight bounds for various lookahead scenarios. They explore the implications of their findings on offline reinforcement learning and reward-free exploration, while providing concrete examples through different types of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), including chain, grid, and tree-shaped environments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a rigorous theoretical analysis of future reward information in RL, deriving tight bounds on the competitive ratio and characterizing worst-case scenarios.
- It introduces specific environments, such as the "delayed tree," which provide insights into the challenges of utilizing lookahead.
- The focus on worst-case scenarios enhances the robustness of the findings, laying groundwork for future algorithm design.

Weaknesses:
- The assumption of perfect knowledge of future rewards may not reflect practical scenarios where information is noisy or partial.
- The theoretical analysis is conducted in a simplified tabular setting, lacking direct applicability to more complex real-world RL problems.
- The paper does not adequately situate its findings within existing literature, particularly regarding the rollout approach in Control Theory.
- There is a lack of conclusive statements and clarity on the implications of the competitive ratio for policy learning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation of motivating examples in the introduction to provide a clearer understanding of the problem. A central example illustrating the implications of reward lookahead would enhance comprehension. Additionally, we suggest relocating important figures, such as Figure 3, from the appendix to the main text to aid understanding of key proofs. The authors should also consider including a section on Broader Impact to contextualize their findings in empirical studies. Finally, addressing the connection to the rollout approach and clarifying the definitions of dense rewards would strengthen the paper's situational context and theoretical foundations.
