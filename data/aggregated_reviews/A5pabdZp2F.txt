Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents MultiOOD, a benchmark for multimodal out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, and proposes two methods: Agree-to-Disagree (A2D), which enhances discrepancies between modality predictions during training, and NP-Mix, a novel outlier synthesis technique. The authors demonstrate significant improvements over existing unimodal OOD detection methods through extensive experiments on the MultiOOD benchmark.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of the first benchmark for multimodal OOD detection (MultiOOD).
- The originality of the A2D algorithm and the NP-Mix outlier synthesis method.
- Strong performance improvements over baselines and thoughtful analysis of modality prediction discrepancies.
- Comprehensive experiments and clear explanations of key concepts.

Weaknesses:
- Lack of important baselines, such as an ensemble of multiple single OOD methods for each modality, which raises questions about the practical impact of MultiOOD.
- Limited theoretical analysis of A2D and NP-Mix.
- Experiments are confined to action recognition tasks, making the title "MultiOOD" potentially misleading.
- Some figures lack clarity and consistency.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the relationship between their work and other multimodal studies in the related works section. Additionally, we suggest conducting evaluations in a more statistically significant manner by assessing methods on different ID/OOD category splits and reporting standard deviations. For A2D, we encourage the authors to explore maximizing discrepancies in an order-preserved manner as an ablation study. A more detailed comparison with the method in [16] and Learning Placeholders for Open-Set Recognition (CVPR 2021) is also advised. Finally, to validate the efficacy of A2D and NP-Mix, we recommend creating baselines that combine uni-modal OOD methods with existing multimodal methods outside the OOD area.
