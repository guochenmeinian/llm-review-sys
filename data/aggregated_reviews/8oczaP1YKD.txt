### Key Points
This paper presents SPRING, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based framework aimed at addressing the scalability issues in state placement within sharding blockchains. By modeling the state placement as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), SPRING considers the cross-shard transaction ratio and workload balancing, utilizing real Ethereum transaction data from 2015, 2019, and 2023 for evaluation. The results indicate that SPRING outperforms four baseline approaches in terms of throughput and reduction of cross-shard transaction (CST) ratios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The formulation of the state placement problem as an MDP aligns well with the sequential nature of blockchain transactions.
- Extensive evaluation using real Ethereum transaction data enhances the credibility of the findings.
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty and technical contributions of SPRING are inadequately justified, particularly in comparison to existing solutions like SkyChain.
- Certain technical details regarding the DRL model architecture, training parameters, and hyperparameter tuning are insufficiently explained.
- The relationship between SPRING and SpringChain is not clearly articulated, leading to potential confusion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the differences between SPRING and SpringChain, explicitly discussing their implications. Additionally, the authors should provide more detailed technical information about the DRL model, including architecture and hyperparameter settings, to enhance reproducibility. It would also be beneficial to benchmark the reproduced SkyChain to ensure fidelity. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the impact of load balancing and CST on throughput, as well as the operational context of the DRL implementation. Lastly, we suggest addressing minor issues such as inconsistent notation and improving the readability of figures.
