Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the "Quantitative Relative Judgment Aggregation" (QRJA) problem, focusing on deriving quantitative scores for candidates based on pairwise comparisons, even with missing data. The authors propose a framework that utilizes tuples (a, b, y) to indicate that candidate a is better than candidate b by y units. They narrow their approach to l_p QRJA, employing a restricted loss function to leverage known complexity results, demonstrating that the problem is NP-hard for p < 1 and solvable in near-linear time for p â‰¥ 1. Empirical results show that using p = 1 and p = 2 yields higher accuracy and lower loss compared to other metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a theoretical analysis of computational complexity for a novel problem, supported by empirical validation.
- It includes several novel aspects, such as framing the task within existing literature on social choice and presenting substantial experimental comparisons.
- The shared code enhances clarity regarding the experiments conducted.

Weaknesses:
- The relationship to prior work, particularly [Conitzer et al., 2016], lacks clear distinction, making it difficult to understand the conceptual contributions.
- The motivation for using racing scenarios is not adequately justified, leaving questions about its relevance to the broader context of judgment aggregation.
- The technical writing is at times unclear, particularly in proofs and the presentation of results, which could benefit from more explicit explanations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the relationship between their work and previous studies, particularly how their contributions differ from [Conitzer et al., 2016]. Additionally, we suggest providing a more robust justification for the use of racing data as a motivating example, including its relevance to real-world applications. The authors should also enhance the technical writing, particularly in proofs and the presentation of results, to ensure that the methodology and findings are more accessible to readers. Finally, we encourage the authors to expand on the explainability benefits of QRJA compared to matrix factorization, and to clarify the choice of loss functions in relation to the provided examples.
