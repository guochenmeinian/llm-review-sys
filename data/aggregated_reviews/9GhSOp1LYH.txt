Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative approach called ProMaC (Prompt-Mask Cycle) aimed at enhancing promptable segmentation by utilizing hallucinations from Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The authors propose a framework that iteratively refines prompts and masks, leveraging hallucinations to extract contextual information while minimizing irrelevant data. The effectiveness of ProMaC is demonstrated through extensive evaluations across various challenging segmentation tasks, including camouflaged object segmentation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The novel perspective of leveraging hallucinations as a resource rather than a drawback is insightful and groundbreaking.
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written, facilitating comprehension.
- Comprehensive experiments across diverse datasets validate the method's robustness and effectiveness.
- The integration of techniques such as multi-scale chain of thought prompting and visual contrastive reasoning enhances the generation of accurate instance-specific prompts.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on hallucinations may lead to inconsistent performance, particularly in scenarios where hallucinations are inaccurate.
- The complexity of the iterative refinement process could hinder implementation and scalability in resource-constrained environments.
- Some terms and concepts, such as the definition of "prompt," lack clarity and require further explanation.
- The initial quality of prompts significantly impacts the overall effectiveness, raising concerns about generalization across different tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of terminology and concepts, particularly regarding the definition of "prompt" and the specifics of the multi-scale chain of thought prompting. Additionally, incorporating a broader range of examples from various segmentation tasks would strengthen the motivation for the proposed method. To enhance the paper's applicability, a discussion on the computational and memory requirements of the ProMaC method is necessary. Finally, we suggest providing visual comparisons between ProMaC predictions and ground truth across iterations to better illustrate performance.
