Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents UNION, an unsupervised 3D object detection method that integrates LiDAR, camera, and temporal information to generate pseudo bounding boxes for training object detectors. The authors propose an appearance-based clustering method to create pseudo class labels, enabling multi-class training without manual annotations. The approach shows significant performance improvements, particularly on the nuScenes dataset, and eliminates the need for time-consuming self-training procedures.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The method significantly improves accuracy over existing unsupervised techniques.
2. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, effectively communicating its motivation and methodology.
3. The innovative use of visual embedding aids in distinguishing static objects during proposal generation.
4. The approach successfully combines spatial clustering, self-supervised scene flow, and visual appearance encoding.

Weaknesses:
1. The absence of qualitative results and visualizations limits comprehension of the method's effectiveness.
2. The novelty of the method is questioned, particularly regarding the reliance on self-supervised visual features.
3. The paper lacks detailed analysis of failure cases and the impact of hyper-parameters, such as those for HDBSCAN and the choice of K in multi-class detection.
4. The experiments are limited to the nuScenes dataset, raising concerns about the generalizability of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including qualitative results and visualizations on pseudo box/class generation to enhance reader understanding. A detailed analysis of failure cases should be provided, specifically addressing scenarios where UNION generates poor pseudo labels. The authors should also include information on HDBSCAN hyper-parameters and conduct an ablation study on the impact of the choice of K for multi-class detection. To strengthen the evaluation, we suggest considering additional datasets, such as Waymo, for comparative analysis. Furthermore, the authors should investigate the reasons behind the zero AP for cyclists and explore potential solutions, including the possibility of misclassification due to similarities with pedestrians.
