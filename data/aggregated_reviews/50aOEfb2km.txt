Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for precise and disentangled image editing in diffusion models, termed LOw-rank COntrollable edit (LOCO Edit). The authors base their approach on two key observations: the Posterior Mean Predictor (PMP) exhibits local linearity during denoising, and the singular vectors of its Jacobian lie in low-dimensional semantic subspaces. The method allows for efficient, training-free localized image manipulation by leveraging these properties. Empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of LOCO Edit across various architectures and datasets, achieving superior results compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant challenge in diffusion models: achieving disentangled and continuous editing in a principled manner.
- The methodology is supported by robust empirical evidence and theoretical analysis validating the local linearity and low-rank properties of the PMP's Jacobian.
- The proposed edits can be composed, transferred, and modulated effectively, with strong qualitative and quantitative results.
- Extensive empirical evaluations are presented, showcasing the method's effectiveness across diverse architectures and datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The literature review is limited, lacking comprehensive comparisons with recent state-of-the-art methods.
- The qualitative results for editing are not the strongest, and comparisons are made against relatively weak baselines.
- There is a lack of ablation studies and insufficient exploration of the method's limitations, particularly regarding the assumptions of low-rank Gaussian distributions.
- The metrics used in the empirical evaluations are not intuitive, and the descriptions are unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by including comparisons with other local/global editing methods to provide a more comprehensive benchmark. Additionally, the authors should enhance the interpretability of semantic changes, possibly by incorporating label information for clearer control. We suggest including more ablation studies to demonstrate the contributions of individual components and addressing the limitations of the method more thoroughly. Clarifying the metrics used in the evaluations and providing more intuitive descriptions would also strengthen the paper.
