### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of polarization in online discussions regarding COVID-19, utilizing the concepts of in-group favoritism and out-group animosity. The authors propose a logistic regression model that incorporates the proportion of stances within in-group and out-group neighbors, revealing that in-group love has a greater effect than out-group hate. The manuscript is well-structured, with clear methods and comprehensive results, but it has limitations in its technical contributions and engagement with existing literature on polarization and opinion formation models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an important topic with strong predictive power.
- The presentation of methods and results is clear and accessible.
- The integration of in-group favoritism and out-group animosity into the analysis provides a comprehensive framework.

Weaknesses:
- The logistic regression model oversimplifies the complexities of polarization.
- There is insufficient engagement with existing literature on measuring polarization and opinion formation.
- The authors do not adequately justify their claims regarding the model's ability to measure affective polarization.
- The motivation for the study is not well-established, particularly regarding the novelty of the proposed methods compared to existing quantitative approaches.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation section by comparing their methods with existing quantitative measures of affective polarization, such as those mentioned in the literature. Additionally, we suggest that the authors elaborate on how their model's features—objectivity, scalability, and interpretability—differ from existing methods. Expanding the discussion on how in-group love and out-group hate can contribute to building less toxic online communities would enhance the paper's relevance. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the relationship between their findings and existing studies on polarization, ensuring that claims are substantiated and well-explained. Lastly, addressing the limitations of their logistic regression model and considering the incorporation of graph structure could provide deeper insights into interaction patterns.
