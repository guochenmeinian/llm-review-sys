### Key Points
This paper presents BenchX, a unified benchmark framework for systematic analysis and head-to-head comparison of medical vision-language pretraining (MedVLP) methods. BenchX addresses inconsistencies in datasets, preprocessing, and fine-tuning implementations, facilitating fair evaluations. The authors detail its three main components: a comprehensive dataset, a benchmark suite, and a unified fine-tuning protocol. BenchX establishes baselines for nine state-of-the-art MedVLP methods, revealing that earlier methods can outperform recent ones with optimized training strategies, prompting a reevaluation of prior research conclusions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. BenchX introduces a comprehensive and standardized framework, essential for advancing the MedVLP field through systematic comparisons.
2. The inclusion of nine datasets and four medical tasks enhances the framework's comprehensiveness and utility.
3. The unified fine-tuning protocol addresses compatibility issues, ensuring fairer comparisons.
4. The discovery that earlier methods can achieve superior performance with appropriate strategies challenges existing assumptions in the field.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a detailed discussion on how BenchX differs from or improves upon existing benchmark efforts in related fields.
2. The focus on the image encoder limits the evaluation of decoder-only multimodal LLMs.
3. There is a need for appropriate human evaluation to confirm the benchmark's effectiveness due to the nature of medical data.
4. The datasets used are publicly available, but further evaluation of data quality is necessary.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on how BenchX differentiates from existing benchmarks in related fields.
2. We suggest emphasizing the potential impact of BenchX on clinical practice, particularly regarding improved diagnostic tools or more accurate medical reports.
3. The authors should consider including a benchmark of state-of-the-art multi-modal LLMs.
4. We recommend adding a table summarizing average results across different tasks to provide an overall performance metric.
5. Additional experiments should be conducted to ensure the quality of the datasets used in the benchmark.
