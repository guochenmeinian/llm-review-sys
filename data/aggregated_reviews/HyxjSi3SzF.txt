Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a distributed variant of the classical learning with experts problem, focusing on aggregating expert costs across multiple servers. The authors propose algorithms based on three aggregation models: sum, maximum, and $\ell_p$ norm, deriving bounds on regret and communication costs while providing matching lower bounds to demonstrate optimality. The theoretical findings are complemented by empirical results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses an important and relevant problem in the context of distributed systems, which is increasingly significant as applications grow.  
- The use of randomization in the max aggregation and $\ell_p$ norms is a notable aspect of the approach.  
- The algorithms are relatively simple yet effective, providing a good balance between communication efficiency and regret bounds.

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty of the analysis is limited, relying heavily on existing results rather than introducing significant new insights.  
- The communication model assumptions, particularly regarding the coordinator initiating communication, are atypical for distributed settings and may lead to inflated communication costs.  
- The paper lacks clarity in its writing, making it difficult for readers to grasp the significance of the results and the context of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their writing to better convey the significance of their results and the context in which they operate. Specifically, they should provide a more detailed discussion of their results, including how they relate to existing literature and the implications of their findings. 

Additionally, we suggest that the authors address the assumption that the coordinator must initiate communication, as this may not reflect typical distributed system behavior. They should consider allowing clients to initiate communication to potentially reduce communication costs.

Furthermore, we recommend that the authors clarify the implicit assumptions in the sum aggregation model regarding the sparsity of loss vectors, as this is crucial for understanding the communication guarantees. They should explicitly state the implications of their normalization choices on communication costs and regret bounds. 

Lastly, we encourage the authors to move the discussion comparing their work with Kanade et al. into the main text to highlight its relevance and to provide a clearer justification for the selection of the max function as an aggregation method.
