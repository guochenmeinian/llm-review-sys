### Key Points
This paper presents Dynamic Stashing Quantization (DSQ), a novel dynamic quantization strategy aimed at reducing computations and memory accesses during Large Language Model (LLM) training. The authors demonstrate that DSQ significantly minimizes DRAM traffic and improves operational intensity by employing a time-adaptive stashing principle, which starts with lower precision and gradually increases it. The method's effectiveness is validated through comprehensive evaluations on translation and classification tasks, achieving notable performance improvements, including a 2.55× boost in arithmetic performance and a 20.95× reduction in DRAM requirements compared to 16-bit fixed-point training.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for reducing memory consumption and computational demands in LLM training is compelling.
- The innovative time-adaptive compression strategy is a notable contribution.
- The experimental evaluation is thorough and demonstrates DSQ's effectiveness across various tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The focus on smaller-scale models raises concerns about the applicability of DSQ to larger models, leaving a gap in understanding its effectiveness in more complex scenarios.
- The paper lacks runtime performance metrics, making it difficult to assess the real-world impact of the proposed techniques.
- Some sections require further elaboration, particularly regarding practical implementation and potential challenges.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by extending their experiments to include larger models, such as OPT 1.3B and LLaMA, and provide a comparative analysis of perplexity outcomes. Additionally, including an end-to-end speedup analysis would offer a more comprehensive understanding of DSQ's performance. We also suggest providing more details on the practical implementation of DSQ and addressing potential challenges and limitations to enhance the paper's completeness.
