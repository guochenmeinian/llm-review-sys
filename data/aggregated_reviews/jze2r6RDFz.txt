Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive study on the long-tail problem in extreme multi-label classification (XMLC), proposing a new method to optimize performance metrics through the expected test utility (ETU) framework. The authors derive optimal prediction rules and provide computationally efficient approximations with provable regret guarantees. They argue that existing metrics inadequately evaluate tail label performance and advocate for macro-averaged metrics, demonstrating their effectiveness through empirical results on benchmark datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The exploration of the long-tail problem in XMLC is significant, and the proposal is technically sound, focusing on optimizing performance measures for tail labels.
- The paper is well-structured and presents thorough derivations and proofs, with empirical results indicating that the proposed optimal rules yield superior performance.
- The approach is a plugin method compatible with existing XMLC methods, scalable to large datasets without specialized hardware.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments lack comparisons with other novel algorithms addressing the long-tail problem, which could strengthen the findings.
- The contribution is limited as the investigation primarily focuses on utility functions that can be linearly decomposed, and the algorithm appears not to introduce new concepts.
- Some terms, such as "macro-average," are used without sufficient explanation, and the paper could benefit from a clearer discussion on the relevance of macro measures in the context of inherent data imbalance in XMLC.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including comparisons with other relevant algorithms that address the long-tail problem. Additionally, we suggest providing a more comprehensive discussion of related works and clarifying the significance of macro-averaged metrics in XMLC scenarios. It would also be beneficial to introduce and explain technical terms used throughout the paper for better clarity. Lastly, we encourage the authors to analyze the complexity of the optimal prediction rules to understand the inference overhead better.
