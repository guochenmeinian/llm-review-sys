### Key Points
This paper presents the STEM-POM benchmark dataset, aimed at evaluating the reasoning capabilities of language models (LLMs) in interpreting mathematical symbols within scientific texts. The authors address the gap in LLMs' understanding of abstract mathematical symbols, which is essential for advancing AI in STEM fields. The dataset comprises 2,109 instances from disciplines like Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry, detailing mathematical symbols, their attributes, and contextual information. The findings underscore the limitations of current models in mathematical reasoning, highlighting the need for further advancements.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a well-structured and comprehensive overview of the challenges LLMs face in mathematical reasoning.
- It offers a detailed description of the benchmark, including dataset statistics and construction methods.
- The focus on mathematical reasoning in scientific texts is timely and relevant to the integration of AI in STEM fields.

Weaknesses:
- Some sections, particularly those detailing dataset construction and experimental setup, are complex and may challenge readers without a strong background.
- The paper does not evaluate more recent and stronger models, which could limit its impact and usefulness in pushing the boundaries of mathematical reasoning in AI.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of complex sections related to dataset construction and experimental setup to enhance accessibility for a broader audience. Additionally, we suggest evaluating more recent and stronger models, such as GPT-4o, o1-preview, Llama 3, and Claude, to better understand the challenge level for state-of-the-art models and ensure the dataset remains relevant over time.
