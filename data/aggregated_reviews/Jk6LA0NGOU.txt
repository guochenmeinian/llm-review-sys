### Key Points
This paper presents a method for multi-step logical reasoning that integrates language models with explicit planning. The framework aims to enhance logical reasoning by reducing the number of reasoning steps and improving interpretability. It introduces a base model utilizing beam search for deduction, with two enhancements: modifying scores for planning and incorporating a contrastive loss with KL-divergence. The method demonstrates effectiveness across both small models like T5 and larger models such as GPT-3.5, with empirical results indicating that planning significantly aids deduction.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The combination of language models and planning is novel and meaningful.
- The method is supported by a detailed description and extensive empirical studies, showing strong performance, particularly with small models matching GPT-3.
- The approach is model-agnostic, allowing integration with various language models.

Weaknesses:
- The organization of the paper is poor, with critical information relegated to the appendix, which hinders comprehension.
- Limited baseline comparisons, particularly for small models, weaken the argument for the method's effectiveness.
- The complexity of the method raises questions about its real-world applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization of the paper by including essential information in the main text rather than the appendix. Additionally, the authors should enhance baseline comparisons by including tuning baselines for deductive reasoning, such as RuleTaker and Neural Unification. We also suggest providing a high-level overview of the method at the beginning of the paper to clarify its purpose. Furthermore, the authors should consider revising Figure 1 for clarity and ensuring that all deduction steps are valid and well-explained.
