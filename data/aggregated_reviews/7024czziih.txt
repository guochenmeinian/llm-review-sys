### Key Points
This paper presents VPNSniffer, a VPN server detection system that employs graph-represented probing and communication information to improve detection performance. VPNSniffer constructs probing and communication graphs, extracts node features from active probing and network traffic, and utilizes graph neural networks for classification. The authors compile new VPN server detection datasets in collaboration with their ISP partner. Experimental results indicate that VPNSniffer outperforms active probing-based methods on offline datasets and can complement existing industry detection engines in online scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The construction and utilization of the probing graph is an interesting and novel approach.
- The datasets provided are comprehensive and valuable.
- The significance of VPN server detection is well-justified, appealing to a broad audience.

Weaknesses:
- The GNN-based detection methodology lacks novelty.
- There are no network traffic-based baselines included.
- Claims regarding generalization ability are not substantiated by experiments.
- Efficiency analysis is absent.
- The paper suffers from poor clarity, containing numerous typos and grammatical errors.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by proofreading for typos and grammatical errors, such as correcting "Poring" to "Probing" and ensuring consistent notation for the probing graph. To support the claim of better generalization ability, we suggest conducting experiments that train the model on one dataset and evaluate it on another. The authors should also include experimental results for network traffic-based methods to justify VPNSniffer's superiority. An efficiency analysis comparing VPNSniffer to existing detection methods is necessary, particularly regarding resource consumption. Additionally, we advise the authors to clarify the online experiment setup, specifically whether all servers or only those identified by VPNSniffer were checked by industry engines. A dedicated section defining key terms and a complete spreadsheet of node features would enhance the paper's comprehensibility. Lastly, we recommend a more thorough ethics discussion addressing potential privacy risks associated with deploying VPNSniffer in ISP networks.
