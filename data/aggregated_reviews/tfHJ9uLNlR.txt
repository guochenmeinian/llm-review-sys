Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a joint extraction method for entities and relation triples by integrating set prediction networks (SPNs) and a novel bipartite consistency loss. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on three biomedical datasets, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, although it underperforms on ACE05. The authors argue that the method's efficacy is contingent on the presence of multiple relations per sentence.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and accessible, with a solid explanation of methods and experiments.
- Extensive experiments and detailed ablation studies support the claims, confirming the utility of the proposed losses.
- The method shows efficiency compared to two-stage models and achieves SOTA results on knowledge-intensive biomedical datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The work is considered relatively incremental, with limited novelty beyond the use of SPNs and the introduced consistency loss.
- Generalization ability in the general domain appears limited, and the paper lacks validation on commonly used datasets like ACE2004 and SciERC.
- The writing requires further polishing, and the paper does not include results using the Rel+ metric.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their model by including validation on additional datasets, particularly ACE2004 and SciERC. Additionally, an error analysis would provide valuable insights into the model's limitations. We also suggest enhancing the clarity of the inference process in the paper and addressing the identified typos and grammatical issues for better presentation.
