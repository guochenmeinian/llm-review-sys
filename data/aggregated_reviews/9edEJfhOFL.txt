### Key Points
This paper presents a novel task, recognizing semantic differences (RSD), which aims to identify token-level semantic differences between pairs of documents. The authors propose three unsupervised methods for RSD: Alignability of a Word, Deletability of a Word, and Cross-entropy of a Word, and evaluate these methods using a dataset created from the iSTS task dataset. The paper also introduces different metrics and constructs a test set with varying complexity levels.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The task definition of RSD is novel compared to previous works.
- Each method is clearly explained, and the paper is well written.
- The authors create a specific evaluation dataset for RSD, including various settings for comprehensive evaluation.

Weaknesses:
- The effectiveness of the proposed methods cannot be judged due to the absence of baseline comparisons.
- The focus on unsupervised approaches is not clearly justified, and the potential for supervised methods is overlooked.
- The use of a commercial machine translation system raises concerns about the accuracy of cross-lingual results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for their exclusive focus on unsupervised methods and consider incorporating supervised approaches to enhance the detection of semantic differences. Additionally, we suggest including baseline comparisons, even if they are naive, to better assess the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Finally, we advise verifying the performance of the commercial machine translation system used to ensure its impact on the results is minimal.
