### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of Wu's method in solving problems from the IMO-AG-30 benchmark, demonstrating its capability to solve 2 problems that AlphaGeometry cannot and 7 that DD+AR, AlphaGeometry's deductive engine, fails to address. The authors report that Wu's method solves 15 out of 30 problems, an improvement from previous results, and when combined with DD+AR, achieves solutions for 21 problems on a CPU-only laptop. Additionally, integrating Wu's method with AlphaGeometry allows for solving 27 out of 30 problems, surpassing the performance of IMO gold medalists.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- Excellent experimental results showcasing the effectiveness of Wu's method and algebraic techniques on the IMO-AG-30 benchmark.  
- Significant improvement in problem-solving capabilities compared to prior reports.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper does not provide clear technical contributions or novelty.  
- A lack of diverse problem sets limits the testing of algebraic methods and AlphaGeometry beyond the IMO-AG-30 benchmark.  
- Insufficient comparative analysis on the differing performances of Wu's method and AlphaGeometry. Concerns regarding the generalizability of the work due to the inability to translate 4 problems into JGEX format.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by clearly articulating the technical contributions and novelty introduced. Additionally, the authors should consider collecting a more diverse set of problems to test the algebraic methods and AlphaGeometry beyond the IMO-AG-30 benchmark. A detailed comparative analysis of the performance differences between Wu's method and AlphaGeometry would enhance understanding and provide valuable insights. Finally, addressing the translation issues with the JGEX format could improve the generalizability of their findings.
