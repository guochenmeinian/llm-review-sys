### Key Points
This paper presents SolidMark, a novel evaluation method for measuring image memorization in diffusion models. The authors revisit existing metrics, which are heavily dataset-dependent, and propose a method that fine-tunes images with random "keys" to evaluate per-image memorization scores during generation. The motivation for this approach is well-articulated, and the review of existing metrics is thorough.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The idea of considering image memorization as a task of image outpainting is innovative.  
- The motivation and proposal are clearly described, providing a solid foundation for the method.

Weaknesses:  
- The method is not plug-and-play, as it requires fine-tuning on randomly crafted images to measure memorization metrics.  
- Evaluation is limited to fine-tuned "key" images, raising concerns about how to assess the memorization of the entire model and scale to other images.  
- SolidMark necessitates pre-training the model for each new evaluation, which adds an extra burden compared to some pixel-level memorization measurements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the practical usability of SolidMark by addressing the concerns regarding its plug-and-play capability. Specifically, the authors should clarify how to measure the memorization of the entire model and discuss scalability to other images. Additionally, we suggest including examples of outpainting and corresponding SolidMark scores in the main text rather than relegating them to the appendix, and providing a more detailed explanation of the necessity for pre-training with each evaluation.
