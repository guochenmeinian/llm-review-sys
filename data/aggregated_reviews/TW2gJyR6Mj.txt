### Key Points
This paper presents MetaRAG, a framework that integrates retrieval-augmented generation in large language models (LLMs) with human-inspired metacognition. The authors propose a three-step metacognitive regulation pipeline—monitoring, evaluating, and planning—to enhance the model's introspective reasoning abilities. Empirical evaluations on multi-hop question-answering datasets demonstrate that MetaRAG significantly outperforms existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of metacognition into LLMs is an advanced and innovative approach.
- Significant performance improvements are observed across multiple datasets.
- The paper is well-structured, and the ablation studies provide valuable insights.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a complexity and cost analysis, and the adaptability of MetaRAG to tasks beyond multi-hop QA is not thoroughly explored.
- There is a deficiency in baseline comparisons, particularly with state-of-the-art methods like ToolFormer, FLARE, and others, which limits understanding of the method's competitiveness.
- The reliance on off-the-shelf models raises concerns about the source of performance improvements, and the potential conflicts between the QA and evaluator LLMs need clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental evaluation by including a broader range of datasets to enhance generalizability. Additionally, the authors should compare their method against state-of-the-art baselines to provide a clearer context for its performance. It is crucial to address the potential conflicts arising from using LLMs in both QA and evaluation roles and clarify how errors from these models will be managed. We also suggest conducting a complexity and cost analysis to discuss the trade-offs involved in the proposed framework. Lastly, providing more details on the human annotation process and the categorization of questions would strengthen the paper's clarity and rigor.
