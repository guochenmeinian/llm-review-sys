Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the CRATE architecture, a Transformer-like model designed to optimize the sparse rate reduction (SRR) objective iteratively. The authors analyze whether CRATE effectively implements this optimization and propose two variants, CRATE-N and CRATE-T, based on their findings. They empirically explore the correlation between SRR and generalization performance, ultimately suggesting that SRR can serve as a regularizer to enhance generalization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear structure and language.
2. It provides valuable insights into the relationship between SRR and generalization, particularly noting that SRR correlates well with generalization gaps.
3. The proposed variants, CRATE-N and CRATE-T, are technically original and contribute to the ongoing discourse on white-box deep learning architectures.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivations and technical soundness of CRATE-N and CRATE-T are unclear, especially since they underperform compared to the original CRATE on CIFAR-10/100.
2. The analysis in Section 4 lacks justification for some conclusions, particularly regarding the implications of omitting first-order terms and the role of softmax in the updates.
3. The experiments in Section 5 do not convincingly demonstrate that SRR is a good proxy for generalization, as they rely solely on CRATE models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivations for CRATE-N and CRATE-T, explicitly addressing their advantages over the original CRATE. Additionally, we suggest providing a more comprehensive analysis of the implications of the updates in Section 4, particularly regarding the role of softmax and first-order terms. To strengthen the argument that SRR is a valid complexity measure, we encourage the authors to include experiments with models outside of the CRATE framework. Finally, we advise adding a limitations section to discuss the constraints of the current study and the potential for future work.
