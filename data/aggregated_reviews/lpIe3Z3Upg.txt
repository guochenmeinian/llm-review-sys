### Key Points
This paper presents a novel permute-and-flip (PF) decoding method utilizing large language models (LLMs), which achieves stability akin to softmax sampling while exhibiting lower perplexity. The authors claim that the trade-off between stability and perplexity is Pareto-optimal, and extensive experiments validate the stability of the proposed method. The PF decoder is shown to effectively balance detection accuracy and low perplexity compared to baseline methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces an innovative decoding method that leverages recent advancements, providing both stability and reduced perplexity.  
- The PF watermark decoder allows for precise control over the false positive rate, presenting a promising approach for watermarking.

Weaknesses:  
- The evaluation is limited, as it only compares results with the KGW and Gumbel watermark methods, omitting recent publications with superior performance.  
- The absence of comparisons with state-of-the-art methods undermines the paperâ€™s ability to convincingly demonstrate the proposed approach's effectiveness.  
- The experimental settings for KGW and Gumbel methods lack clarity, particularly regarding the values for k and delta in KGW.  
- The organization and writing quality of the paper require improvement, especially in the typesetting of the algorithm chart.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including a broader range of existing decoding methods for comparison, particularly recent publications that demonstrate superior performance. Additionally, clarifying the experimental settings for KGW and Gumbel methods, specifically the values for k and delta, would enhance the paper's rigor. Finally, we suggest improving the organization and writing quality to enhance readability and comprehension for the audience.
