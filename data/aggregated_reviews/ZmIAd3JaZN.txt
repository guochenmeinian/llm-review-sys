Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an $\varepsilon$-Bayesian incentive compatible and individually rational $k$-sparse linear regression algorithm with side payments for privacy-oriented data providers. It addresses high-dimensional sparse regression with subgaussian covariates while ensuring differential privacy and providing a payment scheme that incentivizes truthfulness. Notably, in the limit where $d >> n >> \log d$, both accuracy and budget requirements diminish.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper tackles a significant problem in data collection for machine learning applications.  
- It introduces important advancements in privacy-preserving machine learning with financial compensations for data providers.  
- The theoretical guarantees are comprehensive, covering estimation error, privacy, truthfulness, individual rationality, and budget considerations.  
- The presentation is generally clear despite the complexity of the topic.

Weaknesses:  
- The notation is overly complex and can confuse readers; significant improvements in writing are necessary.  
- The paper's assumptions, particularly Assumptions 3 and 4, lack practical applicability and clarity.  
- The claim regarding "the one-round communication necessitating a closed-form estimator" is unclear and requires further justification.  
- The accuracy of the algorithm remains ambiguous, limiting the reviewers' ability to provide a higher score.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their writing by unifying notation and defining terms such as "symmetric threshold strategy" before use. Additionally, the authors should clarify the structure of Assumption 3 and provide more practical justification for Assumption 4. It would also be beneficial to include a literature survey on incorporating payments in differentially private models and to add experimental results demonstrating how payments and model error vary with changes in differential privacy guarantees. Finally, we suggest that the authors address the ambiguity surrounding the accuracy of their algorithm to enhance understanding of its implications.
