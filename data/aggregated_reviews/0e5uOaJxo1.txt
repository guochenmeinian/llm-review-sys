Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CoupleNet, a method for learning numerical protein representations by integrating sequential and structural data through two types of graphs: one based on amino acid sequences and the other on tertiary structures. The authors demonstrate that CoupleNet outperforms several baseline methods across various downstream tasks, including protein function prediction and classification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The integration of sequence and structure data addresses a significant challenge in proteomics.  
- The performance improvements over baseline methods are notable, enhancing the method's practical applicability in biology and medicine.  
- The method is well-structured and easy to follow, with memory-efficient hierarchical pooling.

Weaknesses:  
- There is a lack of comparison with state-of-the-art protein language models, which undermines the novelty of CoupleNet.  
- The writing quality requires improvement, with several technical statements needing clarification or elaboration.  
- Experimental results lack error bars and detailed analysis, and the ablation study does not focus on core techniques, limiting insights into performance contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison of CoupleNet with state-of-the-art models such as ESM-2, ESM-S, S-PLM, ESM-GearNet, and SaProt to highlight its advantages. Additionally, please clarify the definitions and implications of terms like "$T_g$ and $S_g$" and the domain and range of $\mathcal{F}$. The authors should elaborate on the pooling strategy, including how average pooling is conducted and the rationale behind reducing the number of residues. Furthermore, we suggest including error bars in experimental results and conducting a more focused ablation study on the core techniques of dynamic pooling and graph construction. Lastly, addressing the robustness of the structure module to perturbations and the differences between model outputs and real structures would strengthen the paper.
