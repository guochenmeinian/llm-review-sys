### Key Points
This paper presents a study on how transformers reason through a synthetic propositional logic task, utilizing a three-layer Transformer and the larger Mistral-7B model. The authors identify key attention circuits responsible for reasoning, revealing that small transformers trained on the synthetic problem repurpose certain tokens to filter out less relevant information. The study employs activation patching to analyze the reasoning processes of the Mistral-7B model.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The synthetic logic problem is a well-chosen, controlled task for understanding reasoning in transformers.
- The paper provides rigorous experimentation, particularly with activation patching, yielding deep insights into transformer architectures.
- The discovery of "routing signals" and the analysis of layer-specific reasoning in Mistral-7B are valuable contributions.

Weaknesses:
- The organization of the paper is poor, making it difficult to follow and understand the main ideas.
- The experiments are limited to a specific case, which restricts the generalizability of the findings to other reasoning domains.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization and clarity of the paper to enhance reader understanding. Specifically, it would be beneficial to clarify the main claims and ensure that all figures and terms, such as "LO chain," are properly defined. Additionally, we suggest connecting the findings from small transformers to larger models to clarify their applicability. Expanding the literature review would provide a more comprehensive context for the study, and exploring the robustness of routing signals through additional experiments with different logic tasks or architectures could offer further insights.
