Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of adversarial Linear Mixture Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with unknown transitions and adversarial rewards, focusing on dynamic regret where the baseline policy can change across episodes. The authors propose a novel hybrid algorithm that combines policy-based and occupancy-measure-based methods, achieving near-optimal dynamic regret, a first in this context. The algorithm's theoretical guarantees are supported by both upper and lower bounds, and it notably removes the dependence on the number of states from prior results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper introduces a novel algorithm that effectively merges policy-based and occupancy-measure-based methods, achieving near-optimal dynamic regret.
2. The theoretical guarantees provided for the dynamic regret are a significant advancement over previous analyses.
3. The paper is well-written and presents its findings clearly.

Weaknesses:  
1. The proposed algorithm is computationally inefficient, particularly due to the need for evaluating the value function over all possible next states and solving global optimization problems.
2. The contributions could be better highlighted, as the algorithm appears to leverage existing components from prior works, raising questions about its originality.
3. The paper lacks experimental validation, which may limit its applicability in complex high-dimensional environments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the contributions by explicitly distinguishing the novel aspects of their algorithm from existing literature. Additionally, addressing the computational inefficiencies associated with the occupancy-measure-based method would enhance the algorithm's practicality. We suggest including experimental validation to demonstrate the algorithm's performance in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we advise reorganizing Section 3 for better readability and explicitly stating the assumptions regarding oracle access in Algorithm 2 as a limitation.
