Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for incorporating syntactic dependency information into transformer-based models for Aspect-Based Sentiment Classification (ABSC) without using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The authors introduce a new token [g] to represent syntactic information and a Variable Distance Control (VDC) mechanism that specifies the attention mask for [g]. Additionally, they propose a Dependency-Aware Aggregation (DAA) module to represent dependency labels.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed method is innovative and addresses limitations in interaction and aggregation for ABSC.  
- The authors engaged actively with reviewers, providing additional results and clarifications.  
- The combination of DAA with Auto-VDC yields improved performance, and the method shows competitive results with BERT-based baselines.

Weaknesses:  
- The overall presentation lacks clarity, particularly in Figure 2, which fails to convey the main idea effectively.  
- The ablation experiments do not sufficiently demonstrate the effectiveness of the DAA module, and further analysis is needed.  
- There are numerous typos, and many illustrations lack clarity.  
- The paper does not adequately differentiate the proposed model from existing graph-based approaches.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Figure 2 to better illustrate the main idea of the work. Additionally, we suggest conducting more comprehensive experiments to analyze the effectiveness of the DAA module and to clarify how well this method performs on BERT. The authors should also compare their model with previous studies to highlight its unique contributions. Lastly, addressing the typos and enhancing the clarity of illustrations will strengthen the overall presentation.
