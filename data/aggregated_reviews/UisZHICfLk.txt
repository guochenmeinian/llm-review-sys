Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel model, BEAST, which integrates contrastive learning and unsupervised sentence embeddings to enhance drug abuse detection on social media. The authors propose that their model effectively outperforms a contrastive BERT baseline, particularly in identifying drug-related posts that use figurative language. The work addresses significant challenges faced by traditional machine learning models, such as informal language and sarcasm, and demonstrates high originality through its innovative approaches, including the integration of contrastive learning with a Target-Based Generating Strategy and the use of SimCSE for refining sentence representations. The significance of this research is underscored by its potential impact on public health monitoring and intervention.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The manuscript is well-structured and clearly outlines the challenges in detecting drug abuse references on social media.
- The methodology is validated through extensive experiments, demonstrating effective performance improvements.
- The topic is novel and addresses a critical public health issue.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on publicly available data limits insights from private conversations.
- The paper lacks sufficient mathematical and statistical evaluations, as well as comparative analyses with traditional models.
- There is insufficient clarity regarding the contributions of the proposed model compared to existing methods, and some technical details, such as the formula for SimCSE, are missing or unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the contributions by explicitly distinguishing how their model differs from existing contrastive metaphor detection methods. Additionally, more mathematical and statistical evaluations should be included to strengthen the paper. The authors should provide the formula for SimCSE and clarify its integration with unsupervised learning. Furthermore, we suggest including SimCSE as a baseline in the experimental section and addressing any instances where the proposed method does not appear optimal. Finally, enhancing the clarity of figures, particularly Figure 5, is essential for better presentation.
