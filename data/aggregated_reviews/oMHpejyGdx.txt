Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Prompt-Agnostic Adversarial Perturbation (PAP), a method designed to enhance privacy and security in customized text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion. The authors propose a novel approach that models the prompt distribution using a Laplace approximation, allowing for the generation of robust perturbations that are effective against a variety of unseen prompts. Experimental results demonstrate PAP's superior performance and robustness across datasets like VGGFace2 and Wikiart, indicating a significant improvement in protecting images from unauthorized use and manipulation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The idea of designing a prompt-agnostic adversarial perturbation for privacy protection is commendable.
2. The method is concise, and the paper's organization is logical.
3. The empirical evaluation is comprehensive and convincing, with clear presentation of formulas, tables, and figures.

Weaknesses:
1. The method appears overly complex; expanding the prompt with a large language model (LLM) to generate diverse prompts could simplify the gradient calculation for adversarial attacks.
2. The assumption in Definition 3.1 regarding Z = p(x0, c0) as a constant lacks sufficient evidence.
3. The experimental evaluation needs improvement, particularly in applying PAP to other recent methods and providing a simple baseline for comparison.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method by simplifying the complexity of the adversarial perturbation process. Specifically, consider expanding the prompt set using LLMs to enhance robustness. Additionally, provide evidence for the assumptions made in Definition 3.1 and address the potential semantic gap between estimated prompts and natural language. To strengthen the experimental evaluation, include comparisons with other recent methods, such as AdvDM + PAP and Diff-Protect, and justify the choice of metrics used, particularly for face datasets. Furthermore, we suggest assessing the performance of PAP against recent encoder-based personalized techniques to ensure comprehensive evaluation.
