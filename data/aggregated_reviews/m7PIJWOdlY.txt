Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new measure called label informativeness (LI) that characterizes the information a neighbor's label provides about a node's label. The authors propose desirable properties for homophily measures and introduce adjusted homophily as a modification of edge homophily. They demonstrate that LI correlates significantly with the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) across various datasets, arguing that current homophily measures fail to satisfy important properties.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors provide a thorough analysis of existing measures, highlighting their drawbacks and proposing desirable properties for new metrics.
- The introduction of adjusted homophily addresses limitations of traditional measures, enhancing applicability across datasets.
- The proposed LI measure shows a strong correlation with GNN performance, which is both interesting and novel.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of LI is questionable, as it may closely resemble prior work on normalized information measures.
- The experimental validation primarily relies on synthetic datasets, limiting the generalizability of findings to real-world scenarios.
- The paper lacks detailed explanations regarding the interpretation of LI values and does not adequately compare LI with existing measures.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty discussion by explicitly acknowledging similarities with prior work, particularly regarding normalized information measures. Additionally, we suggest expanding the experimental validation to include a broader range of real-world datasets to demonstrate the general applicability of LI. Clarifying the interpretation of LI values and providing comparisons with existing measures would enhance the paper's contribution. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore multi-hop variants of LI to enrich the theoretical framework and its implications for graph analysis.
