Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a unified predictor-corrector method, termed UniPC, aimed at accelerating the diffusion sampling process. The method integrates a corrector (UniC) that refines the initial estimation of data points using both current and previous points, and a predictor (UniP) that supports arbitrary order accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that UniPC outperforms existing samplers on datasets like ImageNet and CIFAR10, achieving significant improvements in sampling quality with fewer function evaluations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method effectively reduces the number of sampling steps to fewer than 10 without compromising result quality.
- The theoretical justification and empirical analysis of the method are robust.
- The paper is well-organized and generally clear in its presentation.

Weaknesses:
- Limited novelty in the design, as the method's reliance on current and previous points does not introduce new information, raising questions about its claimed increase in accuracy.
- The method's applicability across different families of diffusion models (DDPM and SGM) is unclear.
- The visual quality of generated images does not convincingly surpass previous methods, despite favorable numerical metrics.
- The writing lacks clarity in parts, particularly in articulating the motivation and theoretical guarantees of the method's accuracy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation section by explicitly stating the technical issues in diffusion models that their method addresses and why it is effective. Additionally, conducting experiments on larger resolution datasets would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of inference time, quality, and diversity. The authors should also clarify the theoretical implications of using the current point in estimation and provide statistical significance for the reported FID scores. Finally, addressing the writing issues noted in the weaknesses will enhance the overall readability of the paper.
