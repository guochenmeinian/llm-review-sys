### Key Points
This paper presents a three-stage pipeline for text-guided compositional 3D-aware video generation, utilizing an LLM to decompose textual prompts into sub-prompts related to scene, object, and motion. The method employs multi-modal LLMs for initial estimations of scales and trajectories, refining results with 2D diffusion priors and SDS loss. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments, showing high-fidelity video generation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The decomposition of the generation task into organized components using LLM is innovative.  
2. The step-by-step trajectory generation method is reasonable and validated through experiments.  
3. The use of SDS loss to refine generative priors enhances the quality of outputs, supported by ablation studies.  
4. The combination of LLM as director and 3D structural representation enables the generation of diverse, high-quality 3D-aware videos.

Weaknesses:  
1. The selection criteria for pretrained expert models and their impact on generation performance are unclear.  
2. The method's effectiveness in complex scenes with multiple interacting objects remains uncertain.  
3. Limited qualitative examples hinder the assessment of visual quality, and prompt adherence issues are evident in provided examples.  
4. The ablation studies lack statistical rigor, and the prompting strategy for LLM is not well-defined.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding the selection of pretrained expert models and their influence on performance. Additionally, the authors should address how the method performs in complex scenes with multiple objects and interactions. To enhance the evaluation, we suggest including more qualitative examples to better demonstrate visual quality and prompt adherence. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide a more rigorous quantitative analysis of the ablation studies and clarify the prompting strategy used in the initial stages of the pipeline.
