### Key Points
This paper presents a study on improving entity disambiguation models through feature diversity sampling and low-rank matrix completion within a tensor model framework. The authors aim to enhance generalization performance under tight annotation budgets, demonstrating that their approach significantly reduces the required labeled data while achieving competitive accuracy on the AIDA dataset. The paper also explores various data sampling strategies and their impact on model performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem addressed is relevant and practical within NLP, focusing on training entity disambiguation models with limited labeling budgets.
- The proposed method is clearly explained, with detailed formulations and algorithms.
- Experimental results effectively compare different sampling strategies and highlight the benefits of low-rank correction.

Weaknesses:
- The targeted scope is narrow, focusing on a single model and dataset, which limits broader applicability.
- The state of the art is inadequately covered, and many design decisions lack justification.
- The experimental section does not provide exhaustive coverage of various aspects, and more qualitative analysis of results is needed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the breadth of their experiments by evaluating the proposed data sampling approaches across multiple models and datasets. Additionally, clarifying the connection between collaborative filtering and the proposed approach in Section 4.1 would enhance understanding. The authors should consider using k-medoids instead of k-means for selecting samples in dense diversity, as it allows for specifying any dissimilarity measure. Furthermore, providing more details about the datasets used, including their characteristics, and discussing the implications of cross-product versus dense diversity strategies would strengthen the paper. Lastly, a more in-depth comparison with related works and a discussion of practical applications of their findings would enhance the overall contribution.
