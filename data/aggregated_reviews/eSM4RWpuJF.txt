### Key Points
This paper presents a novel model for multi-document summarization (MDS) that employs a hierarchical context for both encoder and decoder components of pre-trained language models (PLMs). The authors argue that existing approaches either introduce new architectures or treat MDS as a concatenated single-document summarization (SDS) task, which limits their effectiveness. The proposed method reportedly achieves competitive results across 10 MDS benchmarks, outperforming or matching leading models, while effectively leveraging pre-training.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The methodology is straightforward and easy to replicate.  
- The evaluation is thorough, encompassing a broad set of datasets and human evaluations.  
- The model competes well with state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating good performance metrics.  

Weaknesses:  
- The methodology appears to be an extension of existing models, particularly PRIMERA, raising concerns about novelty.  
- There is ambiguity regarding the evaluation metrics used, particularly whether all baselines and the proposed architecture are assessed using the same Rouge metric.  
- The paper exhibits minimal scientific contribution in methodology, with claims of incremental gains over existing results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their methodology by explicitly detailing how their model differs from PRIMERA and other similar approaches. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide performance metrics beyond Rouge, such as BERT or BARTScore, to strengthen their claims. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to revise the tone of the prose in certain sections to enhance scientific rigor and ensure that all statements are adequately supported by citations or evidence.
