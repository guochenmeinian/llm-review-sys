Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a computational framework for the emergence of grid cells in the mammalian cortex through self-supervised learning (SSL). The authors propose a learning objective that integrates path independence, error-correcting coding, and efficient coding, validated through numerical experiments on recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The results demonstrate that the model produces grid cells organized into modules, replicating key biological properties. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The formulation of a principled and biologically meaningful optimization problem that captures essential properties of grid cells.
- Clear presentation and organization, supported by relevant visuals and a thorough background of prior research.
- The exploration of the role of each component of the objective function through experimental studies.

Weaknesses:
- The advancement over previous work is unclear, as many concepts have been previously discussed in the literature, such as representation theory and coding efficiency.
- The biological plausibility of the proposed learning procedure is not adequately addressed.
- The authors do not discuss the relationship of their work to literature on grid cells' role in predictive representation.
- The robustness of results concerning hyperparameters and the lack of quantitative metrics to characterize grid cell properties are concerning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions by explicitly citing relevant prior work earlier in the paper, such as Sorscher et al. and Nayebi et al. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more detailed discussion on the biological plausibility of their learning procedure. To enhance the robustness of their findings, we encourage the inclusion of quantitative metrics to characterize the grid-like properties of the cells. Furthermore, we advise that the authors clarify the differences between their SSL approach and previous supervised methods, particularly regarding the use of velocities in their dataset. Lastly, we recommend enlarging figure panels and ensuring that font sizes remain legible for better readability.
