Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Flatten Anything Model (FAM), an unsupervised tool for UV mapping 3D geometries, comprising four main components: Deform-Net, Warp-Net, Cut-Net, and Unwrap-Net. FAM utilizes two-cycle consistency losses to maintain mapping consistency between 2D and 3D spaces. It generates a single unwrapped patch and can handle unstructured point clouds, outperforming selected baselines on 3D mesh tasks. The authors claim FAM is the first method to achieve global free-boundary parameterization, directly mapping 3D points to adaptively deformed UV coordinates.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized, with a clear narrative and purpose for each component. The authors effectively replicate standard UV mapping procedures.
- FAM's performance surpasses SLIM and matches FBCP-PC, which is specifically designed for point clouds.
- The separation of the pipeline into distinct components facilitates model tuning and integration with various methodologies.

Weaknesses:
- The claim regarding global parametrization's value is questionable, as it may not align with practical applications for certain objects like CAD models.
- The resolution and clarity of some figures could be improved, particularly by enlarging independent figures and clarifying metrics in Tables 1-3.
- The Cut-Net's role lacks analysis, and its necessity is unclear, as it is not evaluated in ablation studies.
- Limited baseline comparisons in experiments raise concerns about the robustness of the results, particularly with recent methods like DiffSR and Nuvo.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and resolution of figures, particularly by enlarging independent figures and ensuring Tables 1-3 specify whether metrics are to be minimized or maximized. Additionally, we suggest including a detailed analysis of the Cut-Net in ablation studies to clarify its necessity and effectiveness. Expanding the baseline comparisons to include more recent methods would strengthen the evaluation of FAM's performance. Finally, discussing the potential applications of FAM for noisy point clouds and its limitations regarding specific object types would enhance the paper's depth.
