Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel transductive learning method, TransCLIP, aimed at enhancing the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. The authors propose an objective function constrained by Kullback-Leibler divergence, which integrates a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for clustering, Laplacian regularization, and text knowledge preservation. The Block Majority-Minimize optimization technique is introduced to efficiently optimize the intertwined variables. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the method's effectiveness across various datasets, showing significant performance improvements over existing approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized and clearly presents its concepts, facilitating reader comprehension.
- Experimental evaluations are rigorous, employing diverse datasets and demonstrating substantial performance gains.
- The theoretical convergence analysis provides a solid foundation for the proposed optimization strategy.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for using transductive learning is unclear, particularly given the inherently paired and labeled nature of vision and language data in the CLIP framework.
- There is a conceptual misalignment between transductive learning and zero-shot learning paradigms, making the application of transductive methods appear forced.
- The introduction of GMM and Laplacian terms lacks intuitive justification, with no qualitative analysis to explain their effectiveness.
- The computational overhead associated with GMM and Laplacian regularization is significant, and the paper lacks experimental validation of the method's efficiency.
- The proposed objective function's multiple terms may lead to conflicts, necessitating a detailed analysis of their interactions.
- The scalability of TransCLIP on larger datasets remains uncertain, and the robustness of theoretical convergence guarantees in practical scenarios requires scrutiny.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind leveraging transductive learning in the context of the CLIP framework. Additionally, a discussion on the differences between their method and existing unsupervised learning approaches would enhance understanding. We suggest providing qualitative analyses to elucidate the effectiveness of the GMM and Laplacian terms. Furthermore, including benchmarks or comparative analyses regarding computational efficiency would address concerns about scalability. Finally, a detailed examination of the interactions among the multiple terms in the objective function is essential to ensure balanced learning outcomes.
