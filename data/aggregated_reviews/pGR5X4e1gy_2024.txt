Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for graph machine learning on large graphs through Intersecting Community Graphs (ICG). The authors propose that traditional MPNNs struggle with memory and computational efficiency due to their dependence on graph edges. The ICG method approximates the input graph using fewer communities, leveraging a constructive version of the Weak Graph Regularity Lemma for efficient construction. The learning algorithm achieves linear memory and time complexity relative to the number of nodes, making it suitable for large, non-sparse graphs. Empirical evaluations confirm its effectiveness in tasks such as node classification and spatio-temporal data processing.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The approach theoretically scales linearly with the number of nodes, addressing memory complexity issues inherent in traditional MPNNs for large graphs.
2. The introduction of a constructive version of the Weak Graph Regularity Lemma is of independent interest in graph theory.
3. Empirical results demonstrate competitive performance in node classification and spatio-temporal tasks.

Weaknesses:
1. The speed advantage of the proposed method relies on the assumption that the number of communities K is less than the node degree, which may not hold in real-world datasets.
2. The ICG computation requires an offline pre-computation step with linear time complexity to the number of edges.
3. The Runtime Analysis section lacks a time comparison for model convergence alongside per-epoch runtime.
4. The paper should include comparisons with existing initialization methods to validate the proposed initialization method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the conditions under which the proposed method is effective, particularly regarding graph density and sparsity. It would be beneficial to provide a straightforward way to determine the applicability of the method based on these conditions. Additionally, we suggest including a time and memory analysis for the real runtime of fitting ICGs and conducting evaluations across a broader range of datasets to validate robustness. Furthermore, a comparison with existing graph coarsening methods should be included to contextualize the proposed approach within the current research landscape. Lastly, we encourage the authors to refine the notation used throughout the paper to enhance clarity and consistency.
