Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Integrated Multimodal Perception (IMP) for multimodal multi-task learning, utilizing a shared Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Encoder and modality-specific layers. The authors propose an Alternative Gradient Descent (AGD) approach to optimize various inputs and outputs while maintaining efficiency. The method employs a multi-resolution strategy for training on large batches of video and audio data. Extensive experiments demonstrate competitive performance in zero-shot classification tasks, although some limitations are noted.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method effectively integrates multiple modalities into a single model, showcasing an interesting solution that maintains efficiency and accuracy.
2. The dynamic resolution strategy is novel and enhances training effectiveness.
3. The paper is well-written and presents clear experimental results demonstrating the method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. The performance of IMP appears to decline when new modalities are added, potentially undermining the paper's main claim.
2. The model's performance varies with sample distribution, raising concerns about its robustness and the implications for future dataset incorporation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Algorithm 1 by removing f(t, S_t) to align with Lines 142-143 and consider discussing alternative sampling options. Additionally, incorporating a mini-batch sampling within one task could enhance the algorithm's logic. It would be beneficial to add a section addressing the method's limitations and contextualizing the conclusion that alternating objectives is superior to summing them. Explicitly discussing the performance drops when adding new modalities, as noted in Figure 5, would also strengthen the paper.
