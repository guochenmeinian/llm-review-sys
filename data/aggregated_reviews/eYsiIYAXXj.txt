### Key Points
This paper presents a deep sequence generation network for inverse design in optical multilayer thin film structures aimed at achieving a shiny reflecting appearance. The authors propose two structures, with the second exhibiting high transmission in the radio frequency regime, and validate their findings through experimental measurements of transmission and reflection. The authors justify the significance of their work as an environmentally sustainable alternative to Decorative Chrome Plating (DCP), although the use of germanium (Ge) raises concerns due to its high cost compared to chromium (Cr). Additionally, the authors mention that shiny metal-based emblems can block radio frequency (RF) transmission for vehicle sensors, but lack supporting references.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The method is clearly articulated and the design results are experimentally verified.  
- The study addresses an important topic related to environmental sustainability and chromium deposition.  
- The theory-to-lab pipeline demonstrates practical applicability and potential for broader applications.

Weaknesses:  
- The significance of the materials developed is unclear, particularly regarding the use of germanium.  
- The choice to design layers sequentially rather than encoding the recipe as a vector may limit optimization efficiency.  
- Lack of references to support claims about RF transmission issues related to shiny metal-based emblems.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for using germanium by addressing its cost implications compared to chromium. Additionally, we suggest providing references to substantiate claims regarding RF transmission issues. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to consider optimizing the layer design simultaneously by encoding the recipe as a vector to avoid local minima during the PSO process.
