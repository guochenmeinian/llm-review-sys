### Key Points
This paper presents a study on private online prediction from experts (OPE) and online convex optimization (OCO), proposing a transformation that converts lazy algorithms into private algorithms. The authors demonstrate that their approach yields improved regret bounds, particularly in high privacy regimes, and provide a matching lower bound for lazy algorithms, indicating the necessity for alternative techniques for better regret.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed transformation is versatile, applicable to any algorithm meeting specific properties.
- The results significantly outperform previous bounds, especially in high privacy scenarios ($\varepsilon \ll 1$).
- A matching lower bound is established, reinforcing the theoretical contributions.

Weaknesses:
- The improvement may not be substantial, as it primarily enhances the dependency on $\varepsilon$, which is often treated as a constant in practice.
- The lower bound's applicability is limited; Theorem 4.2 necessitates $\varepsilon^2$-CDP rather than $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP, suggesting not all $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP algorithms will meet this lower bound.
- The transformation is restricted to low-switching algorithms and oblivious adversaries, lacking adaptability to non-oblivious settings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the applicability of their results to adaptive adversaries, as the current assumptions may limit the practical relevance of their findings. Additionally, clarifying the implications of using CDP for the lower bound while providing upper bounds based on DP analysis would enhance the theoretical framework. It would also be beneficial to include proof-of-concept experiments comparing the new mechanism with previous algorithms to substantiate claims of improvement. Finally, consider simplifying the presentation of definitions related to differential privacy to enhance accessibility for readers unfamiliar with the topic.
