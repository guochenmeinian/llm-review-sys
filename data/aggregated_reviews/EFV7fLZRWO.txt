Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Muscles in Time (MinT) dataset, a large-scale synthetic muscle activation dataset created by augmenting existing motion capture datasets with simulated muscle activations using OpenSim. The dataset encompasses 227 subjects and 402 muscle strands, providing over nine hours of simulation data. The authors propose neural network baselines for muscle activation regression based on kinematic observations, demonstrating the dataset's potential applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The creation of a large-scale synthetic muscle activation dataset is a significant contribution to data-driven motion analysis.
- The detailed description of the data generation pipeline enhances reproducibility and utility for future research.
- The dataset's extensive coverage of subjects and muscle strands surpasses many existing datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on synthetic data raises concerns regarding its practical applicability and generalization to real-world scenarios.
- The baseline selection and experimental evaluations are insufficient, lacking quantitative assessments of data quality and comparisons with simpler models.
- Documentation of the dataset and code is inadequate, hindering usability for future researchers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset's validation by incorporating real-world EMG data to enhance its applicability. Additionally, expanding the dataset to cover a broader range of motions and exploring domain adaptation techniques would strengthen generalization. We suggest providing clearer documentation on the simulation pipeline, including detailed instructions for marker placements and the use of the code repository. Finally, addressing the limitations of the SMPL model regarding foot and hand representation would clarify the dataset's assumptions and improve its robustness.
