### Key Points
This paper presents a method to enhance automatic speech recognition (ASR) for various accents through the use of learnable accent-specific codebooks and a joint beam search algorithm that iterates over all possible accents. The authors demonstrate that their approach yields statistically significant improvements for both seen and unseen accents, supported by comprehensive experiments and ablation studies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and provides a clear motivation for the proposed method.
- The introduction of accent-specific codebooks and the joint beam search algorithm is innovative and suitable for the task.
- The experimental results indicate strong performance, particularly in zero-shot settings, and the work is systematically executed with a wide range of hyperparameters.

Weaknesses:
- The improvements diminish as the dataset size increases, raising concerns about performance on accent-balanced datasets.
- The potential for codebook size to become unmanageable with numerous accents is a significant issue.
- The modified beam search algorithm may not effectively explore all accent codebooks, risking premature pruning of low-score accents.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the model's performance for unseen accents, addressing questions such as why the method excels in this area. Additionally, the authors should provide more details on model architectures, sizes, and computational complexities for the results reported in Tables 3, 4, and 5. It would be beneficial to include I-vector and multi-task learning (MTL) system results in the relevant tables, as these could serve as strong baselines. Furthermore, the authors should consider the implications of fixed codebook sizes on imbalanced accent data and provide statistics on the number of distinct accents processed during the modified beam search. Lastly, the authors should ensure that relevant literature from traditional ASR on accented speech is cited to strengthen the paper's foundation.
