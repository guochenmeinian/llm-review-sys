Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel algorithm for adaptively selecting an optimal discretization schedule in the training of diffusion models, which does not require hyper-parameter tuning and adapts to the dynamics and geometry of the diffusion path. The authors propose minimizing a surrogate for the total length of the diffusion sampling path, defined in terms of the Fisher divergence between two steps. The method achieves competitive FID scores on image datasets and demonstrates solid empirical performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The findings are interesting, providing a theoretical analysis that addresses the heuristic nature of current schedule designs.
- The proposed online data-dependent adaptive discretization schedule tuning algorithm is simple and effective.
- The mathematical analysis is detailed, with adequate discussion of related work and provision of corresponding code.
- Clear visual comparisons illustrate the distribution of optimized times.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments lack validation for the widely used LDM model, which is critical for assessing the proposed method's robustness.
- The method's applicability to other diffusion frameworks, such as VP-SDE and Flow Matching, is unclear.
- Additional quantitative and visual comparisons are needed, as the FID metric alone is insufficient for evaluating generation quality; incorporating metrics like sFID, Recall, and Precision would provide a more comprehensive assessment.
- The mathematical sections, particularly on differential geometry, are difficult to understand; background and notation notes should be added.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental validation by including tests on the LDM model and other diffusion frameworks to demonstrate robustness. Additionally, the authors should provide more quantitative and visual comparisons beyond FID scores, incorporating metrics such as sFID, Recall, and Precision for a thorough evaluation. To enhance clarity, we suggest adding background and notation notes to the mathematical sections, particularly regarding differential geometry, to aid reader comprehension.
