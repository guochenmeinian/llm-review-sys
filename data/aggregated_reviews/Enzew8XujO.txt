Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a transfer learning algorithm, mean embedding kernel ridge regression (MEKRR), which utilizes kernel mean embeddings from pre-trained graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict energies of atomistic systems. The authors demonstrate that MEKRR achieves competitive performance compared to SchNet on the OC20 dataset, while providing interpretability regarding chemical evolution in trajectories. The method is designed to address challenges in transferability within machine-learned interatomic potentials.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and organized, providing a clear overview of GNN and kernel-based approaches to modeling potential energy surfaces.
- MEKRR shows excellent generalization and transferability performance on datasets of increasing complexity.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation of MEKRR is limited to comparison with only one GNN, SchNet, which is not the state-of-the-art model for the OC20 dataset. This raises questions about the method's robustness and generalizability.
- The lack of substantial theoretical evidence supporting MEKRR's claimed advantages over fine-tuned GNNs leaves its performance motivations unclear.
- MEKRR's inability to directly calculate molecular forces and its linear scaling computational cost for inference may limit its practical applications in large-scale datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including comparisons with additional state-of-the-art GNN models, such as Allegro, MACE, or Spherical Channel Network, to better establish MEKRR's effectiveness. Additionally, providing theoretical insights or empirical evidence to support the performance claims of MEKRR would enhance the paper's credibility. We suggest conducting an ablation study to clarify the innovative aspects of the proposed method and explicitly distinguishing between new contributions and existing methods in the methodology section. Lastly, addressing the limitations regarding model robustness and ethical considerations would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the implications of the proposed work.
