Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a systematic review of 239 dataset papers published in the NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks track from 2021 to 2023, focusing on four key aspects of data management practices: provenance, distribution, ethical disclosure, and licensing. The authors identify significant inconsistencies across these areas, emphasizing the necessity for standardized data infrastructures and improved guidelines for ethical and legal dataset management. They call for the NeurIPS community to establish standardized data infrastructures to ensure responsible dataset usage and accurate models, proposing built-in templates for structured metadata input and mechanisms for tracking changes and contributors across dataset versions. The authors highlight the importance of compliance with the FAIR principles, advocating for rich metadata, persistent identifiers, and accessible hosting services. They also recommend that dataset authors collaborate with institutional libraries to enhance dataset accessibility and consider authentication mechanisms for sensitive datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of a large sample of recent NeurIPS dataset papers, offering valuable insights into current practices.
- It effectively identifies critical issues around dataset provenance, ethical considerations, and licensing, which have significant implications for responsible AI development.
- The authors present clear and actionable recommendations for addressing the identified challenges, including the need for standardized data infrastructures and compliance with the FAIR principles.

Weaknesses:
- The review is limited to NeurIPS dataset papers, which may not fully represent practices in other conferences or disciplines.
- The manual data-collection process is not scalable and lacks discussion on potential automation.
- The limitations section is brief and lacks depth, particularly regarding the implications of standardization and the variability in ethical disclosures.
- The manuscript lacks specific examples of hosting services that meet the outlined requirements and insufficient detail on how dataset authors can implement the suggested improvements in practice.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the limitations section by expanding on the potential drawbacks of standardization in documentation practices and discussing how ethical disclosures could be standardized. Additionally, the authors should consider incorporating more detailed case studies or examples of best practices to illustrate their recommendations. A closer integration of the analysis with the results, particularly regarding dataset hosting and the review process, would strengthen the paper. We also suggest including specific examples of hosting services that support rich metadata and DOIs, as well as providing practical guidance on how dataset authors can implement the recommendations for accessibility and interoperability. Finally, we recommend revising the title to avoid the term "norm," as it may imply normative expectations rather than empirical observations; a title emphasizing "practices" or "empirical" would be more appropriate.
