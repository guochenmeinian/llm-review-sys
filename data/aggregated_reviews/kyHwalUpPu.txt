### Key Points
This paper presents the Diagnosis of Thought (DoT) approach, which utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect cognitive distortions in psychotherapy. The method involves a three-stage process: (1) subjective assessment, (2) contrastive reasoning, and (3) schema analysis, aimed at enhancing the identification of cognitive distortions. Evaluations on a public dataset demonstrate that the proposed prompting method outperforms existing techniques. The authors argue that this approach could provide valuable AI assistance to mental health professionals.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The application of LLMs in mental healthcare could improve the identification of cognitive distortions, potentially enhancing therapy effectiveness.
- The DoT method is grounded in domain expertise and shows promise in addressing significant issues in psychotherapy.
- The paper includes human evaluations and ablation studies, contributing to the interpretability of the results.

Weaknesses:
- The main contribution, while valuable, lacks sufficient novelty for a competitive conference, primarily focusing on prompt engineering rather than groundbreaking methodology.
- Claims regarding "diagnosis" are overstated, as there is insufficient evidence that LLMs can genuinely diagnose cognitive distortions.
- The literature review is weak, and the connection to interpretability is not well established.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their contributions by expanding the related work section to include more comprehensive literature on cognitive distortion detection and LLM applications. Additionally, clarifying the role of clinicians in the study, including their qualifications and involvement in the evaluation process, would enhance the paper's credibility. The authors should also address the ethical concerns regarding the use of "experts" in labeling data, ensuring that qualified clinicians are part of the research or review process. Finally, we suggest that the authors consider resubmitting to the CLPsych workshop, which may be more appropriate given the focus on psychotherapy applications.
