### Key Points
This paper presents a study on identifying and ranking agents who strategically manipulate inputs to game machine learning models in multi-agent environments. The authors propose a causally-motivated approach to tackle this challenge, demonstrating that while gaming parameters may be unknown, an ordering of agents based on their ranking is learnable from datasets. The application of this ranking is illustrated through a Medicare case study.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The work generalizes the study of strategic adaptation to a more realistic setting and provides provable results for computing rankings, which can be utilized for gaming detection.  
- The application to Medicare is particularly noteworthy and relevant.

Weaknesses:  
- The assumption of players being almost perfectly rational is problematic, as real-world players may exhibit bounded rationality, raising questions about the accuracy of the proposed approach.  
- The framework lacks clarity on how rankings can be effectively used to detect gaming, which is the primary motivation of the study.  
- The paper's motivation and justification for the chosen problems are insufficiently contextualized, and the model appears marginal compared to existing studies.  
- The experimental evaluation relies on a single synthetic dataset, limiting the generalizability of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how rankings can be utilized to detect gaming, potentially by providing a general provable approach under specific conditions. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the motivation and justification for the problems addressed at the beginning of the paper to provide better context. The authors should also consider expanding their experimental evaluation to include multiple datasets to strengthen the generalizability of their results. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify their assumptions and provide justifications for them, particularly in relation to existing literature.
