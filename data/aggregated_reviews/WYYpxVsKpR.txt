Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a dynamic programming (DP) framework, STreeD, for constructing optimal decision trees, expanding the range of solvable objectives and constraints. The authors introduce a new cost function and provide theoretical insights into the solvability of specific optimal decision tree problems. The framework is evaluated through extensive experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in tasks such as revenue maximization and group fairness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and organized, with comprehensive experimental evaluations supporting its claims.
- It introduces a flexible cost function and a novel framework for learning decision trees, which can handle a wider range of objectives and constraints.
- The theoretical contributions include a rigorous definition of separable objectives and a mathematical formulation of the DP recursive algorithm.

Weaknesses:
- The originality of the generalization is unclear, and more details are needed to justify the benchmarks in the numerical section.
- Some definitions, such as anti-monotonicity, appear non-standard and could benefit from clearer explanations and examples.
- The relationship between the proposed framework and existing DP theory is not sufficiently articulated, raising questions about the novelty of the work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by providing examples that illustrate the concepts of order preservation and anti-monotonicity, particularly in Section 4.4. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the relationship between Proposition 4.3 and Theorem 4.6 and existing works, as well as justify the choice of benchmarks used in the experiments. It would also be beneficial to discuss the limitations of the current framework, particularly regarding the types of splits considered. Finally, we advise revising the title to better reflect the theoretical contributions of the paper.
