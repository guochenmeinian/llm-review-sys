Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents sample complexity bounds for Bayesian optimization using invariant kernels, which model functions invariant under transformation families. The authors investigate the theoretical implications of these invariances, focusing on finite subgroups of isometries. They provide upper and lower bounds on sample complexity for two BayesOpt algorithms: maximum variance reduction and upper confidence bound (UCB). The empirical results demonstrate significant speed-ups in optimization tasks, including a real-world application in nuclear reactor configuration.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The regret bounds appear novel and significant for the Bayesian optimization community, aiding in understanding trade-offs in kernel selection.
- The theoretical contributions are sound and well-articulated, with a clear exploration of the method's efficiency.
- The paper is well-written, making complex ideas accessible.

Weaknesses:
- Contributions are primarily theoretical, with a relatively short empirical study that may not fully convince readers of practical applicability.
- Sample complexity bounds are only provided for the maximum variance reduction algorithm, which may be less relevant than UCB for many applications.
- The experimental section lacks clarity and could benefit from additional applications or examples to illustrate broader applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical study by showcasing more applications of the algorithm to demonstrate its feasibility in various contexts. Additionally, we suggest providing clarity in the experimental section to enhance reproducibility. It would be beneficial to include comparisons with simpler baselines, such as periodic kernels or constrained Bayesian optimization, to contextualize the performance of the proposed method. Furthermore, addressing the sample complexity of the UCB acquisition function and providing more intuitive examples of invariance-aware Bayesian optimization would strengthen the paper.
