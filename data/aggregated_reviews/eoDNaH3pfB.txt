Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to differential privacy (DP) tailored for interactive machine learning (ML) settings, introducing Challenge DP, a relaxed notion allowing sensitive outputs for specific queries while maintaining privacy for others. The authors propose a construction that enhances accuracy, reducing errors from exponential to quadratic in the number of mistakes made by a black-box algorithm. The work aims to bridge the gap between privacy guarantees and the accuracy of interactive learning algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The method is an interesting and well-supported proposal, with significant theoretical contributions and proofs.  
- The paper provides a comprehensive overview of prior advancements in the field.  
- The novel relaxation of classical DP and the proposed construction are clever and yield important improvements in accuracy.  

Weaknesses:  
- The presentation is poor, with numerous writing issues, including citations in the abstract and a lack of a proper conclusion.  
- The paper is heavily reliant on the appendix, making it difficult to process crucial sections.  
- There are no experimental results to validate the proposed method, which is odd given its application-driven context.  
- The motivating example involving a chatbot may not be relevant to private online classification, creating a disconnect in the narrative.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the overall presentation by restructuring the paper to include a clear conclusion and explicit contributions. The abstract should be reworded to eliminate citations. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the relationship between Challenge DP and existing DP definitions, possibly by introducing different terminology for clarity. Including experimental results would also enhance the paper's credibility and demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed method. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide a more relevant motivating example related to private online classification and to ensure that all proofs and key results are highlighted effectively in the main text.
