Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents multiple extensions of Haim et al. [2022] regarding the reconstruction of training data in neural networks, including adaptations for multiclass classification, regression losses, the effects of weight decay, and the relationship between sample size and network parameters. The authors provide both theoretical foundations and empirical evidence for their claims, particularly highlighting the significance of their multiclass extension.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work is original and presents novel contributions, particularly in extending the reconstruction scheme to multiclass settings and convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
- The paper is well-structured, clearly written, and provides a balance of theoretical analysis and empirical results.
- It offers significant insights into the conditions influencing the memorization of training data, which is crucial for understanding neural networks.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution regarding general loss functions is perceived as weaker, with concerns that the authors are merely testing various regression losses rather than presenting a truly general framework.
- The empirical results lack depth, with insufficient discussion on findings, particularly regarding the failure of straightforward extensions and the challenges posed by CNNs.
- Limitations of the method are not adequately discussed, particularly regarding its applicability to shallow networks, specific architectures, and scenarios with limited training samples.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions by explicitly labeling the section on general loss functions as "general regression losses." Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more thorough discussion of their empirical findings, addressing questions such as the reasons behind the failure to reconstruct samples and the impact of weight decay on reconstruction efficacy. It would also be beneficial to include a dedicated limitations section that outlines the constraints of their method, particularly its applicability to larger and more complex datasets like ImageNet. Finally, we encourage the authors to consider the inclusion of statistical analyses in their experiments to strengthen their findings.
