Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CryoGEM, a method that generates large annotated cryo-EM datasets from a limited number of real micrographs (100) by combining a physics-based image formation model with a contrastive learning strategy. The authors demonstrate that CryoGEM enhances the quality of downstream tasks such as particle picking, homogeneous reconstruction, and pose estimation. The method significantly improves the visual quality of generated images, preserving structural details and realistic noise patterns, thereby leading to better 3D reconstructions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- CryoGEM effectively combines physics-informed modeling with generative techniques, addressing a significant gap in cryo-EM analysis.
- Extensive experiments show that CryoGEM produces high-quality synthetic cryo-EM images that outperform existing methods like CycleGAN and CUT.
- The method is clearly described, and the experiments are reproducible, with all contributions illustrated through experiments.

Weaknesses:
- Some parts of Section 3 lack clarity, particularly regarding the mutual information extraction and the origin and resolution of coarse models.
- The requirement for a coarse result as input can limit applicability in scenarios with small or dynamic molecules.
- There is no code availability, which may restrict access for the broader research community.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 3 by providing detailed explanations regarding the mutual information extraction process and the origin and resolution of the coarse models used. Additionally, addressing the limitations related to the requirement for a coarse result and discussing the efficiency of the proposed pipeline compared to manual picking would enhance the paper's practical relevance. Finally, we urge the authors to consider making the code available to facilitate broader accessibility and validation of their work.
