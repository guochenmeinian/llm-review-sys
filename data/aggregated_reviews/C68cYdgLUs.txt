### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of citation patterns in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to assess its influence on and from other fields, utilizing a dataset of metadata from approximately 77,000 NLP papers and over 3 million citations. The authors propose metrics for measuring citation prominence and diversity, and their findings indicate a trend of increasing insularity within NLP. The paper is structured around several research questions, supported by visualizations, but often lacks in-depth discussion of the results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides valuable insights into NLP's interdisciplinary connections, illustrated with clear graphics.
- It raises important discussions about citation trends and their implications for the field.
- The writing is generally clear and the organization is effective.

Weaknesses:
- Discussions are limited, primarily focusing on describing figures rather than interpreting results.
- The methodology for citation collection lacks clarity, particularly regarding citations from other fields.
- The reliance on classification for field identification may introduce unnecessary errors.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the depth of discussions surrounding their findings, particularly regarding the causes of observed trends. Clarifying the citation collection methodology, especially how citations from other fields are accessed, is essential. Additionally, we suggest reconsidering the use of classification for field identification, as publication venues often indicate the field explicitly. Addressing the inconsistencies in plot timelines and providing more nuanced interpretations of citation patterns would enhance the paper's overall impact.
