Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the DenseFusion-1M dataset, designed to generate high-quality, detailed image-text pairs by leveraging multiple visual experts, thereby enhancing the research and application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The authors propose a Perceptual Fusion framework that addresses the limitations of existing caption engines and demonstrates significant improvements in MLLM perceptual and cognitive abilities through extensive benchmark testing.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The Perceptual Fusion framework innovatively integrates multiple vision experts, significantly enhancing the accuracy and detail of image descriptions.
2. The DenseFusion-1M dataset, comprising 1 million carefully selected images, offers rich textual information and supports comprehensive visual perception training for MLLMs.
3. Extensive experiments validate the dataset's effectiveness across various visual-linguistic benchmarks, showcasing its broad applicability and potential for future research.

Weaknesses:
1. The potential biases inherited from the LAION dataset are not adequately addressed, raising concerns about the dataset's fairness and representativeness.
2. The computational resources required for implementing the Perceptual Fusion framework are significant, which may limit scalability and practical application.
3. The article lacks clarity on how different vision experts contribute to the final image descriptions, hindering a deeper understanding of the framework's performance benefits.
4. There are no visual analyses or case studies provided to illustrate the roles of different visual experts in generating image descriptions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on assessing and mitigating potential biases in the DenseFusion-1M dataset. Additionally, the authors should clarify the computational resource requirements for generating large datasets and explore feasible ways to reduce these costs. It is essential to provide detailed explanations of how information from various vision experts is integrated into the final image descriptions, including any specific fusion algorithms used. Furthermore, the authors should consider including visual analyses or case studies to demonstrate the contributions of different visual experts effectively.
