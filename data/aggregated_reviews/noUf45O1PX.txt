### Key Points
This paper presents BanLemma, a rule- and dictionary-based lemmatization system specifically designed for the Bangla language. The authors propose a novel method that analyzes suffix marker sequences based on the part-of-speech (PoS) class of words, achieving a high accuracy of 96.36% on a human-annotated test dataset. The linguistic rules were derived from an extensive analysis of a Bangla text corpus containing 90.65M unique sentences. The evaluation framework includes intra-dataset and cross-dataset assessments, demonstrating BanLemma's superior performance compared to existing methodologies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. BanLemma is based on a rigorous analysis of a large Bangla text corpus, providing a comprehensive understanding of word formation.
2. The focus on suffix marker sequences rather than entire suffixes addresses limitations of previous methods.
3. Achieving an accuracy of 96.36% on a human-annotated test dataset highlights the system's potential.
4. The paper details its methodology thoroughly, including the creation of rules and the dictionary for BanLemma.
5. The system performs competitively across various datasets, surpassing other lemmatizers in specific tests.

Weaknesses:
1. Performance significantly decreases when using an automatic PoS tagger, raising concerns about real-world applicability.
2. The lemmatizer struggles with words that are already lemmas but end with suffix substrings, which could affect its utility in evolving vocabularies.
3. Notably lower performance on the dataset from Chakrabarty et al. (2017) suggests potential overfitting or lack of generalizability.
4. The specifics of rule formation are not deeply discussed, making it difficult to assess adaptability to nuanced linguistic challenges.
5. A more comprehensive analysis of failure cases beyond PoS errors would provide a clearer understanding of the lemmatizer's weaknesses.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the lemmatizer's limitations, particularly regarding its performance with out-of-dictionary words and its dependency on PoS tagging accuracy. Additionally, providing clearer details on the formation of linguistic rules would enhance the paper's robustness. Addressing the performance discrepancies observed with different datasets would also strengthen the overall argument. Finally, we suggest unifying the presentation style of Bangla words and their English meanings to facilitate understanding for a broader audience.
