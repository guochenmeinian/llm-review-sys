### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method, Contextually-spectral based correspondence refinery (CANDY), to tackle the Dual Noisy Correspondence (DNC) problem in contrastive multi-view clustering (MvC). CANDY employs inter-view similarities to identify false negatives and utilizes a spectral-based module for denoising correspondences, effectively addressing the challenges posed by false positives. The authors validate the method's effectiveness through extensive experiments on five multi-view benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance compared to eight competitive MvC methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- CANDY introduces a practical and innovative approach to handle DNC, showing potential as a plug-and-play solution to enhance existing contrastive MvC methods.
- The combination of context-based semantic mining and spectral-based denoising offers a robust solution against noisy correspondence, with extensive experiments validating its effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. The influence of the Gaussian kernel parameter $\sigma$ on CANDY's performance requires thorough examination, as varying $\sigma$ may impact the affinity graph's construction.
2. Insights into the computational overhead introduced by the CANDY method are needed.
3. Clarification is required on how false negative and false positive proportions are maintained across different datasets and experimental conditions, particularly regarding the fixed false negative proportion of 1/K in Table 1.
4. The claim that CANDY can serve as a plug-and-play solution raises questions about its integration with other contrastive multi-view clustering methods beyond DIVIDE.
5. Concerns regarding the arrangement of the cross-view similarity matrix in Figure 4 and the trade-off between true and false recalls need to be addressed.
6. The applicability of CANDY to incomplete views and its extension to handle more than two views should be explored.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the examination of the Gaussian kernel parameter $\sigma$ and its impact on clustering results. Additionally, the authors should provide insights into the computational overhead of the CANDY method. Clarifying how false negative and false positive proportions are maintained across datasets is essential, particularly regarding the fixed proportion in Table 1. We suggest exploring the integration of the pseudo target generated by CANDY into other contrastive multi-view clustering methods beyond DIVIDE to demonstrate its versatility. Furthermore, addressing the arrangement of the cross-view similarity matrix in Figure 4 and the balance between true and false recalls would enhance the clarity of the results. Lastly, we encourage the authors to investigate the method's applicability to incomplete views and its potential extension to scenarios involving more than two views.
