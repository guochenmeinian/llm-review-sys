Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for testing conditional independence (CI) in the presence of discretized variables, which are originally continuous but mapped to a discrete domain. The authors introduce bridge equations to estimate covariance and utilize nodewise regression for precision coefficients, supporting their approach with theoretical and empirical evidence. The method aims to address limitations in traditional CI tests that assume discretized observations can substitute continuous variables.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper significantly contributes to structure learning and causal discovery, providing a solid theoretical framework for the CI test.  
- It features a self-contained graphical representation of discretized and continuous variables, and the flexibility of the bridge equations enhances its applicability.  
- Empirical results demonstrate the method's effectiveness across various scenarios.

Weaknesses:  
- The reliance on a multivariate Gaussian distribution is a stringent assumption that limits the method's applicability.  
- The empirical results indicate that the proposed Discretized CI Test (DCT) exhibits lower power compared to baseline methods.  
- The authors do not adequately discuss the impact of discretization on induced dependence, nor do they provide compelling examples where discretization induces strong dependence.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the impact of the adopted discretization approach on induced dependence, including specific examples that illustrate strong dependence induced by discretization. Additionally, we suggest incorporating comparisons against modern tests for mixed variables, such as the Bayesian Independence Test with Mixed-type Variables by Benavoli et al. (2021), and using established tests for discrete variables as baselines. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the definition of the "vec" operator and consider alternative discretization methods, such as uniformly spaced or equiprobable bins, to enhance the informativeness of the discretized variables.
