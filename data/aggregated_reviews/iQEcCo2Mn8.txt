### Key Points
This paper presents Miresga, a novel approach to optimizing Layer-7 (L7) load balancing in cloud data centers by offloading elephant flows to programmable switches while managing mouse flows on general-purpose servers. The authors propose a hybrid system that enhances throughput and reduces latency through a co-design of software and hardware. Miresga addresses significant challenges associated with programmable switches, such as limited memory and complex kernel protocol stacks, and demonstrates its effectiveness through extensive simulations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Miresga introduces a hybrid system that effectively combines software and hardware to enhance L7 load balancing, addressing performance limitations of existing solutions.
2. The paper tackles critical challenges in utilizing programmable switches, applying techniques like entry compression and task-specific agents to leverage their advantages.
3. The technical rigor is evident through problem formulation, detailed system design, explicit workflows, and the provision of open-source code.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper's simulations indicate that Miresga outperforms Prism for small objects, but performance similarities for larger messages warrant further discussion to highlight Miresga's advantages.
2. Scalability concerns are raised, particularly regarding the potential bottleneck of programmable switches in large or diverse network environments.
3. The bounded CPU usage of the back-end server raises questions about the underlying reasons and whether this limitation can be addressed through L7 load balancer design.
4. The cost implications of using programmable switches compared to traditional methods need clarification to assess their economic viability.
5. The slower processing of encrypted packets may expose vulnerabilities to potential attacks on data center servers.
6. Visual elements, including figures and charts, require enhancements for clarity and readability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the value of performance improvements for small objects to emphasize Miresga's advantages. Additionally, the authors should address scalability concerns by providing insights on how Miresga maintains performance across varying network sizes and conditions. Clarifying the reasons for the bounded CPU usage in the back-end server and exploring potential solutions would strengthen the paper. The authors should also evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using programmable switches compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, addressing the security implications of slower processing of encrypted packets and enhancing the clarity of visual elements in the paper would improve overall readability and impact.
