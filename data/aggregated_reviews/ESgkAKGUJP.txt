### Key Points
This paper analyzes the relationship between geometric compression, indicated by intrinsic dimensionality, information-theoretic complexity, measured as perplexity, and ease of adaptation for representations learned by large language models (LLMs). The authors demonstrate that geometric compression predicts both information-theoretic complexity and ease of adaptation, even when linguistic structure is progressively destroyed. Their findings suggest that LLMs, despite varying extrinsic dimensionality, exhibit similar and relatively small intrinsic dimensionality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is clearly written and presents rigorous experimentation with a variety of estimation methods and datasets, lending credence to its results.
- The findings could stimulate interest in analyzing linguistic characteristics through LLMs, enhancing understanding of human language.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation lacks diversity in the language models used, primarily focusing on the OPT family without including models like BLOOM or Llama.
- Some areas lack clarity, such as whether models are fine-tuned on transformed datasets and the definition of zero-shot perplexity.
- The destruction of linguistic structure through severe transformations may diminish the interest in the increase of intrinsic dimensionality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the diversity of language models evaluated by including those with different training data and architectures. Additionally, we suggest enhancing clarity regarding the fine-tuning process and defining zero-shot perplexity. To address concerns about the severity of linguistic structure destruction, we encourage the authors to consider less severe transformations, such as noisy paraphrase. Finally, we advise that the authors strengthen the connection between the theoretical discussions and the concrete experiments presented in the paper.
