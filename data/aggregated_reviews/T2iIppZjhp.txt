### Key Points
This paper presents DiscomfortFilter, an LLM-based tool designed to filter discomforting recommendations from recommender systems. The authors conduct a formative study and validate their approach through experiments on the Zhihu platform, demonstrating the effectiveness of DiscomfortFilter. The methodology emphasizes user preferences, generating a comprehensible and editable user profile for filtering criteria. The authors claim that their approach allows smaller LLMs to match or exceed the performance of larger models like GPT-4.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- The plug-and-play approach enhances transparency and flexibility in filtering discomforting recommendations.
- The methodology personalizes recommendations effectively, even without direct access to the recommender system.
- Users expressed high satisfaction with DiscomfortFilter compared to traditional 'Not Interested' buttons.

Weaknesses:
- The participant pool in the studies is relatively small and lacks diversity, with most users having a high educational background.
- The experiments are limited to the MIND dataset, which is insufficient for robust validation; at least 2-3 datasets should be used.
- There is a lack of comparison with existing methods, which would help verify the proposed method's effectiveness.
- The filtering process resembles critiquing-based recommender systems, yet related works are not adequately discussed.
- The paper does not provide code for reproducibility, which is detrimental to the research community.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the diversity and size of the participant pool in user studies to enhance representativeness. Additionally, conducting experiments on multiple datasets would strengthen the validation of DiscomfortFilter. We suggest including comparisons with existing methods to demonstrate the proposed method's advantages. A detailed discussion on the differences between discomforting and disliked items, as well as the computational overhead of the LLM-based system, would be beneficial. Finally, addressing the algorithm's effects on the echo chamber problem could provide valuable insights.
