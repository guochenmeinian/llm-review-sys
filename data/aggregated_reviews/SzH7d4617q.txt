### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of 100 highly cited papers on automated fact-checking, focusing on the motivations, mechanisms, and intended users of proposed solutions. The authors propose a comprehensive categorization of common pitfalls in fact-checking narratives and provide recommendations for enhancing the clarity and usability of these contributions. The analysis employs a systematic content analysis approach, resulting in a novel categorization scheme and an annotated corpus to substantiate the arguments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper offers a critical examination of the fundamental goals of automated fact-checking research, revealing low coherence in influential publications.  
- It employs a robust annotation and analysis procedure, following best practices in content analysis, and provides detailed guidelines and examples for each label.  
- The work presents a broad perspective on related research across disciplines, raising awareness of the practical implications of fact-checking systems.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper makes implicit assumptions about the necessity of comprehensive narratives in all cases, which may not be universally applicable.  
- It lacks specific information about the analyzed papers, such as their distribution over publication years and citation counts.  
- The introduction of numerous new terms and categories without concrete examples complicates comprehension, and some analysis results appear simplistic or intuitive.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by providing concrete examples for the introduced terms and categories, possibly in a table format with descriptions and examples in an appendix. Additionally, addressing the underlying reasons for the identified shortcomings in the analyzed papers would enhance the paper's depth. We suggest clarifying the methodology for obtaining the analyzed papers and including relevant statistics to support the analysis. Furthermore, the authors should consider refining their argument regarding the necessity of comprehensive narratives and explore more nuanced categorizations of evidence. Lastly, simplifying complex sentences and ensuring consistency in terminology will improve readability.
