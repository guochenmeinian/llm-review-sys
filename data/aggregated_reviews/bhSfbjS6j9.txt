Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for normal map estimation from images using a conditional diffusion model that processes 16x16 patches. The authors propose a multiscale approach for consistent resampling and integrate a lighting consistency module to ensure that outputs align with global directional lighting. The model demonstrates strong generalization capabilities for both synthetic and real images. Additionally, the authors argue for producing distributions of outputs in monocular shape reconstruction to address ambiguities, drawing parallels to human multistable perception. The method employs a small patch-based diffusion model to achieve multistable solutions for shape from shading.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- A novel diffusion model for consistently predicting normal maps from input images.
- Clear presentation of the model and methodology.
- Effective handling of ambiguous cases.
- Lightweight and efficient model.
- Strong generalization to unseen images.

Weaknesses:
- Limited applicability, primarily tested on synthetic or controlled images.
- The contribution is more conceptual, lacking immediate practical impact.
- The reconstruction method yields multiple solutions, raising questions about solution selection and variation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the applicability of their method by testing it on a wider range of real-world images. Additionally, it would be beneficial to explore whether the method can be adapted for multiview settings to reconstruct texture-less surfaces consistently. We suggest including experiments to assess potential biases in the generated reconstructions, particularly in relation to training data. Furthermore, clarifying the mechanism for selecting among multiple solutions in the reconstruction process would enhance the understanding of the method's outputs. Lastly, we encourage the authors to reflect technical clarifications in the main paper and provide more explicit references to appendices for additional experiments.
