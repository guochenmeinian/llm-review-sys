Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of a Greedy bandit algorithm within a linear bandit framework, where the regression parameter is fixed and unknown, and the $K$ arms are sampled from a context distribution at each time step. The authors introduce the Local Anti-Concentration (LAC) condition, under which they derive poly-logarithmic regret guarantees for the greedy algorithm. The paper argues that exploration may not be necessary in certain contexts, making greedy methods more appealing compared to standard approaches like UCB, which can be costly. Additionally, the authors provide a theoretical analysis of the regret in a bandit problem, focusing on the upper bounds of the density of the suboptimality gap of contexts. They establish that for a 1-dimensional uniform distribution, the maximum density $M$ is proportional to $K$, while for a $d$-dimensional uniform distribution, $M$ decreases rapidly with increasing $d$. Insights into the behavior of $M$ for Gaussian and light-tailed distributions are also provided, demonstrating a logarithmic dependency on $K$. The results align with known asymptotic results, and the authors express confidence in the experimental predictions based on their theoretical findings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an interesting research question regarding the effectiveness of greedy algorithms in linear bandit settings.
- The theoretical foundation is solid, with clear connections to known results in extreme value theory.
- The authors provide a clear description of the statistical challenges and the LAC condition, which is intuitive and well-articulated.
- The numerical experiments support the theoretical claims, demonstrating the applicability of the greedy approach across various distributions.
- The authors effectively address technical questions and provide clarifications that enhance understanding.
- There is a willingness to incorporate feedback and improve the paper based on reviewer suggestions.

Weaknesses:
- The setting of the problem is perceived as artificial, with a preference for a more natural setting where arms are fixed but their performance varies due to external factors.
- The presentation lacks clarity, making it difficult to follow the technical insights and the correlation between challenges and regret analysis.
- The organization of the paper, particularly the appendix, requires significant improvement for better accessibility, complicating the verification of results.
- The appendix is poorly organized, and the proofs lack rigor.
- There are noted typos and clarity issues that detract from the overall presentation.
- The relevance of the unbounded context case is questioned, as it appears overly complicated and not essential to the main findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by reorganizing the paper to clearly link the challenges with the regret analysis. Each technical result should be properly proved in dedicated sections, and the appendix should contain rigorous proofs rather than sketches. Additionally, focusing on the bounded context case may simplify the analysis and reduce confusion. We suggest that the authors improve the organization of the appendix by significantly reorganizing it to facilitate easier navigation of the main proofs, and incorporating a table of contents at the beginning of the appendix would be beneficial. Furthermore, addressing any typos and enhancing the clarity of the writing throughout the paper, particularly in the final version, would improve overall readability. Finally, justifications for the chosen settings and clarifications regarding the implications of the LAC condition, particularly its necessity for achieving poly-logarithmic regret, would enhance the paper's contribution. Addressing the optimality of the achieved regret concerning the parameters of interest would also be beneficial.
