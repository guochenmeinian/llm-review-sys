Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a large-scale multi-view video dataset of in-the-wild human-human interactions, addressing the lack of diversity in existing datasets. The authors propose a novel tracking algorithm that utilizes a Kalman filter for 3D pose tracking and instance segmentation masks for precise 2D pose estimation. They demonstrate that state-of-the-art (SOTA) monocular mesh prediction methods underperform on their dataset, highlighting the need for improved training datasets. Fine-tuning the HMR2.0 model on the proposed dataset results in significant performance enhancements.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset significantly contributes to the understanding of human-human interactions, offering diverse types of interactions and environments.
- The authors effectively illustrate the limitations of existing datasets by showing SOTA methods' failures on their dataset and the improvements achieved through fine-tuning.
- The proposed pipeline for mesh registration is convincing and well-documented.

Weaknesses:
- The necessity of ARIA glasses in the capture setup is not well-justified.
- SMPL-X fitting could be improved, especially given the availability of Ego-view captures for precise hand information.
- The interpenetration loss is not novel and lacks proper citation.
- The ablation study lacks depth, particularly regarding the trade-off between camera count and processing speed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the use of ARIA glasses in their capture setup. Additionally, enhancing the SMPL-X fitting process on the captured dataset could significantly increase its utility. Demonstrating the advantages of ego-view captures would further validate the dataset's capture methodology. We also suggest providing more detailed insights into the processing speed and the impact of reducing camera numbers on performance. Lastly, including a discussion on common failure cases and occlusion-related challenges would inspire future research directions.
