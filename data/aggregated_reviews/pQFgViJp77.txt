Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the SPARROW benchmark, a comprehensive multilingual dataset for evaluating sociopragmatic understanding across 64 languages and 169 datasets, covering 13 task types. The authors propose a SPARROW score to assess model performance and maintain a public leaderboard. The evaluation reveals that zero-shot ChatGPT underperforms compared to task-specific finetuned models. The paper includes an in-depth analysis of various models, highlighting the impact of instruction tuning and the performance of low-resource languages when prompts are translated to English.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The SPARROW benchmark is extensive and one of the most comprehensive for sociopragmatic understanding.
- It includes a diverse range of languages, including many low-resource ones.
- Detailed evaluations and comparisons of 14 LLMs across multiple dimensions enhance the benchmark's utility.
- The proposed interactive leaderboard is anticipated to be beneficial for the NLP community.

Weaknesses:
- The paper does not introduce original datasets or methods.
- There is a lack of theoretical grounding in the selection and categorization of tasks for sociopragmatic understanding.
- Few-shot in-context learning evaluations are missing, limiting the analysis of larger models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical grounding of "sociopragmatic understanding" by providing clearer justification for task selection and categorization. Additionally, we suggest including evaluations of few-shot in-context learning for the larger models, particularly ChatGPT, to enhance the robustness of the results. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to address potential data leakage between datasets and consider dataset quality when computing aggregate scores in the benchmark. Lastly, we advise investigating the sensitivity of the SPARROW score to prompt variations and the impact of tailored prompts on model performance.
