Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on self-supervised learning (SSL) in the context of long-tailed distributions, where traditional contrastive learning methods struggle with minority classes. The authors propose a Geometric Harmonization (GH) technique to encourage category-level uniformity, which can be integrated into existing SSL frameworks without modification. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of GH on several long-tailed datasets, including CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT. Additionally, the authors address concerns regarding "representation transferability" through further experiments, with results from pretraining on CC3M enhancing the analysis of imbalance classes under SSL setups.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an important issue in SSL related to class imbalance, providing a clear motivation for the proposed method.
- The GH method is interesting, simple to implement, and shows effectiveness across various datasets.
- The writing is generally clear, and the authors perform extensive analyses to support their claims.
- The authors effectively addressed concerns regarding representation transferability through additional experiments, and the inclusion of results from CC3M pretraining adds depth to the analysis.

Weaknesses:
- Numerous typos and grammatical errors hinder comprehension, and some mathematical definitions are inconsistent, raising doubts about theoretical claims.
- The choice of baselines is limited, with SimCLR not being a strong representative of state-of-the-art methods; comparisons with stronger frameworks like BYOL or MoCo-v3 are necessary.
- The introduction lacks clarity regarding the motivation for the study, and the significance of the problem in SSL is not well-supported.
- The paper does not adequately address the impact of hyperparameter choices on the GH method's performance.
- The initial score of 5 reflects some unresolved issues prior to the additional experiments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by thoroughly proofreading the text to eliminate typos and grammatical errors. Additionally, we suggest providing clearer mathematical definitions and ensuring consistency throughout the paper. To strengthen the contribution, the authors should include comparisons with stronger SSL baselines such as BYOL and MoCo-v3. We also advise enhancing the introduction to better articulate the motivation for the study and provide concrete examples of the issues faced by minority classes in SSL. Lastly, the authors should discuss the sensitivity of the GH method to hyperparameter choices and consider conducting transfer learning experiments to demonstrate the generalizability of their results. Furthermore, we recommend including the additional experiments in the revised version to further strengthen their findings.
