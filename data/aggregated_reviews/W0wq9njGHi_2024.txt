Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Kaleidoscope, an adaptive partial parameter sharing method for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) that enhances policy heterogeneity while maintaining high sample efficiency. The authors propose using learnable binary masks to control parameter sharing among agents and within critic ensembles. The method aims to balance the benefits of full parameter sharing with the flexibility of non-parameter sharing, demonstrating superior performance across various MARL benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and organized, making the core idea of using learnable masks clear.  
- The application of soft threshold reparameterization (STR) for dynamic partial parameter sharing is novel and well-motivated.  
- Comprehensive experiments and a detailed ablation study support the claims, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed method.  
- The manuscript effectively addresses the trade-off between sample efficiency and policy diversity, a crucial challenge in MARL.  

Weaknesses:  
- The authors do not include FuPS+ID as a baseline, which is a common parameter sharing implementation in MARL and would provide a useful comparison.  
- The motivation for using STR over methods that learn different activations per agent, such as SNP, is unclear and warrants further discussion.  
- The experimental results do not convincingly demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the baselines, as many results fall within 95% confidence intervals.  
- The paper lacks a pseudocode for the proposed method, which would aid in understanding its components.  
- Limitations are presented in the appendix rather than the main text, and the scalability of the method with a large number of agents is not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental comparisons by including FuPS+ID as a baseline to strengthen their claims. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the motivation for using STR over alternative methods like SNP, as this could provide valuable insights for future work. To enhance the clarity of the results, we advise using the Interquartile Mean (IQM) for statistical significance and including details about the evaluation procedure, such as the evaluation interval and the number of evaluation steps. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide a pseudocode for the proposed method in the main text and to elaborate on the scalability of Kaleidoscope with respect to the number of agents. Lastly, we suggest integrating the limitations into the main text for better visibility.
