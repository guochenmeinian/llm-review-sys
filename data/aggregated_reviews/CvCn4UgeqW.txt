### Key Points
This paper presents a novel task, Omni-scene driven visual Sentiment Identifying, Locating and Attributing in videos (Omni-SILA), which aims to analyze visual sentiment in videos by identifying, localizing, and attributing sentiment causes. The authors propose an Implicit-enhanced Causal Mixture of Experts (ICM) approach that integrates scene information and addresses implicit cues beyond explicit facial expressions. The framework is validated through extensive experiments on a newly constructed Omni-SILA dataset, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study introduces a well-structured technical approach combining Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture with causal interventions.
- Comprehensive experimental validation, including ablation studies and qualitative analysis, supports the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
- The research is relevant for applications in content moderation and safety, with attention to efficiency.

Weaknesses:
- Limited discussion on failure cases and the study's limitations.
- Insufficient detail on dataset construction and computational requirements.
- The Causal Intervention Graph section lacks clarity, particularly in differentiating implicit from explicit scenes.
- Some technical choices, such as expert architecture selection, need better justification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding failure cases and limitations to provide a more balanced view of the study's implications. Additionally, enhancing the details on dataset construction and computational requirements would strengthen the paper. We suggest clarifying the Causal Intervention Graph section to better explain how implicit bias is measured and addressed. Furthermore, justifying the selection of expert architectures and exploring strategies for optimizing model efficiency, such as model compression or distillation techniques, would be beneficial. Finally, incorporating qualitative examples beyond the two selected would enhance understanding of the model's capabilities.
