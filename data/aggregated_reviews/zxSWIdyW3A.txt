Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Federated Hardware-Prompt learning (FedHP) framework designed to enhance adaptability in snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) systems amidst hardware variations. The authors propose a method that learns from diverse coded aperture samples across clients, addressing privacy concerns and improving spectral reconstruction quality on a specific dataset. The results indicate improvements across all samples compared to existing federated learning approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The manuscript is well-organized, enhancing readability and clarity.  
2. It provides a detailed background on snapshot compressive imaging and federated learning, with the planned release of the Snapshot Spectral Heterogeneous Dataset (SSHD) aiding future research.  
3. The approach of using different coded apertures for clients reflects real-world scenarios, adding practical relevance.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The literature review on federated learning heterogeneity is not comprehensive, lacking recent citations.  
2. The explanation of the coded aperture distribution is insufficiently detailed.  
3. The method of partitioning data for heterogeneous scenarios is unconvincing; alternative methods should be explored.  
4. The number of clients in experiments is small, and the significance of findings is unclear due to limited data.  
5. The proposed FedHP method lacks deeper insights and does not show significant performance improvement compared to FedAvg.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by including more current and diverse references on federated learning heterogeneity. Additionally, provide a detailed explanation of the coded aperture distribution and explore various data partitioning methods to construct heterogeneous scenarios. We suggest increasing the number of clients in experiments to better demonstrate performance stability and including more real-world data to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to address the concerns regarding the artifacts in reconstructed images and the spectral accuracy of the results. Lastly, consider investigating the applicability of FedHP to other compressive imaging systems to broaden the scope of the research.
