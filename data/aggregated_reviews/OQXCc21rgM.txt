### Key Points
This paper presents a new physics-informed neural network (PINN) for extreme event prediction, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional time series forecasting models. The authors propose that their model provides valuable insights for both the PINN and weather time series communities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed model shows superior performance in weather event forecasting, outperforming traditional models.  
- The paper contributes valuable insights to the PINN and weather time series communities.  

Weaknesses:  
- The dataset used (SST, humidity) is not specifically for extreme events, and the performance metrics (MSE, MAE) do not emphasize extreme values, raising concerns about the appropriateness of the title.  
- Figure 2 is difficult to read due to small font size.  
- The reliance on the Van Der Pol model may not capture all non-linearities in climatic events, and the independence of synthetic data from the task dataset is unclear.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the title to better reflect the dataset and performance metrics. Additionally, we suggest increasing the font size in Figure 2 for better readability. The authors should clarify whether the synthetic data from the Van Der Pol generator is independent of the task dataset and consider incorporating other oscillator systems. Furthermore, we advise including recent forecasting papers in the introduction, such as those found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05833 (earthformer) and https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10422 (prediff).
