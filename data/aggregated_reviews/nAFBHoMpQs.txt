Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents MARPLE, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate AI models' long-horizon inference capabilities using multi-modal evidence in simulated "whodunit" scenarios. It details the benchmark's design, procedural generation of environments, and evaluation against human performance. Key contributions include a comprehensive benchmark for long-horizon tasks, a procedural environment generator, and benchmarking results comparing traditional Monte Carlo simulation, GPT-4, and human performance. The paper addresses a unique area in AI inference, although the experimental setup requires more rigorous validation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Innovative benchmark addressing long-horizon, multi-modal inference, filling a gap in existing evaluations.
- Comprehensive approach combining vision, language, and audio stimuli in a procedurally generated environment.
- Inclusion of human performance as a benchmark provides a valuable reference for AI model evaluation.

Weaknesses:
- The choice of baseline models and configurations lacks rigorous justification and exploration.
- Statistical analysis is insufficient, requiring more detailed testing to confirm result significance.
- The benchmark scenarios may not encompass the full spectrum of real-world complexities, necessitating broader testing.
- Limitations of evaluated models, particularly GPT-4's underperformance, are not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the complexity, realism, and diversity of simulated environments beyond the current gridworld/template-based approach. Expanding the types of inference queries beyond "whodunit" to include more general state/event reconstruction would enhance the benchmark. Developing new end-to-end learnable models specifically for long-horizon multi-modal reasoning tasks is essential. A deeper analysis of key factors and failure modes in reasoning problems through granular probing studies would be beneficial. Additionally, providing prescriptive insights on promising future research directions based on identified limitations would strengthen the paper. Addressing potential biases in procedural generation and considering privacy and consent issues in future expansions is also advised.
