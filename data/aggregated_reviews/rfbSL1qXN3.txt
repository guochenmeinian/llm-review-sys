### Key Points
This paper presents SS3DM, a synthetic dataset designed for benchmarking street-view surface reconstruction using precise 3D mesh models from the CARLA simulator. Unlike traditional datasets such as KITTI and Waymo, which provide noisy LiDAR points, SS3DM offers high-fidelity ground-truth meshes, enabling accurate evaluations of geometric and surface normal assessments. The dataset includes multi-view RGB video sequences and LiDAR points, collected through simulated driving scenarios. Key contributions include a plugin for exporting detailed 3D meshes, extensive benchmarking of current surface reconstruction methods, and the identification of challenges and future research directions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- SS3DM provides precise synthetic 3D mesh models as ground-truth geometry, facilitating accurate evaluations of reconstructed surface positions and normals.  
- The dataset includes multi-view RGB video sequences and LiDAR point clouds, capturing diverse street scenes with varied structures.  
- It offers a well-designed benchmark that evaluates multiple state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction methods across different input modalities.  
- The dataset, CARLA exportation plugin, and benchmark code are publicly available, promoting future research.  

Weaknesses:  
- The reliance on synthetic data from the CARLA simulator raises concerns about the dataset's applicability to real-world scenarios, as synthetic environments may lack the unpredictability and variability of actual street scenes.  
- The diversity of scenes is limited, lacking dynamic objects like moving vehicles and pedestrians, which are crucial for robust evaluation.  
- Details regarding data splits (train/val/test) and the rationale for not using the IoU metric for 3D reconstruction were not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset's applicability by addressing the domain gap between synthetic and real-world data. Consider evaluating models trained on SS3DM against real-world datasets like Waymo Block-NeRF or MatrixCity to understand generalization capabilities. Additionally, please provide clearer details about the data splits and the training process. We suggest including the IoU metric in evaluations, as it is a standard for 3D reconstruction tasks. Lastly, we recommend enhancing Table 3 to better represent the performance of models based on different input modalities by grouping them accordingly.
