### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to Bitcoin address clustering by incorporating both confirmed and unconfirmed transactions. The authors introduce two clustering heuristics that leverage the replace-by-fee and dependency chain mechanisms in unconfirmed transactions. They construct a labeled dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of their methods through comparative evaluations against six state-of-the-art clustering techniques, showing improvements in recall and precision.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Innovative method for clustering Bitcoin addresses that includes unconfirmed transactions.
- Comprehensive data collection framework that supports the proposed heuristics.
- Detailed evaluation comparing the proposed methods with existing state-of-the-art techniques.

Weaknesses:
- Lack of clarity regarding the design of the *Heuristics Executor* component and its rationale.
- Insufficient justification for the representativeness and reliability of the labeled dataset.
- The evaluation methodology is questionable, with limited comparison to other clustering heuristics and unclear implications of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the *Heuristics Executor* component, particularly regarding the rationale for excluding unconfirmed transactions from state-of-the-art clustering heuristics. Additionally, the authors should provide a detailed justification for the representativeness and reliability of the labeled dataset, including its size, distribution, and labeling methodology. It would also be beneficial to expand the evaluation to include a broader range of clustering heuristics and to analyze the specific contributions of the proposed methods to clustering effectiveness. Furthermore, we suggest clarifying the relationship between transaction irreversibility and the addition of six new blocks in Section 3.3, and validating the prevalence of the proposed heuristics in real-world scenarios. Lastly, addressing the low weighted accuracy and weighted recall shown in Table 2 would enhance the paper's robustness.
