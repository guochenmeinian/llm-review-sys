### Key Points
This paper presents a novel optimization problem termed Difference of Max-Structured Weakly Convex Functions (DMax), extending traditional frameworks like difference-of-weakly-convex (DWC) optimization and weakly-convex-strongly-concave (WCSC) min-max optimization. The authors propose a stochastic algorithm called SMAG, utilizing a Moreau envelope smoothing technique, which achieves a state-of-the-art non-asymptotic convergence rate of $O(\epsilon^{-4})$. The experimental validation demonstrates the efficacy of SMAG across applications such as Positive-Unlabeled Learning and partial Area Under the Curve (AUC) optimization with an adversarial fairness regularizer.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- **Originality:** The introduction of the DMax problem significantly contributes to the field by addressing a broader class of optimization problems.
- **Quality:** The theoretical foundations are rigorously established, and the SMAG algorithm is methodically developed, supported by well-defined lemmas.
- **Clarity:** The paper effectively communicates complex concepts, enhancing readability and transparency in theoretical derivations and experimental procedures.
- **Significance:** The paper advances theoretical understanding and practical applications in machine learning optimization.

Weaknesses:  
- **Problem Statement and Novelty:** The justification for how the DMax generalization represents a significant departure from existing frameworks is unclear, which is crucial for establishing its theoretical contribution.
- **Complexity Analysis:** SMAG's complexity results appear similar to Epoch-GDA, raising concerns about its broader implications for WCSC min-max optimization. A clearer explanation is needed on how SMAG surpasses existing complexities.
- **Algorithmic Technique:** The proof and technique resemble SBCD, necessitating a clearer distinction of SMAG's advantages in complexity.
- **Limited Applications:** The current applications are confined to DWC and WCSC, raising questions about the broader applicability of DMax.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the theoretical contribution by providing a more robust justification for the significance of the DMax generalization. Additionally, a clearer explanation of how SMAG's complexity results differ from existing methods is essential. We suggest that the authors explore and demonstrate the applicability of DMax beyond DWC and WCSC to enhance the perceived utility of their framework. Furthermore, addressing the identified typos and improving the overall readability will strengthen the paper.
