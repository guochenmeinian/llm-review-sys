### Key Points
This paper presents ERBench, a novel approach for constructing benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) using relational databases based on the entity-relationship (ER) model. ERBench generates complex, verifiable questions by leveraging database integrity constraints, allowing for the evaluation of LLMs on single-hop and multi-hop questions. The authors conduct experiments with five public databases, demonstrating ERBench's effectiveness in assessing LLM performance across various question types and prompting methods, while also addressing hallucination rates.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well organized and clearly written.
- ERBench introduces a significant advancement in benchmark construction by utilizing relational databases, enabling automatic verification of LLM responses.
- Comprehensive evaluations across multiple LLMs and question types validate the approach.
- The framework supports continuous evaluation and adapts to evolving LLM capabilities.

Weaknesses:
- The analysis lacks depth, particularly in identifying specific error types and the implications of different models' performances.
- The originality of the approach is questionable, as similar methods exist in the literature, such as those using knowledge graphs for benchmarking.
- The underlying data's correctness is not sufficiently detailed, raising concerns about potential inaccuracies affecting results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis by providing a breakdown of specific error types and how different models perform on similar problems. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion on the differences between ERBench and existing knowledge graph-based datasets, such as LC-Quad and HotpotQA, to clarify its novelty. More details about the data collection process and the relational schema should be documented to ensure transparency regarding data integrity. Finally, we encourage the authors to enhance the intermediate rationale verification method to assess the contextual use of keywords rather than merely their presence.
