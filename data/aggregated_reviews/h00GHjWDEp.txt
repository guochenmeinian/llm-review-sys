### Key Points
This paper presents a neurosymbolic approach that combines language models with first-order logic provers to parse natural language questions into first-order logic expressions, which are then evaluated by a logic prover. The authors evaluate their framework using the smaller StarCoder+ and GPT-3.5 on two datasets, FOLIO and ProofWriter, demonstrating significant performance improvements, particularly with StarCoder+. The analysis includes a comprehensive error analysis and qualitative comparisons of model behaviors.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed method effectively combines the semantic understanding of LLMs with the logical reasoning capabilities of FOL solvers.  
- The paper is well-written, easy to follow, and provides in-depth analyses of methods and performance.  
- The empirical results confirm the benefits of the proposed approach, particularly in reasoning scores.

Weaknesses:  
- The originality of the NL-to-FOL task is questioned, as it resembles existing autoformalization tasks in mathematical reasoning.  
- The applicability of the method to more natural language tasks remains unclear, and comparisons with more realistic datasets are lacking.  
- The paper could benefit from a more extensive discussion of related work, particularly in relation to other LLM + tool paradigms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the originality discussion by addressing the similarities with existing autoformalization tasks and including relevant references. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments on more realistic datasets to assess the method's performance in natural language contexts. It would also be beneficial to expand the related work section to include discussions on non-LLM neuro-symbolic approaches and comparisons with other tool-using frameworks like Toolformer. Lastly, please clarify the pass rate of the parsed FOL expressions and address error propagation from parsing to final answers.
