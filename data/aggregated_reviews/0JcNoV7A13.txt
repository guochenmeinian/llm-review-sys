### Key Points
This paper presents a Bayesian disease progression model that addresses healthcare disparities often overlooked in existing models. The authors focus on three specific disparities: (1) certain populations begin receiving care at more advanced disease stages, (2) some groups experience faster disease progression despite receiving care, and (3) the frequency of care is lower for certain populations, even with similar disease severity. The paper demonstrates that neglecting these disparities results in biased estimates of disease severity. The work is original in its integration of healthcare disparities into disease progression models and holds significant potential for real-world impact, particularly through collaboration with hospitals for validation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The model innovatively captures critical and underexplored healthcare disparities.  
- The rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical validation using synthetic data enhance the quality of the work.  
- Clear motivation and presentation of the problem and solution contribute to the paper's clarity.  
- Collaboration with New York-Presbyterian Hospital for a heart failure case study indicates future practical relevance.  

Weaknesses:  
- The proof of identifiability (Theorem 4.1) is incomplete, raising concerns about the soundness of the claim that the model is identifiable.  
- The case study results are not fully explored, limiting the immediate impact of the work.  
- The paper exceeds the page limit, which could hinder resubmission to other venues.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the proof of identifiability to ensure it is complete and adequately supports the claim of model identifiability. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed explanation and comparison with existing models to enhance clarity regarding the contributions of the model. Finally, we encourage the authors to adhere to the page limit if they consider resubmission to other venues.
