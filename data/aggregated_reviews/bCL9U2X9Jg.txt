### Key Points
This paper presents a framework to adapt CLIP-based vision-language models (VLMs) for the fashion domain, addressing the challenge of insufficient learning of entity-related details through direct finetuning. The authors propose a region-based contrastive loss using selection tokens to capture information on tag entities such as brand and composition. Additionally, they introduce a new dataset, AmazonFashion, which offers briefer text descriptions compared to the FashionGen benchmark. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements across various benchmarks, validating its effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The contributions to the fashion domain are significant, particularly through the introduction of selection tokens and region contrastive loss, which enhance fine-grained visual representations.  
- The new AmazonFashion dataset serves as a valuable benchmark for future research.  
- The paper is well-organized and clearly presents its key contributions.  
- Experiments validate the method's effectiveness across multiple tasks and base models, showcasing its generalization.

Weaknesses:  
- The method is primarily evaluated within the fashion domain, limiting its applicability to other fine-grained recognition or captioning tasks.  
- Efficiency evaluations regarding training and inference speed of the newly added components are missing.  
- The presentation could be improved for clarity, particularly for a general ML audience, and figures are often too small to read.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation, particularly in the introduction and abstract, to better highlight the core novelty of using fusion blocks with selection tokens. Additionally, we suggest including efficiency evaluations to clarify the impact of added components on training and inference speed. Expanding the evaluation to include visual question answering tasks would strengthen the paper's impact. Finally, addressing the interpretability of selection tokens and considering additional datasets for evaluation could enhance the robustness of the findings.
