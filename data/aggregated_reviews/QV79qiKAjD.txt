### Key Points
This paper studies the benefits of learning to route in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, presenting key contributions that include empirical studies demonstrating significant advantages of intelligent routing over random or fixed methods, and a theoretical analysis proving that simple MoE architectures can effectively route inputs from mixtures of Gaussians. The authors identify that the benefits of MoE models stem from increased parameters due to sparsity and the router's learned function, providing insights into the types of cluster structures that are easily identified. The paper also compares MoE models with dense models, noting that while MoE models outperform smaller dense models, the performance gap narrows with larger dense models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence on the advantages of learning to route in MoE models, contributing to a better understanding of their capabilities.
- It introduces carefully constructed synthetic tasks that effectively demonstrate the effects of learned routing.
- Experiments on real NLP data validate the relevance of insights from synthetic tasks, showing significant improvements with learned routing.

Weaknesses:
- The majority of experiments are conducted on synthetic data, lacking conclusive results on complex real-world datasets.
- The theoretical results are limited to simple cases and may not extend to more complex data distributions.
- The paper does not benchmark against the latest state-of-the-art models in sparse expert architectures.
- Clarity in writing and presentation needs improvement, particularly in describing theoretical results and problem setup.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical analysis by including results on complex real-world datasets to strengthen their claims. Additionally, the authors should benchmark their findings against the latest state-of-the-art models to contextualize their contributions. Clarifying the problem setup and enhancing the writing style will help make the paper more accessible to readers unfamiliar with the topic. Finally, addressing the implications of their results could provide valuable insights for future architecture designs.
