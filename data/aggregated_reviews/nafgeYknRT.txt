Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a diffusion-based approach to compressing a policy archive generated by a Quality-Diversity Reinforcement Learning (QD RL) algorithm. The authors propose using a conditional diffusion model operating in the latent space of a variational auto-encoder (VAE) to achieve significant compression while maintaining reasonable reconstruction quality. The evaluation is conducted across four Brax environments, demonstrating the model's ability to generate policies that yield similar rewards to the original archive.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is clearly written, with a well-structured description of the approach.
- Promising results indicate high compression levels and good reconstruction across some Brax environments.
- Strong visualizations illustrate behavior during training and various synthesized behaviors.
- The proposed method increases the practicality of QD approaches for skill discovery in reinforcement learning.

Weaknesses:
- The approach is limited to compressing the original archive, with sequential behavior composition experiments only replicating original capabilities. There is a need to explore generalization to novel measure vectors or language instructions.
- The assumption of small 2-layer, 128-width MLPs raises questions about scalability to larger networks.
- A notable loss in diversity, particularly in the ant environment, is observed.
- The metrics used for evaluation, such as the Mean-Error in Measure (MEM) and QD score, lack clarity and context for interpretation.
- The design of the network encoder, particularly the use of convolutional filters on MLP weights, appears questionable.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the abstract by specifying the environments where compression ratios and coverage are observed. Additionally, including a background section on Quality Diversity would enhance accessibility for readers unfamiliar with the topic. The authors should also consider providing baseline comparisons to other distillation methods, as well as clarifying the metrics used for evaluation to facilitate interpretation. It would be beneficial to explore the model's generalization capabilities further, particularly regarding the influence of text conditioning and the potential for generating policies under novel conditions. Lastly, addressing the high loss in diversity on the ant environment through increased network capacity or improved VAE representation could strengthen the findings.
