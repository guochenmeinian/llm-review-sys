Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Cross-Episodic Curriculum (CEC) aimed at enhancing the learning efficiency and generalization of Transformer agents by structuring cross-episodic experiences. The authors propose three curriculum implementations: Learning-progress-based curriculum, Task-difficulty-based curriculum, and Expertise-based curriculum. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance and generalization in both discrete control tasks (DeepMind Lab) and continuous control tasks (RoboMimic).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The concept of Cross-Episodic Curriculum is simple yet effective.
2. The authors provide three distinct curriculum implementations suitable for various settings (RL or IL).
3. The paper is well-written, making the methods and experiments easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
1. The comparison is limited to a weak baseline (Transformer-based BC agent), lacking comparisons with more recent methods like Algorithm Distillation and TIT, or a discussion on their suitability.
2. Important experimental details, such as the implementation of "without cross-episodic attention" and "Curriculum granularity," are relegated to the Appendix, which may hinder understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the baseline comparisons by including more recent methods like Algorithm Distillation and TIT, or provide a rationale for their exclusion. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the implementation details of the ablation study in the main text rather than the Appendix. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to discuss the suitability of each curriculum for different environmental settings more comprehensively. Lastly, the authors should address the limitations of their method and the potential negative societal impacts in the manuscript.
