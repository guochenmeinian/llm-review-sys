### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative approach termed "Bidirectional Constraints of Beta Rules" (BCBR) for Document-level Relationship Extraction (DocRE). BCBR incorporates both forward and reverse logic constraints, enhancing rule consistency and regulating the output of the DocRE model. The authors conduct extensive experiments on datasets such as DWIE, DocRED, and re-DocRED, demonstrating that BCBR significantly improves existing models like ATLOP, DREEAM, LogiRE, and MILR, achieving superior performance and logical consistency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of BCBR addresses limitations in existing logic constraint approaches, providing a unique contribution to DocRE.
- The experimental results robustly support the claims, showing BCBR's effectiveness in enhancing performance and logical consistency.

Weaknesses:
- A more detailed explanation of the bidirectional logic constraints is necessary for clarity.
- The marginal improvements over LogiRE and MILR raise questions about the overall contribution, particularly given the similarities in techniques.
- The ablation studies indicate that removing the beta rule mining (BR) does not significantly affect performance, which is unexpected.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the bidirectional logic constraints by providing a more detailed explanation. Additionally, including a comprehensive case study or statistical analysis of the extracted rules would enrich the content. We also suggest adding more baselines, particularly on datasets like Re-DocRED and DocRED, to enhance the evaluation of the proposed approach. Finally, addressing the parameter settings and ensuring they are well-specified could aid in reproducibility.
