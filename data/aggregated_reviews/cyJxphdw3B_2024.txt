Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the continuous discretization of neural operators within the framework of category theory. The authors prove that a continuous approximation scheme for all diffeomorphisms does not exist, while demonstrating that neural operators with strongly monotone layers can be continuously discretized. They also establish that bilipschitz neural operators can be approximated by deep networks with strongly monotone layers, and discuss further implications of their findings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses the critical issue of discretizing continuous operators, which is significant in operator learning.
2. It provides a comprehensive analysis, including both positive and negative results, with various theorems.
3. The theoretical results are presented in a relatively clear manner, making them accessible to readers unfamiliar with category theory.

Weaknesses:
1. Most results are theoretical and lack quantitative or asymptotic estimates, such as the convergence rate in Definition 8 and the number of layers \(J\) in Theorem 4.
2. The absence of empirical results limits the practical applicability of the theory; toy experiments demonstrating the concepts would enhance understanding.
3. The presentation requires significant improvement, with numerous typos and poorly formulated sentences noted.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and organization of the text to enhance readability. Additionally, including practical examples, such as solving the Poisson equation \(\Delta u = f\) using methods like DeepONet and FNO, would make the paper more accessible to a broader audience. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors provide quantitative estimates for their theoretical results and clarify the assumptions regarding the Hilbert spaces studied. Lastly, refining the use of category theory in the context of their proofs could strengthen the overall contribution of the paper.
