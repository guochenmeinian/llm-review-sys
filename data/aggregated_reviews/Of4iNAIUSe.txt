Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a multi-teacher knowledge distillation framework, FedMKD, aimed at enhancing global representation models in resource-adaptive federated self-supervised learning. The authors propose a solution to the challenges of heterogeneous architectures and extreme class skew, demonstrating significant improvements in representation abilities across diverse clients. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of FedMKD, which outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a critical issue in federated self-supervised learning, providing a unique solution through FedMKD.
2. The framework effectively integrates knowledge from heterogeneous clients using multi-teacher knowledge distillation, even under extreme class skew.
3. The adaptive knowledge integration mechanism significantly enhances representation capabilities.
4. The experimental section is thorough, showcasing the method's efficacy across multiple datasets.
5. The combination of self-supervised loss and distillation loss, along with the global knowledge anchored alignment module, improves representation abilities.

Weaknesses:
1. The Related Work section lacks a comprehensive discussion of existing approaches in transfer learning and attention mechanisms.
2. The mechanism design is somewhat confusing, particularly regarding the roles of multi-instructor knowledge distillation and global knowledge anchored alignment.
3. The paper may have a limited audience due to its specialized focus on image classification tasks and could benefit from more context for readers unfamiliar with the datasets and techniques.
4. The contributions could be more explicitly stated in the Introduction for clarity.
5. A complexity analysis of the FedMKD algorithm would provide insights into its computational efficiency; if not feasible, a rationale for its omission should be provided.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the Related Work section by including a more thorough discussion of existing approaches in transfer learning and attention mechanisms. Additionally, clarifying the mechanism design to avoid confusion regarding knowledge transfer between global and local models is essential. To broaden the paper's appeal, providing more context for readers unfamiliar with the specific datasets and techniques discussed would be beneficial. We also suggest explicitly stating the contributions in the Introduction to enhance clarity. Finally, including a complexity analysis of the FedMKD algorithm or justifying its omission would strengthen the paper.
