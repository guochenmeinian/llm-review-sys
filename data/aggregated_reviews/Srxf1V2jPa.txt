Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an ensemble dataset and benchmark that measures the robustness of Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) systems against contextual changes surrounding grammatical errors. The authors utilize two pre-published GEC datasets and create a third dataset from responses to a L2 English exam in China, annotated by humans. They report results on five pre-published GEC systems and propose a KL-divergence-based method to improve the top-performing system's robustness. The study highlights that context perturbations can mislead correction behaviors, indicating a potential reliance on spurious correlations rather than learned grammatical patterns.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized, thorough, and presents a novel approach to GEC robustness, particularly through the exploration of context perturbations.
- The methodology includes a detailed dataset creation process with strict quality control, contributing valuable resources for the GEC community.
- The proposed method effectively enhances model robustness, even for the most robust baseline (GECToR).

Weaknesses:
- Ethical concerns arise regarding the sources of the TEM-8 dataset, particularly regarding copyright and privacy issues related to test takers.
- Some arguments lack clarity, such as the potential use of LLMs for GEC systems without sufficient evidence.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their arguments, particularly regarding the use of LLMs in GEC systems, by providing concrete evidence or references. Additionally, we urge the authors to address ethical concerns by providing transparent information about the sources of the TEM-8 data and how they handled privacy issues for test takers. Furthermore, in section 3.1, we suggest elaborating on the data sampling process from TEM-8, including whether it was random or stratified. Lastly, we recommend specifying the metric used for inter-annotator agreement in section 3.2.
