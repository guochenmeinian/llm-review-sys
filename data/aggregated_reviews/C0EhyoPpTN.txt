### Key Points
This paper presents a method for fitting stochastic low-rank RNNs to neural recordings using variational sequential Monte Carlo methods. The authors demonstrate the technique's ability to model noisy sequences, identify low-dimensional latent dynamical systems, and generate neural trajectories with realistic variability. The method is validated on synthetic systems and applied to EEG, hippocampal, and motor cortical data. Additionally, the authors introduce an efficient fixed point finding procedure for low-rank RNNs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Originality: The combination of low-rank RNNs, variational inference, and sequential Monte Carlo is innovative.
- Quality: Thoughtful comparisons to existing methods, with improvements over state-of-the-art techniques in certain contexts.
- Clarity: Figures and tables are well-presented, and the writing is generally clear.

Weaknesses:
- Section 2.2 lacks accessibility for non-experts in variational inference and sequential Monte Carlo methods.
- The implementation details of the technique are not clearly articulated.
- The approach does not outperform state-of-the-art techniques in the Neural Latents Benchmark, raising questions about its comparative efficacy.
- The model's formulation in low-dimensional space may lose generality, particularly with non-stationary inputs.
- Limited performance in recovering latent structures and predicting dynamics, with specific figures indicating discrepancies between generated and ground truth data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve Section 2.2 to enhance accessibility for a broader audience. Additionally, the authors should provide explicit implementation details for their technique. It would be beneficial to benchmark the variational SMC method against simpler baselines, such as SMC methods with simpler proposals. Clarifying how the model relates to the neuralODE literature and discussing the limitations of handling transient dynamics outside the column space of the weight matrix factors would strengthen the paper. Finally, addressing the performance discrepancies noted in the figures and conducting ablation studies on stochasticity and low-rank constraints would provide further insights into the model's capabilities.
