### Key Points
This paper presents VISTA, a novel latent space visualization technique that creates a mosaic of summarizing clusters of input labels in a lower-dimensional representation. The authors apply this method to analyze the latent codes of sparse autoencoders, demonstrating its effectiveness in revealing deeper meanings and associations often overlooked by traditional automated techniques. VISTA aggregates labels of local neighborhoods smoothly, enhancing the understanding of clusters with multiple semantic meanings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. VISTA significantly improves upon standard latent space visualization techniques by aggregating labels of local neighborhoods smoothly, which enhances the understanding of complex, multi-semantic clusters.
2. The method respects the uncertainty of latent space areas with no features by masking those regions, preserving the topological properties of the latent manifolds learned by UMAP.

Weaknesses:
1. The "cartographic rendering" step may face challenges based on window size, where a large window could over-generalize dense clusters and a small window could incur excessive computational costs. A thorough analysis of the tiling approach is needed to optimize detail and efficiency.
2. The reliance on generative models like MultiDiffusion introduces potential issues such as hallucinations or non-informative conditioning, which could impact data analysis capabilities and should be addressed more explicitly.
3. The paper lacks a comprehensive discussion on VISTA's performance with other modalities, such as images or audio, limiting its perceived versatility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the "cartographic rendering" process, detailing how to balance window size for optimal efficiency and semantic diversity. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide more information on the "custom metric" used for UMAP, including its development and advantages over standard metrics. It would also be beneficial to conduct experiments on the optimal window size and analyze its impact on computational efficiency and semantic preservation. Furthermore, a more thorough discussion of the limitations, including potential biases and computational resource requirements, would strengthen the paper. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the main insights VISTA provides regarding interpretability and how it aligns with semantic meaning, particularly in cases involving abstract concepts.
