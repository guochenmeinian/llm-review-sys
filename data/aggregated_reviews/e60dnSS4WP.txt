Aggregated Review:
**Key Points**  
We recognize that this paper introduces diffusion-based methods to amodal instance segmentation (AIS) for the first time, proposing Diffusion Shape Prior Estimation (DiffSP) to enhance mask prediction by leveraging shape knowledge. The method demonstrates effectiveness across various detectors and datasets, addressing the challenge of recovering whole objects from occluded parts in images.

**Strengths and Weaknesses**  
Strengths include the novelty of applying diffusion models to AIS, clear motivation due to the extensive pre-training on object-level data, and well-structured writing that facilitates understanding. The method shows consistent performance improvements across multiple benchmarks, including KINS, COCOA-cls, and D2SA. However, weaknesses are evident in the lack of computational cost analysis and outdated baseline comparisons, as previous works utilizing diffusion priors for AIS are not addressed. Additionally, while the method improves performance, the gains are marginal compared to existing methods that do not rely on shape priors.

**Suggestions for Improvement**  
We suggest including a detailed analysis of computational costs and runtime. It would also be beneficial to compare the proposed method with more recent works that utilize diffusion priors for AIS, such as those by Ozguroglu et al., Zhan et al., and Xu et al. Furthermore, discussing the relationship between humans and segmentation in urban scenes could enhance the paper's relevance to the workshop's theme.
