### Key Points
This paper presents a two-step approach for generating radiology reports that align with a physician's style, utilizing RadGraph for content extraction and large language models (LLMs) for verbalization. The authors claim that their method effectively tailors AI-generated reports to individual radiologist styles, supported by positive quantitative evaluations. However, the study lacks a compelling argument for the clinical importance of style in report generation and does not provide sufficient evidence to substantiate its claims regarding the risks of existing methods conflating content and style.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed approach is straightforward and effectively separates content and style in report generation.
- The use of RadGraph is well-motivated, and the method shows promise in generating reports that are indistinguishable from those written by humans.

Weaknesses:
- The paper does not convincingly explain why style should be prioritized in clinical report generation, undermining its clinical significance.
- Experimental results lack comparisons with other studies, making it difficult to assess the proposed method's advantages.
- There are insufficient details regarding model architecture, input-output specifications, and the evaluation process, leading to concerns about the validity of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and depth of their argument regarding the clinical importance of matching a physician's style in report generation. Additionally, the authors should provide examples or evidence to support claims about the risks of existing methods. More detailed explanations of the serialization process, including how to serialize the RadGraph and define the order of entities, are necessary. The authors should clarify the input and output of the Image to Serialization task and provide a comprehensive comparison with other existing image-to-report methods. Furthermore, we suggest including more information about the clinicians involved in the human evaluation and exploring the quality of the generated reports beyond mere identification of AI-generated content.
