Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an efficient algorithm for PAC learning $\gamma$-margin halfspaces under $\eta$-Massart noise, achieving an error of $\eta + \epsilon$ with a sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(1/(\epsilon^2 \gamma^2))$. The algorithm is based on an iterative stochastic-gradient descent approach, which defines a new loss function at each iteration. The authors claim that their algorithm is near-optimal in terms of sample complexity, addressing a significant gap in the literature regarding computational sample complexity for this problem.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a fundamental problem in PAC learning and provides a near-optimal algorithm for learning $\gamma$-margin halfspaces under Massart noise.
2. The writing is clear, and the main techniques are well-explained, making the paper accessible.

Weaknesses:
1. Some results may be weaker than presented, with vague phrasings that could benefit from clarification (e.g., "there is evidence that...").
2. The natural agnostic extension of the problem is not discussed, which could limit the applicability of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their results by providing more precise statements regarding the computational sample complexity, particularly addressing the claim that "...we essentially settle this question..." in line 71. Additionally, we suggest discussing the agnostic case to enhance the paper's relevance. It would also be beneficial to define what $\eta$ represents in the abstract for better reader comprehension. Lastly, consider clarifying the expression regarding the independence of the reweighting term in the context of the algorithm to avoid potential confusion.
