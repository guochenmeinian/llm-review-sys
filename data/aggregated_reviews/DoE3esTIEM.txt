Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel conditional permutation importance (CPI) approach that effectively estimates variable importance while accounting for feature correlations. The authors theoretically justify the inflation of feature permutation methods and demonstrate that CPI provides calibrated results across various settings, outperforming existing methods. The work addresses critical issues in interpretable machine learning, particularly statistical calibration and scalability, and shows significant improvements in controlling type-I errors compared to naive permutation methods. Additionally, the authors propose a systematic, model-agnostic approach for studying CPI, highlighting its advantages in biomedical applications. They introduce a novel implementation of CPI that combines deep neural networks and Random Forest models, conduct extensive benchmarks on various data types, and provide a reusable library for simulation experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper offers a rigorous theoretical foundation for CPI and demonstrates its effectiveness in empirical evaluations, particularly in controlling type-I errors and improving statistical calibration.  
- The clarity of writing and organization facilitates understanding, and the experimental results convincingly support the claims made.  
- The authors effectively clarify their contributions and the context of their work, particularly in biomedical applications.  
- The inclusion of relevant literature enhances the depth of the discussion on the limitations of permutation approaches.  
- The implementation of CPI as a software tool is a notable contribution, making it accessible for practical applications.

Weaknesses:  
- The evidence provided for the calibration of CPI is insufficient, with specific suggestions for improvement, including the need for qqplots with a sufficient number of tests and further justification for the choice of Random Forest in approximating conditional distributions.  
- The paper lacks a comprehensive discussion of limitations, particularly regarding computational complexity, sensitivity to data structure, and the assumptions underlying the theoretical framework.  
- The contributions are presented in a way that may mislead readers into thinking CPI is a novel concept, without adequately acknowledging existing literature on conditional permutation importance.  
- The initial manuscript lacked clarity regarding the specific application context, which may have led to misunderstandings.  
- Some references to prior work were not adequately highlighted, potentially obscuring important discussions on the limitations of non-conditional permutation methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the soundness of the paper by providing qqplots with at least 100 tests to demonstrate calibration. Additionally, further justification is needed for the use of Random Forest to approximate feature distributions, including comparisons with simpler models. Increasing the sample size in simulations to at least 10K is suggested to ensure robust power detection. We also encourage the authors to expand the discussion on the limitations of their method, particularly regarding computational complexity and the implications of their theoretical assumptions. Furthermore, we recommend improving the clarity of the application context in the abstract and introduction to ensure that readers immediately grasp the focus on biomedical applications. Finally, consider further emphasizing the significance of the cited works by Nicodemus et al. (2010) and others that discuss the drawbacks of non-conditional permutation methods to strengthen the literature review and clarify the novelty of their contributions in relation to existing literature.
