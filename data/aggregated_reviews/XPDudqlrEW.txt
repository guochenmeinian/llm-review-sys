### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative approach to protein function prediction by integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) within a multimodal framework. The authors propose a method that combines diverse data types, including protein sequence, structure, and textual annotations, to enhance the prediction of protein functions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The methodology is novel, effectively combining GNNs and LLMs to create a comprehensive representation of protein functions.  
- The empirical evaluation is thorough, providing evidence of the model's effectiveness using a real-world dataset, which reinforces the practical utility of Prot2Text.  

Weaknesses:  
- The definition of LLMs is ambiguous, with GPT2 not generally recognized as an LLM.  
- The choice of element-wise addition for multimodal fusion lacks justification and references in the literature.  
- The rationale for using free text to describe protein functions needs clarification regarding its practical advantages over concise categorical classifications.  
- The use of BLEU score as an evaluation metric raises concerns about its appropriateness, and the paper does not compare the proposed method with conventional multi-class accuracy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for using element-wise addition in multimodal fusion by providing relevant references or literature support. Additionally, the authors should clarify the practical advantages of using free text descriptions for protein functions compared to categorical classifications, particularly for biology experts. We also suggest evaluating the model using embeddings to capture semantic relationships more effectively and including a comparison with conventional multi-class accuracy to highlight the benefits of the proposed approach.
