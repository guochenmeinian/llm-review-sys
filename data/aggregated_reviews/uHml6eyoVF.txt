Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the likelihood ratio (LR) for distinguishing between two distributions, specifically a "spiked" model and a Gaussian one, utilizing higher-order cumulants. The authors demonstrate that the minimum sample size required for distinguishing these distributions is linear in an ideal scenario, while it becomes quadratic in practical computational settings. They also show that neural networks outperform random feature models in this classification task due to a mismatch in approximation power. Additionally, the paper explores the efficiency of neural networks in extracting features from higher-order cumulants and provides bounds on sample complexity necessary for statistical distinguishability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The results are interesting, and theorems are well articulated, providing significant original statistical insights.
- The paper builds on existing literature and offers a thorough theoretical foundation, demonstrating the efficiency of neural networks compared to random features.
- The pedagogical structure of the appendices is appreciated, and the relevant literature is adequately covered.

Weaknesses:
- The proofs are derived from relatively elementary techniques, raising questions about the theoretical contribution's importance.
- The experimental section is underdeveloped, particularly regarding neural networks, and the necessity of random feature simulations is questionable.
- Some assumptions, such as the Rademacher prior for the special direction, may limit the generalizability of results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the expressions for the two LR norms, as they are currently too complicated for insight. Additionally, a detailed discussion on the assumption of a Rademacher prior would enhance the generalizability of the findings. The authors should also consider expanding the experimental section to include a broader range of parameters and clarify the purpose of the replica analysis. Furthermore, addressing the arbitrary choices in hyper-parameters and ensuring consistent notation would strengthen the paper.
