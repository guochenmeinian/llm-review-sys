Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
We recognize that the paper presents a data-driven pipeline for modeling and simulating traffic at urban intersections, utilizing real-world tracking data for training trajectory models. The methodology includes a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for generating coarse trajectories, which are refined using an LSTM. The authors propose future work that includes collision avoidance and traffic light control.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- We commend the authors for their extensive preparation of real-world data, including five years for object detection and tracking, and 30 days for trajectory forecasting.
- The integration of GMM and LSTM is sensible, allowing for diverse trajectory generation and effective modeling of nonlinear interactions.
- The paper is well-organized, with clear visualizations that enhance understanding of the methodology and results.

Weaknesses:
- We note that the diversity of testing scenarios is limited, as only one intersection is showcased, which may not capture varying traffic patterns.
- The discussion lacks consideration of the role of humans in traffic dynamics, raising questions about their impact on the simulation.
- There are concerns regarding model complexity and computational costs, which may restrict accessibility for users with limited resources.
- The potential for overfitting exists due to the detailed customization of models to specific datasets, necessitating more robust validation with diverse external datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We suggest enhancing the diversity of testing scenarios to include multiple intersections and varying traffic conditions. Additionally, we recommend incorporating a discussion on the role of humans in traffic dynamics to align better with the workshop's focus. To improve clarity, we advise providing more detailed explanations in certain sections, such as the meaning of `Wpts` in Table 1. Lastly, we encourage the authors to expand the literature review to include relevant works, such as Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) methods for trajectory forecasting.
