Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents new lower bounds for the uniform stability of UD-based and IFT-based algorithms in hyperparameter optimization. The authors derive these bounds by introducing the lower-bounded expansion property of the update rule for hyperparameters, demonstrating the tightness of existing stability bounds for UD-based algorithms. The paper also provides a uniform lower-bound for validation argument stability, indicating that existing upper bounds are tight.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
2. The uniform stability lower bounds are novel and contribute valuable insights into the stability of gradient-based methods for bilevel optimization.
3. The introduction of the lower-bounded expansion property is a novel approach to proving lower stability bounds.

Weaknesses:
1. The technique employed appears straightforward, with the lower bound demonstrating that gradient algorithms may be costly for non-convex quadratic loss functions, which is not particularly surprising.
2. The lower bound does not necessarily imply a generalization lower bound, which may weaken the significance of the results.
3. The analysis does not clarify whether the most efficient gradient-based algorithms using warm-starting strategies are covered.
4. The dependence of the generalization bound on the training dataset size is unclear, potentially leading to unreasonable interpretations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the applicability of their analysis to warm-starting strategies in gradient-based algorithms. Additionally, we suggest addressing how the generalization bound depends on the training dataset size to prevent misleading interpretations. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore whether the bounds presented in theorems 5.6 and 5.7 are tight and to clarify the implications of the scaling steps needed to reveal an explicit order with respect to \( T \).
