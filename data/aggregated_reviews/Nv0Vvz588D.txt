Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Streaming Bayes GFlowNets (SB-GFlowNets), a method for performing approximate Bayesian inference over discrete parameter spaces in streaming data contexts. The authors propose two training methods: a streaming balance condition and a KL divergence-based approach, enabling continuous updates of posterior distributions as new data arrives. The theoretical performance of these methods is analyzed, and experiments demonstrate their effectiveness in various applications, including linear preference learning and phylogenetic inference.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The methods are technically novel, providing elegant solutions for streaming inference that significantly reduce training time compared to full retraining.
- The paper includes a comprehensive theoretical analysis and strong experimental results, showcasing the benefits of SB-GFlowNets over traditional GFlowNet training.

Weaknesses:
- The extension to streaming inference is somewhat straightforward, as the use of prior distributions from previous steps is an expected adaptation.
- Some definitions and equations, particularly Definition 2 and the derivation of equation (9), lack clarity, which may confuse readers regarding their validity and implications.
- There is insufficient discussion on how the model addresses permutation invariance and the independence of new data from past data, which could impact performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Definition 2 and provide a more detailed explanation of the equivalence and the role of KL divergence. Additionally, we suggest including ablation studies to demonstrate how the model maintains permutation invariance across different data splits. To strengthen the paper, consider adding an experiment on discovering causal graphs conditioned on observational samples. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to visualize the set generation task for better comprehension. Lastly, addressing the significance of streaming inference compared to batch inference for a broader audience could enhance the paper's impact.
