Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method to estimate the conditional distribution of treatment effects (CDTE) using Makarov bounds for partial identification. The authors argue that this approach quantifies the aleatoric uncertainty of treatment effects, demonstrating properties of Neyman-orthogonality and double robustness. Additionally, the authors categorize causal quantities into three streams: the AU of potential outcomes, distributional treatment effects, and the AU of the treatment effect. They clarify that distributional treatment effects focus on differences in potential outcomes, while the distribution of treatment effects pertains to individual treatment responses, emphasizing the importance of these distinctions in medical contexts. The proposed method is theoretically grounded and validated through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, although the authors acknowledge that the initial categorization of causal quantities was not clearly articulated and plan to revise it by adding a formal categorization in a table.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses an important problem in treatment effect estimation and proposes a theoretically sound method with useful properties.  
- The explanations of aleatoric versus empirical uncertainty are clear, and the numerous diagrams enhance understanding.  
- The authors provide a clear rationale for their categorization of causal quantities, highlighting the differences in interpretation and inference between distributional treatment effects and the distribution of treatment effects.  
- The experimental validation of the proposed method is solid and concise, and the authors express a willingness to revise the manuscript based on reviewer feedback, demonstrating responsiveness to concerns.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper is poorly written overall, with weak motivation and insufficient background information, particularly in the Introduction.  
- Key terms and concepts, such as CDTE and the role of $Y[a]$, are not adequately defined, making it challenging for readers to grasp the content.  
- The contribution is not clearly articulated, with misleading statements regarding the AU-learner's capabilities and insufficient focus on the real contribution of the doubly robust estimator.  
- The initial categorization of causal quantities was not sufficiently justified or clearly presented, leading to confusion regarding its relevance and application.  
- The authors acknowledge that the categorization lacks universality and finality, which may undermine its robustness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation in the Introduction by clearly stating why the proposed estimator is necessary, especially in relation to existing methods like quantile estimators. Additionally, the authors should provide clearer definitions and context for key terms and concepts, particularly CDTE and $Y[a]$, to enhance reader comprehension. 

We suggest revising the description of contributions to accurately reflect the role of the AU-learner and its relationship to challenges in treatment effect estimation. Furthermore, the authors should focus more on the practical implications of their doubly robust estimator, including detailed error analysis and examples that illustrate its advantages over existing methods. 

We encourage the authors to enhance the rationale for their categorization in the Related Work section to address potential concerns about its applicability and comprehensiveness. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their categorization by explicitly defining each term and its relevance in the context of their work, and incorporate a formal table to present the categorization clearly. Finally, we urge the authors to reconsider the narrative structure of the paper, emphasizing conceptual ideas in the main text while relegating technical details to supplementary materials to improve readability.
