### Key Points
This paper presents a novel and unifying framework for causal representation learning (CRL) based on the invariance principle. The authors argue that existing CRL methods, which often depend on specific causal assumptions for identifiability, can instead be unified by focusing on known data symmetries. The framework includes formal definitions and theorems, particularly regarding latent variable identifiability, and demonstrates practical applications, such as treatment effect estimation using ecological data. The paper emphasizes a shift from strict causal assumptions to preserving data symmetries, which could significantly influence future research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper provides valuable insights that unify the theoretical foundations of several CRL approaches, supported by extensive analyses.
2. Despite being notation-heavy, the manuscript is generally easy to follow, with a helpful high-level overview in section 3.
3. Theorem 3.1 presents a strong result regarding the identification of invariant components of latent variables under certain constraints.

Weaknesses:
1. The feasibility of searching for encoders and selectors to satisfy constraints, as suggested in definitions 3.2 - 3.4, is unclear, and the experimental information lacks detail on this aspect.
2. The experimentation with the ISTAnt dataset is seen as a simplification, raising concerns about its robustness, particularly due to high sensitivity to $\lambda$ and the use of a basic invariance method (V-REx).
3. The framework lacks a discussion on recovering causal structures, which is a primary goal of CRL, leaving unclear whether it preserves the ability to identify causal relationships among latent variables.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the feasibility of searching for encoders and selectors, providing more examples to demonstrate tractability. Additionally, we suggest expanding the experimental section to include more diverse datasets to test the framework's robustness across various domains. It would also be beneficial to address the sensitivity of results to $\lambda$ and to incorporate a discussion on the recovery of causal structures, potentially including an analysis of causal graph recovery in Section 4.
