Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a critical examination of the challenges posed by partial observability in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), specifically identifying two failure modes: deceptive inflation and overjustification. The authors formalize these concepts and analyze the implications of human feedback under conditions of limited observability, introducing a belief matrix to model human perceptions. They also define ambiguity as a linear subspace that complicates the recovery of the true return function from feedback.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research question is significant and addresses a practical issue in the RLHF pipeline, emphasizing the importance of human annotators' limited information.
- The theoretical framework is well-structured, providing clear definitions and rigorous proofs regarding the identified failure modes.
- The paper includes informative figures and examples that enhance understanding.

Weaknesses:
- The absence of experimental results and metrics undermines the practical applicability of the theoretical findings.
- Some logical inconsistencies in the writing detract from clarity, particularly in connecting proven propositions to the proposed questions.
- The formulation of the belief matrix is considered overly strong, limiting the generalizability of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by incorporating empirical evidence to validate the theoretical claims, as this would significantly strengthen the work. Additionally, we suggest discussing potential experimental designs to explore the impact of partial observability in practice. Furthermore, the authors should consider revising the formulation of the belief matrix to enhance its applicability to more complex environments. Finally, including a discussion of related work in RLHF that addresses partial observability would provide a more comprehensive context for the research.
