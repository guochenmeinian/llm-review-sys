Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents two history encoders for reinforcement learning (RL) in partially observable control tasks, inspired by PID control principles. The authors propose a generalized PID encoder that enhances feature representation through summation and difference of observations over time, analogous to PID's integral and derivative components. Experimental results demonstrate that these encoders outperform GRU and transformers in various tracking and locomotion tasks, suggesting the effectiveness of the PID-inspired inductive bias. Additionally, the paper explores partial observability in robotic applications, particularly focusing on tokamak control using RL. The authors propose that GPIDE without attention may be faster than policies utilizing GRU or LSTM, although they cannot currently quantify the speed difference. They emphasize the importance of grounding research in practical applications and highlight various forms of partial observability, including unknown system parameters and unmeasured signals.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of conventional control techniques with RL offers a novel perspective, particularly the application of PID architecture in history encoders.
- The experimental validation shows that generalized PID encoders provide significant advantages in locomotion tasks, indicating potential for broader applicability in the RL community.
- The justification for tokamak control is compelling and relevant, reflecting current interests in the field.
- The authors recognize the significance of real-world applications and the various types of partial observability that warrant investigation.
- The paper is well-structured and clearly articulates the methodology and results, making it accessible even to readers less familiar with the subject.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation primarily focuses on low-dimensional tracking problems, lacking exploration of more complex environments with inherent partial observability.
- The authors' assumptions regarding MIMO systems and the use of separate PID controllers require clarification and acknowledgment of alternative synthesis methods.
- There is insufficient discussion on the computational costs associated with the proposed architecture, particularly in terms of inference time and efficiency compared to existing methods.
- The focus on tokamak control is limited within the broader context of the experiments presented.
- The examples provided, while interesting, may not fully resonate with all readers, as alternative tasks like rocket landing could offer more relatable challenges.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section by incorporating literature on the integration of conventional control techniques with RL, particularly studies on adaptive PID tuning. Additionally, addressing the concerns regarding the failure of SAC-GPIDE in the HalfCheetah-V environment is crucial; providing insights or hypotheses about this failure would enhance the paper's robustness. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors clarify the role of attention heads in GPIDE and consider optimizing their configurations to better justify their design choices. We also recommend improving the clarity of the test-time execution point in Appendix E to better address its implications. Lastly, expanding the scope of experiments to include more diverse applications of partial observability, such as rocket landing scenarios, would strengthen the relevance and appeal of the paper. Including a discussion on the computational savings and inference costs of GPIDE compared to baselines would further enhance the evaluation of the proposed architecture.
