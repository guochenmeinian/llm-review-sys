Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel dataset, SuperCon3D, which integrates 3D crystal structures and experimental superconducting transition temperatures. The authors propose two models, SODNet for predicting critical temperatures and DiffCSP-SC for superconductor generation, demonstrating improved performance over some previous methods. The dataset aims to provide a benchmark for superconductor critical temperature prediction and includes candidate superconductors for future validation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a novel crystal superconductivity problem.
2. The dataset integrates 3D crystal structures and experimental superconducting transition temperatures.
3. The proposed models show better performance than some previous methods.
4. The curated dataset includes both ordered and disordered structures, examined by domain experts.

Weaknesses:
1. The contribution appears limited, as the dataset is similar to previous works without adequate citation or comparison.
2. The novelty of the DiffCSP-SC model is not sufficiently qualified, as it seems to be an incremental improvement.
3. The presentation is unclear due to inconsistent notation and insufficient definitions of terms.
4. The dataset size is relatively small, and the authors do not adequately discuss limitations in the data curation process.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by standardizing notation and providing definitions for all terms used. Additionally, the authors should explain how the proposed dataset differs from previous works, particularly in relation to [R1]. It would be beneficial to discuss how SODNet compares to non-deep-learning methods mentioned in [R2-3]. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the novelty of DiffCSP-SC and address the limitations of their dataset curation process, including the small size and potential false positives in model evaluation. Lastly, providing a link to the dataset and improving documentation around the curation process would enhance the paper's overall quality.
