### Key Points
This paper presents a novel metric called Spot Check Equivalence (SCE) for measuring the performance of information gathering systems, particularly in crowdsourcing. SCE evaluates both motivational proficiency and ex-post fairness, demonstrating its effectiveness through theoretical analysis and agent-based model simulations. The authors propose that SCE provides a robust framework for understanding the effectiveness of information elicitation mechanisms and contributes valuable insights for designing efficient incentive mechanisms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
+ The introduction of SCE offers a fresh perspective on evaluating information elicitation mechanisms, enhancing the understanding of incentive mechanisms.
+ The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making complex concepts accessible.
+ The authors establish connections between existing metrics, such as sensitivity and measurement integrity, which enhances the credibility of SCE.

Weaknesses:
- The assumptions underlying SCE's development are scattered throughout the text, lacking upfront clarity and discussion of limitations.
- The paper does not provide comparative results between SCE and other existing metrics, limiting its empirical validation.
- The scope of the agent-based model appears narrow, potentially affecting the generalizability of findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the transparency of the paper by clearly stating the assumptions made during SCE's development and discussing its limitations. Additionally, we suggest including empirical validation using real-world data or experiments to better situate the paperâ€™s claims. Expanding the scope of the agent-based model to include a more diverse range of contexts could enhance external validity. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to delve deeper into the interpretation of findings in the results section to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the observed trends.
