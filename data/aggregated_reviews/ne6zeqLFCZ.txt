### Key Points
This paper presents Lion, an automatic search strategy for deep learning optimizers, claiming enhanced compute efficiency and improved accuracy across various tasks and model architectures. The search employs an evolutionary algorithm initialized with AdamW, utilizing strategies such as the removal of redundant instructions, hash-based caching, and funnel selection to mitigate overfitting. The standout feature of Lion is its combination of a sign function with a specific momentum strategy, demonstrating significant improvements, particularly with larger architectures and datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The evaluation is thorough, encompassing various vision and language models, including contrastive learning and diffusion models, with significant improvements over AdamW, especially in Transformer models.
- The idea of automatically searching for an optimizer is relevant and innovative.
- The presentation is generally clear.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution appears primarily technical, resembling an engineering effort, with the search strategy being relatively simple.
- Lack of code availability and reliance on Google internal datasets hinder reproducibility; search hyperparameters are not provided.
- The search method generates unnecessary statements requiring manual removal, and a cleaner code generation approach would be preferable.
- The computational resources needed for the search method are prohibitive for many research groups, and theoretical analysis is lacking.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the reproducibility of their results by providing code and detailed search hyperparameters. Additionally, we suggest automating the simplification process to enhance the methodology's elegance and efficiency. A theoretical analysis of the Lion optimizer's convergence conditions would also strengthen the paper. Finally, exploring the application of the Lion algorithm to resource-intensive tasks like Stable Diffusion could yield valuable insights.
