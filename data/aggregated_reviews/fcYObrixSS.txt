Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents LEPARD, a framework for reconstructing the 3D shape of animals from single images using a part-based approach with parameterized primitive surfaces. The authors propose to model shapes with global and local deformations, employing a kinematics-inspired optimization that utilizes DINO supervision without requiring 2D or 3D annotations. Experimental results indicate that LEPARD outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating significant improvements in shape reconstruction.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method's part-based approach is innovative and effectively captures detailed shape deformations.
- The experimental evaluation is thorough, showing clear performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.
- The paper is generally well-written and presents compelling qualitative results.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity in defining model parameters and the rationale behind certain methodological choices, such as the use of image forces and the optimization process.
- There is insufficient discussion regarding the limitations of the proposed method, particularly concerning the number of primitives and the treatment of kinematic chains.
- The writing requires significant improvement to enhance readability and comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of model parameter definitions, particularly for q_c and q_theta, and provide detailed explanations for the local deformation process and the use of stationary velocity fields. Additionally, the authors should include a discussion of the limitations and failure cases of the proposed method, addressing how the choice of the number of primitives affects performance. It would also be beneficial to qualitatively evaluate the method on held-out images from diverse sources and to clarify the optimization of camera parameters in relation to the image forces used.
