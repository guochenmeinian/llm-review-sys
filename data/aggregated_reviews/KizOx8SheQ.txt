### Key Points
This paper presents Diff-BBO, a novel diffusion-based inverse modeling approach for solving black-box optimization (BBO) problems online. It introduces the Uncertainty-aware Exploration (UaE) acquisition function, which utilizes uncertainty in diffusion models to propose objective function values, leading to sample-efficient optimization. The methodology is validated through theoretical analyses and empirical evaluations, demonstrating superior performance over baseline methods in various continuous and discrete optimization tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- Introduces a new inverse modeling technique leveraging diffusion models, providing a fresh perspective in the BBO domain.  
- The UaE acquisition function effectively balances exploration and exploitation, optimizing sample efficiency in an online setting.  
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, consistently outperforming baselines in both discrete and continuous tasks.  

Weaknesses:  
- The performance of the Diff-BBO algorithm is heavily dependent on the quality of the initial training dataset, which may hinder optimization if limited or skewed.  
- While the UaE function is theoretically proven to balance objective values and uncertainty, the proofs lack a clear discussion of limitations, assumptions, or failure cases in real-world BBO problems.  
- The paper's clarity is hindered by dense mathematical presentation and insufficient explanations of key concepts, such as the design of the UaE function.  
- The novelty of the approach is not sufficiently differentiated from existing generative models, and the practical impact of the proposed method is questionable due to marginal performance improvements and lack of real-world application examples.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing more intuitive insights and visual aids to explain the core contributions and their significance. Additionally, the authors should strengthen the discussion around the novelty of the UaE function by comparing it more thoroughly to existing methods that balance exploration and exploitation. We also suggest including comprehensive empirical evaluations and real-world application examples to enhance the practical significance of the Diff-BBO method. Finally, addressing the limitations and assumptions of the UaE function in real-world scenarios would improve the robustness of the theoretical contributions.
