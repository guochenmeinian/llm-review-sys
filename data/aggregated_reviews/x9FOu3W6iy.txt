Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents methods IAPEK and Thrust to make instance-level decisions about utilizing external knowledge for question answering. IAPEK allows for the use of external knowledge only when necessary, while Thrust serves as a heuristic scoring method to determine which questions require external knowledge based on distance from existing clusters. The authors demonstrate that Thrust outperforms baseline methods (random and BM25) in accuracy when selecting instances for external knowledge under a fixed budget, achieving significant cost-efficiency and performance improvements across various tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The task is important, with a well-elaborated motivation.
2. Thrust is data-efficient to construct, providing practical value.
3. Comprehensive evaluations support valid conclusions about the methods' effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. The LLMs used may not effectively utilize external knowledge; incorporating stronger models like FLAN-T5 is recommended.
2. The Thrust score lacks theoretical grounding and sufficient ablations to justify design decisions, necessitating more experimental examples and comparisons with simpler distance metrics.
3. The methods and experiments are described informally, lacking clarity on the external knowledge used and how to obtain it.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical justification for the Thrust score and provide more experimental comparisons with simpler distance metrics. Additionally, including knowledge probing experiments could enhance the evaluation of adaptive knowledge injection. Clarifying the external knowledge's reproducibility and accessibility is essential. Lastly, we suggest annotating Table 3 in the appendix for clarity and improving the presentation of results to enhance reader comprehension.
