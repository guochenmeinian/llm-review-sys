### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical and empirical study of document manipulations aimed at improving rankings for multiple queries, extending previous work focused on single-query optimization. The authors analyze document modifications within a game-theoretical framework and conduct ranking competitions. They demonstrate the existence of Nash equilibrium in multi-query settings and provide empirical evidence supporting their claims. The paper is well-structured, with clear problem statements and a solid theoretical analysis, although the analysis features may not fully reflect real-world search engine scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is robust in its problem statement, methodology, and results, demonstrating a thorough approach.
- The theoretical analysis is solid and rigorous, with empirical studies providing valuable insights, particularly regarding the role of generative AI in document modification.
- The extensive comparisons and experiments conducted enhance the paper's contributions to the field.

Weaknesses:
- The integration between the theoretical analysis and experimental results lacks clarity, potentially disconnecting the two components.
- The ranking functions and features analyzed are traditional and may not accurately represent real-world scenarios.
- Ethical concerns arise from incentivizing student participation in experiments, which may create undue stress.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the integration of the theoretical and experimental components to clearly illustrate their interaction and support the paperâ€™s conclusions. Incorporating examples and figures could enhance comprehension for readers outside the field. Additionally, clarifying the use of crowd workers in evaluating document relevance and discussing the implications of the findings for publishers and search engine providers would be beneficial. We also suggest addressing the ethical concerns related to student participation in the experiments and providing a clearer comparison of the current analysis with previous work.
