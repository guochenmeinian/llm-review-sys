Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an algorithm for fair influence maximization, focusing on a welfare fairness notion that balances fairness and influence spread through an exponentially-weighted sum over communities, parameterized by α. The authors propose an efficient algorithm utilizing reverse influence sampling (RIS) to achieve a (1 - 1/e - ε) approximation. Additionally, the paper discusses the selection of nodes in a community using the IMM method, addressing concerns about fair comparisons when seed budgets vary. The authors clarify that their approach intends to select seeds proportional to cluster sizes and acknowledge the need for further experimentation with two variations of IMM: (i) inner-cluster coverage and (ii) whole-network coverage. They also explain the rationale behind the exponent α in the calculation of EoF, emphasizing its role in differentiating methods based on fair influence. The study includes experiments on five social networks, demonstrating the relationship between the fairness parameter α and the price and effect of fairness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The theoretical results are substantial and original, particularly the introduction of efficient algorithms for influence maximization under welfare fairness.
- The unbiased estimator for the marginal influence spread is notable and could have broader applications.
- The paper addresses scalability in influence maximization, a critical aspect of the problem.
- The authors demonstrate responsiveness to reviewer feedback by committing to implement suggested variations of the IMM method.
- The clarification regarding the calculation of EoF enhances the understanding of the methodology and its implications.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental section lacks depth, particularly in analyzing computation time and scalability with network size.
- The importance of the unbiased estimator is not adequately discussed, nor is the complexity of computing it.
- The paper's presentation can be dense, especially in Section 3.4, making it challenging to follow.
- There is insufficient discussion on the implications of the assumptions made, particularly regarding the existence of a fair solution.
- The authors acknowledge a limitation in presenting results for the new IMM variations due to time constraints, which may affect the completeness of their findings.
- There was an oversight in the initial calculation of EoF, which could undermine confidence in the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including a detailed analysis of computation time and how the algorithm scales with network size. Additionally, a clearer discussion on the importance and complexity of the unbiased estimator should be included. We suggest revising Section 3.4 for better clarity, perhaps by explaining high-level concepts before deferring formal statements to the end. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve clarity in their methodology by explicitly stating how seed selection is conducted across different cluster sizes. We also suggest that the authors prioritize conducting and presenting the results of the cluster-budget aware IMM variations in their revised paper to strengthen their findings. Finally, we encourage the authors to ensure accurate calculations and thorough explanations of all metrics, including EoF, to maintain the integrity of their analysis.
