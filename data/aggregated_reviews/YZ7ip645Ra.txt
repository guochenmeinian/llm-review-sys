Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on $\mathcal{H}$-consistency of surrogate losses for structured prediction, demonstrating that several widely used surrogate losses are not Bayes-consistent. The authors propose two families of $\mathcal{H}$-consistent losses—structured comp-sum losses and structured constrained losses—along with efficient algorithms for their minimization. The work highlights the theoretical shortcomings of existing losses and introduces new losses that ensure both $\mathcal{H}$-consistency and Bayes-consistency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The manuscript is well-written, with sound and novel theoretical results. It provides practical optimization methods, demonstrating that the proposed losses are consistent and computationally feasible. The originality of the research is notable, addressing an under-explored area of H-consistency bounds in structured predictions.

Weaknesses:  
The manuscript lacks a conclusion section, which could improve readability. Additionally, there is a potential drawback due to the absence of empirical results to support the theoretical claims. Some sections, particularly from Section 6 onwards, are denser and less clear, which may hinder comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the manuscript by adding a conclusion section to summarize the findings and enhance readability. Including empirical comparisons of the proposed consistent losses with other consistent losses would strengthen the paper. We also suggest organizing key results in lemmas and propositions to clarify the exposition, particularly in the denser sections. Finally, addressing the questions raised regarding the novelty of results and the definitions of certain terms would further clarify the contributions of the work.
