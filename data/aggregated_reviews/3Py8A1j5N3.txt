Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DP-HyPO, a pioneering framework for adaptive private hyperparameter optimization (HPO) that bridges the gap between private and non-private methods. DP-HyPO employs a comprehensive differential privacy analysis and demonstrates its effectiveness through empirical evaluations on various datasets. The framework allows for the flexible use of non-DP adaptive methods while providing sharp DP guarantees. However, the experimental setup primarily utilizes simplistic datasets, raising questions about the robustness of the findings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and accessible, facilitating understanding.
2. The availability of code enhances reproducibility.
3. DP-HyPO addresses a significant problem in the field of adaptive hyperparameter optimization under privacy constraints.

Weaknesses:
1. The experimental analysis is limited, lacking depth and variety in datasets, particularly relying on the MNIST dataset, which is considered overly simplistic.
2. The presentation requires improvement, with important definitions and theoretical insights inadequately integrated into the main text.
3. The framework's applicability to broader learning algorithms beyond deep learning is unclear, and the term "privacy cost" may not be familiar to the HPO community.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by incorporating more challenging datasets and conducting additional evaluations to better demonstrate the strengths of DP-HyPO. Furthermore, we suggest reorganizing the paper to include key definitions and theoretical concepts in the main text, while relegating less critical information to the appendix. Clarifying the framework's applicability to non-deep learning algorithms and explaining the term "privacy cost" would also enhance the paper's accessibility and relevance to the broader HPO community.
