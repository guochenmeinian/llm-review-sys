Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a learnware system designed to manage heterogeneous feature spaces by leveraging label information, including model predictions and minor labeled data. It proposes a strategy to match models with additional conditional distributions and conducts experiments to compare its effectiveness against other learnware systems. The findings indicate that the proposed method significantly outperforms user self-training with limited labeled data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The observation that matching with only the marginal distribution is insufficient is both interesting and novel, as the paper improves this by incorporating conditional distribution.  
2. The experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements.  
3. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, addressing a practical problem in the learnware paradigm.

Weaknesses:  
1. The use of subspace learning to address heterogeneous feature spaces is standard, which limits the perceived contributions of the paper. The relationship between the proposed technology and heterogeneous features needs clarification.  
2. The experiments lack comparisons with more state-of-the-art methods specifically designed for heterogeneous features.  
3. The random division of heterogeneous feature spaces in experiments does not reflect real-world applications, where feature spaces have distinct semantics. Conducting experiments on at least one real-world heterogeneous dataset would be beneficial.  
4. The paper does not adequately discuss existing works on handling learnwares from heterogeneous feature spaces, which are only cited without sufficient analysis.  
5. A thorough analysis of the computational complexity and scalability of the proposed framework is missing, which is crucial for real-world applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the relationship between their contributions and the handling of heterogeneous feature spaces. Additionally, the authors should compare their method with more state-of-the-art approaches specifically designed for heterogeneous features. Conducting experiments on real-world heterogeneous datasets would enhance the validity of their findings. Furthermore, a detailed discussion on the computational complexity and scalability of their framework is necessary to address potential deployment concerns. Lastly, the authors should refine the abstract to emphasize the main contribution of explicitly exploiting label information in handling heterogeneous feature spaces.
