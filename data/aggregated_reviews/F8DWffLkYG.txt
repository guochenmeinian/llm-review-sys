### Key Points
This paper presents a workflow for designing cell-type-specific promoter sequences using a conservative model-based optimization (MBO) approach. The authors focus on creating promoters that minimize off-target effects in closely related cell types, validated through empirical experiments on blood cancer cell lines. The proposed method consists of five steps: pretraining on existing datasets, fine-tuning with a conservative regularizer, gradient ascent for sequence design, selection of optimal and diverse subsets, and experimental verification. The authors compare their workflow's performance against existing methods, demonstrating instances of improved optimality and diversity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The manuscript is well-written and clear, providing a comprehensive guide for promoter design. It effectively addresses the problem's significance and includes a wet lab evaluation, enhancing credibility. The detailed description of model architectures and experimental procedures is commendable.

Weaknesses:  
The innovation of the model is limited, primarily relying on existing models without substantial improvements. The experimental evaluation lacks a broader range of comparative models, and the claim of data efficiency is not well substantiated. Additionally, certain statements are confusing or unsubstantiated, such as the ensemble model's ability to estimate differential expression consistently.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the innovation of their model by incorporating more diverse biological sequence design algorithms rather than relying solely on existing models. To substantiate claims of data efficiency, the authors should clarify how fine-tuning contributes to this aspect. We suggest merging points in Section 4.1 for clarity and enhancing the visual representation of the workflow with decision-tree-like figures. Additionally, the authors should address the contradictions between diversity and conservative regularization and consider revising unclear statements throughout the manuscript for improved readability.
