Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents two algorithms, Categorical Thompson Sampling for MCTS (CATS) and Particle Thompson Sampling for MCTS (PATS), which integrate distributional reinforcement learning into Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enhance value estimation in stochastic settings. The authors provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating a non-asymptotic problem-dependent upper bound on simple regret of \(O(n^{-1})\). They evaluate the algorithms on synthetic planning tasks and in combination with a pre-trained network on the Atari benchmark.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of distributional RL into MCTS using categorical and particle distributions is innovative and addresses a critical need in handling stochastic environments.
- The theoretical analysis is rigorous, with well-defined proofs and clear methodology.

Weaknesses:
- There is a lack of referencing existing work, particularly regarding the novelty of the proposed methods compared to Hayes et al. (2023).
- The empirical validation is limited to a toy domain, and the results on the Atari benchmark are not adequately detailed or reproducible.
- CATS does not outperform fixed depth MCTS on the synthetic tree task, and there is no significance testing for claims of superiority in performance.
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion of limitations, particularly regarding computational demands and hyperparameter sensitivity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical validation by including a more diverse set of benchmarks and conducting experiments in larger stochastic environments. Additionally, the authors should provide a detailed sensitivity analysis of hyperparameters and discuss the computational overhead introduced by the distributional approaches. We also suggest enhancing the presentation by addressing formatting issues and ensuring clarity in the discussion of limitations. Finally, the authors should clarify the differences between the baselines used in synthetic and Atari experiments to strengthen the paper's contributions.
