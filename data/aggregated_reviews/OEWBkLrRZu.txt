Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to protein interface prediction (PIP) by addressing the issue of protein flexibility, which is often overlooked in protein docking. The authors propose an adversarial training framework called ATProt to enhance model robustness against conformational changes. Theoretical guarantees and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ATProt, particularly when using unbound structures as input.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles a significant issue in computational biology, specifically the domain shift caused by protein flexibility.
- ATProt introduces a theoretically sound framework with a stability-oriented objective that can be generalized to various graph neural networks (GNNs).
- Comprehensive experimental settings validate the superiority of ATProt, especially with unbound structures.

Weaknesses:
- The problem formulation is somewhat confusing, as the authors classify all possible residue pairs rather than adhering to the standard PIP task.
- There is a lack of adequate ablation studies to demonstrate the contribution of each component of ATProt.
- The selected baselines are outdated, and the authors should include more recent models like ESMFold and AlphaFold-2.
- The writing lacks clarity in some sections, particularly regarding the specifics of adversarial training objectives.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the problem definition to clarify the distinction between their approach and standard PIP. Additionally, we suggest conducting a more thorough ablation study to highlight the contributions of each component, particularly the stability regularization. It is crucial to include more up-to-date baselines and evaluate models such as ESMFold and AlphaFold-2. Furthermore, enhancing the clarity of the writing, especially regarding adversarial training objectives, will strengthen the paper. Lastly, we encourage the authors to visualize the changes in interface prediction before and after incorporating ATProt to provide more intuitive validation of their framework.
