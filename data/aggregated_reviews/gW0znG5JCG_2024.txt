Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents scCR, a novel imputation method for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data that models both associating and dissociating gene relationships. By utilizing a k-NN graph and negating the cell-gene matrix, scCR standardizes gene value distributions and demonstrates significant performance improvements in gene expression recovery and cell clustering across multiple datasets. The method effectively addresses the limitations of existing approaches by incorporating dissociating relationships, leading to enhanced analysis of scRNA-seq data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper tackles a critical issue in scRNA-seq data imputation, leveraging negatively correlated gene relationships.  
- Extensive experiments validate scCR's superior performance compared to baseline methods, particularly in identifying rare cell types and handling dropout rates.  
- The method is well-structured and clearly presented, with a sound theoretical foundation.  

Weaknesses:  
- The simplicity of the proposed method raises questions about its innovation and the clarity of its motivation, particularly regarding dissociating relationships.  
- A detailed sensitivity analysis of key hyperparameters (e.g., k for k-NN, \(\alpha\), \(\beta\), and \(\gamma\)) is lacking.  
- While runtime analysis is included, memory usage analysis is absent, limiting the comprehensiveness of the scalability discussion.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind the proposed method, particularly in explaining the significance of dissociating relationships. Additionally, we suggest conducting a detailed sensitivity analysis of key hyperparameters to enhance understanding of their impact on performance. Including a memory usage analysis would provide potential users with better insights into the method's scalability and resource requirements.
