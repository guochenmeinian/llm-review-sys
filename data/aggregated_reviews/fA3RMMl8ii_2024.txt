Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for generating 3D assets with detailed geometry using tactile sensing signals, specifically height and normal maps. The authors propose a 3D mesh generation guided by a normal-conditioned ControlNet to ensure consistency between visual and tactile textures. Additionally, they introduce a multi-part editing pipeline to create objects with varying texture parts. The experiments and ablation studies indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing geometric details.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The originality of the paper is commendable, being the first to utilize tactile sensing for 3D generation.  
2. The generated meshes exhibit good geometric details that align well with the input tactile signals.  
3. The exposition is clear, and the paper is well-structured, with visualizations effectively demonstrating the quality of the generated meshes.  
4. The introduction of the TouchTexture dataset, comprising 16 everyday objects, contributes valuable resources to the community.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The connection between tactile sensing and 3D generation lacks robustness, as tactile signals are primarily used for generating normal maps, which could potentially be substituted by simpler methods like texture retrieval from a normal map database.  
2. The paper does not convincingly demonstrate the necessity of the tactile input for the proposed method.  
3. The limited number of objects presented raises concerns about the generalization ability of the model, and the dataset does not adequately capture local geometric intricacies.  
4. The ablation study is insufficiently detailed, lacking both quantitative and qualitative analyses, and should not be summarized in a few sentences.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the connection between tactile sensing and 3D generation by elaborating on why this combination is necessary. Additionally, including an experiment that utilizes real images and corresponding tactile signals would enhance the study. To strengthen the ablation study, we suggest providing more comprehensive quantitative and qualitative results, including specific figures and tables for reference. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to demonstrate the method's performance on more complex objects and to include results on albedo, as well as experiments involving objects with significantly different textures learned through the diffusion prior.
