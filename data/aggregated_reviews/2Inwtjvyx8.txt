Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to physical adversarial attacks, specifically the Camera-Agnostic Patch (CAP) attack, which addresses the limitations of existing methods by incorporating a differentiable camera Image Signal Processing (ISP) proxy network. This network models the transformations images undergo when captured by different cameras, enhancing the robustness of adversarial patches across various camera systems. The proposed adversarial optimization framework consists of an attack module that generates adversarial perturbations and a defense module that optimizes ISP parameters to mitigate attack effectiveness. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the CAP attack across multiple imaging devices.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The authors identify a critical flaw in existing physical adversarial attack methods regarding the transition from physical to digital domains mediated by cameras, and they evaluate the camera's influence on attack performance.  
2. The adversarial optimization framework utilizing a camera ISP proxy network is concise and intuitive, demonstrating good performance across different devices.  
3. Comprehensive experiments, including digital and physical evaluations, provide good quantitative results, addressing significant limitations in the reproducibility of prior works.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The paper lacks an explanation of hyperparameters and their value ranges for the camera ISP proxy network.  
2. There is insufficient discussion on the model black-box scenario, which is an important research direction.  
3. Key experimental settings, such as the total number of images used to calculate the Attack Success Rate (ASR), are missing, and the robustness against real-world disturbances is not discussed.  
4. The method flowchart is unclear and does not seem related to attacking person detection, and there are typographical errors in citations that need correction.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of hyperparameters and their selection criteria for the camera ISP proxy network. Additionally, the authors should provide a more thorough discussion on the threat model and the black-box model scenario. Including Figure A from the supplementary materials in the main text could enhance reader understanding. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the experimental setup by providing the input image size and the total number of images used for ASR calculations. Lastly, expanding the testing to include cameras commonly used in autonomous driving or video surveillance would strengthen the paper.
