Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a dynamic algorithm for the k-center problem with outliers in a metric space with bounded doubling dimension, referred to as the (k, z)-center problem. The objective is to find a set of k points C that minimizes the maximum distance from the n - z closest data points to C. The authors propose a dynamic algorithm with an update time of \( \epsilon^{-O(dim)} \log n \) and a query time of \( (3 + \epsilon) \epsilon^{-O(dim)} k \log n \), which is independent of z. The algorithm builds on previous techniques, improving bounds by integrating various existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The algorithm achieves significant improvements in running times, particularly being independent of z and having a query time linear in k.
- The comprehensive comparison with recent works effectively highlights the novelty of this research.
- The integration of ideas from multiple sources into a cohesive framework is technically interesting.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for focusing on doubling metrics is only partially justified, particularly regarding the dependence on z.
- There is a lack of empirical evaluation, which may be crucial for the NeurIPS community.
- The absence of a clear statement of the main theorem complicates understanding and referencing the work.
- The presentation may be challenging for non-experts, as it assumes familiarity with doubling metrics and k-center clustering.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for the doubling metrics setting, particularly addressing the dependence on z. Additionally, including empirical evaluations would enhance the paper's appeal. A clear and rigorous statement of the main theorem should be added to facilitate understanding and citation. Lastly, simplifying the presentation to make it more accessible to non-experts would be beneficial, possibly by adding a "Technical Contribution" section to clarify the main contributions of the work.
