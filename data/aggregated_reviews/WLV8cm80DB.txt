### Key Points
This paper presents a method called Swapping-based Semantic Change Detection (SSCD) to measure semantic shifts of individual words between two corpora. It utilizes sibling distributions to compare words and a context-swapping test akin to permutation significance tests. The experiments indicate that SSCD correlates well with human rankings of semantic shifts across two datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results for semantic change detection in multiple languages. However, the authors need to clarify the motivation behind their approach and its limitations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is innovative and contributes to the field of semantic change detection.
- It demonstrates effective performance on multiple datasets and languages, including low-frequency words.
- The methodology is clear and offers interesting results.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for the method lacks clarity, particularly regarding the use of sampling distributions.
- The comparison with state-of-the-art methods is not exhaustive, and the authors do not convincingly demonstrate superiority over existing approaches.
- The paper does not adequately address the potential limitations of contextual embeddings derived from contemporary language data.
- There is insufficient discussion on the linguistic significance of the results and the impact of word frequency.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their motivation, particularly regarding the use of sampling distributions and the limitations of their approach. Additionally, a more comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art methods is necessary to substantiate claims of superiority. The authors should also explore the performance of SSCD on semantic changes over longer historical periods and discuss the implications of using contextual embeddings. Furthermore, we suggest providing a deeper analysis of the linguistic significance of the results and addressing the impact of word frequency more thoroughly. Lastly, justifying the choice of multilingual BERT over monolingual models could enhance the paper's contribution.
