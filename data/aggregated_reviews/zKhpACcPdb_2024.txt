### Key Points
This paper presents H-Space Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) as a method to enhance the interpretability and safety of diffusion models. The authors propose leveraging the latent space within the U-Net architecture, termed "H-Space," to facilitate controllable and interpretable modifications to generated images. Notable contributions include the introduction of the Channel-Aware SAE and interpretable modification techniques. The work provides valuable future directions, such as exploring the choice of $t=0.7T$ and its impact on results, alongside a richer understanding of the interventions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- Interesting idea linking to language modeling.  
- Good quantitative and qualitative results.  
- Addresses computational limitations in the H-space of U-Nets.  

Weaknesses:  
- Sections 3.4.1 and 3.4.2 are somewhat difficult to follow; Algorithms 1 & 2 require more descriptive information at each line to aid reader comprehension.  
- Lack of explanation regarding the choice of the middle of the U-Net as the H-space; this may be common knowledge but should be clarified.  
- The intervention in the H-space appears somewhat ad hoc; further explanation of how and why specific interventions are chosen is needed.  

Minor Issues:  
- Line 79: "deep diffusion implicit Models" should be "Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models."  
- Section 3.4.2: Contains a few mistakes, including an unfinished equation (L.152) and an unclear forward process (L.153).

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Sections 3.4.1 and 3.4.2 by providing more descriptive information for Algorithms 1 & 2. Additionally, we suggest including an explanation for the choice of the middle of the U-Net as the H-space to enhance reader understanding. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the rationale behind the specific interventions in the H-space to strengthen the paper's contributions.
