### Key Points
This paper presents a reranking principle for language generation from a communication-theoretic perspective, conceptualizing the generator as a sender transmitting multiple descriptions of a message through parallel noisy channels. The receiver decodes the message by ranking the descriptions to select the most reliable one. The authors analyze the probability of decoding errors and run experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of their method in text-to-code generation and machine translation tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and presents an interesting theoretical analysis relevant to language generation frameworks.  
- The approach is flexible, applicable across different architectures, and well formalized, with sound mathematical explanations.  
- The theoretical contributions provide practical insights for practitioners regarding the number of strings needed from the generator to achieve desired accuracy.

Weaknesses:  
- The related work analysis is not comprehensive, lacking comparisons with existing ranking and reranking methods in recommendation systems.  
- The empirical evaluation is limited, with only two tasks and insufficient baselines, raising concerns about the robustness of the results.  
- The paper lacks a thorough analysis of the experimental results, leaving insights and implications underexplored.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section by including comparisons with existing ranking and reranking methods in recommendation systems. Additionally, we suggest expanding the empirical evaluation to include more common downstream tasks, such as QA scenarios, and increasing the number of baselines for the experiments to enhance representativeness. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide a more detailed analysis of the experimental results, discussing their implications and how they can inform future work. Lastly, clarifying the communication-theoretical framing and its relevance to the paper's contributions could enhance readability and understanding.
