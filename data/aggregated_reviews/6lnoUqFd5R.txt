Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents NeuralEF, a novel deep learning method that reformulates the Efficient Frontier (EF) problem in portfolio optimization as a sequence-to-sequence (SEQ2SEQ) task. The authors utilize an attention mechanism to learn the relationship between financial conditions and optimal portfolio allocations, aiming to accelerate large-scale simulations while adhering to linear constraints. The method includes a Dynamic Greedy Allocation Rebalancing (DGAR) module to ensure feasible solutions. Experimental results demonstrate NeuralEF's effectiveness in providing accurate portfolio allocations with reduced computational resources.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The originality of NeuralEF lies in applying SEQ2SEQ modeling, traditionally used in natural language processing, to portfolio optimization, potentially benefiting various optimization problems.
- The paper is well-structured, with clear notations and definitions, and the methodology is computationally efficient, particularly with the vectorized implementation for multiple EF problems.
- The introduction of the DGAR module enhances the feasibility of the solutions generated by the deep neural network.

Weaknesses:
- The assumption of known expected returns and volatilities limits the model's applicability in real-world scenarios where such estimates are uncertain.
- The study lacks rigorous evaluation on real-world financial data, making it difficult to assess the model's practical utility without empirical validation.
- The effectiveness of the DGAR module is inadequately demonstrated, raising questions about its impact on model performance and the handling of discontinuous behavior.
- The paper does not sufficiently compare NeuralEF with modern portfolio strategies that rely less on expected returns, making it challenging to evaluate its practicality and superiority.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on how NeuralEF handles uncertainties in expected returns and volatilities, as this is critical for asset management. Additionally, we suggest evaluating the model using real-world financial data to better assess its applicability. It would also be beneficial to provide a comprehensive comparison with other optimization techniques, particularly modern portfolio strategies like risk-based portfolios, to clarify NeuralEF's advantages. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to conduct an ablation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the DGAR module and clarify the contributions of each component within NeuralEF. Lastly, addressing the formatting issue to comply with NeurIPS 2023 guidelines is essential.
