Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to mechanism design by integrating concepts from randomized linear algebra (RLA) and active learning, extending the model proposed by [CD22] to a more general setting. The authors propose a two-stage design where the seller queries bidders to recover their latent valuations and then constructs a mechanism based on these approximations. The main contribution is a design that requires milder regularity conditions on representative valuations and operates under various $\ell_p$ norms, unlike prior work which focused solely on the $\ell_\infty$ norm.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper significantly relaxes the requirements on the design matrix A compared to [CD22].
2. The mechanism design argument that translates Prokhorov distance into total variation distance via rounding is novel and broadly applicable.
3. It establishes an intriguing connection between randomized linear algebra and mechanism design, enhancing understanding in the statistical learning community.
4. The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations of technical contributions and a thorough comparison to past work.
5. The notation table is helpful for clarity.

Weaknesses:
1. There is considerable notational overhead and numerous assumptions, making it beneficial to streamline these concepts, possibly by recapitulating assumptions in an appendix.
2. The paper may appear to make an incremental contribution within a niche setting, as the techniques for RLA are somewhat standard.
3. The authors should clarify their contributions to mechanism design and the broader implications of their work, addressing why their specific setting is the most appropriate.
4. The paper is dense with heavy notation, which could be alleviated by including simple running examples to illustrate key concepts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by streamlining notational overhead and assumptions, potentially through an appendix summarizing these elements. Additionally, consider providing a simple running example to illustrate the mechanism design process. It would be beneficial to explicitly state Lemma 2 and discuss how the results in [CD22] could be improved or simplified using the authors' techniques. Furthermore, we suggest enhancing the introduction to be less formal yet more comprehensive, ensuring that key ideas are clearly communicated to improve accessibility for readers from diverse backgrounds.
