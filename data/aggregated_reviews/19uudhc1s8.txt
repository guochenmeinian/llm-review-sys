### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of adaptations of novels into films, introducing an alignment technique based on the Smith-Waterman algorithm and sentence-BERT similarity measures. It provides three datasets, two of which are manually annotated, and evaluates the alignment method across 40 adaptations. The authors explore various aspects of adaptation, including faithfulness to the source material and the retention of dialogues that pass the Bechdel Test. The study aims to enhance understanding in the underexplored area of narrative NLP.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a niche yet significant area in narrative NLP, potentially catalyzing further research due to its valuable datasets and comprehensive experimental comparisons.
- The methodology is robust, with a clear experimental design and a well-considered replication strategy that navigates copyright challenges.
- The paper is well-written and accessible, providing interesting empirical data on film adaptations.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on textual similarity measures may oversimplify the adaptation process, neglecting important cinematic elements such as narrative tempo and emotional subtleties.
- The chosen techniques for alignment and faithfulness assessment may be outdated, suggesting that newer methods could yield better results.
- The datasets, particularly the gold alignments, are relatively small, which may limit the effectiveness of the chosen techniques.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the alignment and faithfulness assessment by exploring newer or more tailored techniques, such as contextualized embeddings or algorithms used in paraphrase detection. Additionally, we suggest expanding the datasets to enhance the robustness of the findings. Finally, we encourage the authors to consider incorporating visual or auditory analysis to capture essential cinematic elements that could enrich the interpretation of book-film adaptations.
