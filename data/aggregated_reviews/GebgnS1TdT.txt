### Key Points
This paper presents two methods to enhance the accuracy of analog hardware affected by non-idealities. Both methods estimate the confidence of an analog neural network's output and correct low-confidence outputs by executing an additional run with a digital-only neural network. The authors validate these methods using a software library that simulates analog electronic crossbar arrays, achieving accuracy improvements of up to 20 percentage points depending on the model and method used. The proposed algorithm coordinates analog and digital computation to leverage the power efficiency of analog systems while maintaining the accuracy of digital systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and effectively discusses intuitive strategies for executing the digital model based on confidence metrics.  
- The experimental validation demonstrates digital-like performance with reduced computation.  

Weaknesses:  
- The terminology used equates analog computing primarily with analog electronic crossbar arrays, neglecting other forms such as optical or photonic computing.  
- There is a lack of quantitative analysis to clarify the connection between the analog network's confidence and its deviation from the digital network's outputs.  
- Variable names in Algorithms 1 and 2 are not clearly defined, impacting readability.  
- A typo is present in line 168.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the terminology to include a broader definition of analog computing, encompassing optical and photonic forms. Additionally, we suggest providing a quantitative analysis to illustrate how the confidence metric predicts deviations between analog and digital outputs. Clarifying variable names in Algorithms 1 and 2 would enhance readability, and correcting the typo on line 168 is necessary. Furthermore, exploring the combination of the correction-based approach with other methods, such as hardware-aware training, could yield insights into potential accuracy improvements.
