Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a formalization of meaningful communication in Emergent Communication (EC) protocols, identifying two prerequisites: **semantic consistency** and **spatial meaningfulness**. The authors analyze these concepts in two EC environments—reconstruction and discrimination settings—demonstrating that while optimal solutions in reconstruction tasks are both semantically consistent and spatially meaningful, discrimination tasks do not require these properties. The authors introduce "semantic consistency," defined formally to compare discrimination and reconstruction objectives in emergent communication research, and show that semantically inconsistent protocols can be optimal for discrimination but not for reconstruction. Additionally, the paper introduces "spatial meaningfulness," which aligns more closely with natural language characteristics. The theoretical findings are supported by numerical experiments using the MNIST dataset, indicating advantages in communication goals based on distance rather than probability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with clear theorems and proofs.
- The formal definitions and theoretical proofs contribute innovatively to the literature, establishing new standards for meaningful communication in emergent communication systems.
- The theoretical contributions are novel and valuable, providing useful tools for future research in EC.
- The paper is well-structured, with clear definitions, hypotheses, and theorems that logically build upon one another.
- The rigorous theoretical analysis regarding semantic consistency and spatial meaningfulness is robust and well-founded.

Weaknesses:
- The empirical evaluation fails to demonstrate the significance of spatial meaningfulness and may not capture the complexity of real-world applications; additional experiments with diverse datasets or complex tasks are needed.
- The analysis of spatial meaningfulness using message clusters may not fully explore the concept's nuances, warranting further investigation into evaluation methods.
- The assumption that Euclidean distance broadly indicates semantic similarity is questionable; discussing the limitations of this metric and considering alternatives would enhance the paper.
- The paper's two-stage training procedure lacks a discussion on computational efficiency and scalability, which is crucial for understanding practical applicability.
- There are missing citations and unclear definitions that detract from the overall clarity and impact of the work, and the novelty and significance of the contributions, particularly regarding the connection to human communication, are unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical evaluation to better highlight the importance of spatial meaningfulness and incorporate more complex datasets and tasks to better reflect real-world scenarios. Additionally, please address the missing citations in Section 2.2 and clarify the definitions of key terms, such as "unrestricted" and "unexplained variance." Further exploration of spatial meaningfulness through varied evaluation methods is essential. The authors should discuss the limitations of using Euclidean distance and consider alternative metrics for measuring semantic similarity. Including a detailed analysis of the computational efficiency and scalability of the proposed methods would provide a more comprehensive understanding of their practical applicability. Lastly, clarifying the novelty and significance of the contributions, particularly in relation to human communication, would strengthen the paper's impact.
