### Key Points
This paper presents a provably faster algorithm for computing John ellipsoids, utilizing an approximation of leverage scores with a faster algorithm as indicated in Theorem 1.3, and employing fast matrix multiplication along with lazy updates to reduce polylog suboptimality. The authors propose a nearly linear time algorithm for dense matrices, specifically running in time $\widetilde{O}(nd)$, and introduce low-space streaming algorithms that leverage similar techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed algorithm is provably faster and may yield improvements for optimization algorithms that utilize leverage score computations.  
- The insight is presented clearly, enhancing the understanding of the algorithm's implications.

Weaknesses:  
- The main result does not rely on Theorem 1.3, and there is a lack of proof or reference for it.  
- The contribution is unclear, as the proof of Theorem 1.6 primarily depends on existing results.  
- The paper is poorly written, with major issues in presentation and a lack of justifications in the checklist.  
- There are minor issues such as typos in Algorithm 1 and a suboptimal runtime guarantee.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contribution by providing a detailed proof or reference for Theorem 1.3. Additionally, please clarify the specific applications of leverage scores and discuss concrete runtime improvements that arise from Theorem 1.3. We also suggest addressing the writing quality and ensuring that all references are correctly capitalized. Furthermore, please explicitly state the space complexity in Theorem 1.8 and consider using the Sherman-Morrison formula to enhance the update time for maintaining the inverse in the streaming algorithm.
