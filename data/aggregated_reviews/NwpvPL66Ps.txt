### Key Points
This paper presents CDLtvS, a novel method for predicting Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) in supply chain platforms by leveraging cross-domain information. It addresses the challenge of data sparsity and long-tail distributions that complicate LTV predictions. The method incorporates an Expert Mask Network (ExMN) to model long-tail distributions and mitigate biases in cross-domain learning. Comprehensive experiments on real-world data from JD.com demonstrate the effectiveness of CDLtvS in enhancing LTV predictions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- CDLtvS introduces a novel approach tailored for cross-domain LTV prediction, effectively addressing data sparsity and long-tail distribution issues.
- Extensive experiments validate the method's performance, showcasing significant improvements over baseline models.

Weaknesses:
- The complexity of the approach may limit its applicability in other industries beyond supply chain platforms.
- The paper lacks clarity in its writing and arrangement, making it challenging for readers unfamiliar with the domain.
- Comparisons are primarily made against traditional machine learning algorithms, with a need for inclusion of more state-of-the-art methods.
- Some technical details, such as the unexplained symbol $\ddot{e}^s$ and discrepancies in reported NRMSE values, require refinement.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing a table of definitions for jargon and abbreviations to enhance accessibility for a broader audience. Additionally, including more comparisons with state-of-the-art methods in cross-domain recommendation or LTV prediction would better highlight the technical contributions of CDLtvS. We also suggest refining technical details, such as ensuring all symbols are clearly defined and correcting any inconsistencies in reported results. Finally, addressing the statistical significance of claims and discussing potential biases and fairness issues related to the research would strengthen the paper's contributions.
