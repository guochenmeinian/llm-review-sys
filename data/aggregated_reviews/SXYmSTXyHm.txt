Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework that integrates causal sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness of fairness metrics in machine learning, focusing on three types of biases: proxy label bias, selection bias, and extra-classificatory policies. The authors demonstrate that even minor biases can significantly impact fairness assessments, revealing the fragility of many fairness metrics. The analysis is applied to various classifiers and datasets, providing upper and lower bounds for fairness metrics and emphasizing the need for more robust evaluations in FairML.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel perspective on evaluating fairness metrics, addressing the critical aspect of sensitivity to measurement biases.
- The methodology is well-structured and the experiments are comprehensive, leading to significant implications for FairML practices.
- Clear real-world examples effectively illustrate complex concepts, enhancing reader understanding.

Weaknesses:
- Some sections, particularly those detailing technical aspects, lack clarity and could benefit from simplification and better notation.
- The repository is not well-organized, hindering reproducibility and adaptation for other datasets.
- The paper does not provide solutions to the identified biases, limiting its practical application.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of technical sections, particularly in explaining causal sensitivity analysis and defining symbols upon first use. Additionally, tidying the repository by removing unnecessary files and providing a comprehensive README with instructions for reproducing results would enhance usability. We also suggest including a discussion on the computational costs of the proposed methods and considering the addition of other bias types in the analysis. Finally, clarifying the number of datasets analyzed and addressing typos throughout the paper would strengthen the overall presentation.
