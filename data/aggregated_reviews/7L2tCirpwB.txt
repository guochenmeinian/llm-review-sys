Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical error analysis of the Spherically Constrained Least Squares (SCLS) method, which is the state-of-the-art approach for solving the Stackelberg Prediction Game with least squares loss (SPG-LS). The authors transform the estimation error into a Primary Optimization (PO) problem and utilize the Convex Gaussian Min-Max Theorem (CGMT) to reformulate it as an Auxiliary Optimization (AO) problem. The theoretical results confirm the reliability of the SCLS method, and empirical studies validate these findings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces a novel method for analyzing the estimation error of the SCLS method, enhancing its theoretical framework and confirming its reliability.  
- The writing quality is high, with clear argumentation and presentation.  
- The contribution is significant, promoting the large-scale application of the SCLS method.

Weaknesses:  
- The motivation for the lack of theoretical analysis on the SCLS method's error is unclear, which is crucial for understanding the paper's importance.  
- Some notations are ambiguous, hindering readability, and assumptions regarding data distribution may be overly restrictive.  
- The relationship between Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 is not adequately explained, and certain derivations lack clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for the theoretical analysis of the SCLS method's error to strengthen the paper's significance. Additionally, the authors should clarify ambiguous notations and assumptions, particularly regarding the data distribution. It would be beneficial to provide more detailed explanations for the derivations and the relationship between Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 to enhance readability and comprehension.
