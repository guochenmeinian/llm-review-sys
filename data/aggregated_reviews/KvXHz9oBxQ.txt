Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents PASS, a predictive auto-scaling system designed to enhance Quality of Service (QoS) in enterprise web applications by utilizing future workload predictions. The authors motivate their approach by outlining the limitations of existing methods and provide a thorough evaluation across over 200 enterprise web services. The paper claims to achieve improved QoS results with minimal cost implications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and clearly presents its arguments.
- It effectively motivates the performance of different prediction algorithms under varying scenarios.
- The evaluation is comprehensive and demonstrates the potential of PASS in real-world applications.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation lacks fairness as it combines two models while baselines are based on a single model, leading to concerns about overhead and complexity.
- There is insufficient discussion on the scalability and limitations of PASS.
- The manuscript shows a lack of comprehensive literature understanding, with claims that are not sufficiently supported by existing research.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by providing an overhead comparison and integrating their prediction algorithm with other state-of-the-art auto-scaling methods. Additionally, a discussion section should be included to explore the broader implications of the research. The authors should also clarify the definitions of key terms and provide a detailed component analysis to demonstrate the contributions of each part of the system. Finally, citing recent work on microservice scaling would strengthen the literature review.
