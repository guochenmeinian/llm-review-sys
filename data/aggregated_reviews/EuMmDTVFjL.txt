### Key Points
This paper presents research on identifying conflict within Twitter data as a preliminary step toward distinguishing between productive and unproductive conflict. The authors propose a dataset with human annotations, early predictive results, and ideas for differentiating agonism from antagonism in future work. The study emphasizes the importance of contextual information for conflict identification and aims to enhance understanding of conflicts in democratic dialogue.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation to differentiate between productive and unproductive conflict is compelling and of broad interest.
- Robust data annotation processes and a well-defined distinction between agonism and antagonism are provided.
- The paper is well-organized, clear, and easy to follow, contributing valuable insights into online conflict dynamics.

Weaknesses:
- There is a disconnect between the paper's motivation and the binary prediction task presented in the experiments.
- The level of inter-annotator agreement for key aspects of conflict annotation is low, raising concerns about reliability.
- The hypothesis is difficult to track, and figures are presented in a way that diminishes clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity in the introduction by explicitly connecting the theoretical motivation to the operationalized tasks. Additionally, addressing the low inter-annotator agreement through refined guidelines or additional training sessions would enhance the reliability of the annotations. We also suggest adding a list of all hypotheses to aid in tracking the study's claims and ensuring that figures are modified for better readability.
