### Key Points
This paper presents the PM-MOE framework, which integrates a Mixture of Experts (MoE) structure with energy-based denoising for personalized federated learning (PFL). The authors propose a dynamic weighting mechanism via gating networks to enhance personalization across clients and introduce an energy-based denoising method to filter out irrelevant parameters. The framework aims to improve model generalization in heterogeneous data settings while ensuring privacy and preventing gradient leakage.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The innovative combination of MoE and energy-based denoising addresses significant challenges in PFL.
2. Theoretical guarantees and empirical results support the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
3. The design preserves privacy by keeping sensitive parameters local and minimizing computational overhead.
4. The framework's adaptability to existing PFL algorithms without altering their architectures is a notable advantage.

Weaknesses:  
1. The scalability of the framework to large datasets and systems with numerous clients is unclear, and the computational overhead of the gating network is not thoroughly addressed.
2. The energy-based denoising method's reliance on similarity measures may not generalize well across diverse domains.
3. Implementation details, such as hyperparameter selection and tuning, require further elaboration for reproducibility.
4. The paper lacks a quantitative evaluation of communication overhead related to sharing personalized parameters among clients.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the abstract by more straightforwardly highlighting the main contributions and evaluation metrics. The explanation of the PM in the proposed architecture should be refined for clarity. Additionally, the authors should discuss potential security risks beyond gradient leakage, such as model tampering and validation. A more comprehensive analysis of the performance across various datasets, particularly where improvements are minimal, is necessary. The authors should also provide a detailed analysis of the computational costs associated with the gating network and denoising method, and include pseudocode along with a time complexity analysis for the algorithm. Lastly, the limitations of the work and connections to future research should be elaborated upon.
