Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach called Deep Evolutionary Clustering jointed temporal knowledge graph Representation Learning (DECRL) aimed at enhancing Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) representation learning. The authors propose a cluster-aware unsupervised alignment mechanism to align soft overlapping clusters across timestamps and an implicit correlation encoder to capture latent correlations between clusters. Experimental results indicate that DECRL achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates significant improvements on various benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The integration of high-order structure in TKG representation learning is innovative.  
2. The experimental results show remarkable improvements, particularly on ICEWS datasets.  
3. The paper is well-organized, clearly presented, and the technical details are adequately explained.  

Weaknesses:  
1. Key concepts such as entity graph and cluster graph are not adequately introduced, leading to unclear intuition behind the method.  
2. The evaluation relies on a relatively simple future relation prediction task, while more complex tasks like future entity prediction should also be assessed.  
3. The clustering approach only considers entity representations, neglecting the impact of various relations that may indicate different correlations.  
4. The experimental evaluation is limited to two benchmark datasets, which undermines the robustness of the findings.  
5. The motivation for introducing a cluster graph at each timestamp is unclear, and the differences between DECRL and similar methods should be discussed.  
6. The methodology lacks ablation studies for minor techniques, and additional explanations for figures and case studies are needed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by clearly defining key concepts such as entity graph and cluster graph. Additionally, the authors should evaluate the learned representations on more complex tasks like future entity prediction to demonstrate their effectiveness. It would be beneficial to incorporate relation semantics into the clustering process to better capture correlations. We suggest expanding the experimental evaluation to include more diverse datasets, such as GDELT, YAGO, and Wikidata, to strengthen the findings. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the motivation behind the cluster graph and discuss how DECRL differs from existing methods. Lastly, we encourage the inclusion of ablation studies for minor techniques and more detailed explanations for figures and case studies to enhance clarity.
