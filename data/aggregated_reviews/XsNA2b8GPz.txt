Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an efficient algorithm called AdaptiveSoftmax, aimed at computing the top k outputs of the softmax function more effectively than traditional full softmax computations. The authors propose an adaptive approach that utilizes multi-armed bandit techniques to prioritize computations for the largest input elements, leading to significant reductions in sample complexity. The paper provides PAC (Probably Approximately Correct) guarantees for AdaptiveSoftmax, demonstrating its theoretical soundness. Empirical results on various datasets, including EuroSAT, validate the algorithm's efficiency, achieving substantial computational overhead reductions. The proposed method for estimating the softmax partition function suggests potential applications beyond its current scope.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The AdaptiveSoftmax algorithm significantly reduces computational overhead in high-dimensional settings, making it practical for large-scale machine learning applications.
- Strong theoretical foundations are provided with PAC guarantees, ensuring reliable performance bounds alongside extensive empirical validation across different networks, including CNNs and LLMs.
- The paper presents a novel approach to softmax approximation, addressing challenges faced by existing methods and offering a clear and well-organized presentation.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on a variance proxy bound for the sub-Gaussian parameters of the estimators is not thoroughly explored, potentially limiting the algorithm's applicability in varied environments.
- The paper lacks quantitative comparisons with other adaptive softmax methods, such as those by Joulin et al., which could provide context for its performance.
- Practical implementation may require parameter tuning, and an ablation study on the sensitivity of default hyperparameters is necessary. Additionally, the worst-case performance scenarios need to be discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the exploration of the practical implications of the variance proxy bound assumption and its impact on algorithm effectiveness in diverse environments. A quantitative comparison with existing adaptive softmax methods, particularly regarding speed improvements, would enhance the paper's contributions. Furthermore, conducting an ablation study to assess the sensitivity of the algorithm to parameter choices, including the $\epsilon$ parameter, and providing comprehensive evaluations of these changes would strengthen the findings. Lastly, discussing scenarios where the proposed method may not be suitable, particularly in lower-dimensional settings, would provide a more balanced view of its applicability.
