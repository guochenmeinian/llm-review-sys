### Key Points
This paper presents the tool GenAudit for fact-checking and modifying LLM responses. The authors propose an end-to-end solution for identifying and correcting factual errors in LLM-generated content, including a user interface and human annotation, which is significant for future research. The originality lies in introducing a tool that suggests edits based on fact-checking LLMs and allows for their evaluation, comparing it against a similar hallucination detection approach (Mishra et al., 2024).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces an important tool for evaluating fact-checking LLMs, relevant for safe generative AI.
- Experiments are well-documented and sound.
- Human evaluation addresses concerns regarding dataset splits and error identification rates.
- The discussion of recall versus precision is effectively handled with the Thresholded Edit algorithm.

Weaknesses:
- The middle portion of Algorithm 1 is difficult to follow, despite comments.
- The impact of dropping irrelevant portions of the reference document on results is not discussed.
- The analysis of the scalability of the proposed method concerning the length of reference documents is insufficient.
- The novelty is limited as the authors primarily fine-tuned LLMs without exploring advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the middle portion of Algorithm 1 to enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide an analysis of how dropping irrelevant portions of the reference document affects results. To strengthen the paper, we encourage the authors to include more experimental results validating the scalability of their method and to elaborate on the unique advantages of their approach compared to advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation methods.
