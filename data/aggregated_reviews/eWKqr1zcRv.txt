Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for solving inverse problems using diffusion-based probabilistic models, focusing on an asymptotically exact approach that leverages a diffusion model for the prior distribution and a likelihood without requiring additional training. The authors propose a reconstruction guidance technique to approximate the score of the diffused posterior, leading to particle approximations of the marginal of the backward diffusion of the posterior using twisting functions. The method is extended to Riemannian manifolds and is empirically validated through numerical experiments, including applications in protein design. However, the new results do not clearly demonstrate a significant advantage of the proposed techniques, as evidenced by the scores of TDS with one particle being very close to those with 16 particles, with the only notable exception being the inception score, where TDS (P=16) indicates higher sample diversity, although the diversity of the reported images remains limited.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The contribution is original and theoretically grounded, providing a reliable solution for complex inverse problems, unlike existing methods such as DPS.
- The paper is well-written and engaging, with sound numerical experiments and an interesting application to protein design.
- The authors' effort in conducting additional experiments and providing clarifications is commendable.
- The proposed method and its implementation details are considered elegant and potentially beneficial to the community.

Weaknesses:
- The computational cost of approximating optimal twisting functions may limit the number of particles used, especially in large-scale applications, potentially affecting performance in multimodal posteriors.
- The comparison with SMCDiff is deemed unfair, as SMCDiff does not require gradient computation, leading to lower computational time and memory costs.
- The impact of high-dimensional observations on the method's performance is not adequately discussed, which could mislead readers regarding its effectiveness in such scenarios.
- Some assumptions regarding convergence are considered strong and should be explicitly stated, along with a need for clarity in the mathematical expressions and notation.
- The new results fail to show a clear advantage of the introduced techniques, and the diversity of the reported images is very limited, despite the higher inception score for TDS (P=16).

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the computational cost associated with the gradient calculations for optimal twisting functions, particularly in large-scale applications. Additionally, a more balanced comparison with SMCDiff should be included, addressing the differences in computational requirements. We suggest adding a section discussing the implications of high-dimensional observations on the method's performance to avoid misleading conclusions. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the strong assumptions made regarding convergence and enhance the clarity of mathematical expressions throughout the paper. We also recommend that the authors improve the demonstration of the advantages of their techniques by providing more comprehensive results and enhancing the diversity of the reported images to strengthen the overall impact of the findings. Lastly, we advise moving relevant content from the appendix to the main body for better coherence and accessibility.
