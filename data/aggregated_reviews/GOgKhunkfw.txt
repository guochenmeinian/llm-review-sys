Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for modeling deterministic maps on paired data using neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) with flow matching (FM). The authors address the challenge of preserving coupling in training by introducing learned encoders and decoders to rewire trajectories, ensuring they do not cross. The approach is validated through experiments on classification and regression tasks, demonstrating efficiency and the ability to learn linear maps with reduced computational overhead. Additionally, the authors propose a novel approach to learning through Flow Matching via latent embedding, emphasizing the joint learning of the embedding space and dynamic function to minimize flow matching loss in an end-to-end manner. They argue that their method differs significantly from prior works that utilize fixed latent embeddings, which do not adequately address target trajectory crossing, and focus on learning a deterministic mapping between paired data, preserving the original coupling of data pairs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces an innovative end-to-end learning approach for NODEs that effectively preserves training set coupling.
- The authors propose a method that learns the embedding space jointly with the dynamic function, which is a significant advancement over fixed latent embeddings.
- Experimental results indicate that the method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both metrics and runtime.
- The paper addresses the critical issue of preserving the original coupling of data pairs, which is essential for their problem setting.
- Empirical comparisons demonstrate the importance of learning data embeddings.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation lacks formal rigor, particularly in explaining the method and experimental settings, such as the noise addition to labels and the introduction of flow matching.
- The motivation for using NODEs for linear maps is weak, as the heavy lifting is performed by the encoder-decoder networks, raising questions about the necessity of NODEs in this context.
- The contribution of the paper may be perceived as limited due to existing discussions on similar approaches in recent literature.
- The experimental setup regarding augmented dimensions appears to lack clarity and does not convincingly resolve the crossing trajectory problem.
- The paper does not adequately compare the proposed method with naive baselines, such as augmented NODEs combined with flow matching.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by providing more formal and rigorous explanations, particularly regarding the noise addition in the loss function and the flow matching dynamics. Additionally, we suggest including a comparison with augmented NODEs and discussing the potential performance implications of using an identity function for the learned flow. To strengthen the motivation for using NODEs, we encourage the authors to justify their choice over conventional finite-depth models through empirical comparisons with similar-sized non-NODE-based architectures. Furthermore, we recommend improving the clarity of the experimental setup, particularly regarding the role of augmented dimensions in resolving crossings. Consider employing a learned third dimension for augmentation, as suggested, to enhance the experimental baseline. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide more thorough comparisons and analyses with existing methods, particularly in relation to the Augmented Bridge Matching approach, to better contextualize their contributions. Visualizing the trajectory crossing issue in both the proposed method and traditional FM would also enhance the understanding of the method's effectiveness.
