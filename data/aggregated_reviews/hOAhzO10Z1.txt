### Key Points
This paper presents a re-ranking approach for recommender systems that emphasizes beyond-accuracy metrics, such as diversity, novelty, and serendipity, calibrated to user-specific preferences. The authors propose a post-ranking greedy optimization algorithm to balance accuracy with user preferences, based on the hypothesis that users have distinct, implicit behavioral models valuing different metrics. The methodology is supported by experiments on two real-world datasets, demonstrating significant differences in user preferences regarding beyond-accuracy metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces a novel idea of calibrating beyond-accuracy metrics to user history, which is a unique contribution to the field.  
- The authors provide a clear overview of concepts and notation, making the paper accessible.  
- The clustering analysis offers a fresh perspective on user behavior, and the proposed methodology is theoretically robust.  
- Experiments effectively illustrate the importance of beyond-accuracy calibration for personalized recommendations.

Weaknesses:  
- The experimentation is limited, lacking robust comparisons with established baselines that incorporate beyond-accuracy metrics.  
- Clarity issues arise in several areas, including tables, figures, and definitions, which hinder reader comprehension.  
- The paper does not adequately address temporal drift in user interactions, potentially affecting the validity of the results.  
- Some figures and tables require better explanations and formatting consistency.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by addressing the specific concerns raised regarding tables, figures, and definitions. An initial schematic outlining the flow of the paper would enhance understanding. Additionally, consider including baselines that incorporate beyond-accuracy metrics to better illustrate the contributions of the proposed approach. We also suggest providing a more thorough explanation of the discovered user clusters and ensuring consistent formatting in tables to avoid confusion. Lastly, addressing the potential impact of temporal drift on user interactions would strengthen the overall findings.
