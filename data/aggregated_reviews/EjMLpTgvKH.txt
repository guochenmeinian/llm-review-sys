Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Timewarp, a method that utilizes a normalizing flow as a proposal distribution to enhance sampling of the Boltzmann distribution, achieving a significant acceleration in molecular dynamics (MD) time steps from ~1 fs to 10^5 fs. The authors demonstrate the method's transferability across peptide systems and its integration with the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) acceptance step. The experimental results indicate that Timewarp closely matches MD samples and provides reasonable free energy estimates, although less accurate than those obtained with MCMC.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is well-organized and clearly presented, making it accessible.
- It demonstrates generalization to unseen peptide systems, marking a significant contribution.
- The integration with MCMC enhances the sampling process, and the batched sampling compensates for low acceptance ratios.
- Experimental results validate the proposed exploration algorithm, showing reasonable performance.

Weaknesses:
- There is no comparison with conventional MD-acceleration methods like metadynamics or parallel tempering, leaving questions about competitiveness.
- The method's performance on larger peptide systems (4-mer) appears to break down, raising concerns about scalability.
- The low MH acceptance rates suggest that the diffeomorphism function requires better learning.
- The method's inability to reproduce transition states limits its applicability to chemical reactions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison of Timewarp with conventional MD-acceleration methods to clarify its competitive standing. Additionally, evaluating the proposed method on application-oriented metrics, such as the reproducibility of physical properties, would strengthen the findings. We suggest addressing the low MH acceptance rates by enhancing the learning of the diffeomorphism function. Furthermore, discussing the implications of using implicit solvent simulations and exploring generalizations to explicit solvent systems would provide valuable insights. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the computational environment for baseline MD simulations and the rationale behind the choice of amber-14 in OpenMM.
