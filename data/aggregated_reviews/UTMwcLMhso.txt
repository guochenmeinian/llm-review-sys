### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the effects of prompt format and in-context examples on the probability assigned to answer choices in multiple-choice question-answering tasks. The authors introduce a mathematical formalism for the "surface form competition" (SFC) hypothesis and a new metric, PMA, to quantify SFC and its impact on model performance. They propose methods to mitigate SFC, including incorporating choices in prompts and using in-context learning, and analyze the correlation between SFC and task accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors provide a formal definition of the SFC hypothesis, enabling a quantifiable assessment of its impact.
- The proposed methods to reduce SFC significantly increase PMA and offer practical insights for using different types of language models in multiple-choice tasks.
- The paper is well-written, with clear explanations and well-designed experiments demonstrating the relationship between SFC and accuracy.

Weaknesses:
- The findings may not be broadly applicable beyond multiple-choice tasks, and the actual impact of SFC in standard setups may be overstated.
- Observations indicate that reducing SFC does not consistently lead to improved accuracy, raising questions about the robustness of the conclusions.
- Some experimental results, particularly regarding the performance of larger models, contradict the proposed insights, suggesting a need for further exploration.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the correlation between SFC and accuracy by reporting concrete metrics, such as Spearman correlation. Additionally, we suggest exploring the applicability of their findings to more complex prompt templates beyond simple configurations. It would also be beneficial to conduct further experiments on NLP tasks outside of multiple-choice QA to provide a broader perspective on the implications of SFC. Lastly, clarifying the observed contradictions in model performance, particularly with larger models, would strengthen the paper's conclusions.
