### Key Points
This paper presents a study on how transformer models process animacy, particularly focusing on atypical token-level animacy. It builds on previous findings that language models (LMs) are sensitive to animacy, demonstrating that LMs can adapt quickly to atypical cases, similar to human responses. The study employs existing datasets and translates Dutch psycholinguistic studies for evaluation by English LMs, contributing to both theoretical understanding and practical datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a novel and interesting topic relevant to cognitive modeling and BERTology.
- Experiments are clearly presented and anticipate potential pitfalls, yielding a significant finding that LMs respond to animacy in a human-like manner.
- The interdisciplinary approach is well-executed, effectively linking psycholinguistic studies to LM evaluation.

Weaknesses:
- The significance testing in Section 5.1 is flawed, as it incorrectly sets the null hypothesis. An equivalence test would be more appropriate.
- The background section lacks references to previous work on animacy detection, which should be included for context.
- The conclusion may overstate the findings, suggesting LMs respond to animacy like humans without sufficient caution.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the significance testing in Section 5.1 by employing an equivalence test instead of the Wilcoxon test. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the terminology used to describe animacy in the introduction and conclusion, particularly the terms 'muted' and 'indirect.' To enhance the background section, please include references to previous studies on animacy detection. Finally, we advise the authors to moderate the tone of the conclusion to reflect that the findings are based on the specific experiments conducted, rather than making broad generalizations.
