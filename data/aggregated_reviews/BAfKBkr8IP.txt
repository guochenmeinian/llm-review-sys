Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Fourier Basis Model (FBM) for long-term time series forecasting, addressing challenges in existing Fourier-based methods such as inconsistent starting cycles and series lengths. The authors argue that FBM improves upon methods like DLinear and Autoformer by effectively separating trend and seasonal effects without requiring a predefined kernel size. The model incorporates both linear and nonlinear variants, leveraging time-dependent and time-independent basis functions for enhanced interpretability and noise reduction. The authors claim that FBM consistently outperforms various baselines, particularly in noisy conditions, and provide a comprehensive analysis of performance differences compared to iTransformer on the ETTh1 and PEMS04 datasets. They also emphasize the innovative design of FBM in capturing time-frequency features and highlight improvements made from previous work, including the replacement of less efficient baselines with state-of-the-art alternatives.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The FBM model effectively integrates time and frequency domain features, demonstrating consistent performance improvements over existing models, particularly in handling various time scales and noisy conditions.
2. The authors provide thorough clarifications of performance discrepancies, supported by detailed tables and comparisons, enhancing transparency.
3. The inclusion of detailed experimental settings and visualizations improves reproducibility and showcases the unique advantages of the proposed method in time-frequency modeling.

Weaknesses:
1. The technical contributions appear incremental, with similarities to existing works, such as FEDformer, and the mapping methods in the decoder seem simplistic.
2. The introduction and model architecture lack clarity, particularly regarding the integration of non-learnable and learnable components, and the analysis of model performance lacks depth, failing to comprehensively address running time, model parameter size, and GPU memory usage.
3. The manuscript contains numerous typos and writing errors, requiring thorough proofreading, and some figures are too small for detailed analysis, with axes lacking explanations.
4. The selection of only the last 20 dimensions for testing does not align with benchmark standards, raising concerns about the validity of the results, and the paper lacks sufficient visual examples to illustrate the uniqueness of the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction by clearly articulating the identified problems and corresponding solutions in separate paragraphs. Additionally, the authors should enhance the explanation of the model architecture, particularly regarding the integration of non-learnable and learnable components. We suggest including more comparisons with state-of-the-art models to validate the effectiveness of FBM and conducting full experiments according to benchmark standards, rather than limiting testing to the last 20 dimensions. A more comprehensive analysis of model performance should encompass running time, model parameter size, and GPU memory usage, as well as how efficiency changes with increasing input length. We also encourage the authors to conduct a sensitivity analysis of model parameters and provide visual showcases and error bars with confidence intervals for prediction results. Finally, the manuscript should undergo thorough proofreading to correct typos and improve overall presentation, and we advise using vector figures for better detail and providing clearer explanations for all axes in the figures.
