### Key Points
This paper presents a novel task called incremental novel slot detection (INSD), which aims to continually identify new slot types in dialogue systems. The authors propose a framework that integrates contrastive learning and noise-induced adversarial learning for novel type prediction, alongside a Query Enhanced Knowledge Distillation approach to address catastrophic forgetting during incremental learning. The experimental results indicate the framework's efficacy compared to a novel-type prediction baseline and two continual learning baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed research problem is relevant to real-world applications, particularly in online dialogue systems, as it addresses both out-of-distribution and in-distribution incremental slot detection.
- The use of learnable query vectors for feature matching and the Hungarian algorithm for optimizing labeled triples demonstrates innovative approaches to slot detection and model adaptation.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks strong baselines, as it does not compare against various established methods in incremental learning, such as architecture-based, memory-based, and data-retrieval-based approaches.
- The benchmarks used for evaluation are limited and simplistic; more complex datasets like MultiWOZ or SGD should be considered to validate the method's effectiveness.
- The methodology is somewhat complex and may be challenging to implement in practical scenarios, with unclear explanations regarding the influence of catastrophic forgetting on novel slot detection.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with stronger baselines, including various slot-filling and incremental learning methods, to better contextualize their contributions. Additionally, incorporating more complex and realistic benchmarks, such as MultiWOZ or results from models like ChatGPT or GPT-4, would enhance the validation of their approach. Clarifying how catastrophic forgetting impacts novel slot detection and providing quantitative or qualitative analyses would strengthen the paper's claims. Finally, simplifying the methodology and ensuring clarity in the implementation details would make the framework more accessible for real-world applications.
