### Key Points
This paper presents a method for optimizing black-box functions with high-dimensional outputs, such as images or robot trajectories, using human feedback. The approach effectively addresses the complexity of high-dimensional outputs by embedding them into a lower-dimensional space, enhancing optimization efficiency while preserving critical features. The authors propose a joint training process for the embedding and utility models, which captures relevant features for human decision-making, thereby improving model accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The method scales better than previous approaches by embedding high-dimensional outputs into a low-dimensional latent space.  
2. The innovative framework of hdpgp effectively utilizes human feedback for joint training of the embedding layer and utility model, focusing on the most relevant output subspace.  
3. The paper provides clear explanations and examples, particularly in the introduction and framework sections, enhancing reader comprehension.  
4. The experimental design includes ablation studies and tests across multiple criteria, demonstrating the methodology's versatility.

Weaknesses:  
1. The reliance on human feedback raises concerns about consistency and bias, which could undermine the pipeline's effectiveness.  
2. The scalability of the method to large datasets or very high-dimensional spaces remains untested.  
3. The performance claims in the cell tower scenario lack sufficient explanation, as the confidence intervals for HDPGP overlap with baselines.  
4. There is limited discussion on the approach's limitations and scenarios where it may not perform well.  
5. A minor formatting issue is noted in the section linking.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of human time costs associated with feedback to better assess overall efficiency. Additionally, the authors should conduct scalability tests with larger datasets and higher dimensions to validate the method's robustness. Clarifying the performance claims in the cell tower scenario and addressing potential limitations of the approach in broader contexts would strengthen the paper. Finally, we suggest correcting the minor formatting issue in the section link.
