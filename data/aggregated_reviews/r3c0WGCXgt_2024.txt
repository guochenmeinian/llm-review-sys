Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework aimed at enhancing multilingual text image generation and editing by optimizing control information. The authors investigate the impact of control information from three perspectives: input encoding, its role at different stages, and output features. They propose TextGen, which employs Fourier analysis to emphasize relevant information and reduce noise, utilizing a two-stage generation framework. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both Chinese and English visual text generation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The investigation into the influence of control information is well-organized and offers valuable insights for the community.  
2. The use of Fourier analysis and a two-stage generation framework introduces innovative methodological approaches in text image generation.  
3. The introduction of a new lightweight dataset, TG2M, is a significant contribution to training resources in visual text generation and editing.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The absence of detailed quantitative analysis for the internal workings of the designed modules limits understanding.  
2. Comparisons with existing benchmarks are insufficient, and the data-building process lacks clarity.  
3. The necessity of the FEC module is unclear, and the paper does not adequately address the potential limitations or societal impacts of the proposed method.  
4. The writing lacks clarity in some sections, and the experimental results do not convincingly demonstrate the method's advantages over existing approaches.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing, particularly in the theoretical analysis and the description of the data-building process. Additionally, we suggest including more detailed quantitative analyses of the internal workings of the modules and expanding the experimental comparisons with other benchmarks. It would be beneficial to clarify the necessity of the FEC module and address the potential societal impacts of the technology. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide more ablation experiments and visualizations to demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed methods.
