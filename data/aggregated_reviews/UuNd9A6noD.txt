Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Bayesian optimization approach for node-level tasks on graph-structured data, utilizing a framework that incorporates three kernels to model node behavior through ego-graphs of variable sizes. The authors argue that this method enhances tractability and addresses incomplete graph information. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets indicate that the proposed framework achieves competitive performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The paper identifies a gap in the application of Bayesian optimization for node-level tasks.
2. Soundness: The kernels, particularly the latter two, are well articulated and their roles in the Bayesian optimization process are convincingly explained.
3. Clarity: The inclusion of Figure 2 and Algorithm 1 aids in the presentation of information, with most terms clearly defined.

Weaknesses:
1. Significance: The introduction and experimental tasks do not convincingly establish the necessity of using Bayesian optimization.
2. Time Complexity: The paper lacks a discussion on time complexity and does not provide experimental results on running time.
3. Minor Errors: There are typographical errors in Algorithm 1 and incorrect references in Figure 2.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction to better justify the necessity of Bayesian optimization for the tasks presented. Additionally, a discussion on time complexity should be included, along with experimental results on running time. The authors should also correct typographical errors in Algorithm 1 and ensure accurate references in Figure 2. Furthermore, elaborating on the selection process for local subgraphs and how the algorithm handles potentially unknown graphs would enhance clarity. Lastly, providing a more detailed analysis of the experimental results and addressing the consistency of findings would strengthen the paper.
