Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel empathetic dialogue generation framework that enhances emotion correlation through a multi-resolution emotion graph and an emotion-enhanced decoder. The authors propose to address the limitations of existing methods that treat emotions independently by incorporating intrinsic emotion correlations into dialogue generation datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well organized and easy to follow.
- It offers a new perspective on emotion correlation, potentially inspiring advancements in dialogue generation.
- Experimental results demonstrate meaningful enhancements, supported by advanced modeling and visualization techniques.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for the study is unclear.
- Mathematical expressions lack rigor, and some experimental results are inadequately explained.
- The implementation of the method is complicated, and comparisons with existing models, such as few-shot prompting LLMs, are not sufficiently addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the motivation behind the study and provide a more rigorous mathematical framework. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explain the significance of emotion scores more clearly and detail the initialization of the re-parameter matrix S. It would also be beneficial to include a description of the overall process in the figure captions and to clarify the connections among emotion nodes in the graphs. Lastly, we advise the authors to ensure that the human evaluation details are included and to test for statistical significance in their results.
