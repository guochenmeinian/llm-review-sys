Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a strategy to enhance the expressiveness of message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) by incorporating affinity measures as features. The authors introduce effective resistance, hitting time, and commuting time as affinity measures, along with efficient computation techniques for these measures. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly improve performance across various graph benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results without notable increases in computational cost.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. This work is the first to propose that incorporating affinity-based measures into MPNNs can enhance their expressive power beyond the 1-WL algorithm.
2. The paper provides efficient techniques for computing the introduced affinity measures.
3. The authors demonstrate that MPNNs with affinity measures are strictly more powerful than the 1-WL algorithm, particularly through examples involving regular graphs.
4. Empirical experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods on both graph-level and transductive node-level tasks.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks thorough comparisons with other positional encoding-enhanced graph neural networks, both theoretically and empirically.
2. The baselines used in empirical comparisons have different parameter counts compared to the proposed method, necessitating a clearer explanation of hyperparameter choices.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical and empirical comparisons with other positional encoding-enhanced MPNNs, such as those discussed in the literature (e.g., Loukas, 2020; Dwivedi et al., 2021). Additionally, providing a more detailed rationale for the selection of hyperparameters and ensuring that comparisons are made with similar parameter settings would strengthen the paper. Clarifying the advantages of the proposed affinity measures over non-affinity-based encodings, particularly in distinguishing isomorphic graphs, would also enhance the discussion. Finally, organizing the presentation of notations and results more cohesively would improve readability and comprehension.
