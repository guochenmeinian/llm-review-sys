### Key Points
This paper presents MADNet, a graph-neural-network-based approach for multi-party conversation generation that effectively addresses the issue of missing addressee labels. The authors propose a fully-connected graph for context aggregation, utilize an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for addressee deduction, and initialize addressees through domain adaptation. Empirical validation demonstrates MADNet's superiority in generating responses, particularly in scenarios with incomplete addressee information.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
* Effective Addressee Deduction: The incorporation of EM for accurate addressee deduction is innovative, with strong empirical support from both automated and human evaluation metrics.  
* Comprehensive Experimental Analysis: Evaluations on diverse benchmarks highlight MADNet's generalizability, with robust comparative analysis against both non-graph-based and graph-based models.  
* Ablation Studies: Systematic isolation of model components provides valuable insights into their contributions to response generation.  
* Human Evaluation: The inclusion of human evaluation assesses response quality in terms of relevance, fluency, and informativeness.

Weaknesses:  
* Problem Significance and Novelty: The paper lacks a compelling case for the significance of the addressed problem and does not thoroughly demonstrate the real-world impact of accurate addressee prediction.  
* Theoretical Grounding: There is insufficient justification for employing EM in this context, and comparisons with alternative approaches would strengthen the methodological foundation.  
* Limited Evaluation: The evaluation is restricted to two benchmarks, which may not represent all multi-party conversation scenarios.  
* Computational Complexity: The paper does not adequately discuss the computational overhead of the EM algorithm, which may limit practical applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical grounding for the choice of employing EM for addressee deduction by providing a robust justification and comparing it with alternative methods. Additionally, expanding the evaluation to include more diverse datasets would strengthen the generalizability of the results. We also suggest providing a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method and how it scales with input size. Furthermore, enhancing the description of the graph neural network architecture and clarifying the human evaluation setup, including inter-annotator agreement, would improve the robustness of the findings. Finally, consider using additional evaluation metrics beyond BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L to capture the quality of generated responses more comprehensively.
