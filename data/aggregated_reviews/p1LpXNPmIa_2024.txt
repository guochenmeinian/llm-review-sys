Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents PromptFix, a unified framework that enhances diffusion models' ability to follow human instructions for various low-level image-processing tasks. The authors propose a comprehensive multi-modal dataset and a frequency-based diffusion model trained on this dataset. The method incorporates high-frequency guidance sampling and an auxiliary prompting adapter, demonstrating competitive performance on restoration tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The large-scale, instruction-following dataset is beneficial for low-level image processing.
2. The integration of a high-frequency guidance sampling method and an auxiliary prompting adapter shows effective problem-solving capabilities.
3. The proposed model exhibits superior zero-shot capabilities in blind restoration and hybrid degradation tasks, with strong visual and quantitative results.

Weaknesses:
1. The clarity of how to select different instructions for images with the same type of degradation remains unaddressed, as does the potential for users to utilize instructions beyond those provided.
2. The modules employed are relatively common in the literature, lacking novelty.
3. The absence of ablation studies for auxiliary prompts and the lack of numerical metrics for the high-frequency guidance method limit the evaluation of their effectiveness.
4. The dataset's collection method may not accurately reflect real-world degradation, raising concerns about generalization.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of instruction selection for images with similar degradations and consider allowing users to provide custom instructions. We suggest conducting ablation studies to demonstrate the necessity of auxiliary prompts and high-frequency guidance in achieving optimal results. Additionally, we encourage the authors to evaluate PromptFix on out-of-distribution and real-world datasets to substantiate claims of generalization and effectiveness. Lastly, we advise providing quantitative metrics to support the effectiveness of the high-frequency guidance sampling method.
