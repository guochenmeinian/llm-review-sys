Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DJINN (Diffusion-based Joint Interaction Network), a generative model for producing synthetic traffic scenarios using a diffusion model. The authors propose a flexible conditioning approach that allows for various observation masks, enhancing the model's applicability in generating safety-critical events and out-of-distribution scenarios. The experiments demonstrate competitive performance on the Argoverse and INTERACTION datasets, showcasing the model's ability to generate diverse and realistic traffic scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a comprehensive exploration of using diffusion models for traffic scenario modeling, including various types of masking and conditioning.
- DJINN's flexibility in handling different observations enables its application in multiple downstream tasks, such as goal conditioning and scene editing.
- The paper is well-written, self-contained, and presents a clear introduction to diffusion models, making it accessible to readers unfamiliar with the topic.

Weaknesses:
- The model sometimes fails to maintain consistency with input observations, as seen in generated trajectories that exhibit jumps or discontinuities. Test-time guidance may be necessary to improve this consistency.
- The masking procedure lacks clarity, particularly regarding whether predictions are made only for unobserved timesteps or if the entire trajectory is generated.
- There is a lack of quantitative evaluation demonstrating the increased variability of generated scenarios compared to existing methods.
- The paper currently includes limited qualitative results, making it challenging to fully assess trajectory quality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the masking procedure by explicitly stating how predictions are generated and whether the masked portions are supervised during training. Additionally, conducting a quantitative comparison to demonstrate the variability of generated scenarios would strengthen the paper. Including more qualitative results, such as colored trajectories over time or video demonstrations, would enhance the evaluation of the model's capabilities. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the model's limitations and potential societal impacts should be included, along with a roadmap for future research directions. Lastly, we suggest performing ablation studies to better understand the influence of different components on DJINN's performance.
