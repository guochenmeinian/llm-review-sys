Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents LinGCN, a novel framework aimed at enhancing the efficiency of homomorphic encryption (HE)-based graph convolutional networks (GCNs) by reducing multiplication depth through a differentiable structural linearization algorithm and a compact node-wise polynomial replacement policy. The authors demonstrate that LinGCN achieves significant improvements in both latency and inference accuracy compared to existing methods like CryptoGCN. The framework incorporates three key elements: a differentiable structural linearization algorithm, a compact node-wise polynomial replacement policy, and finer-grained operator fusion for node-wise activation functions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper is well-written, with clear motivation and illustrative figures that effectively convey the framework and evaluation results.  
2. The authors provide comprehensive ablation experiments, demonstrating higher accuracy and lower latency compared to the baseline CryptoGCN.  
3. The proposed method's structured approach to optimizing ReLUs is promising and well-explained.

Weaknesses:  
1. The novelty of the proposed techniques is limited, as similar methods have been explored in prior works, particularly regarding ReLU linearization and polynomial replacement.  
2. The paper relies on a single dataset, raising concerns about the generalizability of the proposed techniques to other datasets.  
3. The authors should provide more analytical results on the reduced computational cost and utility loss, as well as discuss the security implications of the modified designs in the HE-based GCN inference process.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analytical support for their empirical results by including detailed discussions on the reduced computational cost and utility loss. Additionally, the authors should address how the security of the HE-based GCN inference process is influenced by their proposed modifications. To enhance the paper's contribution, we suggest including an ablation study that compares the effectiveness of logit-based and feature-based knowledge distillation against existing methods like CryptoGCN. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the generalizability of LinGCN to other datasets and tasks, and consider discussing the relevance of non-linear layers in GCNs compared to CNNs, particularly in light of the findings from their sensitivity analysis.
