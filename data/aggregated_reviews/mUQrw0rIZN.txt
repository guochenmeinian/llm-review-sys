### Key Points
This paper presents the application of DeepONets to model airflow (x & y-velocities along with pressure) in an operating room. The authors demonstrate that DeepONets, without physics regularization, effectively capture the complex airflow dynamics. The work aims to contribute to the development of neural PDE solvers as fast surrogate models for computationally expensive simulations in healthcare.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The application of DeepONets for solving PDEs in a healthcare context is novel and technically sound.
2. The paper provides a qualitative analysis of both successful and failure cases, which is crucial for the model's applicability in sensitive environments like healthcare.
3. The implementation of physics-informed regularization significantly reduces physical residuals, showcasing the model's potential to learn underlying physics.

Weaknesses:
1. The choice of Random Forest as a baseline is weak and lacks motivation; comparisons with CNNs or traditional MLPs are necessary.
2. The justification for the large number of simulations required for training and validation is insufficient, raising questions about the model's practical utility.
3. The evaluation metrics used may not adequately reflect the model's performance in turbulent flow predictions, as physical residuals could be more relevant than relative error.
4. Figure 2 misrepresents the training process, suggesting that regularized models start from untrained weights.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the necessity of over 1000 training trajectories and the associated GPU costs to clarify the model's practical relevance. Additionally, we suggest comparing the proposed method against established neural PDE surrogate models such as FNO, MPPDE, or convolution-based models to strengthen the claims made in the abstract. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to emphasize the significance of physical residuals in their results and to revise Figure 2 for clarity by aligning the curves to accurately represent the training epochs. Lastly, exploring the differentiable nature of the method for inverse design applications could enhance the paper's impact.
