Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies empathetic dialogue generation using large language models, particularly ChatGPT. The authors propose three methods to enhance ChatGPT's empathetic response generation: (1) retrieving semantically similar exemplars for in-context learning; (2) employing a two-stage interaction model that first infers emotions and contexts before generating responses; and (3) augmenting dialogue context with external commonsense knowledge. The effectiveness of these methods is evaluated on the Empathetic Dialogues dataset, demonstrating improvements over existing state-of-the-art models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper presents a clear problem statement and proposes three fundamental techniques for improving empathetic response generation.
- The experiments are thorough, showcasing improvements in both automatic and human evaluation metrics.
- The paper is well-organized and easy to follow, with qualitative examples illustrating the proposed methods' impact.

Weaknesses:
- The contributions are seen as incremental, with proposed ideas having been previously explored in other contexts.
- The evaluation could be more comprehensive, lacking clarity on which components contribute to performance improvements.
- The focus on a single dataset limits the generalizability of the findings, and the human evaluation process lacks detail regarding evaluator demographics and bias mitigation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their evaluation metrics and provide more details on the human evaluation process, including the hiring and demographic details of evaluators. Additionally, the authors should clarify the motivation behind applying their methods specifically to empathetic dialogue generation and discuss how combining the three proposed techniques influences overall performance. Lastly, we suggest expanding the evaluation to include diverse datasets to enhance the generalizability of the results.
