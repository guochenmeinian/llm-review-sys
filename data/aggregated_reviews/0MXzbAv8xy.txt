Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents GFT, a graph foundation model utilizing computation trees to enhance transferability in graph learning. The authors demonstrate GFT's effectiveness through extensive theoretical and empirical evaluations across various tasks and domains, particularly highlighting its performance in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a significant challenge in graph foundation models by identifying transferable patterns.
2. It includes robust theoretical and empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world graphs.
3. The extensive experiments cover multiple graph tasks and domains, showcasing GFT's generalization capabilities.

Weaknesses:
1. The experiments are unconvincing due to reliance on outdated supervised baselines, raising concerns about fairness and validity.
2. The assumption of a common feature space across different graphs limits applicability to non-textual graphs.
3. The complexity of the method, with a broad hyperparameter space, may hinder practical implementation.
4. Certain sections lack clarity, particularly regarding the construction of computation trees and the interpretation of figures.
5. The distinction between computation trees and subgraphs is inadequately defined, and the analysis of time complexity does not consider subgraph sizes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental setup by incorporating more recent and relevant baselines to ensure fair comparisons. Additionally, clarifying the assumptions regarding feature spaces and enhancing the explanations of computation tree construction and time complexity analysis would strengthen the paper. We also suggest exploring the applicability of GFT in zero-shot scenarios and providing a detailed comparison between computation trees and subgraphs to elucidate their differences. Lastly, addressing the concerns regarding Theorem 2.2 and its applicability to real-world graphs would enhance the theoretical foundation of the work.
