Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a multi-frame optical flow estimation model named StreamFlow, which introduces a novel flow decoder called Global Temporal Regressor (GTR) that estimates flow outputs for all frames simultaneously. The authors argue that their Stream-lined In-batch Multiframe (SIM) pipeline enhances efficiency by processing video in multi-frame batches rather than frame-by-frame. The GTR decoder employs an iterative design and utilizes correlation volumes for input image pairs, while the Integrative Spatio-temporal Coherence (ISC) module encodes temporal relationships. Experiments on the KITTI and MPI-Sintel datasets demonstrate that StreamFlow achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) or near-SOTA performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The stream processing approach for optical flow is innovative and allows for distributing computational effort across multiple outputs.
- The GTR decoder's design, which incorporates multiple correlation volumes and spatio-temporal features, is a notable advancement.
- The paper includes a comprehensive ablation study to evaluate the model's components and variations.
- Quantitative results indicate superior performance on the Sintel and KITTI datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The method only partially addresses the high computational costs of recent optical flow methods, particularly due to high memory requirements, limiting its applicability on edge devices.
- The paper overstates performance gains, particularly on the MPI-Sintel and KITTI datasets, where it does not achieve top performance compared to methods like VideoFlow and MemFlow.
- The literature review is insufficient, lacking discussions on related works such as SKFlow and VideoFlow.
- Presentation issues hinder clarity, including unclear definitions of operations and insufficient detail in figures and equations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by clearly defining the `Integration` operation in Eq. 2 and using component names instead of mathematical notations from Eq. 5 to Eq. 9. Additionally, the authors should enhance the literature review to include more discussions on related works like SKFlow and MemFlow. To validate the proposed method's generalizability, we suggest conducting experiments on the Spring dataset. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to analyze the impact of non-overlapping inference on accuracy, especially regarding frame distance, and to provide a detailed analysis of the time complexity compared to other methods. Lastly, we recommend addressing the presentation issues noted, including improving figure captions and ensuring proper notation throughout the paper.
