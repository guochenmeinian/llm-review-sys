Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents FourierGNN for multivariate time series forecasting from a graph perspective, utilizing matrix multiplications in Fourier space, a novel approach not previously explored. The authors design a hypervariate graph structure to jointly capture spatiotemporal dynamics and reformulate graph operations in Fourier space. Extensive experiments across seven real-world datasets demonstrate that FourierGNN achieves superior performance in terms of efficiency and fewer parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written, clearly presenting the contribution and novelty of the proposed work.
2. The direct application of graph networks for multivariate time series forecasting is innovative, with the hypervariate graph structure effectively encoding spatiotemporal dependencies.
3. The authors provide a meaningful argument that Fourier space multiplications equate to graph convolutions in the time domain while offering lower complexity, which opens new avenues for graph operations.
4. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of FourierGNN, supported by thorough efficiency analysis and ablation studies.

Weaknesses:
1. The efficiency analysis should specifically compare the number of parameters in FourierGNN's graph operations against baseline methods for a clearer evaluation of its efficiency.
2. MAPE results on certain datasets, such as Traffic and COVID-19, do not achieve state-of-the-art performance.
3. The hypervariate graph structure may introduce redundant information or unwanted correlations, raising questions about how these issues are managed.
4. The experimental protocol lacks clarity, particularly regarding hyperparameter consistency across datasets and the performance of FourierGNN on longer prediction horizons.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the efficiency analysis by focusing on a direct comparison of the number of parameters involved in the graph operations of FourierGNN versus baseline methods. Additionally, the authors should address the MAPE performance on datasets like Traffic and COVID-19 to clarify the model's limitations. It would be beneficial to provide insights on how redundant information in the hypervariate graph structure is handled. Finally, we suggest enhancing the clarity of the experimental protocol, including detailed hyperparameter settings and performance metrics across various forecasting horizons to align with established literature standards.
