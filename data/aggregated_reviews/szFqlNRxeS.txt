Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents online algorithms for geodesically convex losses on Riemannian manifolds, utilizing two oracles—a separation oracle and a linear oracle—to avoid costly projections onto feasible sets. The authors employ an inverse exponential map to transform manifold points into tangent space vectors, facilitating operations without explicit projections. They address projection onto a geodesic ball, achieving high accuracy while remaining projection-free. The algorithms yield adaptive regret guarantees that are sublinear in the horizon. Additionally, the paper introduces a novel bandit algorithm that achieves a \(\sqrt{T}\) bound instead of \(T^{3/4}\) by operating in a different model. The authors clarify the non-positive curvature characteristic of Hadamard manifolds, which is essential for understanding the framework, and include significant contributions such as the extension to CAT($\kappa$) space.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors significantly contribute to the computationally challenging area of projecting onto Riemannian manifolds, which is relatively underexplored.
- The writing is clear, with a comprehensive background on Riemannian geometry, aiding reader comprehension.
- The paper is well-organized and technically sound, with clear explanations of geometric bounds and computability issues related to the oracles.
- The introduction of a novel bandit algorithm with improved performance metrics is a notable advancement.
- The authors effectively clarify technical aspects, enhancing the understanding of the work, particularly regarding the extension to CAT($\kappa$) space.

Weaknesses:
- The originality is limited, as the paper closely follows the work of Garber and Kretzu (2022) and employs well-known geometric bounds.
- The complexity of the proofs is high, requiring references to prior works, which may confuse readers.
- The paper lacks experimental validation and practical examples, raising concerns about the applicability of the proposed methods.
- The draft lacks self-containment and is more suited for a journal than a conference.
- The new algorithm's description may mislead regarding its relationship to previous methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and self-containment of their proofs to facilitate verification without extensive cross-referencing. Additionally, addressing the practical implications of their methods through examples would enhance the paper's applicability. We suggest revisiting the title to better reflect the paper's contributions, as the current phrasing may imply a vague discussion rather than concrete results. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the self-containment of the draft to better suit a conference format. Please add the new result in full detail while retaining the previous algorithm, emphasizing that the latter does not align with the standard notion of regret. Clarifying the non-positive curvature of Hadamard spaces near the assumptions will also enhance the paper's clarity. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore extending their methods to positive curvature spaces, which could broaden the scope and impact of their research.
