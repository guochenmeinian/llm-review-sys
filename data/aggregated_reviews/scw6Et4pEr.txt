Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to fluid dynamics prediction through the integration of Lagrangian and Eulerian paradigms via the DeepLag model. The authors propose the `EuLag` deep learning block, which facilitates information exchange between Eulerian grids and Lagrangian particles, enhancing modeling capabilities across various scales. The model is evaluated on multiple fluid dynamics tasks, demonstrating improved performance over existing state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors develop a well-motivated and innovative architecture that effectively combines Eulerian and Lagrangian modeling, leading to enhanced modeling capacity.
- The proposed model shows consistent performance improvements, approximately 10%, compared to established models like the Fourier-Neural Operator and transformer-based architectures.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks sufficient detail regarding the experimental setup, particularly in the main text, making it reliant on the appendix for critical information about the model architecture and datasets.
- There is an absence of comparison with a Lagrangian-only model, which is necessary for a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach.
- The paper contains factual inaccuracies and a non-standard taxonomy of related work, which could mislead readers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and completeness of the experimental setup by including detailed descriptions of the model architecture and datasets in the main text. Additionally, a comparison with a Lagrangian-only model should be included to provide a more holistic evaluation of the proposed method. We also suggest addressing the factual inaccuracies noted in the review, particularly regarding the computational costs and boundary conditions, and revising the related work taxonomy to align with established categorizations in the field. Finally, we encourage the authors to conduct ablation studies on the number of scales and overall model size to better understand the performance dynamics of DeepLag.
