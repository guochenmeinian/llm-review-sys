Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Stylebreeder dataset, collected from the Artbreeder website, comprising 6.8M images and 1.8M prompts generated by 95K users. It includes large-scale stylistic images with rich metadata and NSFW scores, facilitating experiments in artistic style identification, clustering, and personalized image generation. The authors also introduce the Style Atlas platform for downloading pre-trained style LoRAs, enhancing user engagement in content generation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is large-scale and contains rich annotations, making it valuable for downstream analysis.
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear applications for personalized image generation and recommendations.
- The authors provide LoRAs for identified styles, facilitating customization for users.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks in-depth analysis of the identified 1,000 clusters of image styles, including how they were selected and their representation of artists.
- There is insufficient discussion comparing the dataset to DiffusionDB, particularly regarding its practical contributions to diverse personalized image generation.
- The authors should address potential copyright infringement issues related to the dataset and consider applying methods from existing literature to explore this further.
- The dataset's advancement over DiffusionDB is minimal, and the impact of different models on task performance is not adequately analyzed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the 1,000 clusters by clarifying their selection process and representation of artists. Additionally, we suggest including a more thorough comparison with DiffusionDB to highlight the dataset's unique contributions. The authors should also discuss the implications of copyright infringements in relation to the dataset and consider applying relevant methodologies to investigate this aspect. Finally, addressing the potential biases in image collection and the quality assurance processes for the dataset would enhance its credibility.
