### Key Points
This paper presents an evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) on a dataset of cognitive stumpers, aiming to compare their performance with that of human solvers. The authors propose that LLMs outperform humans in solving stumpers but that humans excel in verifying the answers. The study introduces a new task of solving stumpers and provides a dataset of 76 problems, analyzing LLM performance through answer generation and verification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an interesting research question regarding LLMs' capabilities in solving stumpers.
- It employs rigorous experimental methods and statistical analyses to compare LLMs and human performance.
- The findings contribute to understanding LLMs' cognitive abilities and their implications for NLP.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the work does not meet top-venue standards, as the experiments are simplistic and lack depth.
- The experimental design is poorly organized, with insufficient details on prompt design and dataset quality.
- The paper structure is unbalanced, with excessive discussion and insufficient focus on experimental details.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definition of a "stumper" and provide a formal operational definition. Additionally, the authors should expand the dataset to at least 200 stumpers to enhance diversity and robustness. We suggest that the authors justify their experimental design choices more thoroughly, particularly regarding the evaluation metrics and the rationale behind the human study design. Furthermore, we advise the authors to restructure the paper to prioritize key findings and experimental details over lengthy discussions. Lastly, we recommend addressing the logical gaps identified in the questions, particularly regarding the relationship between the stumper task and the concepts of System 1 and System 2.
