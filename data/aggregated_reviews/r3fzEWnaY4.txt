### Key Points
This paper presents GFN-SR, a deep learning-based symbolic regression (SR) method utilizing Generative Flow Networks (GFN). The authors aim to enhance SR by addressing the limitations of traditional methods like Genetic Programming and the restrictive nature of Deep Symbolic Regression (DSR), which often converges to a single high-reward sequence. GFN-SR promises to provide a diverse set of high-reward solutions, particularly in noisy environments, as indicated by preliminary experiments suggesting its superiority in such scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- GFN-SR effectively addresses the limitations of previous DSR methods by offering a diverse range of candidates for symbolic expression derivation.  
- The method is well-defined with constraints that narrow the search space and reduce computational complexity.  
- Preliminary results indicate GFN-SR's potential superiority in noisy environments.

Weaknesses:  
- The evaluations are limited, lacking comprehensive numerical comparisons that focus on key properties of symbolic regression, such as interpretability and recovery rate across all Nguyen datasets.  
- The Nguyen datasets used are simplistic, with only 1-2 input variables and small sample sizes, which may not adequately represent the complexities of real-world applications.  
- There is insufficient discussion on the application of GFN-SR in scientific domains, which is crucial for aligning with the workshop's focus on AI for Science.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the breadth of their evaluations by including numerical comparisons across all 12 Nguyen datasets and discussing key properties of symbolic regression, such as interpretability. Additionally, we suggest incorporating more complex datasets, like the SRSD-Feynman datasets, to better assess GFN-SR's performance in realistic scenarios. Finally, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the connections between GFN-SR and its applications in various scientific fields, supported by quantitative assessments.
