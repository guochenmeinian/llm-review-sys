Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents NeuralPlane, a GPU-accelerated flight dynamics model for aircraft control using reinforcement learning (RL). The simulator achieves significant speedups compared to existing platforms, supports various RL algorithms, and allows for parallel simulations of up to 1 million aircraft instances. The authors propose enhancements to the platform, including new flight tasks and improved documentation, to broaden its applicability and usability. The experiments demonstrate the simulator's scalability and efficiency, although GPU memory requirements increase rapidly.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- NeuralPlane offers a high-fidelity, scalable simulation platform that enhances RL training and evaluation for fixed-wing aircraft.
- It includes diverse task scenarios and baseline algorithms, facilitating comprehensive performance analysis.
- The introduction of enhanced task scenarios, such as continuous multi-target tracking and multi-aircraft collaboration, demonstrates broader applicability.
- Improved documentation and beginner-friendly tutorials increase accessibility for users without prior RL knowledge.
- The platform is equipped with clear code templates and visualization tools, lowering barriers for researchers.
- Clarified integration of simulation, training, and testing into a single tool streamlines the adoption process.
- The discussion on GPU-accelerated environments situates NeuralPlane within the broader context of RL research.

Weaknesses:
- User friendliness is low, which may hinder adoption; this is a significant limitation noted by the authors.
- The initial setup and configuration of GPU-accelerated simulations may require specialized knowledge.
- The simulator lacks a variety of novel flight tasks/objectives, limiting its potential impact on advancing RL research.
- Initial tasks may have been too specific, necessitating the addition of broader scenarios.
- The platform's usability may still require further refinement to reach a wider audience.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve user friendliness by enhancing documentation and refining the code interface. Additionally, the authors should provide more diverse task scenarios, including novel flight tasks that are not possible with existing flight dynamics models. We suggest expanding on the challenges of sim-to-real transfer to provide more comprehensive guidance for researchers deploying models on real aircraft. Finally, a clearer discussion on the integration of simulation, training, and testing within a single tool would also be beneficial, as would addressing the challenges of generalizing RL-trained models across various environmental conditions.
