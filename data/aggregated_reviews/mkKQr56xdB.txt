Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theorem establishing a trade-off between oracle complexity and memory usage for convex optimization problems. Specifically, it shows that for any \( p \) between 1 and \( d \), a deterministic first-order algorithm can solve the feasibility problem for accuracy \( \epsilon \leq 1/\sqrt{d} \) using \( O(d^2/p \ln(1/\epsilon)) \) bits of memory and \( O((C (d/p) \ln(1/\epsilon))^p) \) calls to the separation oracle. The authors propose a recursive implementation of a cutting plane method that improves upon existing algorithms, particularly in the low error regime.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper makes relevant advances in understanding the trade-offs between memory and oracle calls in convex optimization algorithms. It introduces a new algorithm that improves query complexity over gradient descent while maintaining the same memory usage. The framework of recursive partitioning is particularly interesting and could lead to further improvements in optimization algorithms.

Weaknesses:  
The technique relies heavily on Vaidya's cutting-plane method, and the advancements over the original technique are not entirely clear. The improvement in oracle complexity appears incremental, and the regime of parameters where the algorithm outperforms gradient descent is somewhat limited. Additionally, there are minor presentation issues, such as undefined parameters in theorem statements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the self-containment of Theorem 3.2 by briefly describing the parameters \( d \) and \( \omega \) before the theorem statement. It should not require extensive reading of the paper to understand the main statement. Clarifying the differences between their method and Vaidya's method in the introduction would also enhance understanding. A more thorough description of the algorithm and the intuition behind its workings would be beneficial. Lastly, addressing the clarity of the introduction for non-expert readers could improve accessibility.
