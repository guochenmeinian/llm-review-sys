### Key Points
This paper presents a new multilingual benchmark for interpreting indirect answers to yes/no questions across eight languages: Hindi, Korean, Chinese, Bangla, Turkish, Spanish, Nepali, and Persian. The authors utilized distant supervision based on lexical matching to collect data, with five languages having both training and evaluation data, while three languages only have evaluation data. Experiments demonstrate that training with multiple languages yields better results than single-language training, and that using direct answers enhances the model's ability to interpret indirect answers.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The benchmark includes multiple low-resource languages, expanding the evaluation scope.
- Native speakers contributed to rule writing, enhancing data quality.
- The dataset requires knowledge or commonsense reasoning for accurate interpretation, increasing its complexity.

Weaknesses:
- Experimental results are somewhat predictable, as more training data typically improves outcomes.
- The task is relatively simple, lacking novelty.
- The description of training settings could be clarified; they should be termed as a cross-lingual setting rather than "zero-shot."
- Table 3 is confusing; separate tables for benchmark statistics and rule evaluations would improve clarity.
- The combination of rule-based and annotated data in experiments is unclear, leading to potential confusion about the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the training settings by explicitly labeling them as cross-lingual rather than "zero-shot." Additionally, we suggest separating the data in experiments into annotated samples and distant supervision data to clarify the results. A more detailed analysis of the model's strengths and weaknesses, including examples, would strengthen the paper. Finally, we advise a thorough proofreading to enhance writing quality, formalize terminology, and ensure that all statements are well-supported with citations.
